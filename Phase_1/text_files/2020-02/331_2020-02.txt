Footnotes
TOP ME OFF bumped with THE MAGICAL ONE at the start, set a clear pace along the rail and held comfortably under a drive. THE MAGICAL ONE was
pinched back at the break, steadied off heels near the five-eighths pole, saved ground around the turn, waited for room in upper stretch, angled out near the
three-sixteenths pole and rallied well. AULD LANGE SYNE settled off the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and was along for the show.
IMPERIAL BREW chased the pace from the rail, moved into second around the turn but flattened out in the lane. TALENTED DR. B had a shoe repair in the
paddock, chased the pace from between rivals and came up empty in the drive. ANTRIM AUBREY came in and bumped a foe at the start, had early speed
two wide and faded around the turn.

CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , in range while losing ground four wide, took closer order under coaxing mid turn, shifted out a bit wider into the lane, closed
steadily under right handed encouragement, drew alongside the leader leaving the sixteenth marker, kept on grinding while being floated out and forged to
command in the final strides. DEDICATED , taken to rate, edged up between rivals while in hand mid turn, angled five wide and moved to the lead in upper
stretch, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive past the furlong grounds, switched over to his left lead near the sixteenth marker,
wandered outward under left handed asking and just failed to contain the winner. SIR BRAHMS had speed then rated back off the leader leaving the three
quarter pole, angled out and rebid three wide outside the leader leaving the half mile pole, disputed the pace into the lane, failed to match strides nearing
the eighth pole and faded late. LINDA'S NEKIA lacked speed while three wide and passed tiring rivals. INCORPORATE bobbled at the break, chased
between foes and weakened in upper stretch. FREE TO TRUMP broke a step slow, angled in and edged up under rating past the three quarter pole, gained
to have aim mid turn, angled out into the stretch, failed to kick on and weakened near mid stretch. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR had speed outside a rival then
went clear after a quarter mile, set the pace two wide, took pressure past the half mile, stayed on to upper stretch and faltered.

ONE EYED JACK set a pressured pace in the two path, edged clear in upper stretch under left handed urging and clung to a diminishing lead late.
WELLING pressed the winner in the three path, reached near even terms rounding the far turn, dropped back a bit while stuck on the left lead in upper
stretch, layed in a bit and lost some momentum while finally switching leads leaving the eighth pole, regained momentum near the sixteenth pole and
narrowed most of the gap. DYNA'S KNIGHT settled off the duel in range inside, was well in the clear around the far turn, angled out in the lane and lacked
the needed rally. SNIDELY was squeezed back soon after the start, saved ground well off the pace and never threatened. ANTIPOISON chased the pace
two wide, faltered around the far turn and was eased.

BENANDJOE hopped at the break, dropped in when seeing that TEAM EFFORT was taken off the inside, hit the rail when rushing up into the first turn, got
through to go clear, opened up when fighting restraint, finally settled down the backstretch, was joined from his outside into the far turn, dueled, lost the lead
near the three sixteenths, battled back under strong handling to retake command soon past the eighth pole, spurted clear then dug in tenaciously to hold off
EGO TRIP. EGO TRIP , unhurried early while saving some ground, angled out leaving the far turn and was put to pressure, circled five wide into the lane,
straightened away to have aim on the dueling leaders, finished with good energy but had his surged come up short. TEAM EFFORT was taken off the inside
soon after the break, had the winner shoot through into the first turn, rated off that one and stalked two wide, bid to apply more pressure after a half mile,
dueled around the final turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, held that advantage to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. NOBLE WEED settled in the
clear and off of a contested pace as the field headed into the far turn, commenced a run soon after, rolled up four wide into the lane, bid to challenge, forced
the issue to mid stretch then flattened out. CASPER SLEW stalked outside a rival, was under a ride past the five sixteenths, steadied when lacking room
near mid stretch, failed to kick on after regrouping and faded in the final seventy yards. UP AGAINST IT angled in early and settled, moved up after a half
mile, had aim in upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
MARIE FROM PARIE set the pace in the two path, edged clear around the turn and held firm under a drive. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY steadied off heels
near the five-eighths marker, advanced four wide into the turn, bid three wide nearing the lane, stayed on but was unable to significantly narrow the gap on
the winner. NIGHTMARE tracked the pace two wide between rivals, tipped further out for clear run in upper stretch, lacked a rally and held for the show.
ABACO DREAM broke a bit awkwardly and bumped a foe at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, came six wide into the lane and rallied belatedly.
CLOSE THE DEAL chased the pace three wide, dropped back a bit around the turn and was no threat in the drive. CROSSINGTHEVALLEY was bumped at
the start, quickly recovered to show speed inside but came up empty in the lane. ATLANTIC AVENUE saved ground and failed to menace. TOO MUCH
MINUTIA was outrun while racing two wide. STARR DESIGNER trailed inside.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CADEY prompted the pace outside MISS TAP DANCE while under confident handling, moved up alongside leaving the far turn, took over when
given her cue soon into the lane, lugged in under right handed asking when clearing in upper stretch, straightened with the left stick, pulled away to a
lengthy advantage past the furlong grounds and was kept alert to the wire. MISS TAP DANCE eagerly went to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside,
staved off the winner around the turn, ceded the lead in near the quarter pole, faded in the final furlong but managed to save the place. OMNI DIVA saved
ground, was put to a solid ride mid turn, eased out for the drive and offered a mild response. DANCER'S MELODY , forced in at the break and away last,
edged up between foes nearing the turn, shifted in giving chase but came up empty. QUIET IMAGINATION , taken to rate early on while three wide, raced
in range into the turn, gave futile chase around the turn and faded. BROAD STORM came in at the break, lagged off the pace, swung five wide for the drive
but lacked a solid response. LOA , three wide pursuing the top pair, failed to kick on nearing the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE , taken to rate early on and stalked SO GUCCI, came under a solid ride mid turn, shifted out to be four wide into the lane, closed in under
strong handling, took command soon past the eighth pole, spurted clear then held firm while kept to task. MONEY FROMHEAVEN settled off the pace,
moved up a bit while saving ground past the five sixteenths, angled out into the lane, shifted back in when advancing past the furlong grounds, finished
gamely and made BYE BYE BERTIE work hard for the victory. LADY BY CHOICE broke a step slow, edged up past the five eighths and chased off the
inside, shifted five wide into the lane, ranged up near mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. GRACE ISABELLA saved ground stalking the pace, was
under pressure into the lane and faded. MONACO PRINCESS settled in the clear early on, was put to a ride around the turn, raced removed from the rail
into the lane and lacked a bid. SO GUCCI sped clear early and set a rated pace, was asked three wide nearing the lane, failed to contain the challenge in
mid stretch and weakened. HIGHLAND LASS broke awkwardly, dropped far off the pace and was eased in the lane.
