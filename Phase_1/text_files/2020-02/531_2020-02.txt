fell back, finished evenly and was no match for the winner. PAPA MAMBO pressed the pace while racing inside to the turn, dropped back, lacked a further
response and finished best of the rest. SEA MYRTLE was unhurried early, raced outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. SHARP
HOLIDAY saved ground to the turn, angled out, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a response. BLUE CHIP BETTY had brief speed only,
was eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
PEACH TIME set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and just lasted. WE'RE JUST SAYIN stalked the pace, bid willingly, veered out late
under left handed urging and was outnodded to just miss. REMEMBERTOBREATHE raced close to the pace inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, fell
back and lacked the needed late response. TEDDY TIME raced in the back, closed inside and didn't have enough late. HOLY FRAZIER was void of early
speed, closed inside and gained late. BAY AREA raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. BUYMEABOND swung wide leaving the
turn and lacked a bid. MAMBOCELLO raced in close, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way. MUSIC GIANT was close to the pace while racing outside,
swung wide leaving the turn and gave way. FREDDIES DREAM stalked the pace to the second turn, swung wide and gave way. The quarter and half mile
fractional splits were hand timed.
