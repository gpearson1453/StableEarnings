continued on willingly through the stretch but could not narrow the gap. MARKET MOVER stalked the winner two wide, bid between foes nearing the lane
then weakened through the stretch. INACEPTABLE failed to menace while racing two wide. GLACIER PARK was outrun inside. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE

Footnotes
PETION LASS was unhurried inside early, advanced inside around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, waited behind rivals, angled back to the rail and
found room near the eighth pole, burst through inside once clear and quickly drew off. EYE OF THE WILDCAT raced well back outside down the
backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane, bid widest to take a brief lead in midstretch but was no match for the winner
in the final furlong. CLOSE THE DEAL was bumped at the start, moved up inside under rating to dispute the pace along the inside, battled on to midstretch
and held well enough to preserve the show. THERE GOES MY GIRL prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the lane then weakened.
PRINCESS A'GO GO settled off the pace inside in the clear, advanced along the rail around the turn, angled three wide to bid between nearing the lane,
checked off heels in upper stretch and lacked a further rally. STARR DESIGNER pressed the pace two wide between rivals, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole then tired in the drive. QUEEN OF MUSKOKA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. The rider of PRINCESS A'GO GO
claimed foul against THERE GOES MY GIRL for alleged interference in upper stretch but the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

BOBBY G was bumped after the start, raced well off the pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, responded readily to hand urging in upper
stretch, swept to command in midstretch and drew off while ridden out. SOUND OFF saved ground off the pace advanced inside through upper stretch,
angled out near the eighth pole and rallied for the place. KINGSTON PIKE was unhurried while racing two wide early, swung five wide near the quarter pole
and rallied mildly to gain the show. UPLIFTING had early speed inside, settled back and angled two wide nearing the turn, stalked two wide around the bend
and weakened in the lane. AWESOME FU set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. SPARTY was fractious in the gate, bumped the winner soon
after the start, raced four wide throughout and never threatened.

TACO SUPREAM settled off the pace while saving ground, tipped out in upper stretch, lacked room, bulled through between rivals leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, bumped BROTHER CHUBB several times, pushing that foe into BALLIVOR, charged to the front once clear, dueled inside of
BALLIVOR through the rest of the stretch, dug in gamely and prevailed. BALLIVOR tracked the pace three wide, bid four wide in upper stretch, was bumped
approaching the eighth pole, battled outside of TACO SUPREAM through most of the final furlong and was narrowly outfinished. CONFESSOR trailed inside
for a half-mile, swung to the far outside in upper stretch and rallied widest. BROTHER CHUB had early speed between foes, settled back two wide around
the turn, re-bid between foes in upper stretch, was bumped several times nearing the eighth pole and lost third late. BUSTOFF pressed the pace three wide
down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, vied between to midstretch and weakened. ONEMOREGREATTIME set the pace along the rail and
gave way nearing the eighth pole. Following an objection from the rider of BROTHER CHUB against both of the top two finishers, TACO SUPREAM was
disqualified from first and placed fourth for interference nearing the eighth pole.

Footnotes
ROOKIE SALSA broke inwardly, steadily moved up at the rail down the backstretch, seized command nearing the turn, drew clear around the bend and
widened under a drive. PARADISE PRIDE brushed with a foe at the start, raced off the pace outside, moved three wide around the turn, loomed in upper
stretch but was no match for the winner. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET set the early pace two wide, chased the winner two wide around the turn, lacked a rally
and held for the show. TASTES LIKE PLAID raced three wide and failed to menace. GRAY GARY had early speed three wide, angled in early on the turn
and faded inside. IMAGINE WINNING was outrun inside.
