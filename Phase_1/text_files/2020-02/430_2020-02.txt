CHATTERMAN saved ground, bid inside on the turn, closed steadily to wear down his rivals, got up late and inched clear. CIRCUS RIDE set a pressured
pace to the turn, drew clear entering the stretch, led past the sixteenth pole and was outclosed. J SERINO raced close to the pace, went six wide at the top
of the stretch and lacked the needed late response. TRAPALANDA broke slowly, was taken outside, raced close to the pace, bid seven wide and didn't
have enough late. PACIFIC WAR pressed the pace while racing two wide, fell back leaving the turn and leveled off. BLAZINGULCH trailed the field.

UNLEASH THE TIGER pressed the pace two across, assumed command entering the stretch, drew off and was ridden out. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD raced close
to the pace, bid inside on the turn, shifted out, closed well and was no match for the winner. DAKATI pressed the pace three wide to the second turn, fell
back, hung late and earned show in a steady effort. YEREVAN SONG broke awkwardly and was steadied at the start, set a pressured pace to the second
turn and gave way. TRAFFIC STOP was outrun in an even effort. DISPUTED raced evenly, was never a threat and not urged late. The quarter mile fraction
was hand timed.

PAUL'S DIVA was unhurried early, raced outside, rallied on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in
the final strides. BIG LARRY broke out, stalked the pace, bid four wide into the far turn, dueled to deep stretch, inched away and was caught. MENSCH
bumped at the start, challenged three wide between horses into the turn, dueled for the lead and faltered near the sixteenth pole. TOP HAT HUSTLE was
slow early and improved position in a steady effort. THE FIDDLERS GREEN stumbled and bumped at the start, vied to mid stretch and gave way. MISSION
RELAUNCH was not a factor. YOU GOT THE LOOK vied inside, tired entering the second turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ACEITUNA stalked the pace, bid four wide entering the second turn, closed under strong urging, got up past the sixteenth pole, came out near the wire and
was all out. TANAGER was unhurried early, rallied around the turn, bid seven wide, closed under steady left handed urging, gained late and was crowded
near the wire. IS IT GOLD stalked the pace while racing inside, got through along the rail on the turn, assumed command, drew clear, led to deep stretch
and was outfinished in a game effort. GATTAIA pressed two across, challenged for the lead on the turn, led briefly, fell back, hung late and lost position.
HOUSEMAKER (GB) broke slowly, raced in the back, saved ground to the turn, angled out, bid eight wide and lacked the needed rally. G M T BABY set a
pressured pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. The rider of TANAGER claimed foul against the rider of ACEITUNA for alleged interference in deep
stretch. No change was made. Hand timed.

HOT RODIN set the pace and drew off in the drive under mild urging. DELTA REWARD stalked the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, fell back, continued
in a steady effort and earned place while no match for the winner. OMACHE KID stalked the pace to the turn, dropped back, went evenly late and held
safely for show. CARVILLE saved ground, bid inside and came up empty. PUT YOUR PANTS ON raced close to the pace, bid along the rail on the turn to
get within range, had nothing left and fell back. MINNIE MINOSO trailed the field, went widest in the drive and passed tiring rivals. PREACHER'S BLUFF
broke slowly and was not a threat. KICKENIT raced mid pack, lacked a bid and was outrun.

TWO THE PUNCH raced in the back, bid inside on the turn, closed willingly, shifted out late and got up at the wire. TANNERS PRIDE set the pace, drew off
on the turn for a clear lead and was caught at the wire. CREATIVE ART raced mid pack, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and was
gaining late. KELLER'S GOLD was off a step slowly, was never far back, raced inside and lacked the needed late rally. KEYSON led early, chased to the
turn, fell back, leveled off and faded from contention. TOWARDS THE LIGHT stumbled at the start, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only.
MAXX EFFORT raced close to the pace, swung wide on the turn, fell back and gave way. OH BROTHER JACK was not a factor and not urged late.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SCEPTOR raced close to the pace inside, shifted out on the turn, bid between horses, got a head in front near the eighth pole, inched clear and
held well. EL BORRACHO raced mid pack, went six wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and gained late. MY GOLDEN BOY was unhurried early,
bid four wide leaving the turn, closed well and got up for show. HYPERSONIC was never far back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and
was gaining ground. WARM LAKE DUDE vied two across, assumed command on the turn, drew clear, weakened in the drive and faded from contention.
FORTNITE DANCE advanced to the turn, bid seven wide and lacked the needed late response. RAGING CAJUN CASEY set the pace around the first turn,
vied to the second turn, tired and gave way. ROAD TO MY DREAM trailed the field and failed to contend.
