Footnotes
MY BOY LENNY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing in the two path to the turn, widened the advantage racing into the stretch while
shifting out, went well clear under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. DIVINE AMBITION tracked the pacesetter
between foes racing to the turn, shifted to the four path racing through the stretch and proved best of the others. LUDINGTON tracked just off the the
pacesetter three deep between foes in the opening stages, was fanned five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS
tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and offered no rally. FOXY MISCHIEF was a brief factor four deep in second flight tracking the
pacesetter but gave way early. MAMMA WHITE SOCKS broke slowly, was prompted to a position inside rivals tracking the pacesetter as part of the second
flight but gave way nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
CLEARLY SEEN, reserved last while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, made steady progress inside foes racing into the far turn, saved ground to
upper stretch and continued willingly inside the pacesetter to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. GONEASAGIRLCANGET,
urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn, continued to maintain the advantage
between foes into upper stretch but was collared late. BORN TO GROOVE exchanged bumps with R D BLESSING while being prompted to a forward
placing racing to the first turn, gained terms prompting the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, continued three deep into the upper stretch but weakened
late. MALICED, caught four wide, then three deep racing to the first turn, dropped off the second flight while angling to the inside on the backstretch, was
prompted to advance while shifting out momentarily racing into upper stretch, then continued evenly in the closing stages. EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE tracked
the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening half, was caught four wide racing through the far turn and soon faded. R D BLESSING exchanged
bumps in the opening stages, then was held up avoiding tight quarters along the inside racing into the first turn, shifted off the rail to track off the first flight
between foes through the backstretch, shifted out three deep on the far turn and soon faded. LITTLE MS BROADWAY, reluctant to load, was prompted to
contention while caught four wide racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
BRIDGE DANCER, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, shook clear nearing midstretch
and extended the advantage under some left handed encouragement. DIAMOND NEWS tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the
turn, shifted out three deep in upper stretch, came under some correction when drifting a bit in late stages but continued with interest to edge a rival for the
place honors. WHISPER SLOW tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued along the rail to
late stages while just outkicked for second. PRINCESS BRIENNE tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the turn, shifted about racing into
upper stretch losing some position and had no closing bid. LA BELLE DE COURSE, urged to gain a forward placing prompting the pacesetter racing into the
turn, continued in pursuit to upper stretch and gave way late. BAREBACK FUN ducked out at the start, was collected to track off the second flight racing four
wide into the turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
PRETTY CHITU was urged between foes just off the inside disputing the pace, angled to the rail racing into the turn continuing in pursuit of the leaders,
shifted out four wide in upper stretch while regaining terms with the leaders and edged forward late under firm encouragement. BOLTER exchanged bumps
at the start, was quickly righted, then vied with the first flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, lost some ground to the leaders racing into the
turn, angled inside those rivals in upper stretch to challenge for command leaving the furlong marker and was just outkicked. MUST BE A MONSTER joined
the pace five wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into upper stretch, couldn't contain the top pair but edged a rival for a share.
MOLOKAI NIGHT, urged to prompt the pace on a narrow advantage four wide between rivals in the opening stages, edged forward while angling inwards a
bit racing into the turn, dueled inside a rival racing off the rail to upper stretch, then yielded in the closing stages while finishing on his own courage in the
final strides. NOBLE KING broke outwards exchanging contact with BOLTER at the start, settled well off the leaders racing to the turn, angled five wide
entering the stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. BLAME BISHOP tracked just off the first flight racing three wide into the turn, then
faded into upper stretch. NO LOOK BACK broke in the air losing position to the field and never gained contention. ERIN GO BRAUGH urged along the rail
while being prompted to terms with the first flight in the opening stages, steadied off the eventual winner when losing his path to that foe entering the turn
and soon gave way.

SERVE THE KING (GB) broke readily, tracked the leaders outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, came under some prompting shifting
out three deep nearing upper stretch, angled to the four path in upper stretch and found a solid late response to wrest command go clear in the final
sixteenth under firm handling. GENTLEMAN JOE, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the pacesetter while moving to terms with that foe
racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, then to upper stretch gaining the advantage but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. FLY NIGHTLY, urged to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, attended the pace, then dueled for command inside a rival racing
into upper stretch but weakened late. NO CENTS LEFT broke out bumping CAPTAIN HARDSHIP at the break, tracked the leaders inside the eventual
winner as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly in the closing stages. CAPTAIN HARDSHIP, bumped from both sides
at the start, settled near the inside, gained some position inside foes racing into upper stretch, then shifted out four wide in the last furlong while making a
mild gain. RUDIGER, reserved along the inside early, swung out five wide racing into the stretch but made no real impression. IRONWOOD broke inwards
bumping, was righted to tracked off the second flight near the inside for five furlongs and faded into the stretch. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
FACTION CAT broke sharply to gain a narrow advantage while shifting in to dictate the pace between foes racing into the bend, angled inside nearing upper
stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. JUSTAHOLIC, urged to gain a forward placing three deep prompting the pacesetter racing into the
turn, continued with a steady bid outside that foe while losing some ground into the lane but finished willingly to close the gap late. MAI TY ONE ON angled
to the rail in the opening stages to track just off the second flight, came through close quarters saving ground into the bend and continued with interest along
the rail to prevail for a share late. END PLAY, reserved well off the leaders while angling inwards in the opening stages, advanced inside some traffic
entering the turn, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and continued to make some mild progress. EXTRAVAGANT KID tracked the leaders four wide
between foes in second flight racing to the turn, continued in that path avoiding some traffic racing through the bend and faded into the stretch. HARRY'S
ONTHELOOSE tracked off the second flight five wide in the opening furlong, was forced out six wide avoiding traffic racing through the turn and continued in
that path to late stages in an even effort. BACKTOHISROOTS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening stages, checked off PAY
ANY PRICE when losing his path to that foe entering the turn and had no closing response. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT was settled last along the inside in
the opening stages and failed to menace. OLDIES BUT GOODIES tracked just off the leaders three wide between foes racing to the turn, was steadied
sharply while being carried out by PAY ANY PRICE racing into the bend and quickly came up empty. PAY ANY PRICE, urged to prompt the pace inside
foes in the opening stages, was taken in hand entering the turn while appearing to bear out badly impeding several rivals and quickly dropped out.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STERWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

DONE ACTING bobbled, then was bumped from both sides at the start while being shuffled back, settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch,
gathered momentum racing just off the inside on the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch advancing in close quarters and produced a steady
late response to wrest command and go clear under some right handed pressure. FIERY OPAL broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, tracked off the
first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the first flight four wide racing through the far turn, was fanned five wide into
the stretch while exchanging some light contact with the eventual winner and couldn't match that foe's final kick. GAME DAY DRAMA, urged to terms
prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, shifted out three deep after a half maintaining a narrow advantage, continued in an extended skirmish for
command in that path through the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. PERP tracked just off the first flight along the inside, came around a tiring foe to
bid inside foes racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way. MEILLEUR tracked off the first flight between foes, came through after a half
to challenge for command between rivals racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. PERFECT JOE broke outwards bumping the eventual winner,
was righted to prompt the first flight three wide into the backstretch but was through after a half. CLASSY INDIVIDUAL was urged along the inside disputing
the pace to the backstretch but was spent early. TO YOUR HEALTH was always outrun.

Footnotes
JEAN ELIZABETH was hustled to gain the lead while angling sharply to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn and maintained that
advantage to the end under firm encouragement in a game effort. MISS DEPLORABLE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn,
advanced four wide nearing upper stretch, shifted out five wide leaving the furlong marker but continued willingly to the end to close the gap on the
pacesetter. R HAPPY ENDING broke sharply, tracked just outside the pacesetter three deep racing to the turn, was urged to bid for command in that path in
upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. ODE TO JOY tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch to
bid four wide between foes leaving the furlong marker and continued willingly. ESCAPADE angled inwards to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that
rival into the turn, then to upper stretch but weakened late. JO JO AIR tracked just off the first flight along the rail racing into the turn but faded in late stages.
ROCKY POLICY settled well off the second flight while angling to the rail racing to the turn, angled out in upper stretch while being roused to gain some
position but made no real impression. THINKIN COWTOWN settled between foes in the last flight early, was fanned six wide into the stretch and proved no
threat. AMBASSADOR LUNA tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted three deep nearing the lane and emptied out in upper
stretch. BAYBERRY was settled outside foes in the last flight, drifted out on the turn and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
OUR PETUNIA, held up between rivals racing just off the first flight while caught in close quarters racing into the first turn, continued under patient handling
conceding some position racing through the backstretch, was prompted to split foes three deep nearing the midway point of the far turn to challenge for
command, quickly gained the advantage and held sway on a widening margin under firm right handed encouragement. FEELING GOOD, forced in at the
start by CARAMEL MOON, was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted in nearing the far turn while being prompted to
advance, switched out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. TRACK MAGIC angled to the rail in early
stages avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn, came through inside the pacesetter midway through the backstretch to wrest a brief advantage,
dueled for command inside foes racing into the far turn, gave way into the stretch but continued well enough to edge a rival for a share on the wire.
ELUSIVE AURA sped to the lead racing to the first turn to set the pace racing just off the rail, lost the advantage midway through the backstretch but
continued to press the issue between foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. CARAMEL MOON ducked inwards bumping FEELING GOOD
soundly at the start while forcing that rival inwards, was righted, then pulled her way to contention three deep between foes racing to the backstretch
advancing in close quarters, came under pressure nearing the far turn to briefly press the issue, was fanned four wide on the far turn and soon gave way.
TROPICAL FROSTY, restless before the start, broke awkwardly, settled outside foes to the backstretch and never gained contention. ATHENA'S
REVENGE, urged to gain a forward placing three deep, then four wide racing to the backstretch, was spent after a half. BOSS OF THE HOUSE was soon
outdistanced but walked off under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK
NO ACTION.

Footnotes
GATOR POSSE was held up in close quarters between foes in the opening stages, shifted outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
four wide nearing the far turn, continued three deep on the second bend steadily moving to terms with the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, wrested the
advantage from that foe while coming under light correction leaving midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. SPEAKERIT tracked the
pacesetter from just out of striking distance leading the second flight into the backstretch, took over nearing the far turn, held sway through the second bend,
shifted out while briefly resisting the winner's challenge but proved only second best. LUNAG RI, reserved along the inside in the opening half, gathered
momentum racing into the far turn, swung out four wide racing into the lane and continued to make a mild gain. DANVILLE settled last along the inside
racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and made some belated progress inside. DOHKO tracked off the second flight along the inside to
the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside the leaders racing into the far turn but flattened out racing into the lane. O'HAIRE tracked off the second
flight between foes in the opening stages, was urged to lodge a brief, three wide bid between foes racing into the second bend but proved empty in late
stages. MASTERIO, bumped by DRAMA AN VICTORY at the start, clipped heels with that rival just after the start, was settled outside foes and passed
some tiring rivals late. FLUG, reserved near the inside in the opening half, failed to menace. DRAMA AN VICTORY ducked inwards at the start forcing
MASTERIO to clip heels, drifted wide racing into the first turn losing position to the field and proved no threat. ALITE sprinted to the lead along the rail racing
to the backstretch and emptied out abruptly after a half. FAST WILLY made brief pursuit of the pacesetter racing three deep to the backstretch and was
spent early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SPEAKERIT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHICH
WAS DISALLOWED.
