Footnotes
TENSAS WEEZY broke out and bumped POWERED BY GREELEY and was a bit slow into stride, recovered to establish position just off the pace under
some restraint, drafted in the two path on the turn, dropped to the rail while asked after turning into the stretch, rallied up the fence under a right-handed
whip, closed fast to take the lead just inside the furlong marker then quickly kicked clear, switched back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole, remained
under a right-handed whip into the final forty yards then was held together with the left hand while lugging out in the shadow of the wire. TIZ DARBY broke
out then was pulled in by the rider, was brushed in the hindquarters by a rival, dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn, gained along the
rail into upper stretch, followed the winner through on the inside into the final furlong and safely secured the place. EMERY'S DREAM chased the pace,
moved out near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch, battled
outside of two foes into the final furlong and weakened while just able to get the show. OUR FOOLISH GIRL showed good speed and moved in while going
to the front, set the clear pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the
advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and tired then just missed the show. HOT AND READY broke a step slow, moved up to race up close
on the outside, was given her cue while four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. POWERED BY GREELEY was bumped at
the start and forced into another foe then checked, spotted the front many lengths, raced towards the rear, was urged along while four then five wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ON DECK moved up early to press the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, reached even terms for the lead while between foes into the
stretch, dueled inside of the runner-up while a head or neck behind, gained the advantage under a left-handed whip coming to the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under strong urging. BONNET broke out then was corrected by the rider, moved up to track the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the
four path, was asked late on that bend, made a bid at the quarter-pole then took a narrow advantage, dueled outside of the winner, lost the advantage near
the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well clear for the place. MI CHACHIS INTENTA broke out a bit at the start, was ridden along towards the rear
on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip then was straightened by the
rider, switched to a right-handed whip around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. BET YOUR BANKROLL broke a
step slow, settled towards the back, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. SAINT KENNEDY settled off the pace, was roused leaving the backstretch,
went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then was put to the whip and failed to respond. CHESAPEAKE BAY settled off the
pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. BALLYBRACK LASS settled at the rear of the field, saved ground
on the turn and failed to threaten. MY LITTLE FIRE set the pace under pressure from her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was headed into upper
stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ALMA DERBY shadowed outside the pacesetter through the early going, edged closer into the turn going two to three wide on that bend and given just mild
encouragement nearing the five-sixteenths, was shaken up in upper stretch upon striking the lead, given a couple light taps from the whip past the furlong
marker and edged away under a mild hand ride late. BOSTON BIND was mildly coaxed at the break, set the pace racing inside on or just off the rail,
overtaken in upper stretch and was no match for the winner but clearly second best. HIGHLY CENTSABLE was just lightly brushed at the break, pursued
the top two from outside, ridden along past the three-eighths going three to four wide on the turn, came out a path in upper stretch and could make no
headway on that pair. GRAND LITTLE MAN was just a touch hard to load, broke outwardly, was under a hold behind foes along the fence early, switched
out a path entering the turn then another path about midway on that bend, came to the head of the lane four wide and out a further path at that juncture, ran
on without threatening the top ones. HALOSTAR broke a half step slowly and exchanged light contact with the inside foe, shifted in while moving forward to
track the leaders, went inside on or just off the rail through the turn coming out four wide by the top of the stretch, failed to threaten thereafter. FLASHYBOY
BOBB moved out at the break and exchanged a brush with the outside rival, was rank to place early, switched out a path heading up the backstretch and
continued to fight rider restraint, went between foes into the turn going three then four wide on that bend, came into the stretch five to six wide and had no
rally. LIKE MIKE broke slowly and inwardly brushing the tail-end of a rival, raced outside foes into the turn going four to five wide on that bend and was
never a threat.

Footnotes
MY PEPPER ANN was sluggish under some urging on the initial straightaway, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved in some midway
down the backstretch, angled out at the three-eighths, was ridden along while four then five wide on the far turn, rallied outside under the whip into the
stretch, closed strongly under the whip while still on her inside lead, took the advantage inside the furlong marker then drew away under a mild hand ride to
prove much the best. FOR REAL ALICE went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked while extending the advantage on the far turn, came under
a drive into upper stretch, lost the lead inside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner while well clear for the place. STAR GAZE veered out
at the start, was caught six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while five then four wide on the far turn, dropped to the three path
while chasing the top two late on that bend and weakened while just able to get the show. TOODALOO TO YOU went two then three wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, moved up under urging with a half-mile to run, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, came under the whip turning into the
stretch and failed to rally. GABBY'S HALF went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, lugged out some near the seven-sixteenths,
dropped back under urging while inside on the far turn, tossed her head some while attempting to get out a bit around the quarter-pole, came out into the
stretch then drifted further out and faltered. MILL FALLS raced under a tight hold in the four path on the first turn, dropped in a path entering the backstretch,
was rated under a snug hold just off the pace, pressed the leader past the half-mile pole, was let out near the three-eighths, dropped back under urging
while three then two wide on the far turn and stopped. HEART OF SOUL stumbled at the start, moved up into the first turn, went five wide while between
horses on that bend, prompted the pace until outside the half-mile pole then fell back abruptly, was pulled up on the far turn then vanned off.

Footnotes
LIZZARIO stalked from outside the pacesetter into the turn going three then two wide on that bend and taking over at the quarter pole, was promptly
challenged by an outside rival near the furlong marker, headed by that one nearing the sixteenth pole but dug in to retake command under urging. RUN
BALLERINA shifted to the rail soon after the break, tracked the pacesetter along the rail into the turn, came out a path passing the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide coming to the quarter pole, ranged up alongside the leader in upper stretch, put a head in front inside the final furlong but was outfinished in the
final sixteenth. LA NEGRA NOCHE bumped the outside rival at the start while breaking a tad outwardly, pursued the leaders from outside and in behind four
wide into the turn, shifted in a path nearing the mid-point of that bend then back out late, came five wide into the stretch and was no match for the top pair
but preserved show honors. VEILAZIG was just lightly brushed at the break, saved ground on the rail through the turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on
while needing more for show. UPGRADE ME broke a half step slowly, switched outside a foe early up the backstretch, entered the turn in the three path
coming out a path near the five-sixteenths while asked for more at that juncture, came out two further paths in upper stretch and failed to threaten late.
STARLIGHT SISTER was bumped at the break, moved in to set the pace up the backstretch entering the turn in the two path before soon shifting in a bit on
that bend, was overtaken at the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. MY SCARLET BEAUTY brushed the inside foe at the start, was coaxed forward
chasing the leaders into the turn from well off the rail going in the five path into the turn and gradually shifting in a path or two on that bend, came out a bit
for the drive but was empty. TWINS PLUS A DOT raced well removed from the rail at the rear and going in the four to five path through the turn while never
producing a bid.

Footnotes
JUS LIVELY dropped from the two path to the rail while prompted the pace inside a foe on the first turn, was eased back just off the pace early on the
backstretch, saved ground while coaxed along at the rear of the tightly bunched foursome on the final turn, was asked at the quarter-pole but lacked room at
that point, raced under some urging while continuing to lack room behind the leading trio in upper stretch, steadied while blocked coming to the furlong
marker, altered course to the outside then accelerated under a hand ride into the final sixteenth and was eased up while going by late. MAKE ME SMILE
was last of the quarter to commence, went four then three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, rounded the far turn in the two path, was
asked at the quarter-pole, battled on even terms for the lead while between horses into the final sixteenth and was outfinished late while able to get the
place. TREYS MIDNITE MOON saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear under some restraint, stalked three wide on the far turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch, took a narrow advantage into the final furlong, battled on even terms for the lead into the final sixteenth
and was also outfinished but missed the place while clear for third. THEORYINTOPRACTICE went three then two wide on the first turn, set the pace
through moderate fractions while getting some company to his outside, vied along the rail on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, fought inside of two
opponents under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRAZY shifted in soon after the start tracking the leaders along the rail, continued inside on then came out just off the rail late on the turn, had
room and took aim in upper stretch, drifted out just a bit in mid-stretch but under right-handed urging struck the lead forty yards out and edged past. HAVE
NO FEAR was quickly clear to dictate terms at the fore, was in the two path entering the turn, moved in a bit late on that bend still in the clear turning for
home, drifted out in mid- to late-stretch and was worn down late. GALAXY THIRTYSIX bumped the outside rival at the start, raced between foes heading to
the turn, was bumped from both sides and checked outside the seven-sixteenths dropping back about four lengths at that juncture and shifting in a path,
continued in the two to three path through the turn, drifted a bit in the stretch but rallied inside foes to secure show honors. SUCRE was bumped into the
outside rival at the start but recovered readily to stalk the pacesetter from outside, went three wide on the turn, was between foes leaving that bend and
lacked the needed late kick. NEW YEAR'S PARTY was off just a half step slowly, raced outside foes at the rear heading to the turn, shifted in from the five
to about the three path early on the turn as a rival came out, continued three to four deep through that bend coming out a bit then continuing to drift out in
the stretch and was never near enough to threaten. YES GORGEOUS was bumped at the break, raced outside foes heading into the turn, came in a bit
three wide entering that turn and bumped a rival then subsequently altered out five deep after that incident, continued five wide on the turn and had no rally
in the stretch. NEW ORLEANS SPICE raced between foes up the backstretch then inside a rival into the turn coming out a bit and bumping that foe outside
the seven-sixteenths, continued from the two to three path early on that bend then moved four wide three furlongs out, took closer order outside foes leaving
the turn but flattened out and faded.

turn, moved to four wide while gaining around the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch, came under a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker,
