JASMINE SKY sent for the lead and set the pace under pressure to the outside, cleared that rival around the turn and drew away to the stretch, challenged
late and held gamely under a drive. VERYNSKY knocked into rival at the start, stalked the top pair from the inside, saved ground to the lane, rallied up the
inside, could not get by the winner late but clearly second best. LAKE SHOW bumped at the start, traveled along the inside to the stretch and showed a mild
rally to pick up the show. BALLYCASTLE settled off the rail, went outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lost the show. BRIGHTON
BOY pressed the leader from the outside, could not match strides around the bend and weakened in the final furlong. CAT BLUE veered in and bumped
bumped at the start, off the rail up the backstretch, two wide into the turn, four wide nearing the eighth pole and proved no menace.

angled to the inside, saved ground to the lane and never rallied. ADRIATIC SON chased off the rail, lost ground on the turn, went three wide into the lane

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE MESS vied three deep for command, cleared inside rivals and angled in on the turn, drew away to the eighth pole, led through the lane and
held under right-handed urging. YODELERS WAY broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied along the inside, chased the leader around the turn and
moved out into the two path, re-bid from the outside but lacked the needed late punch get by. PAPA CABALLERO bumped at the start, unhurried in the
early going, traveled along the inside, two wide into the lane, rallied three wide in the stretch and gained the show. MYSTIC GREY bumped leaving the gate,
showed speed between rivals, in a bit tight near the three-eighths pole, chased around the turn and angled three wide leaving the bend and was edged for
the show. REAL QUICK off the rail up the backstretch, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and never rallied. FANDAREL DANCER bumped at
the start, angled over to the inside and stalked the pace near the rail and weakened in the stretch.
