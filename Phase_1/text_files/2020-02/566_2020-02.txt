Footnotes
LITTLE MATILDA tracked early giving a quick move along the rail at the quarter pole showing full of run down the lane to win going awya. A GIRL HAS NO
NAME prompted the pace dueling on lead on the far turn, overpowered from the inside to upper stretch would hold well as a clear second best. SHES JUST
CAPITAL went evenly rallying to bid on the far turn, weakened in upper stretch mustering enough to hold the others. TOAST THE BULLDOGS hustled along
would press through the far turn then wilt in upper stretch. FACTUM'S REWARD failed to menace. SQUATCHINGWITHLYSS was always outrun. IT'S
SPRINGTIME pressed early then gave way along the inside on the far turn.

ROLLIN SO WICKED away alertly set the pace holding to daylight through the turn, moved off along the inside in upper stretch winning as much the best.
MY PEGGY LOU chased the pace extending into upper stretch rallying up for place. LIL COUNTRY GRAD slow early gave a mild rally on the turn angling
out a bit in mid stretch showing some late interest. ANSWER QUIETLY slow early came five wide to upper stretch racing evenly late to move up at mid
track. CIRCLE WILL RUN chased from the rail to upper stretch weakening under a drive. LINDA N MICHELLE hustled along gave hard pursuit to upper
stretch wearing out the final sixteenth. THUNDERTAP played no factor. HIGH CUPPER was always outrun.

Footnotes
EYES FORWARD sent clear set the pace to upper stretch, challenged from the inside an eighth out found more to kick clear. TOMS CHUCHU chased the
pace saving ground bidding from the rail in upper stretch proving no match late while saving place. NOBLE BEHAVIOR hustled along pursued four wide to
upper stretch finishing evenly. CHIEF RED BULL raced evenly in mid pack outbidding the others. JUST OLD SCHOOL slow early gave a mild move to
upper stretch leveling off under a drive. LONESOME PHIL slow early played no factor. PERFECTLY PLAIN chased early between horses wearing out into
upper stretch. QUICK COWBOY was never involved. HEATHWOOD was always outrun. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB showed little.
