Footnotes
SASSY JUSTICE broke to the lead, rated along slightly off the inside to the stretch, and responded well to turn back threats from both flanks. CATNIP
KITTEN saved ground to the far turn, moved out three wide into the stretch and closed well outside rivals. SAND DRIFT was forwardly placed inside from
the outset, bid along the rail through the drive but did not have enough and lost second late. ALGODONAL bumped lightly with STARSHIP GUSSIE at the
start, prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and lacked a solid response. FANTASTIC KINGDOM was outrun inside to the far turn, moved to
the far outside for the drive and passed tired horses. TROPICALITY stayed in range early, came under a ride early on the far turn three wide, and had no
rally. LIBERALE (FR) bumped with SAMIS CAR at the start, and was always outrun. CHA CHA HEELS raced four wide around the first turn, remained well
out in the course advancing up the backstretch, but could not sustain the bid. IMPERIAL CUT was always outrun while mostly three wide. STARSHIP
GUSSIE bumped lightly with ALGODONAL at the start, and was finished early. MYFRANCESCA underwent a four-wide journey and did not factor. SAMIS
CAR took a slight hop out of the gate and was bumped between horses, and made no impact.

Footnotes
FRONTIER MESA hustled up out of the gate, held a slim lead over TOWING in opening stages then cleared over rival and switched in couple paths, settled
on top with a clear advantage, came under some pressure from FEISTY BIRD at the seven sixteenths pole, edged away from rival then hustled up turning
for home, came under attack from inside running GRAN CHAMPANGE top stretch, dug in under steady pressure and held a narrow lead at the furlong
marker, remained under pressure from both sides in final sixteenth, dug in and held firm. FEISTY BIRD settled four wide in early stages then advanced to
race behind the pacesetter, briefly applied some pressure to FRONTIER MESA at seven sixteenths pole then given cue to go after rival turning for home,
was set down for the drive, produced a solid bid but could not get to the winner. GRAN CHAMPAGNE raced off the top two leaders and saved ground
through early stages, roused along the inside around the turn, cut the corner and advanced into striking distance, lacked the kick to get by winner then
evened out in final stages and lost place. TOWING was sent hard at the start but got out-paced by FRONTIER MESA then dropped to last, moved into
stretch six wide under a drive and failed to move into threatening range. THE BEAST AND I reared in the air and unseated the rider at the start, ran loose
then corralled by outrider and walked off.

Footnotes
SUMMER TO REMEMBER prompted the pace outside MAJESTIC RO from the start, dueled with that rival late on the far turn and into upper stretch, forged
clear into the final furlong and had just enough to stave off AFRICAN HERITAGE. The latter bumped with BLESS THE KITTEN at the start, bobbled a bit
while being eased back off the leaders first time under the wire, found a good spot tracking inside just off the pace, came off the rail with aim in the
three-path turning for home, rallied steadily outside SUMMER TO REMEMBER but needed one more jump to get by. PREFECT was strung out four wide on
the first turn, stayed close three wide around the far turn, could not kick on with the top two but was up outside MAJESTIC RO to get the show. MAJESTIC
RO brushed the left side of the gate but was away alertly, rated along setting a moderate pace for six furlongs, fought back when challenged by the eventual
winner at the top of the lane, but weakened through the last eighth of a mile. OFF THE MEDS raced two wide on the turns, steadied slightly inside

Footnotes
BACK IN CHARGE was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated two to three wide off the pace to the far turn, headed in pursuit and gained position along
the outside entering the lane, kept on determinedly under steady pressure and kicked by TOKEN in final stages. TOKEN vied for the lead leaving the chute
then set a pressured pace with KAPIOLANI racing in striking distance, edged away to clearer command and led by a clear margin around the turn, hustled
along under steady pressure then appeared all out in late stages and got outkicked for the win. ETANA raced in the back and saved ground down the
backstretch, shifted out and hustled up around the turn, continued well back turning for home then shifted out wider under left-handed pressure and rallied
up for show. KAPIOLANI vied for the lead with TOKEN out of the chute then applied pace pressure to rival down the backstretch, could not remain in striking
range of the leader upon entering the turn, prompted to go after rival but failed to make headway then raced evenly through the lane. BEAM OF LIGHT
raced in range and tracked the pace to the far turn, launched a bid along inside, cut the corner entering top stretch, stayed on with interest up the inside then
flattened in final sixteenth and lost show. KAHIKO was forwardly placed along the inside and ridden along to maintain tempo down the backstretch then
came up empty and retreated around the turn. PAID UP raced in range in early stages then retreated nearing the half mile marker.

Footnotes
FLOWMOTION was on hold early two wide, steadied slightly between horses late on the backstretch, advanced inside around the far turn, tipped out to the
three-path once straightened away, and wore down the leaders from outside. JUST THE FACTS established an even pace along the inside, and held on
with good courage to save the place. THE QUEENS JULES prompted the pace outside JUST THE FACTS, turned up the pressure challenging a
quarter-mile out, battled through the furlong grounds and weakened late between the top two. TIL THE END stayed in range in the two-path for six furlongs,
shifted out in mid stretch and finished willingly outside the leaders. BOLD DADDY settled in the middle of the field three wide early, moved farther out on the
far turn and could not gain. BONDURANT was well out of it early inside, moved out around the far turn and into the stretch, and gained mildly. YEAR OF
THE KITTEN was never a factor. DEXTER ROAD lacked speed early and never got involved. MAJESTIC LUNA went three then four wide on the far turn,
and did not make his presence felt. DUC DE CALAS (FR) raced far back throughout. MISTER MAESTRO retired early inside. UNION RICHES had a
forward position early, but faded three wide after six furlongs.

Footnotes
FASHION BABE prompted and advanced to challenge STARLIT DAYDREAM in early stages, vied for the lead with rival holding a slight edge down the
backstretch then raced on equal terms around the turn, battled back gamely under pressure into the lane, shook clear past the furlong marker and held well.
PRAIRIE WINGS came away last and hustled up from the get-go, moved into contention and ridden along through the backstretch to maintain tempo,

Footnotes
LIANA SUSQUEHANNA waited for room around the turn toward the inside, slid out smoothly to the three-path at the top of the stretch, and kicked in
strongly to blow by DISTINCTLY BLUE from outside past the eighth-pole. DISTINCTLY BLUE broke out bothering BLUE MAGIC at the start, pressed the
pace outside R NEXT ROLL, reached a brief lead in mid stretch, proved no match for the winner and weakened late to share second. BLUE MAGIC was
forced out at the start and off slowest, raced in the second flight around the turn three then four wide, and finished well outside to wind up on even terms for
the place. DEALER'S GIRL was on hold behind the early leaders, continued to await room past the quarter-pole and into upper stretch, finally got some
open space in the two-path a sixteenth out but could never be fully set down. SPEED STAR stayed in range two then three wide to the stretch, and could
not threaten with an even finish. CATHARSIS saved ground to no avail in midpack. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT was slow from the gate, raced three wide on the
turn, and made no late headway on the far outside. ANSWER MY CALL was slow from the gate and always outrun. R NEXT ROLL dashed clear early,
showed the way inside to the lane, and gave way once collared by DISTINCTLY BLUE through mid stretch. LADY MAGICA was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SWEET MIA got bumped by FILLY JEAN KING at the start, emerged with the lead out of the chute, got joined from the inside by LET'S BE HONEST past
the five-eighths, regained command shifting out to the three-path approaching the stretch and edged clear, jumped back to her left lead while tiring a
sixteenth out and was saved by the wire. FILLY JEAN KING broke out shutting off GRAN RESERVA and bumping SWEET MIA, tracked behind the leaders
around the turn, tipped to the four-path in upper stretch, and closed steadily outside the winner to just miss. LET'S BE HONEST went up to vie for command
inside SWEET MIA after a quarter-mile, maintained a short lead midway on the turn, shifted to the two-path entering the stretch and weakened. GRAN
RESERVA got shut off and checked behind FILLY JEAN KING at the start, put in a four-wide run to contention after a half-mile, but gave way in the stretch.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE was forced out by MANDAMUS at the start, raced in the two-path around the turn and lacked a bid. LALALI saved ground to the
stretch and failed to menace. MANDAMUS broke out at the start, sat poised outside the leaders midway on the turn, steadied behind SWEET MIA going by
the quarter-pole and dropped back, and was eased up late.

Footnotes
MISS MUNNINGS angled inside shortly after the start then rated off the clear top trio down the backstretch, edged closer on the second flight then remained
patiently piloted around the far turn, switched out a path and given cue top stretch, responded willingly and kicked clear. CASH OUT was unhurried and
raced in the back down the backstretch, settled patiently and gained ground along the rail on the final turn, tipped out three wide top stretch and produced a
solid finish. ANGEL OF MISCHIEF settled two to three wide to the far turn, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole then came out five wide entering
the lane, continued in steady pursuit and got up late for show. TAKE CHARGECHRISTY was unhurried and saved ground through early stages, launched a
two to three wide bid around the final turn, shifted out six wide entering top stretch and had a mild improve. EBULLIENT opened up on top leaving the first
turn, held a clear lead through early stages and held clear into stretch then got collared by the winner in the final furlong and gave way. LA AUSTRALIANA
raced off the early pace then was ridden along to pick up the tempo near the half but failed to make headway, moved into top stretch seven wide and lacked
a needed rally. NIKKI BEACH raced near the lead in opening stages then tracked the clear pacesetter to the far turn, launched a two wide bid near the
quarter pole then gave way in the lane. RAKI raced five wide off the early pace, failed to make headway around the final turn then raced eight paths wide
top stretch and lacked a needed rally. MY FAVORITE GIFT raced just off the lead and steadied near between nearing the first turn, tracked the clear
pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid along inside around the final turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT ROSES broke out at the start, was unhurried for nearly six furlongs three wide, shifted out a bit wider being given his cue at the top of the
stretch, reached the front a sixteenth out and held off challengers from both flanks under good handling. CRYPTO GOLD bumped with HIGHWAY FLYER at
the start and was off slowly, raced near the back three wide into the far turn, rallied through traffic and finished gamely inside the winner. DUELLIST bumped
with FILM FAN solidly at the break, then more lightly with DREAMMASTER, advanced circling four wide around the far turn, and finished willingly outside
the winner. TRAFFIC TROUBLE raced four then five wide around the turn, and improved position on the far outside late. BARBIE'S KING got pushed out at
the start, reached a forward position three wide early, came four wide challenging for command after six furlongs, gained a short lead through mid stretch
while shifting in, but weakened late. HAIL MICHIGAN stayed in range two wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed late response. SKY'S SON raced in
the second flight throughout, and could not gain. ROYAL FAMILY saved ground on the turns, and had no final response. NOBLE NEBRASKAN was four
then three wide prompting the early pace, reached a short and brief lead between horses late on the far turn, and gave way in the stretch. DREAMMASTER
bumped lightly with DUELLIST at the start, and was never close. HIGHWAY FLYER bumped with CRYPTO GOLD at the start and was off slowly, tried to
loop rivals five then six wide around the far turn, and had nothing left for the drive. FILM FAN bumped with DUELLIST at the start, set the pace inside, and
faltered after six furlongs.
