Footnotes
TRAPPED TOWN settled in a stalking position near the inside, responded readily when set down nearing the top of the stretch, rallied three wide to make
the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. BEAUTIFUL CREATURE away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch and
finished second best. DIAMOND DARLIN chased the pace into the far turn, inched closer two wide then failed to sustain that bid. KINZUA failed to menace.
MILLBANK MAGIC was no factor. DIAMOND BREW was through after a half. ROSE OF PRADO had speed for a half then stopped and jogged to the wire.

Footnotes
OBIWAN allowed to settle, circled horses rapidly three wide on the far turn, made the lead, drifted from the three to seven path while under left handed
urging between the furlong marker and sixteenth pole and drew off under strong handling. SLATE unhurried early, steadied while widest of all entering the
stretch, closed determinedly in the seven path, was shut off at the sixteenth pole causing his rider to check and finished clear for second. DURITZ trailed for
over a half, then found his best stride late near the inside. BIRD KEY moved up five wide entering the stretch then leveled off. GUCCISSIMO trailed from the
gate, rushed to contention two wide after a quarter, matched strides into the far turn, inherited the lead briefly, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch
then gave way. UNBRIDLEDSELECTION stalked pace the pace into the far turn, rallied two wide to make the lead near the quarter pole then came up
empty. HANNAH'S BOISTER set the pace fro five furlongs, stopped abruptly and lost contact with his field. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SLATE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF OBIWAN FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED OBIWAN AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides. SOUTH BEACH GIRL chased the pace for a half, rallied two wide into the stretch, quickly opened a daylight
lead, set the balance of the pace and was caught in the final yards. PROMISES FOREVER allowed to settle, finished with good courage in the six path.

sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace for a half then. HOPES AND PRAYERS failed to menace. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE was no

Footnotes
SELLING OUT never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch, made the lead late and won under brisk handling. FREEDONIA pressed the
pace into the turn, rallied three wide, made the lead near mid stretch, battled until deep stretch and finished second best. ARATHORN vied for the lead
along the inside into the stretch, drifted out to the five path and finished evenly. HENNESSY FIRE allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals.
MAGICAL EXPRESS away alertly, set the pace along the inside until mid stretch then weakened. OH OZ failed to menace. COAL MINERS SON chased the
pace into the turn, loomed boldly between horses two wide midway on the turn, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. RUN TO FREEDOM was
through early. ELECTRIFYING trailed.
