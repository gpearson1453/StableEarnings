Footnotes
SIR ADVENT disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, moved clear at the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage under his own
power into upper stretch then drew off under a hand ride, was given five cracks of a right-handed whip between the eighth-pole and the sixteenth-pole then
put back to a hand ride while much the best. DISAPPROVAL broke out then was corrected with a tug of the left rein, disputed the pace on the inside, vied
along the rail on the turn, dropped back under urging at the five-sixteenths then lost touch with the winner, was driven into upper stretch and proved no
match while able to hold the place. LORD COLLIERY was moving around at the start and broke slow, spotted the front several lengths, settled outside at
the rear under some urging, moved in late on the backstretch, shifted from three to five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response while able to get the show. TAFT'S LIL BOY was well placed towards the front, came under urging in the two path on the turn, was driven
into upper stretch and had nothing left. JALEN HURTS was urged along while well back in the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out
under a drive near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. GRAND OMEGA tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive and tired. CHIMNEYVILLE was coaxed along on the outside, went six then seven wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TOM MANAGEMENT went to the front, set the pace in the two path through moderate fractions, moved clear at the five-sixteenths, responded well when
asked nearing the quarter-pole, drifted out under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, responded well while lugging out some in the final furlong and
maintained a safe advantage under steady handling. MORETHANFISHIN bumped lightly with ROCK THE JUKEBOX at the start, bumped again with that
foe early, started the first turn in the two path while in hand, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, was rated at the back of the compact field, came
under urging while four then five wide on the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch, drifted out late and was second best. ROSSLARE HARBOUR went
four to five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased five then four wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and tired
while clear for the show. HE'S A CLIMBER bumped lightly with MORETHANFISHIN at the start, bumped again with that opponent early, was rated on the
inside, saved ground through the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and faltered then was vanned off after the race while bleeding from nostrils
then was confirmed to have bled. MASPERO went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace loosely between horses, was asked leaving the
backstretch, vied three wide under urging early on the far turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths then moved four wide, floated six wide into the stretch
and faltered badly then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
RAKE IT UP was off a length slowly then faced mild and brief traffic in behind rivals early, advanced between foes outside the half-mile marker, come up
behind the leading pair in about the two path entering the turn, came out a path early on that bend then another path to be four wide by the five-sixteenths,
took over in upper stretch under urging at that juncture and extended the margin under mild pressure. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS broke sharply but was
outpaced in the early going, raced in behind the leaders well off the fence in the three to four path through the turn coming five wide past the quarter pole,
was put to urging at that point, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and was second best. ROCK THE JUKEBOX vied inside, saved ground through the turn with a
narrow advantage into upper stretch, was overtaken by the three-sixteenths and weakened thereafter while holding show honors from DESERT THIEF, who
settled into stride behind the leaders near but just off the rail, continued in the two path through the turn, was guided out past the three-sixteenths to be
about four wide near the furlong marker and ran on while unable to get up for third. HEIDI'S WISH came in after the break and was urged forward to vie for
the lead outside a foe, went in the three path through the whole of the turn then faded in the lane. IN FULL SWING was a half-step slow into stride, kept
wide up the backstretch and about the four path through the turn coming out a bit into the home straight and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
MR. AL'S GAL went around the first turn in the four path, tracked the pace on the outside, took the lead outside the seven-sixteenths, controlled the action in
the two path on the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed
whip outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. HYPER PIPER was unprepared at the start then off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back on the outside, advanced four wide under urging on the far turn, chased the winner into
upper stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and flattened out while able to get the place. NET A BEAR bumped with a foe at the start and was off a step
slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved closer midway down the backstretch, shifted out outside the three-eighths, was urged along
while five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. BERMUDA STAR rounded the first turn
in the two path, settled off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, shifted from three to four wide under urging early on the far turn, came five
wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. IS TOO was restless in the gate, went five wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the
outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. IRISH HUSTLE went three wide on the first turn, settled
off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, dropped back under urging while three then two wide and retreated. LA MISTAKE broke in then
was hustled, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, dropped back with three furlongs to run and faltered. FAIRWELL TAX BREAK was
sent hard to the lead, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace, lost the advantage outside the seven-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
RAZEENA was coaxed forward at the break to obtain position stalking from outside foes four wide into the first turn, inched closer up the backstretch, bid
four wide late on the far turn taking command in upper stretch, drifted in under right-handed urging in upper- to mid-stretch then switched to left-handed
correction and drifted out, continued to drift a bit late under all out encouragement and just held from SINGITA DREAMS, who was reserved early and
shifted in to to save ground on the first turn, was guided out three wide outside the half-mile marker, advanced three wide into the far turn and put to urging
moving four wide near the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch five wide and took aim on the leader, steadily gained on that rival but could not get past in
time. ROMANI set the pace inside on or just off the fence through the first turn, was kept in the two path up the backstretch facing moderately more
pressure, was challenged by an outside rival still on or near the rail on the far turn being overtaken by the quarter pole and offered no extra for the stretch
while best of the rest. N. D. FREE came out a bit heading into the first turn lightly brushing with FASHION ISLAND then shifted in to the rail early on that
bend, tracked inside up the backstretch and continued to save ground through the far turn but failed to rally. FASHION ISLAND was lightly brushed and just
momentarily taken hold of outside a rival into the first turn, continued in the three path through that bend and two to three wide up the backstretch, continued
in the same path through the far turn before shifting five wide leaving that bend, failed to rally but did pass a rival in the stretch. BLUNT FORCE broke
outwardly just a tad and was encouraged forward two then three deep into the first turn, was within range pressing between foes up the backstretch,
appeared to jump a puddle near the half-mile marker, urged by the three-eighths between foes two to three deep on the far turn but had no response and
came up empty.

Footnotes
DREAM HALO went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, entered the far turn in the three path then angled five wide while
commencing a rally, closed strongly to get the lead into upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. COPPER FIDDLE went to the front, set the pace
in hand while inside to the two path, was asked approaching the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner
while clear for the place. TEZ went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused leaving the backstretch, went four wide while ridden along
on the far turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. AFLEET ROGER brushed with a foe at the start, was taken up off heels early, went
three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted behind horses in the two path early on the far turn, dropped to the rail while asked outside the
quarter-pole, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out nearing the furlong marker, drifted out late and also lacked the needed response. MERLIN'S
SONG brushed with an opponent at the start, was taken up briefly while rank nearing the first turn, settled inside to the two path, was asked on the far turn,
chased into the stretch and came up empty. JACKFRUIT was hustled from the start, raced in the two path for most of the first turn then shifted four wide,
settled outside near the back, dropped well behind under urging while four then three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. NICE OF ME went four wide
on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and stopped.

MAINTAINANCE MATT settled into stride mid-pack between rivals to the turn going two to three wide on that bend, came into upper stretch with room three
deep at the quarter pole advancing inside a foe, overtook the leader outside the furlong marker while under urging and quickly forged clear before being
taken in hand nearing the wire. MOVE IT pressed the early pace from inside, switched outside MAGI entering the turn going two then three wide through
much of that bend before coming four deep into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but kept on to get the place. JACK BEANSTALK raced
outside foes off the leaders going four wide through the turn, shifted in to about the two path past the quarter pole, ran on evenly late improving position
between foes. MAGI bumped the outer foe at the break, moved forward to force the pace from outside a rival, shifted in a bit from the two path early on the
turn, was clear leaving that bend but soon overtaken by the winner in upper stretch, had no extra and was outfinished for minor awards. TRINITY N ROUX
was bumped at the break then under mild encouragement moved forward to stalk the leaders from outside, went four deep through the turn coming out a
path into upper stretch, failed to rally. SOAR LIKE AN EAGLE got away a step slowly at the start spotting the field about a length and a half, encouraged
along but lacking early speed, went in the two path into the turn gradually shifting out four deep through that bend and another further path or two into upper
stretch, failed to produce a bid. BOOGIE SHUES raced mid-pack inside foes on the rail into the turn, came off the fence just a bit while dropping back on
that bend before moving out further to be four wide at the quarter pole, tired in the lane.

Footnotes
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path, responded well when set down in upper stretch, had the rider lose his whip
coming to the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. CONQUEST LEMONRAID went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in
the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted out some under a drive inside the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the place.
BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, dropped to the three
path under a drive outside the quarter-pole, chased the winner under the whip in the stretch and lost the place late while able to get the show. TAKE THAT
FOR DATA was last to commence, went four wide on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, went four then five wide under strong urging on the
far turn, came six wide into the stretch and also finished willingly but missed the trifecta while well clear for the last spot in the superfecta. CADE'S ON THE
BUMP went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under restraint, was asked while three then four wide on the
far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, steadied between horses inside the three-sixteenths and capitulated. HANDSOME HONEY went three to four wide
on the first turn, was well placed in third position, raced inside early on the far turn, was asked while moving to the two path around the five-sixteenths,
chased into upper stretch and came up empty. DICTATOR went six wide under restraint on the first turn, tugged hard at the bit onto the backstretch, stalked
the pace on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded.

CHANSON LA BELLE settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed strongly
to get the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. CHARSEY bumped with a rival at the start then was sent hard, chased the pace on
the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch, took the lead before the three-sixteenths, drifted in while moving clear
outside the furlong marker, led until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to get the place. EZEE ENOUGH bumped with a foe at the start
then dropped back, settled well off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, gained under the whip into the final furlong, moved in close to the rail
late and finished with good energy to just miss the place while well clear for the show. MADISON'S PLACE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
settled well back on the outside, was urged along while six wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch then drifted further out and improved position.
ORANGE TWISTER was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out under a drive
around the three-sixteenths, drifted out some in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to threaten. STANG'S GALAXY quickly sped clear, raced inside
on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and stopped. PREMIE BABY was coaxed along off the pace, swerved out leaving the backstretch, dropped back
while three to four wide on the turn and retreated.
