Footnotes
MISS MAC pressed the pace outside NO GOOD DEED, took over and moved away after a half-mile, and was driving to stay clear late. QUEEN ABARRIO
stayed in touch early three wide, drifted out a bit under left-hand pressure past the eighth-pole, had the rider switch right-handed with aim outside the leader,
lugged in 70 yards out and settled for second. MARKISTAN broke through the gate while in the hands of an assistant starter just prior to the other stalls
opening, dove inward pushing HOLD THE SPENDING in as well, saved ground around the turn in the middle of the pack, rallied mildly into the stretch but
flattened out. BOSS WIFE was outsprinted two wide to the stretch, and finished with some interest. AWESOME FLYER chased the leaders under pressure
through the turn, drifted wide into the stretch and had nothing further. FLAT OUT COOL had her head turned to the left as the gates opened and veered in
at the start, moved out four wide approaching the stretch and posed no threat. HOLD THE SPENDING lunged at the start and was pushed in by
MARKISTAN, moved off the inside around the turn to wind up four or five wide past the quarter-pole, and could not gain. NO GOOD DEED sped to the lead
after an alert beginning, got collared by MISS MAC with five-sixteenths remaining, and gave way. LET'S GO LUNA stutter-stepped and hopped at the start
to get away tardily, was six wide into the lane and made no impact. UNION LANE was unprepared in the hands of an assistant starter at the break, and
raced well back three wide. C EST FAST raced four wide into the turn, and moved in a bit while fading steadily approaching the stretch. MUSIC MUSIC
hesitated at the start, then wheeled out near the outer rail, and was far back throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START,
MARKISTAN AND UNION LANE WERE DECLARED NON-STARTERS.

Footnotes
COMIC KITTEN raced in close contention and tracked the leader under slight restraint, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, kept on determinedly
under strong handling through the lane and got up in time. REGAL ROMANCE cleared out of the gate and crossed over to the inside nearing the first turn,
was forwardly placed and raced just off the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for KATIELEIGH around the far turn, vied for the lead
past the furlong marker then shook free but got caught in final strides. BARBADOLLA was unhurried at the start and raced near the rear around the first
turn, remained settled through early stages then picked up the pace near the three eighths pole, gained position on the turn then hustled along two wide
entering top stretch, stayed on with response, edged closer then got in tight and steadied late. RECESS was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved
ground around the first turn, raced two wide off the early pace then prompted for response near the quarter pole, was set down driving five wide in the lane
and edged closer in final stages. KATIELEIGH took the lead after the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace through early stages then
came under pressure from REGAL ROMANCE mid-way down the backstretch, held off bid from rival around then far turn then challenged by
aforementioned foe upper stretch, fought back from the inside position past the furlong marker then gave way. MARGIE MUSIC rated near mid-range down
the backstretch under a snug hold, let out entering the far turn and hustled up for response along the inside but lacked the needed response to reach
threatening range. TOO MUCH WAR steadied entering the first turn then tracked the pace along the rail to the far turn then failed to move on under
pressure. STATED raced in range down the backstretch then given cue around the far turn but failed to move on then weakened. HENNY'S TREASURE
was unhurried and quickly crossed over to the inside after the start, remained unhurried and saved ground to the far turn, hustled up five wide into the lane
and lacked a needed rally. TWEETY KITTEN raced three wide entering the first turn, raced off the pace to the far turn, moved into stretch run racing widest
and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
UP IN SMOKE broke alertly and tracked outside the leaders, took over with a four-wide move after a half-mile and drove well clear through the lane.
SHAZZY B bobbled at the start, stayed close inside early, waited behind the leaders approaching the quarter-pole while moving off the rail, gained
clearance into the stretch and finished well. KASHAN pressed the pace outside DON'T EATTHE APPLE, rallied into second through upper stretch but
weakened in the late stages. DAILY GRACE stayed in range early, swung four wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late bid. GRANNY BRADLEY
moved in around the turn, and could not gain late on the rail. DON'T EATTHE APPLE set a pressured pace inside, got overhauled after a half-mile and gave
way. QUIET DRAMA got bumped between horses and squeezed back at the start, and was never close. FORTUNATE CAT was up close early, and
dropped back three wide on the turn. DREAM ADRIANNA bumped with QUIET DRAMA at the start, steadied on the rail behind GRANNY BRADLEY
midway on the turn, and dropped far back. NICE ADVENTURE was through early four wide. PATRICIA H bumped with QUIET DRAMA at the start, and was
outrun four wide.

Footnotes
SOLAR settled along the inside and raced near mid-pack down the backstretch, prompted three to four wide near the quarter pole, roused forward to race in
striking distance upper stretch then took command, drifted out wide under left handed pressure and held firm. POSITIVE PHIL raced three wide off the early
pace, hustled up entering the far turn then moved into stretch run six wide, shifted out wider while racing behind drifting out winner, produced a solid finish
but could not reach SOLAR. SALTKING was reserved and raced in the rear to the far turn, swung out wide entering top stretch, continued a wide bid with
response and cleared share. MALIBU MUSIC raced off the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, moved into the turn along the inside then angled
out near the quarter pole, showed response under a drive three to four wide upper stretch, gained position then evened out. DING DONG DITCH settled in
range through early stages, loomed up closer near the quarter pole, raced in aim for the lead upper stretch then failed to kick on under pressure. GOOD
SOLUTION was forwardly placed around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, cleared the lead at the quarter pole, fought back for
command top stretch then got collared by winner and gave way. BLOCKBUSTER was unhurried and saved ground, shifted out turning for home and lacked
a needed rally. I STAND CORRECTED stalked along the inside through early stages, prompted for more around the far turn, failed to advance then steadily
faded. GUESS FIRST raced three wide into the first turn, settled off the pace and failed to respond when called upon. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) raced near
mid-range down the backstretch then faded around the final turn. WAR FEATHER sped to the lead and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace to
the far turn, got collared by rival nearing the quarter pole then tired in the drive. Due to timer malfunction race was hand timed

Footnotes
GOLDEN TAPIT broke outward to get off behind the rest, moved to a forward position through the stretch the first time and prompted the pace outside,
challenged outside TOLERANT a quarter-mile out, and proved best through the final 70 yards. TOLERANT took command after the start, rated along inside
slowing the pace down through the middle stages, responded when hooked by GOLDEN TAPIT turning for home, but could not hold that one off late.
ROCHAMBEAU tucked in nicely off the leaders for six furlongs, moved off the inside approaching the stretch, and finished evenly. GRAY'S FABLE saved
ground in range to the stretch, and lacked a solid final response. NORTH DAKOTA bumped with BETTERMENT at the start, raced three wide much of the
way and did not menace in an even effort. BETTERMENT was bumped between horses at the start, steadied along to the first turn between rivals and
bumped with MAGICAL MIKE, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and could not threaten while angling back in through the furlong grounds.
MADE MY DAY (IRE) steadied along inside while keyed up first time past the stands, and continued to save ground well back. MAGICAL MIKE bumped
with BETTERMENT at the start, bumped with that same rival three wide into the first turn, and never reached contention. HEIRLOOM KITTEN broke in at
the start, raced in the middle of the pace two wide for six furlongs, and tired. POWER (BRZ) was crowded by HEIRLOOM KITTEN at the break, then
bumped with NORTH DAKOTA and steadied back a stride later, went four wide into the first turn, and faltered after six furlongs.

Footnotes
BLAMED tussled for the early lead racing inside of GUACOMOLE under slight restraint, shook free from rival entering the turn and cleared on top still
unleashed at the quarter pole, tapped on the shoulder turning for home and widened advantage, went to prompt right-handed and ducked out near
mid-stretch, shown right-handed whip, straightened out and kept clear. MS MESHAK was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in range along the
outside, edged closer then given cue three wide near the quarter pole, roused five wide into lane then shifted to the inside of drifting out leader and
continued a solid bid. HEIRESSALL positioned not too far off the pace in early stages while ridden along to maintain tempo, prompted four wide at the
quarter pole, continued a outside bid entering the lane then shifted out wider mid-stretch and stayed on with response to clear share. GUACAMOLE vied for
the lead with BLAMED out of the gate, continued to race near equal terms down the backstretch then failed match strides around the turn, chased on upper
stretch then gave way. CELIA'S SONG raced up close in the opening quarter then steadily faded. NO NEED TO APPEAL saved ground along the inside,
responded briefly entering the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
SPA CITY pressed the pace outside HERE COMES BULLET, took over from outside after six furlongs, came into the lane well out in the track, and kept
UNRIGHTEOUS at bay through the late stages. UNRIGHTEOUS bumped and brushed with GUACO at the start, moved off the inside advancing near the
stretch, challenged outside SPA CITY through the drive, but could not reach that one while much best of the others. TELEPHONE TALKER raced three
wide, was ridden along early toward the back, and improved position while never seriously involved. MANDATE saved ground trailing to the stretch, and
improved past tired horses. WILL SING FOR WINE was outrun while primarily two wide on the turns. ALL EYES WEST tracked the leaders three wide, and
faded under pressure after six furlongs. GUACO bumped and brushed with UNRIGHTEOUS at the start, saved ground to the far turn and faded steadily.
BOURBON WISDOM raced three wide in range early, but gave way before reaching the stretch. HOLY MUCHACHO raced four wide, and was empty after
six furlongs. HERE COMES BULLET vied inside SPA CITY to the far turn, and faltered leaving the three-eighths pole.

lost command to CABRE but stayed on gamely. CHARGE CARD tugged slightly while rated off the top flight near the half mile marker, let out and advanced
into closer contention around the turn, drifted out wider turning for home then stayed on with response under steady pressure and gained show. LI'L
MEATBALL vied for the lead out of the gate then held a slim advantage and vied into the turn, lost the lead to DESERT GENERAL near five sixteenths but
stayed on with response upper stretch then gave way in final furlong. DR HARLAN raced five wide off the early pace, roused along the outside around the
turn, raced wide into stretch and failed to kick on. KARMA KING raced up close between foes in early stages, continued in aim entering the turn then faded

Footnotes
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN prompted the pace from the start, wrested command outside SUMMER MISCHIEF turning for home and briefly edged clear, then
dug in and repelled two challengers through the final stages. FLYOFF vied inside SUMMER MISCHIEF early before deferring, saved ground content to
follow along from close range to the far turn, moved out three wide into the lane, bid between TWENTY FOUR SEVEN and PHILO past the eighth-pole and
just missed. PHILO settled within range two wide for six furlongs, shifted out for the drive, loomed boldly outside the top two through the last eighth of a mile
but was edged to the finish. TIPSY KITTEN bumped lightly with LAPOCHKA at the start, settled in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, and gained mildly
on the far outside late. CASH CALL KITTEN hugged the rail every step of the way, and could not gain under pressure through the drive. SUMMER
MISCHIEF vied outside FLYOFF in the four-path before clearing to the lead around the first turn, rated along through the middle stages establishing an even
clip, came under attack by the eventual winner after six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was bumped and forced out at the start,
prompted the pace three wide, and gave way soon after completing six furlongs. LAPOCHKA bumped lightly with TIPSY KITTEN at the start, went along in
the middle of the pack early, and faded four wide into the stretch. MANHATTAN PROJECT broke out bumping and pushing RIVER OF DREAMS into
AREYOUTALKINGTOME, was four wide into the backstretch near the back, and could not gain. RIVER OF DREAMS was bumped by MANHATTAN
PROJECT and forced out into AREYOUTALKINGTOME at the start, and trailed throughout. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
WITH VERVE settled six paths wide in early stages then switched in a couple paths and prompted four wide entering the turn, advanced to race in aim for
the lead then hustled along six wide entering top stretch, driven to clear command then finished in hand. GENGHIS was off a step slow at the start then
quickly advanced up the inside into contention, was patiently handled around the turn then prompted two wide top stretch, stayed on with response and
finished clearly second best. RICKI TICKI TAFFI was forwardly placed through early stages and battled for the lead around the turn, drifted out wider turning
for home then gave way. NORTHBROOK raced five wide in the back, moved through the turn along the outside then raced wide into the lane and failed to
move on. CONQUER held a slim lead along the rail through the backstretch then vied for the lead around the turn, fought back top stretch then came up
empty. DECKOLOGY was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, continued a bid in aim around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
STARSHIP JUBILEE was unhurried early, edged closer to the leaders after six furlongs, ranged up confidently handled three wide past the quarter-pole
keeping MAGIC STAR pinned in, took charge outside TAPIT TODAY in upper stretch, and drew off under hand urging. MAGIC STAR saved ground for six
furlongs, found herself boxed in behind the leaders going by the quarter-pole and into upper stretch, split rivals entering the final furlong and wore down
TAPIT TODAY for the runner-up spot. TAPIT TODAY chased outside KELSEY'S CROSS for six furlongs, challenged between that one and STARSHIP
JUBILEE nearing the top of the stretch, could not kick on with the latter after straightening away, and lost the place in the closing strides. SMART SHOT
trailed to the far turn toward the inside, eased out three wide at the top of the lane, moved a bit further out putting in a mild run through the furlong grounds
but could not sustain the rally. KELSEY'S CROSS set a solid pace inside for six furlongs, got overhauled approaching the stretch and gave way. GREAT
SISTER DIANE raced in the three-path much of the way near the back, and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH held a slim lead around the first turn, set the pace with rivals not far behind down the backstretch, held firm over challenger's around
the far turn, prompted and widened to a clear advantage upper stretch, finished going away then wrapped up late. FRIENDLY FELLA tugged around the first
turn then settled and remained in close contention, launched a two wide bid for leader around the far turn, was no match for pulling away rival but stayed on
for place. JOE BENJAMIN bumped with foe at the start, tracked the pace two wide down the backstretch, launched a bid entering the far turn, was no match
for winner but continued a steady bid and narrowly missed place. KEEP MARCHING saved ground around the first turn then settled through middle stages,
prompted three to four wide around the far turn, gained position then kept under a ride five wide in stretch run and needed more for late impact. MYSTERY
GUEST raced off the pace and saved ground to the far turn, came under a ride two to three wide, shifted to inside upper stretch then evened out. SKYLINE
VIEW got bumped at the start then hustled up nearing the first turn, settled and raced near mid-pack to the far turn then prompted three to four wide and
failed to mount a serious challenge. MORNING TICE raced two wide in the back to the far turn, saved ground entering stretch then angled out and failed to
respond. BELLAS FELLA raced five wide entering first turn, raced off the pace then moved into top stretch five wide and had no response. DRAMATIC
KITTEN raced up close in the first turn, remained forwardly placed just off the leader to the far turn down the backstretch, put to pressure along the inside
around the far turn, failed to advance then faded in the lane. SACCO AND VANZETTI bumped with foe at the start, secured inside position in the first turn,
raced in range to the far turn then faded under pressure. WOLFPUB raced off the pace then two wide into upper stretch to no avail. FULL MOON RISING
