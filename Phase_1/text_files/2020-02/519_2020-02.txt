Footnotes
LIEUTENANT MARGIE pressed the pace, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and was all out at the wire. PANSHIR pressed the pace,
shifted out on the turn, bid eight wide, closed willingly and was outfinished in a game effort. RYDERROO trailed the field in a wide trip, closed fast and was
gaining late. DREAMY EYES pressed the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail, yielded late and lost position in the final strides. STEAMNSTONE was
reluctant to load, vied to the sixteenth pole and was unable to sustain her bid.

Footnotes
GRATEFUL PRAISE broke out, moved up inside to assume command, drew off on the turn, extended her lead under mild urging and finished much the
best. CHATTIN WITH JENNY saved ground, bid inside, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. ACCLIMATED SONG bumped at the start,
was never far back, raced outside, went seven wide entering the stretch, lacked a rally and held for show. DECARCHYS DREAM bumped at the start, raced
in the back, angled out at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. DATCAT dueled to the turn and gave way. I AM THE STORM dueled to the turn
and gave way. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE showed speed to the turn and stopped. BREED FOR SPEED stumbled and was pinched back at the start and
trailed the field.

Footnotes
DAME DANGEROUS pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn, dueled for the lead, inched away, was under pressure through the drive and held
well. MERITTRIS pressed the pace, bid three wide between horses on the turn, bore out, dropped back, came again once straightened and finished gamely.
DANCING AWESOME rallied four across on the turn, was carried wide, dropped back, continued willingly to the wire and earned show. REGAL JAZZ raced
in the back, bid inside leaving the turn and closed steadily to improve position. GOFARGOGO was slow early, raced outside, offered a mild bid and
improved position. COCO LOCO MAMA set the pace, responded when challenged to duel past the eighth pole and faltered. WHISKERJULEP pressed the
pace while racing along the rail, dropped back on the turn and gave way. TIZ LUCY was impeded and steadied along the backstretch and did not threaten.
The rider of TIZ LUCY claimed foul against the rider of DAME DANGEROUS for alleged interference on the backstretch. No change was made.

MADE FOR MORE was in tight at the start, stalked the pace, closed steadily and wore down her rival to get up late. DEEP 'N' IT set the pace to deep
stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. YOU GOT THIS bumped at the start, raced close to the pace, bid six wide and didn't have enough late. SECRET
PARANOIA was crowded and steadied after the start, bid off the rail to get within range and hung late. FAITH IN EXCESS bumped at the start, saved
ground, advanced on the turn, shifted out and closed steadily. TOP LADY MARGIE raced evenly and did not threaten. EMERALD LADY broke slowly,
lagged while racing outside and lacked a bid. STRATAGEM broke awkwardly and was in tight at the start and was not a factor. The rider of SECRET
PARANOIA lodged an objection against the rider of DEEP 'N' IT for alleged interference after the start. No change was made.

GATITO was never far off the pace, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed willingly, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. FRESH ONE
was never far back, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and earned place. CAPITAL REEF raced mid pack, went six wide entering the
stretch, found his best stride and got up for show. KING T'CHALLA got away alertly, vied to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and faltered near the sixteenth
pole. RAY OF SUMMER raced outside, vied to the turn, swung five wide, fell back and went evenly late. E Z SAMURAI raced mid pack, bid inside and came
up empty late. HEZA SNEAK raced in the back, offered a mild bid inside and did not threaten. WISE RIVER RAY showed speed to the turn and gave way. I
DUB THEE was not a factor. SWERVY trailed, went widest in the drive and passed a tiring rival. CHICOTE ducked in and was steadied at the start to be off
slowly and failed to contend.

Footnotes
LOGAN'S LEOPARD pressed the pace two across, challenged on the turn, drew clear in the upper stretch and extended his lead under mild urging. PLUM
LUCKY was never far back, bid inside on the turn and earned place while no match for the winner. GIMME SOME SLACK broke out, raced mid pack, bid
five wide, closed steadily and got up for show. DAD'S A GAMBLER stalked the pace while racing inside, bid four wide, hung late and lost position. FATS
DOMINUS set a pressured pace to the second turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. SAMURAI JACK stalked the pace, went eight wide at the top
of the stretch, had little left for the drive and faded. KALEIDOSCOPE KID was in tight along the rail entering the first turn, raced evenly and did not threaten.
BIG IMPRESSION trailed the field, was eased late and walked off.
