Footnotes
ALPHADORA got engaged with AMOS right from the initial stages, was in path three sparring for control with that opponent, wrested away the advantage
coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, got turned loose spinning into the lane, opened up during the ensuing furlong, was still comfortably in the clear when
switched over to beong ridden out for the final seventy yards. AMOS hand urged for an abbreviated period from the gate to secure a prominent position,
gap-dueled with the winner from the two path, was being shaken off despite having called upon for more a sixteenth prior to the quarter pole, got sent
outward to the four path for the drive home, stayed for the place. FLATTERING EYES underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, shifted closer to the rail
stepping onto the head of the stretch, narrowly held third while proving no match. KEEPMYEYEONTHEBOYS hustled from the gate, failed to attain a
forward position, cut over to the inside route, took it for nearly three-quarters, was maneuvered into path six from upper to midlane, inched up, fell short of
snagging away show honors. DANCING SLIPPERS four wide entering the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, lacked the necessary response. GO
ZAPPEM angled sharply into the two path zeroing in on the half mile pole, kept watch on the front runners without making her presence felt, swung four
wide into the lane, had no offering and gave way.

Footnotes
VICTORY BOULEVARD disputed the pace two wide and from between opponents for a good portion of the journey on the backstretch, slid over onto the
inside after the half had been reeled off, raced as a team with the second place finisher, came under a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, with the pilot of the
nemesis yet sitting chilly, got put to the rest by that rival in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, staved off the challenger and edged away. INSIDE
RISK forwardly placed from the get-go, sparred with the winner from path two during the run around the bend, got cued up nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
failed to claim the top, had no difficulty salvaging second. STONE GUITAR argued for the top from along the inside route for just over a half, went four wide
into the lane, secured the show. SURPRISE VISIT contended for the lead from between rivals during the opening phases, was put to a drive taking up the
chase on the turn, stepped into the lane then was allowed to fade away while being protected.

Footnotes
PROVEN RESERVES brought up the back of the pack for the opening half, was sighted three wide and being feverishly ridden by the top of the turn, was
maneuvered into path six from upper to midlane, closed in, struck the front with approximately a sixteenth remaining and kicked clear. PROMO CODE
tracked the runaway leader from just off the inside route, closed the gap readily on that opponent after entering the turn, took over with ease a short distance
from the quarter pole, settled in upper stretch and was given his cue, held out until the sixteenth pole, then saved second after relinquishing. STARTING
POINT at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, raced three to four wide on the turn, was much like the winner, that is cutting into the deficit
once the half had been completed, got placed into a tighter fit in the four path at the head of the stretch, flattened out in the last eighth and had to settle for
the show. FAMILY BIZ chased the pace from the two path after being brushed from between rivals in the shadow of the starting gate, went into the stretch
and had no solid closing punch. AMERICAN RULE broke open gate after WALKOFF had done soon, was reloaded, proceeded to brush with its next stall
neighbor after coming out a bit at the start, recovered in short order and established the top, sailed along on an open lead stationed in the two path, gave in
when challenged late on the bend, steadily backed away down the stretch. OTHER THINGS EQUAL was under a ride in pursuit of the pacesetter four wide
on the turn, got sent out into path seven from upper to midlane, made no impact. WALKOFF broke through the gate but didn't run off, came away without
apparent mishap after being reloaded, underwent a ground-saving journey, travelled about the turn under a drive, arrived into the stretch and tired.

coming under pressure from the runner up and dueling with that rival through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home, dug in dueling through the length of the stretch and prevailed gamely at the end. WAYNES FOOTSTEPS coaxed from the start, raced five wide in
closest aim of the leader down the backstretch before tucking and advancing three wide through the turn to knock heads with the top one, got let out
spinning three wide for home, dug in dueling gamely through to the finish but was ultimately bested on the wire. OUR STORMIN NORMAN broke out at the
start bumping MANDATORY PAYOUT, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and kept on for the show honors. WILD BOAR lunged at the break, chased three then two wide under a ride
from three furlongs out, cornered three wide for home, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. IMPUNITY coaxed from the gate, chased four wide
down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn under a drive from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no

Footnotes
GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was coaxed along vying for the top towards the two path for the opening three-quarters, edged away from the competition late on
the bend, shifted into the three path when let out for the drive, arrived at the eighth pole with only one other posing a danger, was maneuvered over to the
rail during the next sixteenth, inducing PRIORITIZE to alter course to the outside himself, held on well enough long enough to prevail. PRIORITIZE cut over
to the inside route at the half mile pole, flashed interest when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, maintained the momentum coming into the lane, saw
the rider lose the whip in midstretch, altered course to the outside after the winner took up position on the rail itself with approximately a sixteenth remaining,
chopped away at the deficit, fell just short. SEETHISQUICK sparred for the top from path three matched up with the winner for six furlongs and gave way.
SEA FOAM a pace factor while four wide early, began to back away after the half had been rattled off, turned into the lane under a protective hold and was
allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
BECKY'S MISSION established the front and showed the way in hand four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive kept busy to the finish. TOKYO BAY four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch
and offered up late foot to secure the place honors in the late stages while never threatening the winner. HOPE I CAN five then four wide in pursuit, got set
down spinning five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest for the show honors.
SHES EUPHORIC chased three wide down the backstretch before taking the overland route through the turn five wide, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. HOLIDAY BELLE coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked
inside at the half mile pole, came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. REBEL EMPRESS five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn ridden along from three furlongs out, went four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
SHANTAY YOU STAY six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, chased three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths,
continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. EMPRESS LUCIANA coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under a ride at the
three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and faltered. PRETTY FABULOUS hustled from the start, chased four wide until tucked to the two path
half a mile from home, got placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and folded.
