saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SASSY SUSA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
finished inside and proved third best. MONEY SUNK lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. G G
HAS A SHOT raced in the back of the field, came around the first turn five wide, moved up, but was no factor. COOL SIS went to the front, drove clear,
moved to the rail and faded. SHE'S A SMART CAT brushed at the start, racing in the back and showed little. BERMUDA BRIDGE broke poorly, raced in the

Footnotes
FULKERSON raced within striking distance, came around the first turn four wide, made a steady gain and drove clear before the wire. THAT'S D 'CAT
lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, rallied down the stretch and finished willingly. INDIUM went to the front, drove clear and had nothing
left late. VALLEY OF THE HIDE void of early speed, made a late gain, but was no factor. RED WINED UP raced within contention and weakened. RIDE A
SAINT lacked early speed, moved up and finished evenly. FANCY THIS raced in the middle of the field, finished wide and faded. RUNAROUNDDANCING
pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. FLATTER THE QUEEN challenged for the early lead and dropped back. DRY WOOD CREEK raced
near the back and showed little.

GRACE OF DAVID pressed the pace, made a rail bid, dueling with PRINCESS GIANNA and PADDY O and was just up. PRINCESS GIANNA went to the
front, drove clear, dueled in a three way finish to the wire and was outfinished for the win. PADDY O drifted out around the first turn, raced within contention,
dueled to the wire and was outfinished by the top two. RIGHT ON BY void of early speed, made a late gain, but was no factor. MELODY ROSE lacked early
speed, moved up, racing outside around the second turn and finished evenly. MOONFIELD vied for the early lead, raced three wide around the final turn
and weakened. OUR DIAMOND raced near the back, drifted out around the first turn and was never close. BECCA'S WHISPER raced in the middle of the
field, saved ground around the second turn and faded. HARLANS WARRIOR raced near back, forced out around the first turn and was never a threat.

OH TOODLES vied for the early advantage, drove clear down the stretch and was kept to the task. ASHLEY ASTRAY raced within striking distance, came
around the turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide, rallied down the lane, couldn't catch the winner, but got up for second. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY lacked
early speed, made a late gain and was outfinished for place. TODAYISNOTTHEDAY dueled on the front end, saved ground and weakened. CUSTOM CUT
raced near the middle of the field and was never a factor. CALAJA raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and faded. ROSE RUNNER vied
for the early lead and was finished early. BIND ME UP always trailed the field and showed little.

of early speed, made a late bid and got up for the show position. CAP ROCK MINER dueled on the front end, saved ground and weakened. EXTON

Footnotes
REECE'S PRIORITY dueled for the early lead, took command around the turn, drove clear and won under urging. ONE PROUD BOY raced within
contention, made a late rail bid, couldn't catch REECE'S PRIORITY, but held on the second. LUVMEWHENIMGONE unhurried in the early part, moved up
four wide around the turn, made a late try and was outfinished for place. BIG BOSS MAN raced in the middle of the pack, moved up on the inside around
the turn, angled out sharply entering the stretch and finished evenly. BETTIN ON BRYAN broke out, racing in the back of the pack, was forced out and
bothered entering the stretch and proved no threat. GENTLEMAN CHARLIE dueled for the early lead and was finished early. ARTIES GAME broke poorly,
raced in the back and was never close. THE JOCKEY OF #7 BETTIN ON BRYAN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #3 BIG BOSS MAN FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #3 FROM FOURTH AND PLACED HIM
FIFTH.

MADISON'S WILD ONE raced on the front end, pulled away and proved much the best. PARTY WITH KASSIDY raced within striking distance, saved
ground around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. RUNPEGGYRUN challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout and lacked a late kick. SECRET JOY broke out, raced in the back, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no
factor. PEACH'S SWAN SONG raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and hung. OVERLY SWEET raced in the back of the pack in the beginning and
passed tired ones. TOSHITA FOREVER bumped start, raced evenly near the back and was never close. STONE CLASSIC broke in, dueled for the early
lead and stopped.
