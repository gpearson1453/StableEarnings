for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. DAFFYDILL gave chase and rounded the turn in the five path, dueled to a brief late lead but was
overcome nearing the wire. COOK THE BOOKS chased the pace from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the four path and finished evenly.
MARLEESBEEBEE rushed up for the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, widened through the turn but was caught in
later yards and flattened nearing the wire. OUT ONA LIMB gave chase toward the inside and rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride past the
sixteenth pole. MARYLEE gave chase from the outside and raced in the eight path of the turn. ADORABLEDEPLORABLE chased the pace through the

Footnotes
ONCE MORE EH angled in early and took the lead at the three quarter pole then rated the pace, was given rein leaving the seven sixteenths pole to deter
the runner-up through the backstretch, pulled clear of that one past the quarter pole and held well with steady encouragement. FLANAGAN was forced in
soon after the start then stalked three wide into the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the
far turn and had to settled for second best. AGENT BOND raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased to the outside into the backstretch,
bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path but drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little more. EXPLOITATION raced
with the early pace inside then stalked into the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded toward the far turn. RADCLIFFE ROYALE
raced in the five path the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, maintained the five path through the far turn and showed nothing more in the
lane. BYEGONE DAYS raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn and was not a factor. PLEASANTLY ROYAL showed little response through the
backstretch. COCONUT MAN raced in the six path the first turn, showed no response leaving the turn and was not encouraged while galloping wide.

Footnotes
GOODBYESEEULATER raced boxed in through the opening turn then rated off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid and came between horses leaving
the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the stretch then dug in through the lane to get up past the sixteenth pole and held on
under steady encouragement. GREELY IS BACK rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, maintained the four path through the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was outfinished the final sixteenth. GLEN'S CASTLE raced well off the
pace in the three and four paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path, moved to the outside in the upper stretch and
just got up for third. COURTLY KITTY saved ground well off the pace, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out in the
upper stretch and was outfinished the final sixteenth. KINGDOM MINDED rated close toward the inside and took the lead at the three eighths pole, was
pressured from that point to widen on the far turn, but gave up the lead mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. EMBLEM'S ESTATE saved
ground racing well back, showed only mild response through the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened from the sixteenth pole.
HOSWAY engaged in close chase through the front stretch then rounded the opening turn in the three path and faded on the far turn. HOWYAFORMONEY
drifted into the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch and never factored. LETS DANCE JACK set the early pace inside but was caught at the three
eighths pole and faded readily.
