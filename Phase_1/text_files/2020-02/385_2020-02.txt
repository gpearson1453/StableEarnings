Footnotes
HARPER GO LUCKY broke slowly, advanced inside after a quarter-mile, moved out looking for room near the three-sixteenths but was hemmed in behind
the leaders in the three-path, altered course to the rail in upper stretch, and drove clear after getting through inside CAT GONE QUICK entering the final
furlong. CAPITAN FOFO tracked inside early, shifted out three wide lodging a bid and keeping HARPER GO LUCKY from getting out at the top of the
stretch, ran on with good courage and was second best. CAT GONE QUICK set a pressured pace in the two-path, and weakened between horses past the
eighth-pole. ROMARIO vied for command outside CAT GONE QUICK around the turn, and gave way a furlong out. TOOK A CAB raced three wide in range
to the stretch, and finished evenly without threatening. PURECRAZIDUDE was no factor inside. GRAN HOMBRE raced four then five wide around the turn,
and had no late response. PROUD COUNTRY was in the second flight throughout and made no impact. LAST JET OUT was always outrun. ELECTRIC
HEAT ducked out at the start, lost contact with the field early, eventually crossed the finish and walked off.

Footnotes
LA CHAUFFEUR quickly cleared on top then led the way two wide down the backstretch, widened advantage still unleashed around the turn, remained
unchallenged still in hand upper stretch then finished ridden out in final sixteenth. WEEKEND MADNESS raced four to five wide off the early pace, prompted
and gained position entering the turn, remained in steady pursuit through the lane and cleared second best. TRULY tracked the pace racing between foes
down the backstretch, hustled up along the outside around the far turn, kept on six to seven wide in stretch run and prevailed for a share. UPSY DAISY DO
was not far off the early pace racing a couple paths off the inside, launched a bid entering the turn, briefly gained position nearing the five sixteenths pole
then flattened out. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED was the closest pursuer of the clear leader down the backstretch then failed to keep pace and faded around
the turn. COMMISSION showed response in the opening quarter then dropped to last, saved ground around the turn and had no late response. LONG
STORY SHORT showed response in early stages then quickly retreated entering the turn, eased up before the wire then walked off.

Footnotes
DESCENTE tracked the battling leaders three wide on the turn, ranged up to challenge outside LAPIS STORM after six furlongs, took over through upper
stretch and was driving to the finish. A SONG FOR SUE began to advance inside after a half-mile, moved out three wide for the drive, and finished well to
be inching closer outside the winner. LAPIS STORM bumped with CALAIS COVE at the start, moved through to vie for command inside CHIQUI THE
GRAY midway up the backstretch, got the best of that dispute and edged away nearing the quarter-pole, could not handle DESCENTE after straightening
away and weakened on the rail. CHIQUI THE GRAY sprinted clear leaving the chute, was joined from inside by LAPIS STORM through the middle stages,
and began to fade past the five-sixteenths. HILL VALLEY faded steadily three wide after a half-mile. HILLTOP HARMONY was hustled along from the gate
but outsprinted for position, stayed in range into the turn, and drifted wide while dropping back approaching the stretch. CALAIS COVE bumped with LAPIS
STORM at the start, dropped back to trail after a quarter-mile and could not keep up into the lane.

Footnotes
JUST SMOK'N held a slim lead under pressure in opening stages then vied inside a duo around the turn, continued to match strides along the inside of
GOTTA GO MO into stretch run, dueled gamely along the rail and refused to be denied. GOTTA GO MO raced up close off the top pair in opening stages,
moved up three wide to match strides for the lead mid-way around the turn, continued to battle on racing outside path of JUST SMOK'N in stretch run, put in
a good run but could not get by the winner. LET THEM EAT CAKE was unhurried at the start then picked up the pace and raced under a drive two wide
entering top stretch, remained in steady pursuit through the lane and cleared the rest. MUDSLIDE WICKED broke on top then raced just off the early leader,
vied two wide between foes around the turn then came up empty in the lane. TAPITLIKEITSHOT raced in the back and saved ground, moved into upper
stretch four wide and failed to move into contention. POWER OF MAGIC was away last then hustled along five wide through opening stages, raced six wide
entering the lane and had no late response. AMBER SKY raced in range, chased the top trio around the turn then drifted out turning for home and dropped
back.

Footnotes
LUXURY SUITE raced three wide well back to the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly outside and caught LANSE MITAN past the 70-yard marker to win
going away. LANSE MITAN went up to take over from CAPTURED BY FATE up the backstretch, dueled inside that rival from the three-eighths to the
furlong grounds, and held on well along the rail. CAPTURED BY FATE led early but deferred to LANSE MITAN, re-engaged from the outside approaching
the three-eighths, battled to mid stretch and weakened late. HEALY'S HOPE brushed with CHINOMADITO at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile three
wide, had the rider lose the whip when it was knocked out of his left hand by the rider of CHINOMADITO in upper stretch, and went by tired horses while not
a threat. I KICKN was a bit difficult loading, steadied behind LA VIEXA and was forced out a stride from the gate, moved up heading into the turn toward the
inside, but flattened out after a half-mile. CHINOMADITO brushed with HEALY'S HOPE at the start, had the two-path on the turn and failed to menace.
SOUL REFLECTION raced two wide most of the way and did not factor. LA VIEXA broke out impeding I KICKN at the start, but otherwise made no impact
far behind. BOMOSEEN was in range early, faltered suddenly and drifted very wide through the latter part of the turn, and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
SAINT LARNED broke on top and quickly established a clear lead, set the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, continued the clear leader around
the turn then drifted out entering top stretch, roused right handed, switched in a few paths, drew off then finished geared down. SHE LOVE ME was
unhurried and raced near the inside in the last flight to the far turn, picked up the pace then shifted out upper stretch and finished clearly second best. OLD
DOMINION was the closest pursuer of the clear leader down the backstretch, prompted two wide around the far turn then flattened and raced along for
show. THATS ALL HE WROTE tracked four wide through early stages, hustled up for response around the far turn then emptied out in the lane. STAY
AGAIN settled off the early pace and saved ground down the backstretch, angled off the inside and prompted around the turn but failed to move on then
steadily faded, collapsed after the race and vanned off. MIRIAM'S SKY raced in the last flight then wide into the lane and failed to reach contention. ROYAL
COUP was not far back through early stages then retreated near three eighths pole.

Footnotes
ARRIVEDERLA broke in at the start to no ill effect, tracked outside the early leaders, took over four then three wide late on the turn, and drove well clear
through the lane while shifting inward a bit. NACHO PAPA bobbled, recovered inward bumping with SIGHTED and was clipped behind by FULGENCIO in
an eventful start, advanced five then four wide issuing a bid nearing the quarter-pole, and ran on with good courage second best. VERY AMUSING went
into the turn close behind the leaders, awaited room past the quarter-pole and through upper stretch, tipped out for clearance through the furlong grounds
and lacked a late kick on the wrong lead. GRAN CAUSEWAY vied for command slightly removed from the rail inside FRANK ALONE, weakened turning for
home and faded through the last eighth of a mile. FRANK ALONE battled up front outside GRAN CAUSEWAY for a half-mile, and faded through the drive.
BEAU TRACE raced in striking range two then three wide for a half-mile, steadied behind a wall of horses at the three-sixteenths and dropped back.
RATTLE'M was in the second flight from the start, came six wide off the turn and made no headway. SIGHTED broke out and bumped with NACHO PAPA
at the start, dropped back around the turn and continued to fade widest in the lane. FULGENCIO stumbled at the start, then was shut off and clipped heels
behind NACHO PAPA nearly unseating the rider, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ROYAL FLAG raced five wide entering the first turn then switched in a couple paths and placed forwardly behind the leader, continued as a sharp factor
sitting just off VIOLENT TRICK then began inching up on rival leaving the backstretch, matched strides for the lead mid-way around the turn, prompted and
cleared on top at the quarter pole, roused right handed entering top stretch then shown the whip, responded sharply, drew off to a commanding lead then
kept to task while ridden out. VIOLENT TRICK broke through the gate but did not get away then broke readily and established the early lead, set the pace
along the inside with ROYAL FLAG racing in close range, challenged by rival entering the far turn and vied for the lead, failed to move on with eventual
winner near the quarter pole but stayed on with response through the lane and cleared second best. REMARKABLE SOUL raced four wide entering the first
turn then tracked the top two leaders through early stages, launched a bid in three path moving through the turn, was under a drive at the quarter pole but
could not reach the top pair then kept under a ride five wide in the lane and prevailed for a share. BO'S IMAGE steadied entering the first turn, settled off the
pace in early backstretch then was ridden along going by the half mile marker, coaxed along the inside around the turn and into stretch but lacked the
needed response for impact. BIG TINA raced a couple paths off the inside and tracked the pace to the far turn, given cue to head in pursuit near three
eighths pole but weakened then played no part in late stages. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN was unhurried and raced in the back, launched a bid and briefly
gaining position around the far turn but failed to continue bid into the lane. ASSUME CONTROL raced off the second flight through middle stages then had
no response when called upon and retreated.

LAST JUDGMENT was last to begin, moved off the inside getting coaxed along approaching the turn, began to pick up rivals four wide past the
five-sixteenths, rallied steadily through the stretch and drew clear late under a mild drive. RUNNING FOR RIZ sped to the front at the start, vied inside
COOL ARROW and MOONOVERSEBA around the turn, got headed a furlong out and was back to third 70 yards out, but battled back gamely on the rail to
get the place prize. MOONOVERSEBA pressed the pace three wide, poked a head in front through the furlong grounds, could not handle the winner and
weakened on the wrong lead to give up second at the wire. MALIBU MAX was outrun for a half-mile toward the inside, had the two-path into the lane and
improved position while not a threat. COOL ARROW vied up front between horses around the turn, and faded through the drive. WHERE PARADISE LAY
steadied along in tight between horses from the five-eighths to the half-mile pole, and was empty in the three-path turning for home. FORTUNE'S FOOL
raced up close inside early, but dropped back through the turn. MAGIC TAPIT steadied early, moved out five wide approaching the stretch unable to gain,
and was allowed to fade away through the lane.
