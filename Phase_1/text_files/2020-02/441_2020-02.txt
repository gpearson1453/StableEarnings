Footnotes
MISS MY MACHO saved ground within range of the leaders for a half-mile, came off the rail to the three-path getting her cue a quarter-mile out, rallied
steadily outside CAT'S J N J and wore that rival down in the closing strides. CAT'S J N J tracked from easy striking position for six furlongs, moved off the
inside to challenge outside LA FLAMENCA turning for home, wrested command and edged clear entering the final furlong, drifted out as the rider switched
left-handed near the sixteenth-pole, and could not hang on. LA FLAMENCA vied for the lead inside BUST OUT LADY, put that one away around the far
turn, could not match strides with CAT'S J N J in upper stretch and weakened on the rail. POSITIVE POWER was outrun early, remained well back five wide
around the far turn, and moved in through the drive going by tired horses. DAMA DE NOCHE did not factor while two wide on the turns.
CALLMESENORITA advanced mildly inside after six furlongs, but flattened out. LOVELY LEE trailed for six furlongs, and improved position without
threatening. DUTCHY DAME faded three then four wide after completing six furlongs. DEBBIES UTUBE DIVA was slow from the gate and went along in the
second flight throughout. EMILIA STRONG was four wide on the first turn, and retired early. BUST OUT LADY alternated for the lead outside LA
FLAMENCA to the far turn, and faltered.

Footnotes
ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA got brushed just after the start then quickly moved up the inside to challenge TWO CENTS WORTH for the early lead, raced just
off rival while under steady urging around the turn, remained game in pursuit, wrested a narrow advantage at the furlong marker then drew clear under
steady pressure. TWO CENTS WORTH broke alertly, cleared and crossed closer to the inside, quickly came under attack from rail running
ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA, held the edge over rival around the turn, battled back into stretch run then failed to match with winner in late stages and just lasted
for place. MARCHING IN hustled up the inside early on then angled out around the turn, kept on five wide with response in the lane and narrowly missed
place. FOXY LADY raced off the top pair in the opening quarter, continued to chase the pace racing two wide around the turn, shifted out wider top stretch
and continued a mild bid. DONDER 'N BLITZEN lacked early kick and raced in the back, hustled along around the turn, moved to the inside of shifting out
FOXY LADY top stretch and lacked the needed response for late impact. MAGICGIRL raced in range through early going, continued forwardly placed off the
top pair around the turn then flattened out in the lane. ANOTHERSONGNDANCE raced outside off the early speed, entered the turn four wide and prompted
into top stretch, raced widest in the lane and lacked a needed rally. TANGLED TALE got bumped just after the start, raced two to three wide not too far off
the pace in the backstretch then emptied out in the turn.

Footnotes
JUAN BOLY was unhurried for six furlongs within range, moved off the rail to the three-path after six furlongs, rallied outside through the drive and drew
clear through the last 70 yards. MUHLENBERG broke slowly and was well out of it early two wide, moved inside around the far turn, stayed on the rail
through the lane and finished with good courage. SHANGASSAH settled in the middle of the field early inside, swung four wide coming off the far turn and
rallied outside. PLAN OF ATTACK was four wide on the first turn near the back, crept closer in the two-path through the far turn, stalled in heavy traffic
through the furlong grounds and finished evenly when clear. FAYEZ raced three wide early, tracked the leaders through the middle stages, waited for room
approaching the stretch, encountered some traffic into the lane and lacked a solid bid between foes. ELITE MISSION was four wide early, advanced to
issue a bid three wide around the far turn, dueled outside RINGLE BELLE into the stretch, but weakened late. RINGLE BELLE vied for command inside
early, shook off DRY LAND getting clear on the far turn, dueled inside ELITE MISSION into the stretch, and gave way in the final furlong. DRY LAND vied
outside RINGLE BELLE for five furlongs, then steadied while in the process of giving way approaching the stretch. PRIZED WARRIOR was two wide early,
and could not gain three wide on the far turn. CAB BEEF was always outrun. SILENT MISCHIEF saw all the heels throughout.

Footnotes
BLUE CHICORY raced in range off the top trio in early stages then launched a four-wide bid around the turn, set down five wide for the drive, stayed game
in pursuit and kicked by the tiring leader deep stretch. BELLEVILLE SPRING was off to a decent start and moved advanced three wide entering the turn,
held a clear advantages still unleashed at five-sixteenths pole, prompted turning for home and held clear a furlong out then began tiring under pressure and
got outkicked for the win. FREE FLAYME bumped with foe at the start then held a slim lead through early stages, briefly vied inside a duo at three-eighths
pole then failed to move on for the lead but stayed on with response near the inside down the lane and secured share. CONGRATS THIS raced off the early
speed and saved ground, was put to a drive two to three wide upper stretch and had a mild improve. STARSHIP TAXI bumped with foe at the start the was
forwardly placed racing just off the leader, briefly matched strides at three-eighths pole then failed to move on for the lead, stayed on in range upper stretch
then flattened out. SNORING BARTH lacked speed and raced widest through the backstretch, moved into top stretch six paths wide and lacked a needed
rally. STRIKE PLAY was not far back in the opening quarter then faltered through out.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE TINA kept tabs on the breakaway leader through the first half-mile, closed in around the far turn, took over meeting little resistance at the
top of the stretch, drew clear through the furlong grounds and was all out to keep CHAMPAGNE HORIZON at bay late. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON went
along in the second flight for six furlongs, swung five wide into the lane and was closing in late outside. AUGUSTA MOON saved ground well back for a half,
made up some ground moving off the rail near the quarter-pole, rallied into second late in the two-path but was outkicked for that spot. MIKE'S GIRL
advanced to contention toward the inside after a half-mile, but was outfinished between horses. TOOTSIE lagged well back early inside, swung four wide
turning for home but had no serious response. BLAME THE GODS was never involved in the proceedings. FAIRY LINK was far back early inside, angled
widest for the drive and had no bids. ROSA STAR raced two to three wide on the turns, and faded through the stretch. SHE'S PRIMO set an ambitious pace
removed from the rail to the far turn, and gave way once collared by the eventual winner. LOVE DADDY was slow to begin and never a factor.

Footnotes
LADY KATE raced under slight restraint exiting the chute then advanced after the opening quarter to be forwardly positioned off the leader, let out a notch
and advanced to match strides for the lead with CUDDLE KITTEN nearing the quarter pole, continued to battle for the lead into stretch then shook free near
the furlong marker and kept clear under steady pressure. BOLD SCRIPT was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued to rate off the early pace,
edged a bit closer near the half mile marker then headed in pursuit entering the turn, was ridden along and raced in close contention off the top pair at the
quarter pole, stayed on with response in the lane and prevailed for place. BELLA CIAO raced in tracking mode near the inside through early stages, failed to
advance position under pressure around the turn then shifted out top stretch, raced widest in the lane and got up late for a share. CUDDLE KITTEN held a
length lead on top down the backstretch, vied for the top spot with LADY KATE nearing the quarter pole, continued to battle back upper stretch then failed to
match with the winner at the eighth pole and gave way. KNARSDALE raced in range and tracked the pace down the backstretch then gave way around the
turn.

Footnotes
ARMCHAIR JOCKEY bumped with BOLD PAYNTER at the start, advanced four wide after six furlongs, rallied steadily through the stretch, overhauled
JOYFUL HEART and edged clear late. JOYFUL HEART vied outside SPEED EFFECT early, moved clear showing the way up the backstretch and around
the far turn, remained in command through the furlong grounds, could not hold off the winner and just saved the place. WILLING TO SPEED got shuffled
back a bit heading to the far turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied outside. BOLD PAYNTER bumped with ARMCHAIR JOCKEY at
the start, lodged a mild bid between horses in the three-path leaving the quarter-pole, but flattened out. DERMOT saved ground to the far turn, moved out
through the drive and gained some ground without threatening. TY RAN A HOMER trailed for six furlongs, angled widest into the lane and improved without
menacing. TANGLED WEB prompted the pace outside, could not gain appreciably on the leader under pressure after six furlongs, and steadied while
weakening past the quarter-pole. BURLY BOY was not a factor three wide. SPEED EFFECT vied early inside JOYFUL HEART, deferred to that one before
completing a quarter-mile, and stayed close for six furlongs before faltering.

Footnotes
LADY GRACE entered the turn in range between horses, moved in cutting the corner at the top of the stretch, found a seam between the leaders a furlong
from home, blew past TIZ RED WINE and drew away ridden out. O'MALLEY bumped with MISS BEHAVE at the start, raced three wide around the turn, and
finished well outside. NO WAY JOSE (IRE) lagged well back two wide for three-eighths of a mile, shifted widest in the lane and rallied for a share. SPIN
CONTROL saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail a sixteenth out and finished with interest. DREAMS ARE MADE raced three wide to the lane, and
lacked the needed late kick. TIZ RED WINE dashed clear early, had no answer for the winner past the eighth-pole and steadily gave way on the fence.
MAGIC FAIRY saved ground to no avail. MISS BEHAVE hit the left side of the gate and bumped with O'MALLEY at the start, and was through early. TAP
TAP TAPAROO chased outside TIZ RED WINE to the stretch, and faltered through the last furlong.

Footnotes
BALLAGH ROCKS was off a step slow at the start then raced near mid-range around the first turn, advanced early backstretch and raced in stalking position
behind the leader, let out a notch and moved up to take a slight edge late far turn, dueled with MONARCHS GLEN entering top stretch, battle on holding a
slight edge over rival with a furlong left to run, dug in gamely under strong handling and nipped foe for the win. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) raced in the back
around the first turn then advanced after entering the backstretch and moved into range, tracked the pace to the far turn then headed in pursuit, moved up
and raced in aim for the lead near the quarter pole, dueled with BALLAGH ROCKS entering top stretch, fought back with game response, refused to given
in, battled noses apart in final strides and got nipped for victory. MARAUD secured inside position and stalked the pace to the far turn, hustled up near the
inside then shifted out five wide top of the lane, kept on with response and was inching up on top pair in final strides. GOLDEN DRAGON raced off the pace
down the backstretch, continued near the rear around the far turn, moved into top stretch four wide and given cue, responded and moved up close range but
lacked the needed surge for victory. GUNNISON was unhurried and raced outside through early stages, launched an outside bid around the far turn then
fanned wide into top stretch and improved position without seriously threatening. MUSICAL HEART raced in the back and saved ground, swung out wide
entering the top stretch, stayed wide and showed interest in final stages. PROFITEER rated and saved ground down the backstretch, hustled up along the
rail entering the far turn then shifted out a path, continued in range at the furlong marker then flattened out. SALUTE WITH HONOR tugged a bit around the
first turn then edged back from between foes in early backstretch, settled off the early pace then hustled along on the far turn, steadied nearing the quarter
pole then raced inside to two wide and failed to move on. PROJECTED (GB) settled in early stages not too far off the early pace, showed brief response
when prompted on the far turn then gave way. WAR GIANT held a clear lead around the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, got collared by winner
late far turn then tired in the drive.
