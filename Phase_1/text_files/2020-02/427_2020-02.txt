and gamely prevailed under urging. ARCH ABILITY had good early speed and dueled between horses then briefly outside a rival midway on the
backstretch, battled between foes into and on the turn, took a short lead off the rail leaving the turn, fought back just off the fence in the stretch, brushed
then bumped with the winner in the final furlong and went on willingly to the end. OUTRIGHT stalked outside a rival, came out leaving the turn and four wide
into the stretch and gained the show. SHANGHAI CURLY broke in a bit, stalked inside then a bit off the rail on the turn, came out leaving the turn and into
the stretch and lacked the needed rally. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR bobbled slightly at the start, had good early speed and dueled inside, dropped back
leaving the turn and into the stretch and weakened, then was not persevered with in the final furlong.

back into the stretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong but clearly bested the others. ENGRAM stalked outside a rival then off the rail on the
second turn, came out into the stretch and bested the others. ORIGINAL INTENT broke in and a bit slowly, saved ground off the pace, split horses into the
stretch and lacked a rally. BIRD a step slow to begin, angled in and settled outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and did not rally.

Footnotes
RED LARK (IRE) angled in and chased a bit off the rail then outside a rival on the backstretch, went three deep into and on the second turn and four wide
into the stretch, rallied to bid between horses under urging in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. LADY TIMMY HO (IRE) saved ground chasing the pace,
came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch, rallied to bid three wide in deep stretch and continued willingly to just miss. SWEET DEVIL
stalked three deep then outside a rival, bid three wide into and on the second turn to put a head in front into the stretch, inched away in midstretch, fought
back off the rail in deep stretch and was edged late. NOBLE HEARTED saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, was between horses past
midstretch, drifted out some late and lacked the necessary late kick. UNDISTURBED stalked a bit off the rail or outside a rival, bid between horses into and
on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HONOR HOP pulled between horses to stalk the early pace, continued a bit off
the rail on the backstretch and between rivals on the second turn, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. NU PI LAMBDA sped to the early
lead, inched away and set the pace inside, fought back into and on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PROFITEROLE
(FR) had a shoe repaired before the start, broke out a bit, angled in and saved ground off the pace, dropped back on the second turn and had little left for
the drive.
