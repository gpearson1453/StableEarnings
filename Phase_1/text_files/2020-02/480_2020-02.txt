Footnotes
ALWAYSMINING was sent from the gate and took command into the first turn, set the pace towards the rail and under a light hold, took sterner pressure
from MONONGAHELA entering the far turn, opened up from rivals as those two got into a match race leaving the three eighths, was headed in upper
stretch, kept on under stout left handed rousing, regained the lead leaving the sixteenth marker and proved resolute from there. MONONGAHELA prompted
the pace outside the winner, moved alongside leaving the far turn, dueled and gained a slim lead in upper stretch, maintained the advantage past the
furlong grounds, continued gamely but wasn't quite good enough. SOMEDAY JONES tracked towards the inside, angled out under a drive and saw the
leaders get away past the five sixteenths, churned on through the final furlong and slowly gained. FOREWARNED stalked outside a rival, was put to a
hearty ride departing the far turn, chased and came up empty. BONUS POINTS rated towards the inside early on, was under asking around the final turn
but failed to generate a solid kick.

NAUGHTY THOUGHTS showed speed outside MISS MARISSA down the backstretch, sprinted clear entering the turn, set the pace in the two path, was
put to a drive in upper stretch and eagerly drew off. PRINCESS CADEY , well placed early, circled the turn four wide and rallied. SHE'SMYSUNSHINE
came in bumping BELLA AURORA when stumbling at the break, saved ground around the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and had a mild
rally between horses. MISS MARISSA showed speed along the inner rail, angled out leaving the backstretch, chased the pace three wide around the turn
and gave way in the drive. BELLA AURORA , bumped leaving the starting gate, race three wide between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper
stretch
and
failed

Footnotes
LEBDA accelerated to the inside of rivals and went clear leaving the chute, set the pace towards the rail, opened up after being put to a drive in upper
stretch, kept on under steady hand encouragement through the final sixteenth and lasted. MINE NOT MINE drafted well off the early pace, picked up some
momentum towards the inside mid turn, angled four wide into the lane, worked between foes soon after, closed well under solid handling but just couldn't
quite reel in the winner. ROMANOFF , four deep nearing the five eighths pole, moved up to the outside of a rival mid turn, shifted in for the drive and kept
trying to the line. AMEN CORNER , unhurried early, commenced a run past the three eighths, was fanned six to seven wide entering the lane and continued
on with interest. DREAMS UNTOLD , a bit unruly behind the gate, stumbled badly at the break then was a bit rank before recovering, made a bold move
towards the inside leaving the far turn, angled out and continued progress four wide to have aim on the winner nearing the lane, failed to sustain under stout
left handed asking past the three sixteenths then wilted. NEW COMMISSION , inside foes early on, chased around the turn, drifted five wide into the lane
and faded. BERNIE'S ON FIRE , four wide between runner giving early pursuit, shifted in some to chase to the inside of ROMANOFF mid turn, stayed on to
upper stretch then faltered. ALBERT PARK gave early chase three wide, faltered around the turn and was eased in the drive.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC REASON stalked the pace two wide around the turn, swung out approaching the eighth pole, was under brisk urging, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole then drove clear. VICTIM OF LOVE disputed the pace outside BLUE EYED GIRL, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, finished willingly but
was no match for the winner late. ANNA'S BANDIT lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, angled off the rail in upper stretch and had a slight rally
between horses. NEEDS SUPERVISION chased the pace three wide around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. BLUE EYED GIRL
bumped SAGUARO ROW when coming in at the break, sped to the lead, hugged the rail, disputed the pace and gave way the final furlong. SAGUARO
ROW , bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, was carried out entering the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FIRENZE FIRE was nudged clear early, allowed a pair of rivals to go past from his inside leaving the five eighths pole, relaxed and tracked a contested pace
three deep, moved to command approaching the stretch then was guided five wide, kicked clear after being roused past the three sixteenths, opened up
under some firmer hand urging in mid stretch then was geared down through the final yards. THREES OVER DEUCES flashed speed then was eased back
off the rivals near the five eighths marker, edged up between runners mid turn, worked his way through in mid stretch and finished gamely to earn the place.
STILL HAVING FUN rated behind rivals mid turn, angled six to seven wide for the drive, moved up outside rivals in mid stretch, stayed on his left lead and
was out finished for the place. LONE ROCK , towards the inside, reached a stalking spot nearing the turn, awaited some room near the quarter pole, eased
out in mid stretch and finished with some interest. TIZ HE THE ONE lost ground four wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths and came up empty
in the drive. FACTOR IT IN edged up inside a pair of foes nearing the five eighths and entertained the pace, gained a slim lead after a half mile, continued to
contest the pace to upper stretch then faded in the final furlong. HONOR THE FLEET put a head in front while between runners near the five eighths
marker, disputed the issue outside FACTOR IT IN, was caught between rivals battling past the quarter pole then tired in the final three sixteenths.

Footnotes
STROLL SMOKIN , off last, was sent to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and was under urging late. ABSOLVED bobbled at the break, raced
four deep around the turn, drifted in near the eighth pole and rallied along the rail. SEANY P showed speed along the rail, was rated back leaving the
backstretch, raced between horses leaving the turn and faded. HERO'S HOPE , outrun, hugged the inner rail in the stretch, failed to be a factor and
returned bleeding. GOLDEN SURGE bobbled at the break, was forwardly placed in the three path between horses on the turn, checked in tight quarters
entering the stretch then lugged in near the three sixteenths pole. MAJOR FLIRT hugged the inner rail on the turn, pulled up when going lame in upper
stretch and was euthanized. An objection by the rider of GOLDEN SURGE against ABSOLVED for alleged interference near the quarter pole was not
allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run into the stretch but no action was taken.
