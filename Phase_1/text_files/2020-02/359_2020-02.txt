just missed. HONOR SYSTEM was reserved just off the leaders early, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole, remained close up, angled out slightly into
the stretch, steadied from winner drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. WATCH CAIRO broke sharply to set a pressured
pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied and gave way through the final furlong. TRUST MANDO
chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. THE RIDER OF HONOR SYSTEM LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST

PERCY FAWCETT was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with PORT AGGREGATE while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing
the half, responded when engaged by JIMBO'S BIZ nearing the quarter, vied with that rival, dropped off the foe nearing the sixteenth pole, responded to
steady urging and was up in the closing yards. JIMBO'S BIZ was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter,
vied with the winner into the sixteenth marker, edged away but could not resist that foe late. NETELA lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second
turn and finished with good late energy. ON THE RIGHT raced four-wide through both turn, settled off the leaders early, reached a contending position into
the stretch but lacked the needed closing response. MINER'S NOTION was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gave
way. VICTORY LANE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SPONSOR lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the second turn, did not reach contention and was vanned off. PORT AGGREGATE dueled for the lead with the winner from off the rail and

Footnotes
SILVER SECRET R F was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with RUNAWAY REGENT while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into
deep stretch and held HAPPY RESOURCES safe late. HAPPY RESOURCES was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn,
finished with good energy but could not get by the winner. RUNAWAY REGENT broke sharply to dispute the early lead with the winner, vied with that rival
and gave way grudgingly through the final furlong. SOLID GOLD BAR was reserved just off the leaders early, lacked racing room into the stretch and failed
to gain in the drive. TARGARYCAT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. RADICAL ERUPTION lacked
early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE GHOST OF DIXIE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did
not menace. SEND THE STORM showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not offer a bid. INSOMNIA raced off the pacesetters early,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
JEDI WARRIOR settled off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, vied with MOVE IT
MISTER and drew off through the final sixteenth. MOVE IT MISTER pressed the pace of WILDCAT LAUGH while racing three-wide, moved up to maintain a
pressured pace nearing the three-quarter pole, responded when challenged by the winner approaching the stretch but could not match strides with that rival
late. AIR PATROL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
finished evenly late. RITZY RACER was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter and gave way
through the final furlong. SOUND PUNCH raced five-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. MALUSITA'S HOME raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. WILDCAT LAUGH set a pressured
pace for a half and weakened. WISHFUL SLIM was squeezed back at the start, bobbled, lagged far back and did not reach contention. WAR PAINT BRAVE
lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE START
FOR WISHFUL SLIM AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED HE BROKE A STEP SLOW AND CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS.
