Footnotes
SALSITA ROJA set the pace in four path, drew clear on the turn and continued to draw off. NANCY B chased while outside second flight and was no match.
REIGNING FIRE, in the four path, wasn't a serious threat. HAILEY'S WAY, outrun early, swung out on the turn and was no factor. CONGAREE ROSE, just
off the rail in second flight, fell back leaving the turn and was not persevered with through the final sixteenth. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE, wide, was never a
factor. SWEET LILLY FACTUM, two wide, never threatened. FORTRESSA saved ground and tired.

FLASHNDYNAMITE, just off the rail and just off the pace, moved out four wide on the final turn, took the lead entering the stretch, opened a long lead with a
furlong to run then was under pressure to preserve the win. UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE, outrun early, rallied very wide on the final turn and into stretch and
was gaining. MIDNIGHT BOUNTY raced wide while unhurried, rallied inside winner through stretch but failed to sustain her bid. LORDEN'S LOVE prompted
the early pace two wide then tired. RED WAGON, in the four path, came up empty. CHEVY TO THE LEVY racing three wide, loomed near stretch then gave
way. GATOR GIRL set the pace just off the rail and had little left. FIDUCIARY VALUES, racing outside winner early, tired.

Footnotes
ARCH CAT broke slowly then was steered out to the five path, raced extremely wide on the final turn and into stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole,
drifted wider under left handed pressure in deep stretch and held on. FLASHY KYEM raced wide, challenged deep stretch but was outfinished. POPIZAR
broke slowly, raced between rivals early, angled out very wide in early stretchy, steadied off heels in deep stretch. IT'S GOOD TO BE US saved ground,
moved out three wide, challenged deep stretch but flattened out late. VISIONARY RULER saved ground and failed to menace. ALL STAR RED, never far
back while between foes, faded. WILD CARAMELO set the pace just off the rail, widened near mid stretch then faltered. MASONS TURN, outside winner
early, drifted out through stretch and was never a threat. FIX ME A SANDWICH prompted the pace from the outside then stopped. Following a claim of foul
by the rider of POPIZER, ARCH CAT was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
PRINTER tracked close up along the inside, came through on the rail to challenge at the half mile marker, took over entering the far turn, drew clear under
urging and held well for the win. GENERAL BELLAMY raced four wide early, settled off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the
lane and rallied outside for second. CHAMPAGNE CHUCK stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and got third. MIDNIGHT
HARBOR raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn and closed late near the inside. ZIPPED CODE raced five wide early, settled three wide off the
pace, came six wide into the lane and closed belatedly outside. BELLY DANCER raced off the pace between rivals and lacked a rally. SECRET SECRET
vied two wide for the early lead, dueled three wide on the far turn and tired. THE MONEY TRAIN vied inside for the lead, then dueled, steadied entering the
far turn and faded. FLEET FIRST did not factor. MY PIRATE bobbled at the break and was off last, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. CLOWNEY
stalked between rivals, then chased between foes and gave way.
