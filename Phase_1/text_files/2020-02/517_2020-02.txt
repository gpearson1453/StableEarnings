Footnotes
KNOKKE BY THE SEA raced four wide entering the first turn, then stalked outside a rival, tracked the leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, took over in
upper stretch and drew away under urging. BRIDLECREST vied two wide for the lead, dueled with MARNESIA ONE STEP into the far turn, dug in gamely
entering the stretch, was no match for the winner and stayed on well to earn the place spot. LITTLE TOWN BLUES stumbled at the start, raced three wide
early, then tracked along the inside, chased on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. MARNESIA ONE STEP vied inside for the lead, dueled on the
backside and into the far turn, then weakened. ASBURY AVE raced off the pace inside, was asked on the far turn and failed to rally. SHILOH LANE raced
two wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
IZA ONE moved up between foes, went three wide into stretch, stuck her head in front near furlong grounds and was all out to hang on. TIZ A TRIBUTE
broke sharply. stalked the pace in the four path, remained off the the rail and fought gamely to wire. PABLO'S DREAM set the pace two wide and held on
tenaciously. TAYLOR'S BELLE broke slowly, saved ground and was too late. JUST A DREAM, three wide and just off the pace, had no rally. GRAVEYARD
SHIFT, two wide, never threatened and was ridden back to the paddock lame and vanned off. SEPTEMBER BREEZE was widest of all stalking the early
pace then tired. PASCHA PASCHA, very wide, showed nothing.

Footnotes
YOU TELL ME didn't break sharply, raced between foes on backstretch into the far turn, was gradually eased to the outside, circled into stretch, took the
lead leaving furlong grounds and slowly edged clear. WATCH YOUR WORDS dueled for command two wide, was left with the rail after a half and fought,
gamely to wire. WINDOW TABLE, reluctant to load causing yet another delay, was four wide in top flight, took the lead on the final turn, resisted when
challenged, was headed leaving furlong grounds but held on well. MIDNIGHT HARBOR broke slowly, raced just off the rail, drifted out then in through
stretch and finished with good energy. GOURMET DELIGHT, racing between foes, failed to menace. MY PIRATE, very wide throughout, was no real threat.
SECRET SECRET dueled for command three wide before tiring. NOBLE KENT raced wide while not far back and then tired. BANKER'S ISLAND set the
pace inside and was finished after a half. VIZCAINO saved ground and tired.

Footnotes
LUCKY BRITCHES raced between foes to near stretch, moved out entering the stretch stretch, drifted out despite right handed pressure in early stretch,
rider switched to left handed pressure and LUCKY BRITCHES drifted out farther and ran down the lead in deep stretch. ADMIRAL ABE set the pace just off
the rail, held a clear lead deep stretch and just failed. FLAT OUT FLYING saved ground, raced in traffic and steadied along on the final turn, split rivals to
secure racing room and rallied. TRUE BLUE raced outside, moved to the rail on the final turn, swung out again through the stretch. COMMANDEERING
stalked the pace outside winner, drifted out leaving the final turn and faded. LONG GRAY LINE saved ground early, moved out on the far turn but was no
threat. BUMPERDOO, wide, was never a serious threat. ROBIN HOOD raced wide and showed little. FLAT OUT FLASHY, just off the rail and just off the
pace, was finished after a half.

DREAMER'S MOON set the pace racing with a clear lead from the outset, showed the way on the far turn, raced off the inside, pulled away in the stretch
under some mild urging. PROMISED STORM raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, chased the winner on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and
remained clear for the place award. GLOWING STAR raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly for
third. SAFFRON SPIRIT raced off the pace inside, moved off the rail, chased the leaders on the far turn and lacked a rally. MUSIC MAKER stalked two wide
in the early stages, then chased and tired. TIZ A DATE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. HAY BUCK raced three wide early, then chased
between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
MADAME TIGER raced in the five path of top flight, gained the lead in deep stretch and edged away under mild handling. QUEEN OF SCHMOOZE was
bumped soundly leaving the gate, recovered and was sent up to vied for command between foes, took the lead early stretch but was no match late. ANISSA
bobbled and came out leaving the gate causing crowding, raced three wide and passed faders. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT bobbled then came in leaving the
gate, raced very wide and wasn't a serious threat. MISS STAR LO set the pace in the four path, fell back in mid stretch then was eased up late.
LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT raced and challenged three wide on the turn then gave way. BIG RED SEVEN broke slowly then showed little. PANSY saved
ground disputing the pace then gave way. NATALIE LA ROSE, fractious in the gate, showed nothing. BAD NANA took up sharply leaving the gate then was
outrun.
