Footnotes
CHRISTEANA'S KISS moved in into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled comfortably off the pace, was asked while two then three wide on
the far turn, had dead aim on the vanguard at that point, rallied rive wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead at the three-sixteenths, moved clear
near the eighth-pole then drifted in under a left-handed whip and drew away under strong urging. SUPERSPORT SALLY broke out then was corrected by
the rider, tossed her head a bit while keen into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled towards the front while off the rail on the backstretch, ranged
up in the two path to make a bid between horses on the far turn, led from outside the five-sixteenths into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner
under a drive at the three-sixteenths and proved no match while well clear for the place. LADY FITZGERALD was caught five wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, advanced leaving the backstretch, made a bid outside of three foes on the far turn, moved to the three path under urging outside the
quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired but was well clear for the show. LOOKIN BACK AT IT lunged at the start and was off a
step slow, went two then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid between horses in the three path on the far turn, dropped
back under a drive into the stretch and came up empty. CAN'T COUNT THAT set the clear pace on the inside, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths then
dropped back along the rail, drifted out significantly in upper stretch and faded. MEG AND CLAIR went four wide on the first turn, dropped back while taken
in hand briefly entering the backstretch, settled on the far outside, was urged along outside the half-mile pole, went four to five wide under the whip on the
far turn and failed to respond. MY HALF a bit recalcitrant in post parade, was taken up between horses early while climbing severely, went two to three wide
while still traveling awkwardly the opening bend, lagged at the rear, drifted in outside the half-mile pole, raced inside early on the far turn then shifted three
wide, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in around the three-sixteenths while continuing to climb awkwardly in spurts and showed little.

Footnotes
MUSICAL MAN settled well back on the inside, saved ground under coaxing through the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed strongly under a
brisk hand ride to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear while given several taps of a down-turned whip to keep his mind on business.
SYDSTER rounded the first turn in the five path, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the four to five path on the far turn, moved clear into upper
stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while well clear for the place. SHAE'S DAY went around the first turn in the two path,
settled in a good position in fourth place, was roused outside the seven-sixteenths, angled from the two path to the four path at the three-eighths, chased
the leaders late on that turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and came up empty while best of the rest. IZZY'S BABY BOY bumped with a rival at the
start, prompted the pace outside of the leader in the three path, vied three then two wide under urging on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
tired. LOVE THAT WARRIOR went four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, came
five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. EATORBEEATEN bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled to the lead, raced inside on the first turn,
set the pace under some pressure to his outside, vied in the two path early on the far turn, lost the lead while moving a bit closer to the rail at the
three-eighths and faded. SILVER KING went four wide on the turns and showed little.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE GAL bobbled ever so slightly at the start but recovered and was forwardly-positioned three wide between foes entering the first turn, edged
away from rivals to stalk the leader two to three wide up the backstretch gradually edging closer, bid two to three wide leaving the far turn and took over by
the three-sixteenths, was under urging at this juncture and moved clear by mid-stretch, kept on under mostly left-handed use of the whip till switching to a
right-handed whip in the final strides to hold sway over SOARING NOW, who moved in to the two path entering the first turn content to track in behind the
leader and aforementioned under light rating, moved out coming past the three-eighths pole to the three path with aim on the leading pair, put to heavy
urging in the stretch but could not get past the winner while closing the gap and clearly second best. C ISLANDSURPRISE was urged at the break and
moved clear into the first turn shifting in entering that bend to dictate terms inside, faced increasing pressure from outside up the backstretch into the far
turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened thereafter but ran on to save show honors. THAI CHILI SUE was unhurried early saving ground through
the first turn at the rear, was asked for more past the five-sixteenths still saving ground on the far turn, came out past the furlong marker under an all out
drive and improved mildly. SUNDEREYA tracked in behind the leaders racing just off the fence on the first turn and up the backstretch, shifted four wide
leaving the far turn and failed to rally. GAVINS LITTLE SIS was caught four wide outside foes on the first turn, held good position stalking the leaders up the
backstretch, began to drop back four to three wide on the far turn and was empty for the drive. LADY BLUE was keenly tossing her head three deep and
behind foes into the first turn, moved out four to five wide later on that bend and still fought restraint, settled a bit outside rivals up the backstretch, went four
to five wide on the far turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
MY PEPPER ANN went around the first turn in the two path, settled nicely off the pace, was roused while two then three wide on the far turn, rallied four
wide into the stretch under the whip, closed strongly while still on her inside lead to get the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under
steady handling. OFFSPRING rounded the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the far turn,
took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, shook clear outside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while well
clear for the place. TEMPLE SHADOW brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was well placed on the inside, chased along the rail on the far turn, turned
into the stretch in the two path under the whip and came up empty. AIR GUITAR STAR brushed with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. TREFOIL broke out then was hustled to the lead, set the pace
in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and faded. TOODALOO TO YOU
went four wide into the first turn then tucked into the three path, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, moved out
under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CHARGE THE LINE was brushed at the break, pressed the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, put a head in front coming to the quarter pole in
the four path and was asked at that point, responded well to quickly spurt clear, kept under a drive till late stretch when eased up. ASONGFORYOU brushed
the aforementioned at the start then was mildly coaxed forward, set a pressured pace inside just off the rail through the turn and proved no match. WHY
JOEY WHY settled at the rear from off the fence, went in the three to four path on the turn urged along early on that bend, moved out six wide in upper
stretch and finished well. CALIMAMBO shifted in early up the backstretch, switched outside a rival near the seven-sixteenths pole going two to three wide
on the turn and coming four wide past the quarter pole, ran on without threatening the top ones. FORERUN chased the top pair from off the fence in the four
path through the turn, weakened in the stretch. SALTEE STARK raced outside early, angled in past the half-mile marker, saved ground along the inside
through the turn and was empty in the stretch.

while unable to threaten the winner. SKYCRAFT dropped back soon after the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged
along midway down the backstretch, raced three wide while ridden along on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out near the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. CONSUMERCONFIDENCE went around the first turn in the two to three path,
stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two to three path on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, lost touch
with the winner into upper stretch and tired. MUCHO MACHO BETS went three wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under strong
urging while two to three wide on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and came up empty. SON OF A SAINT went two then three wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, moved in near the five-eighths, saved ground on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, had the rider lose his whip outside
the furlong marker and failed to respond. MAJESTIC SIGN broke out then hit the gate and was off a step slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, dropped back while urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
STOP SHOPPIN TAMMY quickly moved clear into the first turn, dictated terms in the two path while lightly rated through the early stages, extended the
margin slightly on the far turn into upper stretch, was thereupon given just moderate urging through the lane and held sway. KIZZY B tracked off the leaders
saving ground on the first turn, began to edge closer still inside on the far turn moving out to the three path past the five-sixteenths, loomed a threat in upper
stretch but could make no headway on the winner while clearly second best. FRESHMAN CLASS settled into stride well back racing just off the rail through
the first turn, began to advance mildly still near the inside late up the backstretch, came out just a hair while asked for more nearing the three-eighths going
in about the two path through the second turn, was strongly ridden in the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ARTISTIC JEWLER raced between rivals
into the first turn continuing inside a rival but in about the three path out of that bend, tracked the leader up the backstretch still inside a foe, was given some
encouragement past the seven-sixteenths going three deep on the far turn, drifted in through upper stretch and came up empty. HEAVENLY SIS raced
outside rivals four wide through the first turn, was within range still outside rivals up the backstretch into the far turn continuing four deep on that bend, failed
to produce a bid. ACTRESS ON BOARD broke a bit awkwardly, dropped back from between runners early settling at the rear racing off the rail, moved in to
the rail late on the first turn, continued to trail up the backstretch, passed a rival still on the rail scraping the paint on the far turn, came out in the stretch and
was asked for more but failed to produce and was eased through the final sixteenth. LIVY B was just a bit fractious in the gate, broke just a hair awkwardly,
eased back from between foes heading to the first turn and entered that bend in the three path moving out to the four path and in range of the leaders,
dropped back heading into the far turn going in the four to five path on that bend and coming into upper stretch far back, was not persevered with through
the final furlong.

angled five wide late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. DJINN OF DJIBOUTI settled on the outside, was
urged along while four wide on the turn and came up empty. GATO DEL BANCO settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came
three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CABO HEADACHE settled at the rear, was urged along while two then three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive nearing the three-sixteenths and was no factor. CIVIL tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along while
