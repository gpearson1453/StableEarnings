Footnotes
WOODBURN HALL came through the opening turn in the four path then moved to the inside entering the second turn and rated the pace, made some
erratic moved in the vicinity of the three eighths pole and gave up the lead past that point, but recovered stride to retake control three wide approaching the
head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. ARE U rated close inside then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead at the three
eighths, was pressured into the far turn and contested the edge nearest the rail through the turn, but was caught toward the head of the lane and flattened
stride the final furlong. WHIRLAWAY R V F raced in the three path the first turn then stalked the pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced
close two deep on the far turn then weakened leaving the turn. FUERTE settled off the pace in the two and three paths then bid leaving the three eighths
pole, but showed little further at the rail on the far turn. VILLAGE PRINCE rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace, started a bid toward
the three eighths pole but faded past the quarter. OULOG saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

POTENTIAL GRIZZLY rated close toward the inside then eased out with a bid leaving the three eighths pole, checked off the heels of the runner-up then
angled inside that one to come between horses leaving the far turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and inched clear through the final yards. DIONYSUS'
CHALICE stalked the pace two deep then took the lead past the half mile pole, was pressured leaving the three eighths, contested the edge off the rail on
the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded. THROW THE FADE rounded the opening turn in the four path
then stalked three wide into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn but flattened stride down the lane.
JAXBRADENRISHI set the pace inside but was caught and gave chase past the half mile pole, dropped back midway on the far turn then weakened leaving
the turn. WINDSOR LEGEND settled off the pace and off the rail then showed little response through the backstretch. GIO DUDE rounded the opening turn
about the five path, settled outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

BAYTOWN VI VI settled close in the two and three paths then rallied to the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew away through the far turn and
increased that margin down the lane. DUDES PICK raced in the five path the first turn and settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close through the backstretch but dropped back past the quarter pole and had to settled for second best. HIGH VISION saved ground
off the pace the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. QUEEN BOBBY
stalked the pace three wide and took a brief slim lead at the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn. BEYOND
PRETTY set the early pace inside but was caught and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, continued to give chase at the rail through the
backstretch then faded past the five sixteenths pole. MANNA FROM HANNAH stalked the pace two deep and picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, but, faded through the backstretch. PAINT ME PRETTY veered outward at the break, rounded the opening turn in the six path and proved
to be no factor.

OWNER'S SUITE came in to make light contact with Hot Possebility leaving the gate then set a pressured pace inside, contested the rail through the turn
and held well under a vigorous hand ride after the rider lost his whip midway on the turn. NELLYSFORD pressured the pace through the backstretch and
contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn but dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining mildly on the
winner. NICE N' BROAD pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn then ceded second mid-stretch. HOUSE OF
LOVE raced well back and outside from early contention, came through the turn in the five path and finished well. HOT POSSEBILITY was bumped lightly at
the break then picked up the chase off the rail, drifted a bit leaving the turn and finished evenly.

Footnotes
SILK STOCKING surged to the lead and angled to the inside approaching the three quarter pole to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three
eighths, rounded the far turn off the rail and was steadily handled through the lane to hold on well. JET SETTIN LADY stalked the pace two deep then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, continued close in the three path of the far turn but couldn't improve down the lane. OUR BAD GIRL raced
off the rail the opening turn and settled close into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride
down the lane. CISCO BAY saved ground just off the early pace then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but showed little
more in the lane. TREASURED INFO settled off the pace in the three and four paths then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn in the three path and showed little further. JEAN GREY raced well back. RAMANTICAL raced in the five path the first turn and entered the
backstretch outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS CASUARINA stalked the earlier pace two deep and moved to even terms at the three eighths pole, dueled to the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew
clear midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. NOT A SECRET stalked the pace from the three path, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path then dueled for second and finished evenly. BRING ME ANSWERS rounded the opening turn in the
four path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and raced evenly to
late stretch before flattening stride. ABSENCEISPRESENCE rated a short lead inside and was met at even terms nearing the three eighths pole, engaged
the winner from that point but dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and weakened. GROUP TEXT saved ground off the pace and showed little
response through the backstretch. FACEY'S SISTER raced well off the pace toward the inside the first turn, eased out with a bid from the seven sixteenths
pole, came through the far turn in the five and six paths and showed little further. HANALEI SUNSET saved early ground.

Footnotes
MEAN BEAN broke a bit awkwardly to exchange contact with Castle Bound and settled well back while saving ground, started a steady bid leaving the three
eighths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn and closed with a rush through the lane to take over the final yards. NORTH ATLANTIC raced in the five
path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms in the three path nearing the top of the lane,
took the nod mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to earn second while overcome by the winner the final yards. AARON'S TAP stalked the pace from the two
and three paths and challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, then dueled to a slim brief lead leaving the five sixteenths, was met at even terms
approaching the head of the lane and started to cede inside the sixteenth pole. WILLIAM AND MARY settled off the pace in the three and four paths then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and flattened stride. RESCUE FIVE stalked the pace inside,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure
at the seven sixteenths pole, was caught leaving the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened. CASTLE BOUND
exchanged contact with the winner leaving the gate and raced well back.

Footnotes
LADY LOOSE was jostled on the chute then hustled up to take the lead nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms leaving the five sixteenths,
drew clear past the quarter pole and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. FLEETRESS exchanged contact with the winner on the chute then
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, steadily improved in the five path of the turn then dug in through the lane to take second the final
strides. EVER SO D'WILD chased the pace outside and dueled to even terms toward the five sixteenths pole, but dropped back past the quarter, flattened
stride inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped from second the final strides. CANARSIE PRINCESS chased the pace through the backstretch and rounded
the turn at the rail, though, had little left in the lane. DELFINA gave chase toward the outside and raced in the six and seven paths of the turn, then passed
some rivals in an even finish. BAYTOWN MILLI gave chase then faded off the rail rounding the turn. COME GETCHA SOME steadied early then picked up
the chase outside before flattening stride in the four path of the turn. GRETA GRETA BOO was hustled along with a brief early lead then gave chase toward
the three eighths pole, though, faded through the turn. CIVIL STONES broke outward and made contact with Lady Loose on the chute then saved ground.
