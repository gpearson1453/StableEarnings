IMPROBABLE STORY good speed to the front, set all pace, fought off bids and cleared late. TADEO chased winner throughout, could not keep up in the
drive. NOT AGAIN JACKIE bobbled start, no speed to stretch, commenced rally for show. GLASS EATER raced evenly, lacking a late response in the
stretch run. BIG LEMON between horses to the turn with no late kick when needed. BOO REID perfectly placed to turn, faded back in the drive. KENTUCKY
PEERLESS awkward start, never menaced throughout. GET SOME MUNY had a terrible start, rushed and used up to weaken in the drive. EDZO through
after half, dropped far back.
