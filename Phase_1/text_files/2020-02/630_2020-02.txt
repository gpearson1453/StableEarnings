Footnotes
SON OF A QUEEN angled outside a rival early, settled off the pace, raced two wide nearing the quarter pole, angled in on the turn, rallied up the inside and
nailed LOVE AND HOLD at the wire. LOVE AND HOLD stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, bid inside the leader from the two path and gained
command on the turn, drifted in to the inside in the stretch and was caught at the wire. IMPEACHMENT ACE chased a bit off the rail, traveled along the
inside to the turn, lacked room room and steadied behind SON OF A QUEEN around the bend, angled out in the upper stretch and showed a mild rally to
edge rival for the show. CIRCLE THE RED sped clear of the field from the outside, set the pace into the turn, drifted out around the bend, lost command to
LOVE AND HOLD and weakened in the stretch. BOLD EAGLE lacked early speed, took the turn two wide and never rallied.

Footnotes
UNCHANGED showed speed along the inside, set the pace up the backstretch, vied for command from the inside into the turn, drifted out a bit around the
bend and cleared into the stretch, inched away and held safely under a drive. I B BUZZIN stalked from the inside, made progress around the turn and into
the stretch, lacked the needed late kick but held the place. SOPRESCIOUS chased outside a rival, moved forward to vie three deep for the command,
carried wide by inside rival around the bend and kept on willingly through the stretch. VIRGINIA HALL pressed the pace from the outside, floated out by the
winner on the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SPACERIKA stalked the pace from the inside, came in tight quarters and checked into the turn,
traveled a bit off the rail into the lane and failed to rally.
