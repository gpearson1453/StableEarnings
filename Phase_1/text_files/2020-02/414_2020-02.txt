Footnotes
RATTLESNAKEROSE broke readily to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace racing off the inside into the turn, shook clear into upper stretch and just
lasted in an all out drive. MAST COVE, urged to gain a forward placing prompting the pacesetter to the turn, lost some ground to that foe while shifting out
four wide racing into the stretch but continued willingly to the end to challenge the winner nearing the wire. LIL B QUICK ducked inwards at the start, was
quickly righted, then switched out to track off the first flight between foes, then continued with a steady effort through late stages to prevail for a share.
ENDUROS TIGRESS tracked the leaders three wide in second flight into the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. MZ. FOO DO tracked just off the
leaders inside rivals racing to the lane and weakened late. CAN'TCATCHTHERAXX ducked out at the start, tracked off the second flight racing three wide to
the stretch but had no rally. MORNING PRINCESS angled to the inside early while coming under pressure to contend but soon retreated. DON'T SPIN ME
broke slowly and trailed the field into the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS BRIENNE was urged along three deep in pursuit of the pacesetter racing to the turn, pressed the issue between foes to gain a narrow
advantage racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady response to hold RITA OF CASCIA to the end under firm encouragement. The latter was
urged to a forward placing along the rail, conceded some position racing into the turn, switched out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady
bid to challenge the winner while just outkicked. EYE ON THE FINISH was rated along the rail from just out of striking distance, shifted out to split foes just
off the inside to bid for command inside the top pair leaving midstretch but had no final kick. COSI MOMOSI, urged between foes, then along the inside
disputing the pace, dueled for command to upper stretch and gave way. MALICED tracked off the first flight between foes, shifted out five wide racing into
the lane but finished evenly late. TOLLY CLUB settled in hand while angling to the inside early, then passed between tiring rivals racing into the stretch.
CLEAN FUN, urged along four wide pursuing the first flight racing to the turn, gained a brief advantage between calls on the turn but flattened out racing into
the stretch. IMPAZIBLE GIRL angled to the inside early and failed to menace. AMERICAN COUNTESS broke awkwardly and failed to menace. MYSTICAL
EMPATH proved no factor.

Footnotes
GETTININTOMISCHIEF broke readily to gain a position just off the pacesetter prompting that foe racing into the turn, took over nearing upper stretch and
held sway on a clear margin while kept to steady pressure. FOOT IN THE DOOR tracked just off the leaders between foes in second flight, split rivals to
inside the pacesetter in upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with that foe while edging rivals for the place honors. TEMPLE MOUNT tracked the leaders
four wide in second flight through the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened
out late. SULTRY SAMURAI broke a step slowly, raced off the second flight to the turn, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and made some mild
progress late. ACTSPECTATION tracked off the second flight while shifting out, made brief progress to gain contention racing four wide through the turn but
proved empty in the drive. FAFA FOOEY, outpaced in the opening stages, angled five wide racing into the lane to gain some position but had no late
response. ONEWAYTICKET, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the turn, emptied out after a half. SPINOS was a brief factor inside foes tracking
just off the leaders but dropped out early. JOHNNYTHETIREMAN tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and steadily faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
TEXAS SWING broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing just off the rail into the backstretch, turned back a rival's challenge racing
through the far turn to upper stretch and edged clear late under firm handling. DON BOURBON, in touch with the pacesetter prompting the pace into the
backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch but proved only second best. GIOCARE was rated between foes just off the first flight in the
opening half, was prompted to advance shifting out three deep nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with the top pair while edging a rival for a
share. EXTRAORDINARY, bumped at the start, then caught four wide racing into the first turn, gained a position just off the leaders three deep briefly
prmpting the pace to the second bend and faded while being fanned four wide into the stretch. WIND RIDGE was settled along the rail in the opening half,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued with some belated interest to improve position. LASTFORTINOFAMILY tracked off the second flight between
foes in the opening stages and came up empty racing through the far turn. SAFE AND SOUND, pulling against restraint inside rivals tracking just off the
pacesetter into the backstretch, steadily faded after a half. TABLED broke out bumping EXTRAORDINARY at the start, was held up avoiding tight quarters
racing into the first turn, was caught four, then five wide racing into the backstretch and soon, faded.

Footnotes
WANDERLUST tracked the leaders from just off the second flight along the rail in the opening stages, advanced inside rivals while caught in tight quarters
racing into the bend to gain a position just off the pacesetter entering the turn, came through inside that foe to wrest the advantage and went clear under
firm handling. ESTILO TALENTOSO tracked off the first flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide on the turn while
advancing on the leaders and prevailed for the place honors. RECODED, four deep between foes in second flight in the opening stages, was held up
avoiding tight quarters midway through the backstretch, then shifted four wide racing into the turn to steadily gain position into the stretch. GOGO SHOES
dropped off the second flight racing to the turn, angled five wide racing into the stretch and displayed some belated interest. GESTURE tracked off the first
flight between rivals just off the inside, briefly awaited an opening racing into the turn, was urged to advance nearing the lane but had no late bid. BAHAMA
PEARL sprinted to the lead, dictated the pace just off the rail through the bend and gave out mistretch. TEMPTATION EYES was outpaced early. SHARI'S
TUNE ducked out at the start losing position to the leaders, was hustled while angling in three deep to prompt the leaders racing into the turn and gave way
into the lane. LAVALIER proved no factor. NAGINI dropped out early. OUR LITTLE DEVIL was urged to a forward placing between foes prompting the
pacesetter to the turn but emptied out after a half.

SURPRISE AGAIN was rated off the second flight between rivals near the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide leaving the midway point of the far
turn and produced a solid late response to collar WAR ROSE on the wire under strong handling. The latter, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter,
took over from that foe nearing midstretch and just missed. LADY OXBOW tracked off the second flight outside foes to the far turn, then steadily gained
three deep between foes to prevail for a share. PALLAS ATHENE broke out bumping WITH HERSELF (IRE, was settled along the inside, angled out five
wide racing into upper stretch and found her best stride late. TILTINGATWINDMILLS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn, briefly
awaited an opening in close quarters racing into the stretch, then shifted four wide to gain some position between foes nearing the wire. EAST COAST
SWING went quickly to the lead dictating terms on her own courage, maintained the advantage to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker.
WITH HERSELF (IRE), bumped start, angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight, saved ground to the lane, was urged to advance in close
quarters inside rivals entering the stretch but was outkicked. KITTEN'S FINEST tracked the leaders three deep in second flight, was urged to make a brief
bid in that path on the far turn but soon emptied out. TIZAPRINCESSA settled between foes and never gained contention. BLONDE MOMENT proved no
factor. TEGLA tracked just off the leaders inside rivals in second flight to the far turn and gave way into the stretch. DON'T CHARGE IT settled four wide in
the last flight racing to the backstretch and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SARATOGIAN was urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the outset into the turn, edged forward nearing midstretch and just held EXPENSIVE STYLE
to the wire in an all out drive. The latter tracked just off the first flight inside foes racing to the turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch steadily
advancing on the pacesetter and was just outnodded on the wire. SEMPER FI, unhurried between foes in the opening stages, shifted to the inside racing
into the turn commencing his advance, shifted out three deep nearing midstretch and was going well late. CPT. RHETT BUTLER tracked off the second
flight while shifting off the inside racing to the turn, angled five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position. UNCLE BUD joined
the pace outside foes four wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace three wide into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. MR. QUALITY settled
outside foes in early stages, gathered momentum while switching out six wide in the stretch but made no impact. SILVER MAKER, restless in the gate
before the start, broke slowly, settled near the inside, then angled seven wide in the last furlong while displaying some late interest. POINT DRIVEN ducked
out hitting the gate at the start, dropped off the field while angling nearer to the inside, was prompted to gain some position racing into the stretch but was
steadied out of tight quarters late. ROUGH ENTRY, urged to terms with the pacesetter forcing the pace between foes racing into the turn, gave way late.
COURAGE DE LION tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn and soon retreated. DRAMA CHORUS made brief pursuit of the first flight
between rivals, shifted out on the turn, emptied out early and was gathered up racing into the stretch. MR. BURNING MAN proved no factor.

Footnotes
JEHOZACAT moved readily to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace in hand on a comfortable margin to the far turn, held sway into upper
stretch and grudgingly maintained the advantage to the end under strong handling. ALTEA (FR), reserved along the rail in the opening half, saved ground
on the far turn, came around a tiring foe to advance inside rivals racing into the stretch and produced a solid closing response to challenge the winner
nearing the wire. ANDINA DEL SUR tracked the leaders along the inside under light rating to the second bend, lost some momentum behind a tiring foe
nearing the midway point of the turn, switched out three wide racing into the stretch and continued willingly while just outkicked. GOT STORMY was rated
outside a rival tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the far turn, shifted out nearing the lane while being, prompted to advance
but made no headway in the final three sixteenths. PHANTOM OPENING tracked off the second flight outside foes, was fanned wide into the stretch and
soon faded. A. A. AZULA'S ARCH tracked just off the pacesetter near the inside in the opening stages but came up, empty racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
LUCREZIA gained a forward placing along the rail while stalking just inside the pacesetter under rating racing to the backstretch, switched outside that foe
midway through the backstretch while readily moving to terms, took over racing into the far turn and steadily widened her advantage into the stretch under
firm encouragement. TURTLE TRAX was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gained some position nearing the far turn, angled
out four wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest outside foes to prevail for the pace honors. MOTU tracked the pace three wide between foes
in second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out entering
the lane. COMICAL tracked the leader between foes in second flight, was urged to advance in tandem with a rival to lodge a bid three deep between foes on
the far turn but proved empty in the drive. TWO SIXTY sped to fore racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail through the backstretch, then
gave way once headed nearing upper stretch. EMBOSSED was taken back while angling to the inside to track off the second flight to the backstretch but
never gained contention. WE THE CLOUDS tracked the pace inside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but steadily faded after a half. BLAME
DEBBIE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, had no rally when called upon, then angled five wide racing into the stretch.
MISS IMPORTANT, caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to a position in the second flight, continued five wide to the second turn
and soon emptied out.

Footnotes
ADMIRALTY PIER sped to lead along the rail to dictate the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn
into upper stretch, exchanged some contact entering the lane but continued gamely between foes to narrowly prevail in a stiff drive. DEVAMANI (FR)
tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a solid late bid to just miss.
MARCH TO THE ARCH tracked just off the first flight inside rivals under rating racing to the far turn, shifted out to bid between foes just off the inside racing
into upper stretch, was bumped, then forced to alter course inside foes but continued willingly to the end while just outkicked. HALLADAY, forwardly placed
three wide attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue in that path racing into the far turn, ducked inwards racing into upper stretch bumping
REAL STORY soundly while forcing that rival to check and soon gave way. MY BARILEY settled last outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was caught
wide racing into the far turn, angled in nearing the stretch and made an effort to improve position. HEMBREE tracked off the second flight outside foes, was
caught wide into the stretch and had no rally. CARIBOU CLUB tracked the pace between foes in second flight, drifted wide nearing the lane and soon gave
way. REAL STORY, in touch prompting the pace between foes racing to the far turn, pressed the issue through the far turn, was bumped soundly near the
three sixteenths marker while forced into the paths of MARCH TO THE ARCH and ADMIRALTY PIER, was checked off rivals and quickly gave out.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MARCH TO THE ARCH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SOLE VOLANTE broke readily, was rated along the rail dropping well off the first flight racing to the backstretch, advanced with a sharp move inside foes
racing into the far turn, switched outside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest command and go clear in
time under firm left handed encouragement. INDEPENDENCE HALL broke readily to gain the advantage along the rail in the opening sixteenth, conceded
the lead racing into the first turn to track just off the leaders into the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn, shifted
inwards while moving to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's challenge but proved no match late. AJAAWEED was settled
last along the rail to the far turn, saved ground through the bend, swung out four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain a share. TIZ RYE
TIME, unprepared for the start while losing position to the leaders, was settled outside foes then made an effort to gain position three deep between foes
late. NO GETTING OVER ME unprepared for the start, quickly recovered to gain a position outside rivals in the second flight dropping well off the leaders to
the backstretch, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner racing into the far turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing the quarter mile marker but
flattened out in upper stretch. PREMIER STAR, urged to terms between foes, then inside a rival prompting the pace into the backstretch, dueled for
command to the second bend while gaining a brief advantage between calls but gave way once headed nearing upper stretch. CHAPALU joined the pace
outside foes racing to the first turn, pressed the issue to the far turn and abruptly gave way.

BETTER YET was settled outside foes racing in the last flight to the backstretch, advanced four wide through the far turn, swung six wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm encouragement. ITSAGIMME'S GIRL was rated inside rivals tracking just off
the first flight racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch to challenge, gained the advantage between calls late and just failed to
contain the winner. ASHLEY'S ROSE angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch, advanced along the rail to
challenge for command late but was outkicked. QUEEN ROSE settled along the rail in the last flight to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then
shifted three deep midstretch to gain position between rivals to the end. IGOTTAWHITEFACE tracked the pace outside rivals in the second flight for a half,
was prompted to advance on the far turn, angled five wide nearing upper stretch while advancing to contention but was outkicked. CALLIE CALIFORNIA,
urged to dispute the pace along the inside racing to the backstretch, disputed the issue in a prolonged drive and gave way late. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE settled
between foes and never gained contention. TEARLESS, urged prompting a rival's pace, dueled for command to upper stretch and gave out. TAKIN IT
EASY, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the leaders for a half, gave way into the far turn. SHOWBOATING, caught four wide racing into the first
turn, retreated early. MAD GRACE reared at the start and lost her rider, but walked off the course under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
