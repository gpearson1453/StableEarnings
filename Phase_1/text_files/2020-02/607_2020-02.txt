GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was content to lag early, began a strong three wide run into the far turn, quickly ran clear in early stretch and widened under
intermittent urging. CATAPULT JACK ran out into the first turn, was rated well out from the rail, began a three wide run into the far turn, moved closer on the
outside in early stretch then flattened out. BOURBON STREAK stayed out from the rail while making the early pace into the stretch then tired.
GOTTOASKCHARLIE bobbled leaving the gate, raced inside the winner for the first half, made a run along the rail into the far turn then had nothing left for
the drive. MEETMEATTHEWIRE was taken in hand while chasing the top two around the first turn, began to fade after five furlongs and was eased up
through the lane. ITSHOULDBEFINE pressed in the three path outside the early leader for about five furlongs, stopped, pulled up lame in early stretch and
was vanned off.

DETERMINED PURSUIT was bumped between horses at the start, stalked the leader from the three path, bid in hand and took command into the far turn,
drew clear around that bend, then added to his margin under driving pressure through the late. TOPSIDE TRADER was broken into by an outer rival, forcing
him to bump his inner rival at the start, saved ground from midpack, was held up behind the tiring leader into the far turn, split foes and forged place inside
of LACCO AMENO around the turn, then proved second best through the lane. LACCO AMENO broke inwards and was off last, pulled past inner rivals in
the four path around the first turn to stalk from midpack down the backstretch, but was driven to keep pace passing the five sixteenths pole, and flattened
out turning for home. SCOOTER BUSKIE trailed in the two path, but came under coaxing to keep touch with the field into the backstretch, weakened, but
kept on late to pass a tired foe without threatening. SMART PROSPECT set the pace around the first turn, but came under coaxing to hold an advantage
passing the half mile pole, lost the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, and subsequently weakened around the far turn before stopping through the.

MESSY BAKER was rated three wide in good position, was sent to vie into the stretch, ran clear nearing the final furlong, remained clear into deep stretch
then lasted. CARGO SHIP was rated close up along the rail, began a run into the far turn, steadied when caught behind the early leader near the quarter
pole, swung wide into the stretch then closed a gap from the outside in the final yards. INDIGESTION raced two wide while chasing the early leader, moved
to vie for command between foes while inside the winner entering the stretch then flattened out. INALIENABLE RIGHTS settled inside early, came well out
from the rail on the final turn then weakened. WHATA MOOSE was slow early, stayed inside and failed to matter. I'SE DUBAI opened a clear lead soon
after the break, angled to the rail entering the first turn, held on for just over three-quarters then stopped in the lane. JOINER raced two wide while outrun.
WRANGLE was fractious in the gate then was outrun. SUGAR TRAIN showed little.

Footnotes
BANTY'S GIRL established a clear lead early and stayed in the five path down the backstretch, shifted down to the three, then two, path around the then,
was let loose in upper stretch, drew off readily, and was ridden out to the wire. BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN rallied outside of rivals in the four to five path around
the turn to reach place passing the furlong pole. DIRTY GIRL stalked three wide, chased the loose leader around the turn, shifted to the four path
approaching the furlong pole, then drifted back inwards approaching the sixteenth pole while getting outkicked by an outer rival for place. HEADED FOR
HEAVEN was forced outwards at the start by an inner foe, trailed along the inside around the turn, shifted to the three to four path turning for home, angled
inwards as DIRTY GIRL shifted into her path, but lacked a kick to split horses passing the furlong pole, then shied in when DIRTY GIRL drifted inwards in
the late stages. SPECIAL RISK broke outwards, stalked two wide and from between horses, but weakened at the furlong pole. AMERICAN ALI stalked
inside of a pair of rivals, saved ground, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. Following a rider's objection, #4 HEADED FOR HEAVEN against #6
DIRTY GIRL for interference in the stretch, the stewards made no change.

SIERRA SARAH ducked into EZ ON THE EYES leaving the gate then was bumped soon after, gained position inside, fell back entering the turn, rallied to
the front in early stretch, drew out after five furlongs and was under urging. BANK ROLLIN delayed the start while reluctant to load, opened a clear lead
soon after an alert break, stayed out from the inside while making the pace into the stretch then weakened. EZ ON THE EYES, bumped leaving the gate,
was slow early, was carried wide into the stretch and finished willingly outside. ATTENTIVELY was slow early while close to the inside, swung wide into the
stretch and gained between rivals. COOLWATER bobbled leaving the gate, came in, bumped the winner, moved to press outside the early leader in the
three path, stopped in the lane and was eased up late.

Footnotes
MYDRINKSELECTION broke outward, dueled for the lead outside of AXE CAPITAL, drew clear from that foe into the turn, but met a challenge from
PACHAMAMA, but dug in gamely turning for home, and repelled that foe gamely in the late stages to win going away. PACHAMAMA shied outwards at the
start from an inner rival, stalked three wide, inched forward to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled in upper stretch as her inner rival dug in, but
was repelled by that foe in the late stages. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE was hustled early on, but only managed a two wide stalking position between horses,
but failed to keep pace with the leader into the turn, shifted to the three, then four path, around the bend, then kept on in the late stages for show without
threatening. AXE CAPITAL dueled inside of MYDRINKSELECTION into the turn, but gave way to that foe passing the three furlong pole, kept on to hold
show in upper stretch, but got outfinished for that position late. NEW FOUND TREASURE was bumped by an inner rival at the start, made up ground
around the turn by saving it, but lacked a rally to threaten. PUPPET took the turn in the three to five path in midpack, and failed to produce a rally. BRONZE
CHARM broke outwards and bumped a foe, trailed along the inside to the turn, and failed to factor. GRACIAS ADIOS shifted off the rail to pass the tiring
early leader into the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. DANCING COOL took the turn in the five path while far off of the pace, and failed
to get involved.

Footnotes
ALLISON K couldn't keep up early, rallied the rail around the turn, angled sharply to the outside nearing the final furlong, closed a gap in deep stretch and
was up in time. FARFALLA was unhurried following a slow break, rallied two wide between rivals into the stretch, drew even on the front end in the final
yards but was outfinished. BALHARBOUR MISS opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail around the turn, drifted through the
lane and gave way late. MS TEEK had early position outside in the three path, gave her best into the final furlong then weakened.
RAISEDTOBEAWARRIOR angled to the rail while making a run into the turn, moved closer to the front before a half then tired. PARANOIA stayed outside
in the three path and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ARCTICA pulled clear into the first turn and established a wide margin into the backstretch, met a challenge from LADYBUG LADYBUG around the far turn,
but found more, kicked away again turning for home, and held sway through the lane before drifting across LADYBUG LADYBUG's path approaching the
wire. BETTY'S GOT RYTHM split foes to advance to a three wide stalking position into the far turn, got outkicked by the leader turning for home, but
produced a late surge to get up for place at the wire. LADYBUG LADYBUG rushed to stalk from the inside, shifted off the fence into the far turn to make a
bid at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by the leader turning for home, kept on and rebid through the final furlong, but did not have enough to
catch the leader before that foe drifted across her path approaching the wire, then got nipped at the wire by BETTY'S GOT RYTHM for place. SECRET
ACCOUNT saved ground while trailing, and failed to threaten. HUNTER REVOLUTION stalked two wide, but weakened four wide around the far turn.
LAUNCH SEQUENCE raced off of the pace outside of horses in the two to three path around the first turn, but weakened in the four path at the seven
sixteenths pole, was eased up around the far turn, and galloped across the wire. Following a rider's objection, #4 LADYBUG LADYBUG against #7
ARCTICA, the stewards made no change.
