MILLS hustled from the gate intent on the lead, raced three wide into the first turn ranging up to establish the front midway on that bend tucking to the two
path, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch settling into a comfortable rhythm while under attendance from LUCKY RAMSEY to
the outside, came under light coaxing and shook away from the field through the latter portion of the far turn, continued just off the inside for home, went
clear under a drive through the stretch getting geared down in the late stages. PURCHASING POWER saved ground detached at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing half a mile from home and went three wide through the far turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to just get up for the
place honors in the last jump. CALCULATED RISKER tracked the pace from just off the inside in range of the leader, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. SO SUBLIME forwardly placed along the inside, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. LUCKY RAMSEY got off to an awkward start tossing his head a
bit and getting away last, raced five wide into the first turn before chasing four wide through that bend, settled four then three wide in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths when shaken off, swung four wide for home and weakened. LE GROS BILL four wide into the opening
bend, raced three wide through that turn and down the backstretch before going four wide through the far turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, continued four wide into upper stretch, tired and had the rider lose the handle on the whip to the off side nearing the finish.

Footnotes
MR PHIL three wide in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, advanced to duel with that rival through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, before shaking away to a safe lead spinning three wide for home, edged clear under a drive through to the finish kept to task. FIRST LINE
coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide for home, offered up a mild kick to
secure the place honors. ITS A WRAP broke in at the start bumping PRINCE OF CAPS, showed the way in hand just off the inside early on before being
engaged by MR. PHIL through the turn, dueled through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and kept on for the show
honors. PRINCE OF CAPS bumped at the start by ITS A WRAP, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for
home and tired. EMANCIPATION GOLD three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no
impact. SPITBALL coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued three to four wide into upper stretch
and tired. NOT SO EASY chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made
no impact.

Footnotes
THE GREAT JOHANNA broke out a step at the start bumping MIGHT BE, chased four then three wide from midpack, tucked to the two path placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, then edged clear to the finish kept busy to
the wire. MIGHT BE bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe who broke outwards a step, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some
pressure from LITTLE SONG to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung two to three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, ran on to secure the place honors well clear of the rest and along second best. LUCKY
MOVE chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a mild bid swinging five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late
stages while clear for the show honors. LITTLE SONG prompted the pace four then three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled six wide into
upper stretch and weakened. PLAY ME A MEMORY stumbled at the start churning the soil for two to three strides before able to right herself and settle into
stride conceding three lengths to the front before ranging up into prominence, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, briefly got out
four wide midway on the turn, angled in to swing two to three wide for home and made no impact. PEACHES AND SPICE off a beat slow without incident,
chased three to four wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUMMER BOURBON inside early on, tipped to the two path just off the pace, remained patiently handled until set down angling four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command just outside the sixteenth pole, inched away under a drive holding
safe to the finish. THE CARETAKER six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and closed well to just latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the wire. BRONX BOMBER coaxed from
the gate, pressed the pace of HUSHION from the outside in the two path, took over command near the quarter pole and went three wide into upper stretch
coming inwards to the two path straightened away, dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth out, weakened in the late stages and just preserved
the show honors at the end. PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. LE GENERAL coaxed from the start, chased three wide in aim of the front coming under coaxing
midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. VICAR'S LEGEND bobbled at the start and was bumped by THE
CARETAKER, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. HUSHION showed the
way in hand along the inside under pressure from BRONX BOMBER to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the
quarter pole and went just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

Footnotes
DOVEY LOVEY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, inched away under a drive to prevail. QUIETUDE broke in at the start bumping FIVE ALARM ROBIN, chased just off the inside on hold in behind
rivals until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. SEA SPARKLE
coaxed from the gate, vied early on with a pair before chasing four then three wide in close aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. QUESTEQ coaxed from the start, vied early on with a flanking pair before emerging
with sole albeit narrow command coaxed along three then two wide, came under pressure near the quarter pole once more, swung three to four wide for
home, dug in under challenge from a host and was displaced a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. CAPE COD DIVA five then four wide in
pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SHESASUPERFREAK four then
five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and bid mildly through the latter portion of the turn before swinging eight wide into upper
stretch, then tired in the drive. WINIFRED J vied early on inside a pair before chasing just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. FIVE ALARM ROBIN brushed the off side stall at the start then got
bumped by QUIETUDE who broke inwards, chased two to three wide growing detached at the tail of the field, continued to lose ground through the turn and
went five to six wide for home well behind and was eased through to the finish.
