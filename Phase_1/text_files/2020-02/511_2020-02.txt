SPIDER RICO pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up two wide to engage for the lead, responded when hooked by MATSON in mid stretch and
dug in gamely to prevail. MATSON stalked the pace to the half, was three wide on the second turn, rallied to get to terms with the winner in mid stretch then
was outfinished for the win. CODE GRAY never far back to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response.
NORTH FORK trailed to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then also failed to rally late. AFFIRMRACER chased to the half, was two wide on the
second turn and could not make an impact in the drive. RIDGE ROUTE hustled to the front, set the pace for five furlongs, was collared leaving the quarter
pole and weakened in the final furlong.

SIERRA SUNRISE was outrun to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to win going away. FELONY ONE
pressed the pace to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not stall the winner while gamely besting
DIAMONDSNCHAMPAGNE for second. DIAMONDSNCHAMPAGNE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, resisted stubbornly to deep stretch but was
outkicked late. PRORIKA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then was closing ground but too late. RAMONCITA LIGHT was outsprinted to the turn,
shifted off the rail mid turn and finished in a mild bid. VACAVILLE SPECIAL trailed to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and also showed some
late interest. PASTORATE tracked the pace two then three wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CLAUDIA JEAN (IRE) was settled for a half mile, bid two then three wide on the second turn, rallied to the front in mid stretch and edged clear under steady
urging. MYLITTLERUNAWAY stalked the pace to the second turn, moved up two wide to engage for the lead, was overtaken in mid stretch then was tiring
but held the place. FOGGY BOTTOM was unhurried to the half, shifted off the rail on the second turn then finished willingly but missed second. AWESOME
DRIVE had no speed, settled to the half, bid three wide into the second turn, swung out five deep into the stretch but could not offer the needed late
response in the lane. ZAKAR set the pace to the second turn, was overtaken into the stretch and tired. KAYLA'S COWGIRL pressed ZAKAR to the second
turn while three wide then got outrun in upper stretch and gave way. LUCKY SARA was always outrun and had the rider drop his whip at the five sixteenths
then stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
POWER TIMES TWO pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to catch SIERRA DANCE in mid stretch and pushed clear driving. TUSCAN
WARRIOR chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded in the drive and tagged SIERRA DANCE for the place. SIERRA DANCE The latter
set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was caught by the winner in mid stretch then nailed on the wire for second. UNION WINE was also chasing to the
turn, raced two wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. LIL' CHIEFTAIN stalked the pace three wide to the stretch then
lacked a closing response. ZIPPY GROOM trailed to the turn, saved ground to the quarter pole, swung out widest for the drive and was gaining ground
belatedly. INTIMIDATE had no speed and saved ground to no avail. MESA JONES was squeezed between HAWTHORNE LANE and UNION WINE at the
start, was very rank, had no speed once settled and was not a factor. HAWTHORNE LANE also had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then weakened
in the drive.
