Footnotes
BARCELONA opened a clear lead shortly after the break, was rated just out from the rail into the stretch and was put to strong urging through the final
sixteenth. GIULIANA VEE chased in the three path then closed a gap through the final yards. NORMANS GIRL GAYLE stayed inside and lacked the
needed closing. MOUSE CAT broke in the air while slow from the gate then made a belated run outside. TWO IN THE BUSH hesitated in the gate at the
break, lagged inside to the stretch and made up some ground. COIN OPERATED stumbled a stride out of the gate, was in tight between rivals entering the
stretch, angled in some but was no fasctor. SINGING THE BLUES stayed out from the rail and failed to matter. TRIBAL PRINCESS stopped.

Footnotes
LITTLE UNITED prompted the pace setter from the three to two path, inched forward and bid for the lead into the far turn, edged a clear advantage
approaching the quarter pole, then held sway through the lane while flagging her tail due to resenting the whip. OUR GRAYCIOUS GIRL was pinched
between horses shortly after the start, but recovered and advanced between horses to a two wide stalking position at the half mile pole, forged place while
chasing the clear leader turning for home, made a rail bid in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch the leader. MISS PINK settled far off of the
pace in the three to four path around the turn while outside of rivals, then stayed on mildly through the lane to reach show late while hanging on her left lead.
WEEKEND SERENADE was off a step slow and jostled a bit between horses, trailed the field around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, and
passed tired horses without threatening. ATHENA IN FLIGHT advanced to stalk in the four path and outside of rivals into the turn, inched forward and made
a bid for place turning for home, but was outkicked by her inner rival at the furlong pole, then weakened and was outfinished for minor rewards. GROTON
ST SCOUT saved ground from midpack inside of rivals, was shuffled back behind the tiring VIBRANT GINGER passing the quarter pole, shifted to the three
path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally, hung on her left lead, and weakened. VIBRANT GINGER set the pace to the turn, but was headed by the eventual
winner approaching the five sixteenths, offered little resistance, and weakened.

Footnotes
BOURBON STREAK began to steady while not far back along the rail early on the backstretch, steadied sharply nearing the far turn, came out into the four
path for room entering that turn, moved quickly to command before three-quarters, drew out entering the stretch and widened under brisk urging. WHERE'S
THE BEN'S ducked into ADMIRATION leaving the gate, began a run outside early on the backstretch, gave his best two wide between horses into the far
turn but couldn't stay with the winner. JUST KITTEN YOU chased three wide outside the early leader around the first turn, moved clear before a half, angled
to the rail nearing the far turn then tired in the lane. MAKIN TROUBLE improved position in the four path around the final turn then flattened out.
ADMIRATION was bumped a stride out of the gate, was slow early, raced two wide around the final turn and failed to matter. FIELD OFFICER raced the
three path and was no factor. HURACAN was eased up through late stretch while outrun. RAVAGE was hustled to the front at once, made the pace two
wide between horses onto the backstretch, stopped and was eased up through the lane. SIDER ON DA MOUND wasn't far back briefly in the three path
then fell far back.

Footnotes
SHARK CITY built a clear advantage approaching the half mile pole, held a clear margin turning for home, hung on his left lead through the lane, tired late,
but held on with a diminishing margin. BYEBYE BYEBYE vied inside of SHARK CITY early on before getting outpaced by him passing the half mile pole,
chased outside that loose leader around the turn, the kept on through the lane as the leader tired, but failed to catch him. FOLES shifted off of the fence to
the three to four path while forging show around the turn, then made mild headway on the tiring leader through the lane after the rider lost his stick in upper
stretch. REDREAMED chased from outside of horses in the four to five path, but failed to keep pace with an inner rival into the turn, then edged fourth
through the lane without threatening the leaders. RICO CHARGES shifted from the four to the three path while midpack around the turn, but lacked a rally
through the lane. TOPSIDE TRADER raced far off of the pace in the five path, drifted inwards turning for home, and failed to factor. LIVING ON THE EDGE
reared in the gate, then was never involved while in the three path around the turn. AT THE ALAMO dwelt at the start and spotted the field many lengths,
swung to the five path into the turn, and failed to make an impact. LORD RED PEAK saved ground off of the pace, but weakened.

EMPRESS OF FORTUNE ducked out leaving the gate, waited for room behind the first flight while in the two path on the turn, angled out entering the
stretch, vied outside the early leader leaving the furlong grounds, was bumped by that one nearing midstretch, lugged into that one soon after and was
narrowly best. TAKECHARGMATRIARCH bobbled leaving the gate, came out, bumped TWO SIXTEEN, stayed along the rail around the turn, bore out
under left hand whip nearing the final sixteenth, bumped the winner, was bumped by that one soon after and gave way. An objection by the trainer of the
second finisher against the winner was not allowed. TWO SIXTEEN was bumped leaving the gate, raced two wide between rivals in the first flight into the
stretch then tired. NEARLY MISSED broke slowly, trailed into the stretch then passed tired ones. NO QUESTION angled well out from the inside early on
the backstretch and failed to menace. SMARTY PI raced three wide with the first flight for over a half then stopped.

Footnotes
THE GREAT CASBY stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path into the backstretch, waited for racing room behind the leading trio turning for home,
attempted to split foes two wide in upper stretch, but was shut off at the three sixteenths pole when the leader drifted outwards, was shut off again by the
same rival drifting again at the furlong pole, then finally surged between rivals inside the sixteenth pole to get up at the wire. MIDNIGHT ACT set a
pressured pace along the inside of rivals, dug in at the quarter pole as SEPICATO put a nose in front and M G BROKER made three wide bid, regained the
lead at the three sixteenths pole, where he drifted out when the rider flipped up a left handed whip, straightened course, but drifted out again at the furlong
pole when the rider used left handed encouragement, straightened under a loose right rein, but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SEPICATO pressed
the leader two wide, inched closer into the far turn and put a nose in front appraoching the quarter pole, but shied away from an inner drifting rival passing
the three sixteenths pole, causing him to brush with M G BROKER approaching the furlong pole, then held that rival at bay through the late stages for show.
M G BROKER stalked in the three to four path, inched closer to vie into the far turn, held position turning for home, but was brushed by an inner rival
approaching the furlong pole, then kept on, but missed show. PATTY'S BOY trailed early on, shifted to the four path into the far turn, then to the five path
turning for home, and stayed on mildly. LET ME GO FIRST settled off of the pace in the four path, but weakened to trail the field at the five furlong pole, and
showed little thereafter.

SPARE KEY was bumped just after the break, made the pace in the two path, ran out into PIPPIN entering the stretch, bore out, brushed that rival in early
stretch and again just before the finish and held. PIPPIN chased in the three path, was brushed while vying outside the winner into the stretch, again in early
stretch then again just before the wire, An objection by Gonzalez against the winner was not allowed. BOOMBA BRAD was unhurried early, stayed along
the rail around the final turn and gained slowly through the lane. TALKING POINT was bumped and fell back leaving the gate, made a run in the three path
around the final turn then gained slowly through the lane. JASPER K wasn't far back along the rail for about a quarter then stopped.

Footnotes
BOX OF GOLD shifted to the three path into the backstretch, advanced and angled to the two path to make a bid bid for the lead in between horses, held a
slight advantage turning for home when her outer foe drifted in and bumped her in upper stretch, but dug in and prevailed over that rival to the wire. MISS
CINDERELLA shifted off of the rail to the four path down the backstretch, came under a drive passing the seven sixteenths pole to make a three wide bid for
the lead into the far turn, vied into the lane where she drifted in under right handed pressure, causing her to bump her inner counterpart in upper stretch,
dueled with that rival through the lane, but was bested. STEADY ROCK prompted the pace along the inside early on, but dropped back to midpack down the
backstretch, commenced a rerally inside of rivals into the far turn, shifted to the four path to be outside of the leaders at the quarter pole, and sustained her
grinding advanced, but failed to make any late headway. ROMAN TIMES advanced along the inside through the far turn, shifted from the rail to the five path
turning for home, and stayed on mildly for a minor reward. JERSEY STORM set the pace, met challenges from multiple rivals into the far turn, relinquished
the lead at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened through the lane. HORIZON failed to get involved while racing in the four to five path. WELL TRIED
stalked in the three path early on, but failed to keep pace with multiple oncharging rivals into the far turn, and weakened. Due to a GPS tracking malfunction,
no times are available.
