MY FRIEND GEORGE chased the leaders to the turn, shifted out three wide into the stretch, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch and held driving.
TOMASINO attended the pace outside of PRINCE CHEVAL, was two wide to the stretch, put that one away to mid stretch but could not stall the winner
while saving second. ROCK SLINGER was outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response.
PRINCE CHEVAL broke a bit slow then hustled up to contest the pace, saved ground to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. THREE
RED SEVENS hesitated and broke about four lengths last, had no speed and was not a factor. FAST SALE also had no speed and was always outrun.

Footnotes
FIRE DIAMONDS raced closest to the leader to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, took over nearing mid stretch and raced clear under steady
urging. BILLY'SGOTASINGLE chased the pace to the half, was three then four wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner in the final furlong but held
off BORN TO REIGN for second. BORN TO REIGN had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide into the bend then swung out and circled five
wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the late stages. FRIEND OF AUTISM settled mid pack for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn
then lacked the needed late response. URBAN DIVA pushed clear to the backstretch, set the pace for six furlongs but was tiring through the lane. CEEYA
LATER had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then was crowded inside rivals nearing the furlong marker, waited then weakened once clear.

Footnotes
FRUITFULLY was rated in the 'catbird seat' to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front leaving the furlong grounds and
held driving. STRATUS BIRD hopped slightly at the start but was quickest to the first turn, set the pace, saved ground to the stretch, was collared nearing
deep stretch but saved second. HI SKOOL SWEETHART pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs then was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and
finished evenly. SKEETER DAVIS was settled to the half, raced two wide to the stretch then closed the gap but was too late. FLORISTA (IRE) had no
speed, also was settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then was making up ground belatedly. LACEY'S RAINBOW was outrun to the half,
raced three wide while gaining on the second turn but flattened out in the final furlong. STORMY MIST had no speed and was not a factor.

ARNO'S MANE MAN trailed to the turn, swung out four wide while rallying into the stretch then continued to respond and was along in time. STOCKED
stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, rallied to engage for the lead in mid stretch, resisted the winner briefly but settled for the place. WRITE ME A
SONG pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then stayed on late but was outfinished. GRAND AIR had the best speed, set the
pace from the rail to the stretch but was overtaken in mid stretch and weakened. PRIKATI had no speed, was off the rail to the stretch then lacked the
needed late response. MERITOCRACY chased the pace to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

PRINCESS RIO had no speed, raced three then four wide on the turnb, rallied when set down for the drive and closed steadily to be up in time. WAY TO
FIRE tracked the pace three wide to the stretch, rallied to take over in mid stretch then dug in doggedly but could not stall the winner in a good debut.
STAND IN YOUR LOVE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide, swung out for room into the stretch, rallied in the drive but was outfinished.
KISS RIDE GOODBYE hesitated then hopped from the gate at the start, lagged while saving ground to the stretch then swung out widest and closed with a
rush. SAILONSILVERGIRL was awkward to begin, had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then picked off rivals in the drive. PACIFIC SILENCE was
chasing to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but flattened in the final furlong. SMILING GRACE contested the pace from the rail to the stretch but
weakened in mid stretch. THECHAMPISFLORING also was a pace factor two wide to the stretch then tired. TAHOE BLUE was through early.

Footnotes
BOLD ANTE had good speed, set the pace in the three path to the half, was two wide into the second turn, got headed by MOON ROCKET at the quarter
pole but responded when roused to push clear to mid stretch and held under steady encouragement. MY IDOL broke out and bumped ENGLISH EMPRESS
at the start, was never far back to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME got outsprinted to
the backstretch, settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, shifted out for room and was gaining ground steadily. MOON ROCKET prompted
the winner to the half, moved alongside into the second turn, stuck a head in front a quarter of a mile out but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
SURE MAGIC settled mid pack to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. ENGLISH EMPRESS was
bumped by MY IDOL at the start, took up briefly, had no speed, was three wide to the stretch then did not threaten. WHY ARE U SO SWEET had no speed
and was never a factor. WAVERLY WAY was outrun to the backstretch, chased three wide to the stretch then gave way. RUN FOR A MILLION saved
ground to no avail.
