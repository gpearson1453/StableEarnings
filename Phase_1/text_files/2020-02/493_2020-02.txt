Footnotes
MAJOR SILAS perfectly place throughout, rallied three wide past duelers in the late going under good handling. CARIGNAN alternated on the lead to late
stretch while outfinished to the wire. MISTER CARSON dueled on the lead to deep stretch, used up and settled for the show spot. HIGLEY O'PRADO well
placed while never far back, failed to respond in the drive. COMBATING saved ground to no avail. MONEY PIT five-six wide first turn, never a factor.
MAGNITSKY well placed to far turn and gave way readily. I'MYOURHUCKLEBERRY very wide around first turn and never a menace thereafter.
GOFORTHEWINECOURSE flashed brief foot and dropped back quickly.

MERCHANTS OF COOL lunged at the the start, regrouped quickly, rushed up three wide into the stretch and prevailed in long drive with stablemate. DARK
OAK inside trip, gamely to wire with stablemate while well best of the rest. BEXAR speed outside to the front, weakened in the stretch run. SHIPPINGPORT
chased pace to the quarter pole, gave way readily. FLATTER ME PLEASE never a factor. CITY FRONT through early, dropped back.

Footnotes
JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, remained clear in the stretch and held sway in the final stages. NEW ROO
chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the inside but had no gain on the winner in the final stages. NAUGHTY
JOKER tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid down the lane but flattened out late while three wide. RUMANDICE raced back
early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. TUXEDO LEMON was unhurried early on, raced along the five path into the
lane and improved position in the stretch drive. TWIN CHANNEL raced along a inside trip and improved position. TIP AT TAPIT broke out at the start and
was through after a half. TOBAGO was bumped and bothered at the start. CARINA was through after three quarters. LESSONS FROM AVERY was never a
threat. TIZ TRISH had early speed then folded up.
