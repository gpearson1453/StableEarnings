Footnotes
TICKER TAPE PARADE moved up near the five eighths marker and prompted in hand outside BLUE DANUBE, moved to command in hand mid turn, went
clear soon after, responded when shaken up past the three sixteenths, drifted in while well clear past mid stretch, kept on under left handed rousing and
held firm. BIG BOOTS stalked inside, angled out mid turn, took up chase of the winner while three wide into the lane, continued willingly but was kept at bay.
BLUE DANUBE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was hounded by the winner into the turn, ceded command mid turn and weakened in mid
stretch. QUICKHATCH , off the pace, was under pressure three wide past the five sixteenths and came up empty. GRAND RIVER , away alertly, dropped
off the pace while wide, came under a ride around the turn but failed to respond. VALADIER , three wide forcing the early pace, dropped around the turn
then drifted in towards the rail.

UMMU UMMU UMMU took over between foes after a furlong, dropped in and set a rate pace, spurted clear around the turn, dug in when confronted
entering the lane, responded to left handed rousing and went back clear nearing the sixteenth pole, kept on under steady hand encouragement and
widened late. LACROSTIX , four wide, ranged up outside the winner in upper stretch, battled on close terms approaching the eighth pole, failed to match
strides with a sixteenth remaining, faded late but managed to save the place. LUCKY JUNIOR lacked speed under urging, picked up some momentum mid
turn, raced four wide into the lane and churned on willingly. AWESOME AGENDA saved ground off the pace, eased out in the final furlong and kept on with
interest. MAJESTIC DOCTOR , outrun early, circled five wide under pressure but lacked a solid closing response. BELMONTE , away alertly, raced three
deep early, forced the pace into the turn and gave way. SHADOW BOXER vied inside foe early on, eased back off the winner near the turn, angled out mid
turn, tired through the final three sixteenths and was eased late.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL BREW saved ground on the turn, moved up in the two path in upper stretch, gained a short lead in mid stretch, lost the advantage to INDIAN
GHOST inside the sixteenth pole then battled back inside that one to get up at the wire. INDIAN GHOST , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four
path near the three sixteenths pole, advanced between horses, gained a short lead inside the sixteenth pole, switched to his left lead late and just missed in
a game effort. WALL , two wide on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. VOODOO VALLEY chased the pace three deep
around the turn, was well positioned near the eighth pole and weakened late. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE , never a factor, raced in the five path in the stretch.
FATHER'S LUCK showed speed, hugged the inner rail most of the race and weakened late.

SUZY Z edged up early and stalked off the rail, bid three deep leaving the far turn, sparred outside KEEPER IN SPITE into the lane, was roused clear in mid
stretch, opened up a bit nearing the sixteenth marker then held sway under pressure. CREATIVE ALIBI dropped off the early pace, circled the turn five wide,
closed steadily and got the place between foes. AWESOME PAL broke a step slow and bumped with SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS, regrouped and advanced
four wide between foes mid turn, shifted in through the final furlong and finished willingly. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS , off slow and bumped, raced well back
while saving some ground mid turn, angled out nearing the lane, picked up steam near mid stretch, altered out late and finished full of run. KEEPER IN
SPITE had speed then rated off back off the leader, bid between foes leaving the far turn, disputed the pace to the inside of the winner into the lane, stayed
willingly past the furlong grounds then gave way. WORKINGONAMIRACLE vied inside then went clear after a furlong, set the pace into the turn, was taken
on by a pair soon after, failed to resist and faltered past the five sixteenths. DOWN WITH BROWN gave early chase towards the inside and retreated.

DETERMINED CHANCE vied inside, dropped back a bit leaving the five sixteenths, found more leaving the eighth pole, came back along the rail and under
steady pressure and got up in the final jumps. PALACE CANDY was sent up up between foes in the opening furlong and grabbed a short lead outside the
winner, moved clear under some coaxing around the turn, wandered a bit under pressure through the final furlong and failed to last. BEAR FORCE WON
stalked the pace, moved up between foes mid turn, angled four wide into the lane, loomed, lugged in and faded. HARP OF GOLD broke slowly, was outrun
early on, angled wide for the drive and only could muster up a slight response. TOP HAT SCRUTINY lacked speed, raced wide in the drive and had a mild
kick. ANTAGONIZER chased off the inside and came up empty. NONNA'S GLORY had speed four deep early, gave pursuit around the turn and weakened.
