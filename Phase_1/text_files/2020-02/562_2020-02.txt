MO CUISHLE stalked the pace three wide and challenged nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead toward the five sixteenths and widened under steady
encouragement. CHARITABLE MISS saved ground off the pace then started a bid toward the three eighths pole, angled to the three path approaching the
head of the lane and dug in to take second mid-stretch. CORKY COWGIRL rated close to the early pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, raced two deep on the far turn but flattened out inside the eighth pole. SWISS THUNDER rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the
three eighths pole, gave up the lead approaching the five sixteenths then weakened at the rail on the far turn. MY COUSIN VICKY raced four wide the first
turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. GLOBAL COFFEE saved ground the first turn then
eased out into the backstretch, though, showed little response. WORKPANSOMETHINGS stalked the pace two deep, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole but faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
IM A TRICKY ONE raced in the three path the opening turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid toward the three eighths pole, entered the far turn in
the five path, was carried to the seven path approaching the head of the lane, dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. SAINTE
THERESE settled off the early pace about the three path then bid leaving the three eighths pole, was carried to the five path approaching the top of the
lane, dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch then relented later yards. KENTUCKY DANCER raced in the four path the first turn and was well off the pace
entering the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, was carried to the six path nearing the head of the lane and finished evenly. CORY'S CUTIE
steadied early and raced well off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little more.
ROCKIN RUTH saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. LADY REBEL rated the pace inside then came under pressure into the
far turn, bore out approaching the head of the lane, was steadily encouraged leaving the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch and weakened. CHANNEL
SURFING settled off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn.

BANISHMENT stalked the pace off the rail then challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep passing the quarter, drew clear inside
the eighth pole, was steadily handled through the upper stretch then taken in hand late. OUR CHARITABLE settled well off the early pace while saving
ground, entered the backstretch outside and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved and came through the far turn in the five path
then got up for second the final strides. JUST A LIL LUKEY rounded the opening turn in the three path then saved ground, bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out into the lane but was nipped from second under the wire. STEP OUT DANCING rated close toward the inside,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide then flattened stride. TAP KING rated the pace inside, was met nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, dueled through the backstretch before relenting the lead past the quarter pole, dropped back into the lane then weakened.
CASTLEFINN saved ground off the pace and showed only mild response through the backstretch. MY HALO rounded the opening turn in the four path then
faded through the backstretch. GO VENEZUELA GO raced off the pace inside and was never a factor.

ABSOLUTE LOVE stalked the early pace from the three and four paths then took over toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail, drifted outward under a left hand drive through the stretch then just lasted.
LONGSTORYLUCY raced well back from early contention in the two and three paths then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six path, was carried outward in the stretch but was gaining on the errant winner. WHIZ PASS settled back in
the three path then bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out in the upper stretch, closed a bit on the top two but was
shut off and checked off the heels of Absolute Love in later yards. GREELEY AND ARIANA settled off the early pace in the two and three paths then bid
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still in the three path then flattened stride. NURSE TOMPKINS saved ground off the pace then bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn, checked from between horses and angled to the outside at the eighth pole but
showed little more. HAY BABY GIRL stalked the early pace from the three path then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail then weakened. HOPEFUL ANGEL raced well back while saving ground, eased out into the backstretch but showed little response. SO
ARISTOCRATIC rated a slim early lead off the rail but was caught nearing the three quarter pole, showed no response through the backstretch and was
eased through the final five sixteenths. The stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Absolute Love, lodged by the rider of Whiz Pass, for late
stretch interference. As a result, the stewards disqualified Absolute Love to third place for drifting across the path of Whiz Pass through later yards.
