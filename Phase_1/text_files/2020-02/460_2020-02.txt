Footnotes
KEYS TO THE PALACE bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well back under urging, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the
stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths, commenced a rally on the outside under a right-handed whip, leaned in some then was switched to a
left-handed whip near the furlong marker, switched back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and closed strongly to get up late at big odds. ONE
MORE JUMP veered in at the start and bumped GRAND PRIORITY into PIPER'S BUTTERCUP, was rated off the pace then asked in the five path on the
turn, gained outside to make a bid nearing the eighth-pole, battled outside of the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the
place. NO QUARTER jostled with a rival early, tracked the pace, moved closer while given his cue in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, battled with the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, lost the lead at the sixteenth-pole and was also
outfinished then just missed the place while able to get the show. JIMMY ONE SOCK jostled with an opponent early, dropped back off the pace, raced
inside to the two path on the turn, altered course inside the three-sixteenths while not able to go through an opening between horses and lacked the needed
kick. GRAND PRIORITY was fractious in the post parade, broke a bit slow then was bumped into another foe and forced in badly, spotted the front several
lengths, raced well back on the outside under urging, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOVEU AND
PROUDOFU was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn and tired. COACH O'SHEA bumped with a rival at
the start, moved in while going to the front, set the pace while inside to the two path, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead at the quarter-pole
and faded. PIPER'S BUTTERCUP broke a bit slow then was bumped and forced in badly, spotted the front several lengths, went two then three wide on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
GREELEY WENT WEST was bumped at the break, settled last but one switching off the fence up the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn
swinging six wide leaving that bend, edged to within striking distance in upper stretch under urging, was bumped past the three-sixteenths pole, struck the
lead a furlong out, drifted in a bit in late stretch while maintaining the lead late over BUCKETS, who was bumped into the aforementioned at the start, raced
on or just off the rail up the backstretch in the back half of the field, moved out three wide coming past the three-eighths pole, came out five wide and racing
between foes to the top of the stretch, shifted in a couple paths in upper stretch to commence a bid inside foes, continued inside the above rival late but
could not get past. WAR COUNT stalked from outside foes mid-pack going three to four wide through the turn, came five wide past the quarter pole, made a
mild and brief bid between rivals in upper stretch whilst drifting out a bit bumping the winner in the process, could not kick on with that foe but saved show
honors. PAY THE DREAM pursued the leader from outside going mostly four wide through the turn while at brief periods going five deep through that bend,
came in a path turning for home while commencing a bid, came out just a bit in upper stretch but was still in contention at the furlong marker and lacked the
needed late kick. GREELEY'S BANKER was corrected at the break after breaking outwardly, given a little encouragement to obtain a more forward position,
went inside a rival but in the two to three path through the turn and appeared not to corner well on that bend, failed to rally in the stretch. PHAT AND FAST
broke a half-step slowly and was in a bit tight at the start as the inside rival broke outwardly, was unhurried trailing early going in the two then three path on
the turn, came out four wide coming to the quarter pole then moved out further in upper stretch while passing tired rivals. PICKETT bumped the inside rival
at the start, was urged forward at that point, prompted the pace from outside a foe coming to the half-mile marker, made another bid leaving the turn after
having gone two to three wide and between rivals but was empty in the stretch. ADRENALINE was urged at the break, set the early pace inside to just
outside the half, was prompted by an outside foe at that juncture but retook the lead a few strides later, led into the turn racing along the rail through that
bend, was overtaken about the five-sixteenths and came up empty thereafter while not persevered with late.

Footnotes
ROBINSON went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch, rallied on the far outside while still on his inside lead and closed strongly to get up late. EKATERINOSLAV went around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid nearing the furlong marker, took
the lead just inside that marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT went around the first turn in the
three path, contested the pace on the outside under a snug hold, took a narrow advantage in the three path on the far turn, was roused while four wide into
the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost the lead shortly thereafter, fought on well into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while drifting out
late but was clear for the show. IRISH HOKIE was reluctant to load, went five wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, was urged along
while four then five wide on the far turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. BALLYHACK bumped with a rival at the start, went
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while five then six wide on the far turn, swung eight wide into the stretch and improved
position. ARABIAN STORY contested the pace on the inside, lost the lead while urged along on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch
and tired. TAAMER bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and
failed to rally. TAPIZART was taken in hand early, raced inside to the two path under restraint on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under
urging in the two path leaving the backstretch, shifted four wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. ZENMAN was bumped on both
sides at the start then pinched back between horses, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled outside near the back, was urged along while four wide
on the far turn and failed to threaten. SPORTSTER brushed with a rival after the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled well back in the field, went
around the far turn in the three path and was no factor. BAYANDBUNNY brushed with a foe shortly after the start, raced in the two path on the first turn,
settled near the back, saved ground on the far turn and showed little. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
STRONG PATRIOT broke outwardly, prompted the pace from outside a foe going three wide early on the turn, came in a path late on that bend while
edging clear, extended the margin after being asked at the quarter pole and held sway. HERO OF GOLD switched off the inside up the backstretch under
mild coaxing forward, was within range going in the two then three path on the turn, came four wide to the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but
clearly second best. CRY LIKE A BABY was brushed lightly at the break, raced between foes in the three to four path on the early part of the turn mid-pack,
edged away from those rivals leaving the bend but could not threaten the top two while getting up for show honors. RIVETRIX dueled inside the eventual
winner, saved ground on the rail into the turn while losing ground on that foe past the three-eighths, switched off the inside past the five-sixteenths,
continued to weaken through the stretch. COLOR FASHIONED was off about two lengths slow and tardy to get into stride, trailed well back in the early
going, began a mild advance just off the rail on the turn, was given some encouragement in upper stretch, moved in a bit in mid-stretch and continued to
improve inside runners late. MY MY MY shifted in early after breaking a half-step slowly, raced inside on or just off the rail through the turn, came out a path
in the stretch while under urging but failed to produce a rally. OUR LUCKY STAR raced outside rivals four to five wide on the turn and was never near
enough to threaten. ROBYNS LUCKYLIZARD brushed the outside rival at the start, raced last but one early still way off the leaders and in the two path into
the turn, continued three then four deep through that bend floating six wide coming to the quarter pole and failed to produce a bid.

Footnotes
SHARP PROSPECT went four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far
turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, moved in while gaining fast into the final sixteenth and got up at the wire under strong
handling. KULIK BEAR was restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while four
wide on the far turn then moved to five wide late on that bend, swung eight wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid into the final furlong, gained the
slimmest of advantages into the final sixteenth but was denied on the wire while just able to get the place. LIMNERY went four wide on the first turn, settled
just off the pace, was asked while three wide on the far turn, chased six wide into the stretch, took the lead passing the three-sixteenths, battled gamely in
the final furlong and just missed in a three-way photo. CLEAR FOR ACTION went to the front, contested the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn,
came under the whip in upper stretch, drifted out while dropping back near the sixteenth-pole and weakened. CLEAR VISION bumped solidly with foes on
both sides at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was urged along while five then six wide on the far turn,
swung nine wide into the stretch then steadied while dropping in over heels, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed
response. BLACKLINE was last to commence then taken up while rank early, saved ground under restraint on the first turn, settled more kindly on the
backstretch, was roused while inside to the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LOGICAL MYTH bumped with a rival
at the start, was taken in hand early then tugged at the bit under restraint, went three wide on the first turn, was taken up late on that bend then reserved
towards the rear, went three wide under urging on the far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. KNIGHT'S CROSS was taken in
hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the far turn and came up empty.
PONT DU GARD dropped back along the rail early, raced inside to the two path on the turns, was driven four wide into the stretch and was no factor. BIG
BEAUTIFUL WALL was fractious in the post parade, went three wide on the first turn, moved up on the outside early on the backstretch to contest the pace,
was asked in the three path on the far turn, dropped back under the whip in upper stretch and tired. MARTIAL EAGLE bumped solidly with foes on both
sides at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
ALTA'S AWARD broke outwardly just a bit, was just a little keen to go on outside a foe three wide through the first turn, moved up inside a rival still off the
inside coming out of that bend, settled better heading up the backstretch, continued under patient handling in the three path through the far turn given a little
more encouragement late on that bend, moved out five wide near the three-sixteenths pole for room, was urged at that juncture with aim on the leader,
drifted out just a bit and was brushed at the wire while getting up in time. PORTRAIT was mildly coaxed from the start to gain forward position, raced outside
rivals four wide into the first turn, eased back off foes leaving that bend still outside and four deep, made a swift move three wide into the far turn to
challenge, took a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, asked for more just past the quarter pole and edged clear, drifted out under left-handed urging through
mid-stretch and again in late stretch under such urging brushing the aforementioned foe at the wire and just failing to last. CHARMING LADY broke inwardly
just a bit then was given mild coaxing, moved through inside to take the lead into the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground on
the far turn on or just off the rail while challenged by an outside rival, asked for more by the quarter pole but could not kick on with the top pair. SHE CAN'T
SING raced just off rivals in the two path into the first turn, shifted to the rail midway on that bend, continued in behind the leaders up the backstretch,
moved out near the three-eighths pole continuing two then three wide on the second turn, was within range three to four wide in upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. EVIL LYN broke outwardly just a bit, trailed while kept in the four to five path, continued about four deep on the far turn, passed a rival in
upper stretch but was not persevered with in the lane. HALAMA pressed the early leader two to three wide, was ridden along about the half-mile marker but
had no response, was not persevered with in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHEERS TO BERTI was away alertly, stalked the pace while in hand, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied two to three wide on the turn, took the lead
just inside the five-sixteenths, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. KING BANDIT was urged along off the pace,
went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. MY PROPHET broke a step
slow then was taken up a bit, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, angled out significantly under a drive in upper stretch and was along
for the show. MY RAINEY DAY was hustled from the start then taken in hand when BOSTON REPO crossed in front, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased three to four wide on the turn and tired. BOSTON REPO was hustled from the start, angled in while going to the front, vied inside on the turn, lost
the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. MYBLENDOFWHISKY settled well off the pace, was
urged along while two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. MAJOR RIDGE was off slow and
spotted the front a couple of lengths, settled towards the rear, was urged along while four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
EL TRISTAN was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, fell at the five-sixteenths then was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry into
the incident at the five-sixteenths, no change was made to the order of finish.
