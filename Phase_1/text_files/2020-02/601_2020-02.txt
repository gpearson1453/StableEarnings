Footnotes
QUINCY EXPRESS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, opened a clear margin
in mid-stretch and drew off through the final yards. TEXAS SWAGGER dueled for the lead while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner in
the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. MY INDIAN WARRIOR was away in good order to duel for the lead with TEXAS SWAGGER while
racing from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. CASABLANCA HOT was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled
out further in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. BAYTOWN MACCA was off a step slow, showed brief speed and weakened. CATABILITY pressed the
pace while racing five-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

the stretch and was ridden out to the wire. ALL TOO SUPER chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clear
second best. SPECIALYKINDACRAZY chased the winner while racing three-wide and gradually gave way. SEBASTIANNA was forwardly placed early,
raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. HENNO MOMO settled off the leaders early, saved ground
through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to rally. HOMEMADE LOVIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a

BRAVE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. RITZY RACER dueled from the inside and
gave way after going five-eighths. MALUSITA'S HOME pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. FORGOTTEN
SLEW lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SOUND PUNCH was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the

Footnotes
STELLARSBLUERIBBON was allowed to settle early, advanced six-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away through
the closing yards. SKEETER WHO chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, responded when challenged by
the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly late. TARGARYCAT showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and
finished with good late energy. KICK IT lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. SEND THE STORM broke
sharply to chase the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way in the drive. BISCUIT SNATCHER disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave
way through the final furlong. CITY LIGHTS WHO dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MARTHAS BOY was away
alertly to show brief speed and weakened. JERSEY VILLAGE settled off the leaders early and gradually weakened.
