SARGE'S DAUGHTER stalked the leader in the early part, moved up three wide around the turn, drove clear and proved much the best. Z PRIDE
unhurried, racing evenly in the middle of the field, made a late bid, was no match for the winner, but got up for second. MISS PAT'S GIRL broke a step slow,
racing in the back, came around the turn wide, rallied down the lane and was outfinished for second. DIVA'S RANSOM raced within striking distance, put
forth an even effort and lacked a late rally. MEMORY MAGIC raced near the back, moved up, but was never a factor. HALF A MILLION void of early speed
and was never a threat. LADY BELACQUA challenged for the early advantage and dropped back down the home stretch. ELEKTRACUTIONER sprinted to
the front, drove clear and retreated to the rear.

NO PAROLE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away late and proved much the best. FREEDOMFI lacked early speed, moved up,
between rivals around the final turn, dueled down the stretch with GUITAR TRIBUTE and was just up for the place. GUITAR TRIBUTE raced near the back
in the early part, moved up three wide around the final turn, dueled with FREEDOMFI down the lane and was outfinished for second. LUCKENBACHER
raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. X CLOWN raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. OUTOFMYBIND raced behind
the leader in the early going, was finished early, dropped back and lost contact with the pack.

Footnotes
BIG EM C raced within contention, moved up, three wide around the turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. I WANT A PICTURE hopped
at the start, racing in the back, moved up six wide around the turn, rallied down the stretch, couldn't get to BIG EM C, but got up for second. SNAPPER
BITE pressed the pace, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two late. PHILLY void of early speed, made a late gain and was outfinished
for third. ZENDELPHIAN raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. MASTERLY lacked early speed, moved up, racing five wide, but was
no factor. BORN AGAIN GEORGE raced within striking distance and weakened. SKYLAS GOLD went to the front, drove clear and faded down the stretch.
RIVER BOBCAT pressed the early pace, saved ground and retreated. FIRE BLASTER raced near the back and was never close.

STEPH'SFULLASUGAR pressed the early pace, took command, pulled away and finished well. OUR LOST LOVE went to the front, took command, proved
no match late for the winner, but held off SABER CUT for the place. SABER CUT forced in at the start, racing near the back, made a steady gain and
finished willingly. SEBS PRINCESS raced evenly in the middle of the field in the early part, made a mild bid, but was no factor. WILDABOUT AUDREY
broke a step slow, moved up quickly, challenged for the lead and was finished early. FILM STUDY raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even
effort. GEORGIA DAWN pressed the early pace and dropped back. JET SWEEP void of early speed, finished wide and was outrun. VACHERIE GIRL broke
in, raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
CHARMING FLIRT lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, drifted out entering the stretch, made a wide rally and drove clear
before the wire. MISS UNDERRATED dueled for the early lead, drove clear, but was no match late for the winner. LONE STAR DIVA raced in the middle of
the field, came around the second turn four wide, made a bid and proved third best. HIP FLASK raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain,
but was no factor. SHE'SAHOLYROLLER pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the stretch. SUGAR PIE STREET
raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CORRECT ANSWER showed brief speed and was finished early. QUICK HEAT
drifted out around the first turn, racing in the middle of the pack and dropped back. MADELYN'S MOMENT drifted out around the first turn, racing near the
back and was never a threat.
