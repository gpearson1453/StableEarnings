FANCY KELLY stalked the pace along the rail into the far turn, slipped through to make the lead before the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip
under strong handling to win as much the best. STAR OF PRIDE pressed the pace two wide, dug in late and gained second along the inside. QUEEN CITY
KITTY broke in front, set a slow pace into the far turn, drifted out to the four path and was outfinished. ALL THE BEST checked entering the clubhouse turn,
rallied three wide into the far turn then came up empty. SHAKE ME DIVA was through after a half. MAGNA MONEY had speed for a half then folded.

Footnotes
MAGNA MAN had good early speed inside, shifted outside the top pair after a quarter, responded readily when set down on the turn, rallied four wide to
make the lead before the furlong marker and won going away under a strong hand ride. GRECIAN PRINCE pressed the pace two then three wide and
finished clear for second. GREG RULES DA away alertly, set a pressured pace in the five path down the backstretch, shifted in on the turn, maintained
control near the three path into the stretch, drifted in a bit late and faded. FRONTLINER saved ground, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch, was
in a bit tight late and leveled off. RULING EMPIRE failed to respond. FIRST GROWTH was through after a half.

Footnotes
LOCK ON matched strides for the lead two wide into the turn, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while in hand.
D'MONEY HONEY never far back, rallied through the stretch in the five path and got up for second. HIDDEN ARTIFACT checked along the inside near the
half mile marker, saved ground the balance of the trip and went evenly. RED CHILL unhurried early, closed a gap late in the three path. SIDNEY'S
RANSOM had speed from the start, offered a bid three wide on the turn then came up empty. GIANT BOO BOO was no threat. YO BERBS had brief speed.
ALMIGHTY STORM battled with the winner along the inside to the quarter pole and gave way.

SILENT CONTEMPT stalked the pace along the rail into the stretch, slipped through to make the lead in a perfectly timed trip past the furlong marker and
won under brisk handling. VINNY BOY pressed the pace three wide, dug in determinedly late and just missed getting up in time. BRONCOJOENVINNY was
hustled to keep contact the entering trip and finished with good courage four wide. MAKES GOOD SENSE broke in front, set a pressured pace two wide
until deep stretch then was outfinished. CATHMOR failed to menace. JOE BAILEY was no factor. CHESTER MON had speed into the turn then faded.
PRAIRIE CHIEF was void of early speed. BADABOOM close up inside into the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
KATALOX matched strides for the lead between horses two wide into the stretch, shook clear when set down and won under mild urging. CHROMIUM
battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch and finished second best. UNION GRACE never far back, finished with good courage in the five path.
AMERICAN SPARROW with the second flight inside, failed to respond. CORKY'S THE NAME passed tiring rivals through the stretch along the inside.
RISKY GUY raced outside and failed to menace. OBSESSIONSOPTIMIST close up, advanced a bit three wide on the turn then came up empty. MISTER
EUROPA dueled for the lead three wide into the stretch then weakened. MASCHERATO was no factor. NOBLE DAVE was through early.
