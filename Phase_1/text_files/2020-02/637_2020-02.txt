LADY WORTHINGTON set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and widened in the stretch run. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) stalked the pace early, was
in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final stages. SUGAR LOVE chased the pace early, was in
the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. LAS RAMBLAS was slow at the start and raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane and
improved position. MALIBU PARTY was never a threat. FRILLS tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive.
STOLEN BEAUTY was bothered at the start and through after a half. SHELLEY'S GEM broke awkwardly then clipped heels shortly after the start and trailed
the field throughout.

stages. STRONG YEN was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch from between
horses but did not have enough in the final stages. PARADE BLUE chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, inched ahead in the stretch
three wide under a long drive but yielded in the final stages. CHASIN CHARLIE raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane, gradually altered out
around foes in the stretch and finished willingly four wide in the final stages. TALE OF FAME came out at the start, chased the pace early, was in the three
path into the lane with some late gain while five wide in the final stages. JOVA broke in the air at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the five path
into the lane and rallied in the stretch with a late gain in the final stages. GET SOME MO set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and gave
way in the stretch run. EAGLE PASS was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch
drive. LEO was never a threat. JUST LIKE RICHIE was done early.

Footnotes
ENGLISH CHALLENGE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, made a bid and drove past the leaders three wide in
the final stages. EL FRANCO pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch from between horses but did not
have enough in the final stages. MJOLNIR tracked the pace early, took over command, was on the inside into the lane, inched clear in the stretch but
yielded late in the drive. ITASCA raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. PLAYFUL HUNTER set the pace
early, was off the rail into the lane and gave way in the stretch drive. UNDERSTAND was never a factor. WISE SOLDIER steadied along the first turn,
chased the pace for a half then folded up.
