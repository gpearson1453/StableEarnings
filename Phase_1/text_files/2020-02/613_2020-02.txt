early lead, saved ground around the final turn, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but held off SUGAR PIE STREET for second. SUGAR PIE

finished evenly. STOP THE FRIEND went to the front, drove clear and faded. LUCKY PRIORITY raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even
effort. CAJUN SHOTS void of early speed and never a threat. WHISKEY TO WINE lacked early speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
PRETTY PRODUCTION pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a stretch bid and proved the best late. MISS KATNISS vied for the early
lead, took command down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but held on for second. BEST GUESS challenged for the early advantage, eased back,
made a late rail bid and finished willingly. BYANYMEANS broke a step slow, racing in the back, made a steady gain, racing inside around the final turn,
made a bid down the stretch and hung. SKEETER raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. SPANISH ARCH lacked early speed, raced
outside around the final turn and passed tired ones. RED FERN DOLL was an early factor and dropped to the back. JOKERS QUEEN raced near the
middle of the field, checked down the backside, lacked running room, faded and was no threat late. SONG AND A SAINT always raced near the back and
showed little.

PLEASANT MOON vied for the early advantage, dueled down the stretch with LITTLE MAN E DUBAI and proved best. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI challenged
for the early lead, dueled down the stretch, outfinished for the win, but held off HOLY SPIRIT for second. HOLY SPIRIT lacked early speed, made a steady
gain, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch and finished willingly. MCLEAN raced near the back, came around both
turns wide and finished evenly. DALE'S LIL BRO pressed the early pace, drifted out around the first turn, weakened and finished evenly. TALE OF THE
BULL went to the front, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. THREE ROOSTER had a tight start, raced in the back and was never
close.

LAURALEE COCODREE raced in the back in the early going, made a steady gain, came around the second turn on the outside, rallied down the lane and
proved the best late. CRIDER CHASE pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn, took command and was outfinished late for the win.

a late bid, checked down the stretch, getting in tight quarters and went to the wire evenly. MY PAL CHARLENE broke slow, raced in the back, came around
the second turn on the outside and was never a factor. BAD GAL RIRI raced within striking distance and was finished early. BEAR TOOTH PASS dueled on
the front end and stopped. THE JOCKEY OF #1 MIGHTY PEGASUS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #7 CRIDER CHASE FOR INTERFERENCE
