came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to
prevail. DARE TO TRY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home, offered up a mild
kick to close in belatedly while well clear for the place honors. SMART SET established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under
pressure from a pair, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed for the front with five-sixteenths to go, cut
the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the drive while along for the show honors. KASHMIR QUEEN coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace from
between foes in the three path down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, swung
two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. MASONS FRIEND chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper

Footnotes
JENNEMILY away without apparent mishap, established control by the conclusion of the chute, took up residence in the two path, rated kindly showing the
way, with the runner up in attendance to the outside, edged away confidently handled as three-quarters was being completed, came up to the
three-sixteenths pole and was asked for more, offered up the desired response and scampered away. STAND FOR THE FLAG prompted the winner hand
urged in the three path, swung into the lane, put in her best bid during the ensuing furlong, wasn't up to the task at hand. HONOR WAY reserved four wide
for six furlongs, lacked the necessary stretch response. MATTY'S MAGNUM underwent a ground-saving journey, was being asked travelling on the bend,
stepped into the lane and backed away. AVALINA two wide entering the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, never made its presence felt.

AWESOME PARTY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong from home, dug in fighting on to the finish coming out slightly a sixteenth out and came back
on to take command steps from the finish and prevail on the wire. ZUZUDINI broke in the air then got bumped at the start by DISTORTED SKY, raced three
wide through the first turn before settling three then four wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in coming in inside the sixteenth marker and was headed for front steps from the
finish and ultimately bested at the end. COWTOWN coaxed from the start and into the first turn, chased along the inside through to the half mile pole when
tipped to the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, paused near the quarter pole in behind rivals before taking the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid with a seam between the top pair, had that lane close down inside the sixteenth marker and was paused
in the late stages behind those rivals, and lacked the remaining ground to the finish to tip out and make an effective run while clear for the show honors.
REPLICANT coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in the early going before tipping out to the five path five and a half furlongs from home, remained
five wide through the far turn put to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. BUBBA CHUCK two then three
wide through the opening bend, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
DISTORTED SKY broke out at the start bumping ZUZUDINI, raced forwardly placed just off the inside, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

SEANOW quickly established control, rated kindly on the front end taking the inside route, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when turned loose,
began the final furlong in possession of his largest advantage, held on late to preserve the decision. HARDCORE FOLKLORE underwent a ground-saving
journey, rallied with willingness to procure the place. TALE OF MIST rode the rail until the end of the bend, angled four wide into the stretch, had a good
finish down the center of the strip for the show. MISTER BOBBY guided into the pocket at the half mile pole, came under a ride stepping out into the two
path for entrance into the stretch, got outfinished. INVEST assumed the role of primary pursuer after bumping lightly with MENTAL MODEL, went about the
task from the two path, was hard-used for most of the trip on the turn, went into the stretch and gave way. MENTAL MODEL got set up in the two path after
making some contact with INVEST in the shadow of the starting gate, was two wide entering the turn and sent out three wide exiting it, lacked the needed
response. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT sat forwardly placed three wide for the opening half,, was moved out five wide for the drive, folded. LATIN LOVE BUG four
wide on the turn, was through after going a half. Due to a telemeter malfunction, split times are unavailable. The final time for the race was hand timed.

tucked three to four wide through the turn put to coaxing three furlongs out, swung five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly with a mild bid to be
along clear for the show honors. THE FORTY FACTOR hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand from the three path, tucked inside into the turn and
came under increased pressure from the outside and was placed to coaxing in response at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front swinging four wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. MALIBU ACTION bobbled at the break then got bumped by BLUEBLOOD who broke outwards, came under
hustling and raced forwardly placed four then three wide before tucking to the two path into the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, faded
swinging five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. BRIMSTONE three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled
six wide into upper stretch and weakened. SO SUBLIME coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide
through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide for home and made no impact. BLUEBLOOD broke out at the start bumping
MALIBU ACTION then got bumped between foes after the start and was lightly pinched back, chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile
