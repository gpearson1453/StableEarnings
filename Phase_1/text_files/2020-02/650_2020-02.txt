Footnotes
EDGEWAY broke well, showed the way up the backstretch while in hand, continued under restraint turn, turned back a brief bid from the runner up entering
the stretch, clear again, slight drift, drew off, ridden out. CYNICAL GIRL away in good order, chased the winner into the turn, tried that one with a brief bid
entering the stretch, proved no match for that rival in the drive, clearly second best. GOOD SHABBOS last away, raced back, four wide midway on the turn
when advancing, finished up best of the rest. TRUE FRIEND went one paced while racing off the inside. TRIANGLE PARK within striking distance along the
inside, weakened in the drive. MOON DATE in the main group outside, four wide into the turn, tired. KISS MO was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
DUKES UP settled off the early pace, angled out steadily to be three wide into the stretch, engaged the leader inside the furlong grounds and wore that rival
down under steady handling. KRISTI'S COPILOT forwardly placed off the inside, took over with a three wide bid late in the final turn, clear past the furlong
marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. ALL ABOUT ASHLEY lacked speed, dropped in a bit first turn, main body off the inside,
three wide second turn, along forf the show, no threat to the top pair. GOOD GOOD raced back off the pace, saved some ground in the second turn,
improved position, no real threat. HOLD ON ANGEL four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside, three out to four wide again in the
second turn, displayed some mild interest to also improve position. CHICORY BLUE moved up inside to maintain position up front into the first turn, dueled
through that bend, vied 2nd bend, faltered in the drive. MALLARD'S BRO void of speed, fanned five turning for home, went evenly while well out in the strip
in the run to the wire. ADULATOR hopped at the start, quickly recovered to duel into the first turn, alternated in the run up the backstretch and into the far
turn, gave way in the drive. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK remained always back. AULT within striking distance while four wide, gave way. ALBIREO off slowly,
was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
IMPACT PLAYER broke well, showed the way up the backstretch under light restraint, turned back a pair of rivals turning for home, drove well clear thorugh
the lane. DUNPH in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, willingly up rail, determined for the place. EBBEN in mid
pack in the two path, came three wide into the lane, outside bid for the place late, outfinished. MUSKOKA WONDER forwardly placed in the three wide,
weakened in the drive. MR. ANKENY off step slow, failed to menace. BULLION pressured the winner in the two path for a half, crept a bit closer late in the
turn, gave way in the drive. PLATINUM NIGHTS off a step slow, four wide turn, nothing left for the drive. FROLIC MORE off a step slow, remained always
back, returned bleeding.

Footnotes
GENERAL TREV unhurried in the early going toward the inside, four wide into the far turn when beginning a strong advance, took over, drew clear, diving.
HUNT THE FRONT void of speed, three wide advance in the second turn, slowly carving into the winner's advantage late, clearly second best. ENERGIZER
settled off the pace while in the two path, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. PINE KNOLL vied up front along the inside, helped set
a glib set of early fractions, weakened in the drive. SPECIAL DAY in mid pack while off the inside, four wide in the second turn, bore out into the lane,
flattened out. BABA LOU broke out and slowly, raced back, improved slightly, never dangerous. SHACKS WAY contested the quick early pace while
between rivals, faltered when the real running began in the second turn. MISSUMAXWELL lacked speed just off the inside, remained always back in lacking
a rally. JIMMIE T was finished after a half, far back. KNOCKOUT BERT pressured the pace while three wide, stopped.

Footnotes
SUNNY DALE away in good order, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch between rivals, dropped to the inside for the turn, clear into the lane,
enough left to last. GOLDEN SECRET within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner
late. GOLD CREDIT settled in mid pack early, also was three wide into the lane, finished willingly while widest in the drive, too late. INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ
pressured the winner from the outside and in the three path, weakened in the drive. NOMIZAR in the second flight in the two path, failed to respond in the
drive. SUMMER STORM lacked early foot, saved ground to no avail. JO MARIE off a step slow, raced back and out in the strip, three out to four wide
turning for home, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TRUE CASTLE flashed early foot along the inside, retreated. MUCHO
MAS remained always back. MARATHON QUEEN steadily faded.

Footnotes
CLASSY ACT broke alertly, vied up front while between rivals, continued to contest the issue into the lane, long drive, narrowly best in a game effort.
PERUVIAN APPEAL prompted the pace four wide, remained in the four path turn, lost some ground to the leaders into the lane, late push, finished willingly
to earn the place. HEADLAND lacked speed, continued to race back, asked along into the lane, shifted out inside the furlong marker, late bid between
horses. THREE CHORDS forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the turn, vied upper stretch, put a head in front inside the
furlong grounds, not enough in the late going to hold. CALIENTE CANDY last away, raced well back, swung out widest for the drive, was going best of all of
at the end while too late. RAINTREE STARLET broke well, vied up front along the inside, came with the leaders into the stretch while continuing along the
rail, gave ground grudgingly. LIZ'S CABLE GIRL in mid pack while racing in the two path, had little left for the drive. IRISH MISCHIEF broke back, moved
outside, four wide turn, showed little in the drive in a dull effort.

SHOCKING FAST broke alertly, showed the way inside, continued to narrowly set the pace through the turn, pulled away steadily through the lane while
being kept to task. TIZ A GODDESS back off the pace and the inside, worked way out to be six wide turning for home, finished willingly to be clear for the
place out in the middle of the strip, no threat to the winner. DIXIE NATION in the second flight in the two path, in some traffic late in the turn, could not match
the top two late, dug in to earn the show. ALENA MARIE vied up front while between rivals, dueled outside the winner through the turn, weakened. GOT A
GOOD NOTION off slowly raced in the main group early outside, raced five wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. EXCHANGE WEST within
striking distance while three wide, came four wide into the lane, lacked a late punch while between horses at the wire. GOLDEN COMMAND back off the
early pace, steadied in traffic late backstretch, three wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive. HOYAM forwardly laced along the inside, empty.
ICAN'TREADTHEODDS raced in mid pack, four wide through the turn, also found lacking for the stretch run. NURSE SADIE off step slow, trailed well back,
not a factor. LIL RESPECT was finished early.

SHARED SENSE outrun in the early going toward the inside, moved out, advanced three out to four wide in the second turn, reached the pacesetter with a
furlong remaining, wore that rival down under firm handling. MARVIN dueled early while off the inside, got clear into the far turn, continued to show the way
into the lane by daylight, responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong remaining, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best.
SHACKLEFORD'S JOY prompted the pace while toward the inside, continued to race in a forward position while saving ground in the second turn, had little
for the top two in the drive, clearly best of the rest. GANGLY turned in an even effort while racing three wide. RANAAN five wide into the first turn, moved
inside, back three wide late in the final turn, made little impact in picking off a couple of tiring rivals, no real threat. SOMETHING SUPER settled off the pace
while three wide, lacked a closing kick. HURTS SO GOOD tired off the inside. TICK TACK MO away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, began
to weaken after five furlongs.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FANTASY broke alertly, raced behind the first flight while still forward and four wide, advanced on the leaders exiting the turn, took over nearing
the furlong marker, clear late, just lasted. AMY'S CHALLENGE also raced just off the first flight, off the inside turn, waited behind the leaders turning into the
stretch, moved out, set down, finished with good energy to be getting to the winner late. WHAT A FOX fell back to trail well back after the start, trailed
through the turn in the two path, staged a mild rally to finish best of the others, no real threat to the top two. MT. BRAVE away in good order, vied up front
while between horses, weakened in the drive. ARTISTIC DIVA last to leave, moved up inside to maintain position with the first flight, contested the pace into
and through the turn, steadily faded up in the drive while continuing along the inside. BREAK EVEN with the pace while three wide, continued to do battle
into and through the turn, gave way readily in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SANTOS DUMONT away in good order, stalked the pace in the three path, moved to take over turning for home, shook clear when straightened for home,
held sway late. DEAN MARTINI five wide when back off the pace into the first turn, pulled when back in the run up the backstretch, three wide second turn,
three wide when called on for some run in traffic turning for home, finished willingly to be up in time. KOWALSKI tucked in to same some ground in the first
turn, within striking distance, showed some mild interest in the lane to finish best of the rest. MO AND GO went one paced while racing toward the inside.
WARRIOR'S MAP four wide into the first turn, raced back, five wide in the second bend, improved slightly, no real threat. OCTOBER SURPRISE bumped at
the start, void of speed, remained back, toward the inside into the far turn, two path through that bend, angled out into the stretch, picked off some tiring
rivals while never a threat. KICKIN' KIRBY dueled up front closest to the inside, faltered in the drive. JASIRI bumped at the start, bit rank into the first turn,
remained back. STEELY DANZA four wide most of the way, lacked a rally. TIME HEIST dueled up front in the two path, stopped in the drive.
