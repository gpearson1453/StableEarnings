Footnotes
JEN TAKE CHARGE vied for command inside AERODYNAMIC for six furlongs, shook that one off into the stretch and widened under pressure. PLATINUM
PAYNTER hugged the rail throughout, and finished well without seriously menacing the winner. AERODYNAMIC alternated for command outside JEN
TAKE CHARGE to the quarter-pole, weakened into the lane and was able to salvage the show spot. LASKA was slowest to begin and unhurried early
inside, swung four wide for the drive and gained mildly outside. COLORADO CLASS raced two wide on the turns, and posed no threat in an even effort.
MATCHA vied inside JEN TAKE CHARGE through the stretch the first time, deferred and went along pocketed behind the leaders, and came up empty
through the lane. SINGSONG BIRD had aim off the battling leaders three wide into the far turn, but gave way soon after completing six furlongs.

Footnotes
DIXIELAND HUMOR raced three to four wide off the early speed then circled up into contention near the quarter pole, put to a drive racing five wide
entering the lane, held a slim lead near the furlong marker then kicked clear under firm handling. LUXE DIAMOND angled inside and tracked the top pair in
early stages, hustled up along the inside around the turn then remained in steady pursuit up the inside through the lane and gained place. TOONIE LOONIE
hustled to the lead in opening stages, remained on top then challenged by IMPRESSION GIVEN nearing the quarter pole, dug in and repelled bid leaving
the turn, battled back for command at the eighth pole then failed to kick on with the winner and weakened to show. IMPRESSION GIVEN was forwardly
placed positioned just off the early leader, moved up and vied for the lead with TOONIE LOONIE at the quarter pole, could not match strides entering top
stretch but remained close then faded a furlong out. SNAKE N SHAKE raced inside off the early speed and bumped with MAMA JO near the half mile
marker, moved out and raced wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. TAPIZAR GIRL raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then moved into
stretch run two wide and failed to move into contention. MAMA JO raced off the early speed and hustled up between foes, made contact with SNAKE AND
SHAKE near the half mile marker then faded in the turn. AURORA NATION showed response in a forward position in the opening quarter then dropped
back and had no late response.

Footnotes
COMBINATION broke out but was quickly corrected, went along covered up behind the leaders for a half-mile, shifted out three wide into the lane, overtook
ZIPPY under a drive a sixteenth out and moved away on the wrong lead. ZIPPY set the early pace pressed from both flanks, edged away after a half-mile in
the two-path, could not handle the winner late but was best of the remainder. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER ranged up four wide outside the leaders to loom a
threat past the five-sixteenths, but flattened out through the furlong grounds. FIVES WILD bumped lightly with DON FAGER at the start, came under a ride
four wide off the far turn but could not gain. DON FAGER bumped lightly with FIVES WILD at the start, vied inside rivals early, and tired after a half-mile.
FANTASIZING pressed the early pace three wide, and was through after a half.

Footnotes
ASK FOR BODE slightly bumped with rival nearing the first turn then held a slim into the backstretch, set a pressured pace then moved away from WINTER
AT BASTOGNE while taking on the challenge from DREAMING OF CARATS, repelled bid nearing the quarter pole, had plenty left in reserve when roused
for more, stayed sharp in response and pulled away. MAVERICK KITTEN settled off the early pace, continued patiently handled along the inside around the
far turn then given cue entering top stretch, showed response driving two wide and cleared second best. STONECASTLE clipped heels not too long after
the start, dropped back and angled inside, raced near the rear and saved ground through the far turn, switched out top stretch, showed response and
advanced to captured show. ABRUPT raced in tight quarters and steadied slightly nearing the first turn, raced off the pace in early stages and continued
near the back turning for home, prompted two wide top stretch and improved position. DREAMING OF CARATS stalked the pace down the backstretch,
loomed up to challenge the leader near three eighths pole, could not reach equal terms with rival then steadily weakened in the lane.
VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ raced in tight and steadied nearing the first turn, raced midpack then launched a bid along inside around the far turn, raced in
contention then failed to sustain bid and gave way. INDIRECTLY brushed with foe nearing the first turn, raced in range while rated down the backstretch,
launched a bid between foes at three eighths pole, hustled along into upper stretch then failed to move on. STRONG ENDING raced wide into the first turn,
settled off the early pace, moved up to race four deep near three eighths pole then lacked a needed rally when called upon. WINTER AT BASTOGNE
applied pace pressure to the leader down the backstretch then gave way around the final turn. STARSHIP BUBBA was briefly fractious in the gate, checked
sharply midway on the first turn, and dropped back.

Footnotes
WHAT'S INSIDE sat chilly saving ground behind the leaders for three furlongs, eased out for running room at the top of the stretch, responded readily and
overhauled FULLY LOADED from outside under confident hand urging. FULLY LOADED pressed the pace outside EARTH from the start, wrested
command passing the eighth-pole, finished gamely but could not hold off the winner. MARCELINO was outsprinted to the top of the lane in the two-path,
shifted further out and closed steadily outside to get the show. EARTH set a pressured pace inside, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. GRAN
SAMAN saved ground outrun for three furlongs, moved to the two-path for the drive and could not mount a serious threat. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE)
raced in the second flight throughout, and lacked a late response on the fence. KRSTO SKYE encountered some traffic behind the leaders approaching the
top of the stretch, then did not have enough between rivals when clear. GRAN MALBEC was forwardly placed three wide early, and faded through the late
stages. SLEEPING GIANT stayed in range early four wide, but gave way before reaching the stretch.

QUALITY SPECIAL took the lead and crossed over to the inside in early stages, remained the leader down the backstretch and kept clear around the turn,
took on the challenge from inside running RED FOG at head of the lane then came under attack from outside running MONMOUTH DR, fought back
determinedly past the furlong marker, continued to find more under strong handling, dug in gamely and held on. MONMOUTH DR tracked the pacesetter to
the far turn then launched a bid near the quarter pole, roused along the outside into the lane, continued to edge up closer moving out wider while under left
handed pressure, raced wide in aim for the late lead but could not get by game winner in time. RED FOG stalked the pace down the backstretch then
launched inside bid around the turn, moved up to race just off the leader upper stretch, continued in striking range but lacked the needed surge to get by.
UNCLE GREGORY raced five wide off the second flight near the half mile marker, prompted along the outside around the turn, raced six wide into top
stretch and failed to move into range of the clear top trio. THATS ALL HE WROTE stalked the pace and raced between foes at the half mile marker then
failed to keep pace past the five-sixteenths pole and dropped back. I STAND CORRECTED was forwardly placed out of the gate, raced between foes and
steadied slightly in early going, weakened from between then had no response, retreated and eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
KITTEN BY THE SEA quickly showed in front, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, and responded well to stay clear under a drive. MUSIC OF LIFE
saved ground on the turns in easy striking range, moved out in upper stretch with aim in the two-path, finished well but could not reach the leader. I AM
MAGICAL (GB) saved ground in the second flight for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and rallied mildly. SO CHARMING raced three wide on the first
turn, moved in a path after that and failed to threaten in an even effort. SHIKAKA prompted the pace outside KITTEN BY THE SEA, got shaken off turning
for home and faded. SHE FLED THE SCENE was taken out three wide around the first turn, and failed to become a factor. STRELLA'S WAR was four wide
early, and tired after six furlongs. ROONEY trailed inside throughout.

Footnotes
FRANK'S LEGACY was forwardly placed along the rail, switched out a path leaving the backstretch and headed in pursuit around the turn, put to a drive
upper stretch, steadily edged up closer on BLACK HOPE then moved by late. BLACK HOPE sped to the lead and continued on top through the turn, saved
ground entering top stretch then put to a drive, dug in determinedly on top, came out wider then failed to hold off FRANK'S LEGACY in final stages. MY
MAE DAY lacked kick from the gate and raced in the back, showed interest along the outside moving around the turn then raced wide in the lane and stayed
on evenly to collect a share. DR G'S HOPE raced four to five wide not too far off the early pace, urged along the outside around the turn, gained position
then raced five to six wide entering the lane and had no late response. FREDDY SOTO raced in contention and chased the leader into the turn then came
up empty and dropped back. MALETTA raced in contention between foes then failed to keep pace and dropped back upon entering the turn.

Footnotes
STURGEON set a pressured pace inside to the stretch, dug in when confronted by MACHO BLUE, and gamely prevailed while drifting out. BY THE SEY
SHORE saved ground tracking behind the leaders for three furlongs, moved out with aim in upper stretch, and finished with good determination outside
rivals to get up for second. MACHO BLUE bumped with WILD ONE FOREVER at the start, stalked outside STURGEON to the stretch, appeared poised to
go by entering the final furlong, could not do so and weakened between the top two in the closing yards. WHAT'S TO BLAME brushed the right side of the
gate coming out, steadied on the rail past the three-eighths, moved out widest at the top of the lane, and rallied while moving back in through the late
stages. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR chased after the leaders three wide to the stretch, and faded. CLAMOR went to the turn between horses, moved in cutting
the corner to the lane and could not gain. WILD ONE FOREVER took the worst of a bump with MACHO BLUE at the start, and was outsprinted throughout.
