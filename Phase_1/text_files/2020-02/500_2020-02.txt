Footnotes
GODDESS APHRODITE settled early from the inside, saved ground into the lane, shifted out and split near the sixteenth pole and edged ZACKEE for the
victory. ZACKEE chased from the outside, bid alongside LINDA AND MINDA on the turn, lost a bit of ground into the stretch, re-bid in the lane but lacked
the needed late punch to get by the winner. LINDA AND MINDA set the pace from off the rail, angled in entering the turn, pressure from the outside and
kicked clear again into the stretch but could no match the top pair in the final sixteenth. BRITE TAN off a bit slow to begin, raced along the inside them
moved out into the two path, continued in the lane to the stretch and finished willingly. JADE LUCKY SEVEN tracked off the rail, went three wide into the
lane and never responded when asked. SEATTLE'S CODE trailed the field up the backstretch, went two wide around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MERGIE TROID raced off the pace from the inside, angled out upper stretch then angled back inside near and bumped rival near the sixteenth pole, split
foes and got up at the wire. PRINCESS RUN IT vied three deep into and around the turn, gained a short lead into the stretch and was caught at the wire.
SOPRESCIOUS vied between rivals for the lead to the lane, fought gamely through the final furlong and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SPACERIKA
settled off the rail, two wide on the turn, angled out leaving the turn, closed from the outside and missed the show. SIENNA vied for the lead from the inside
and was outfinished in the late stages. LAST DANCE BELLA off the pace in the early stages, raced a bit off the rail then outside a rival, came three wide
into the lane, bothered by rival in the upper stretch and showed a mild response to gain ground through the late stages. VIRGINIA HALL chased from off the
rail then angled in ear the five sixteenths marker, continued along the inside to the turn, looked to advance but lacked room, came off the rail then angled
back to the inside, bumped by rival near the sixteenth pole and weakened. There was a Stewards' inquiry involving the winner MERGIE TROID and
VIRGINIA HALL. After a review, the Stewards ruled that although there was contact between the runner at the sixteenth pole. MERGIE TROID beat
VIRGINIA HALL to an opening between rivals first and the contact did not warrant a disqualification.

DARK AND DANDY reserved in the beginning, off the rail to the turn, angled out and went outside a rival on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied
to the outside of MR BINGLEY in the stretch, floated out and got up under a drive. MR BINGLEY sent for the lead, dueled from the inside with STREET
PUNK, cleared that rival and came out entering the stretch, lugged out through the final furlong and caught in the final strides by the winner. BAJA
WARRIOR stalked from the two path into the turn, three wide nearing the eighth pole and went evenly for the show. STREET PUNK dueled from the outside
to the turn, failed to match strides around the bend and entered the stretch two wide and weakened. CANADIAN WARRIOR unhurried up the backstretch,
traveled a bit off the rail, lugged out on the turn and had little left for the final furlong.

Footnotes
CUTE TALKER stalked the top pair near the inside, swung out entering the stretch, rallied from the outside and nailed SLIGHTLY at the wire. SLIGHTLY
chased the pacesetter from off the rail, challenged for command and gained a short lead, cleared that rival and traveled three wide into the stretch, led
through the final furlong but was caught on the line. ANA LISA threw head, hesitated and broke in, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced two wide then
angled out and showed a late rally to gain third. FOREST WILDFLOWER raced off the rail then outside a rival to the turn, went two wide into the stretch and
edged for the show. PLAN B sped clear soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch, lost command and pressed from the inside, lost ground leaving
the turn and tired in the final furlong. The Stewards reviewed the start of ANA LISA and ruled that she caused her own problems as the gates opened and
therefor is declared a starter. THE ONE-QAURTER FRACTIONAL TIME IS NOT AVAILABLE.
