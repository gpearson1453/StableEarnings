the stretch and extended her lead under urging. FLIGHT DATA set the pace to the turn, fell back entering the stretch, finished evenly and held for place.
LUV IS ALL U NEED broke out, raced in close, challenged three across on the turn, dropped back, continued willingly and earned show. PONTIFICATOR

Footnotes
TOWARDS THE LIGHT set the pace while racing well off the rail, drew off on the second turn for a clear lead and extended the margin under urging. JUNE
TWO FOUR raced mid pack inside, angled out for the drive, bid seven wide and got up for place while no threat to the winner. FRANKIE MACHINE was
never far back, raced inside, lacked a rally despite left handed urging, earned show and was best of the rest. HALLIE'S HERO raced in the back, went eight
wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. OUT OF PATIENCE was not a factor. UTANDREAM broke slowly and was crowded at the start, raced far
back and passed tiring rivals. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT was crowded and steadied into the first turn, pressed the pace, tired and stopped on the second turn.
OH BROTHER JACK was crowded and steadied into the first turn, showed speed to the second turn, tired and stopped. The rider of NO HARBOR IN
SIGHT claimed foul against the rider of TOWARDS THE LIGHT for alleged interference on the first turn. No change was made.

Footnotes
FRANCES ANNA vied around the first turn, set the pace, drew off on the second turn for a clear lead and just lasted under steady urging. LOOKOUT
TAYLOR broke in the air to be away slowly, saved ground mid pack, shifted out into the far turn, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. LA MER held a
good position, was roused on the far turn, had little left for the drive and held safely for show. HERE'SLOOKINATYA did not threaten in an even effort.
MARIA lacked a response in an outside trip. EXTRA GORGEOUS stumbled at the start to be off very slowly, fell far back and passed a tiring rival.
CASHMERE BLISS vied inside around the first turn, pressed the pace, was through after a half, stopped, was eased and walked off. The stewards' posted
an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

IKNOWYOURFACE got away alertly, was steadied slightly, set the pace and held well in a driving finish. TIZ THE STORM stalked the pace while racing
outside, bid willingly, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. PERFECTLY SEASONED raced close to the pace, lacked the needed late
response and settled for show. STELLA SWEEPER raced in the back, bid inside on the second turn and didn't have enough late. SHOELESS JACKSON
raced mid pack, lacked a rally and failed to menace. SOPHIE T was outrun in an even effort. BELL OF RAINIER was not a factor. HI SKOOL SWEETHART
stumbled at the start to be off slowly, raced six wide along the backstretch and was through after a half.

Footnotes
MR VIEW was well placed, went six wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up late. MIGHTY MICK dueled to the upper
stretch, inched away, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. FLY FIRST CLASS pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back entering the turn, went
willingly to the wire and didn't have enough late. BUBBA BAY was never far back, raced outside, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.
LINEMANS CHECK failed to threaten in an even effort. OHTANI dueled to the upper stretch, weakened and faded through the stretch. ZERO SUM GAME
saved ground and failed to contend.
