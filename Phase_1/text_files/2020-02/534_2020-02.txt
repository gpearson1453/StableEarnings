Footnotes
CHERRY TWIST showed good speed and set the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead into upper stretch,
battled gamely in the final furlong, drifted out under a left-handed whip late and prevailed under strong urging. BEADSINTHETREES tracked the pace on the
outside, made a bid in the five path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, came under a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, began to drift
out into the final furlong then switched to a left-handed whip, continued to drift out while in front into the final sixteenth and was caught while able to get the
place. MONARCHOS PRAYER showed speed then was taken back just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into
the stretch, drifted out while in pursuit of the leader nearing the furlong marker and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. DAYLIGHT DEELITE broke
a step slow while bumping with a foe then was taken up in tight quarters, settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to
threaten. JADED ROSE broke a half-step slow while bumping with an opponent, settled off the pace, was asked while four then five wide on the turn, spun
six wide into the stretch and came up empty. BORN TO D' WILD stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging in the three path on the turn
and retreated. D'FREAK NASTY was urged along at the back on the outside, went six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON brushed with a foe at the start , went three wide on the first turn, settled nicely off the pace, rallied four to five wide on the far turn,
closed fast to get the lead just outside the five-sixteenths then quickly moved clear, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew away under
strong urging. RESILIENT RICK went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, advanced two to three wide into the far turn, checked behind
horses at the three-eighths, dropped to the rail around the five-sixteenths and secured the place while unable to threaten the winner. RUN TAPPY went
three wide on the first turn, lagged well behind, advanced three then four wide early on the far turn, shifted six wide while gaining around the five-sixteenths,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and flattened out while well clear for the show. MR. PAPILLON shifted four early on the first turn, settled off the pace,
was urged along while two to three wide early on the far turn, moved to four wide late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF brushed with a rival at the start then was sent hard to the lead, went to the front, raced in the two path on the
first turn, set the pace under pressure from his outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost the lead just outside the five-sixteenths and stopped.
VINYL was sent hard from the start, went around the first turn in the five path, prompted the pace on the outside, came up empty while four to five wide on
the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
BEAR TRAPPE was urged at the break, raced outside foes in the four path just off the lead through the first turn, continued to attend the pace in the three
path up the backstretch, moved to challenge in earnest on the far turn still racing removed from the inside and taking over from SMITHWICK on that bend
moving clear by the five-sixteenths, drifted in having reached upper stretch and in command, was tested late but just lasted. TWO MIKES N DOC G was
forwardly-positioned five wide outside rivals headed to the first turn but eased back and shifted in to about the three path entering that bend content to track
the leaders from off the inside, continued in the three path behind the winner, gradually edged closer to that one through the stretch while drifting in about
the sixteenth pole despite left-handed use of the whip and just missed. SUMNER was just a bit fractious in the gate then tossed his head just slightly at the
start, lacked early speed bringing up the rear saving ground on the rail through the first turn and advancing inside foes on the far turn, came out to the three
path turning for home then was guided out a further path or two in mid-stretch and was gaining but too late. REIGNING WARRIOR raced inside foes saving
ground on or just off the rail through the first turn in the back half of the field, took closer order still inside up the backstretch heading into the far turn, came
out five wide leaving that bend and nearing striking distance but offered no late kick. MAKING A MARC was caught five wide into the first turn moving in a
path early on that bend, raced off the leaders from outside up the backstretch continuing four to five wide on the far turn and having edged a little closer into
upper stretch but had no late bid. TRUE WEST came out a bit at the break, went between foes in the three path into the first turn, raced mid-pack off the
early leaders still near but just off the inside up the backstretch and into the far turn going two to three wide on that bend and shifting six deep coming to the
top of the lane, was urged along in upper stretch but never near enough to threaten. HONOR MISSION was taken up a few strides out of the gate as the
inside rival came out a bit and outside foe moved in a bit, regained stride and was caught outside foes four deep through the first turn racing toward the
back, continued outside rivals up the backstretch and four to five wide on the far turn while being asked for run outside of the three-eighths pole, failed to
provide the needed response. FOOLISH PRINCE had brief speed between rivals three wide into the first turn, dropped back leaving that bend and chased
momentarily in behind from the three to four path, continued to drop back going mostly in the three path through the far turn and was empty for the drive.
SMITHWICK set a pressured pace inside, gave way by the top of the stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE MYTH broke out and bumped solidly with a foe, disputed the pace on the outside in the three path, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, came under a right-handed whip at the furlong marker, remained under the whip until the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to
the wire while best. MO GAYLE went around the first turn in the two path, was urged along in the second flight, went two then three wide early on the far
turn, angled six wide just inside the three-eighths, turned into the stretch under a drive, chased the winner on the outside under the whip and was second
best. GIRLS IN CHARGE was bumped solidly at the start, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue while four
wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and tired while clear for the show. TEMPLE OF ROSES was hustled to the lead, set the pace while inside to the
two path, was urged along against the rail on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated. FOLLY broke out at the start, went five wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went five wide while hard ridden on the far turn, floated seven wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. MOYNE SPUN went four then three wide on the first turn, dropped in early on the backstretch, lagged at the rear, went two
then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
DAAHERACHEL broke alertly and quickly moved clear to dictate terms up the backstretch racing just off the fence, began to widen late on the turn still in
the two path, was shaken up in upper stretch, given a few right-handed reminders near the furlong marker and left-handed ones near the sixteenth pole en
route to drawing away. STEALING SUNSHINE was forwardly-placed tracking along the inside, went on then just off the rail on the turn, came out just a bit
for the drive and was no match for the winner but kept on to get the place. ANGEL'S CUT shifted in up the backstretch racing mid-pack, saved ground inside
foes along the rail through the turn, kept on late to get up inside for show honors over FASHION'S TOUCH, who switched outside a rival up the backstretch
stalking while several paths removed from the rail, went in the four path through the turn coming five deep into upper stretch, tired late to lose several
positions. HEIDI'S WISH broke outwardly just a bit, moved in to the three path in pursuit of the leader and eventual winner into the turn, gradually lost
ground on that one and faded in the stretch. CLOSE TO ME reared at the start losing about three lengths, settled into stride moving up willingly heading to
the far turn, was nearly between rivals leaving the backstretch but dropped back and switched out a path going in about the three path through much of that
bend, came out a further path for the drive but lacked the needed late rally. ARKANSAS ALLEY raced outside foes in the three to four path in the back half
of the field through the turn coming out six deep past the quarter pole and under urging but was never near enough to threaten. BAYLOR broke a step
slowly, raced off the inside in the two to three path through the turn and drifted out a bit in upper stretch while not a factor. CANT HIDE MY CRAZY broke a
half-step slowly and steadied at the start, raced inside at the back heading to the turn, moved out to the two path early on that bend then the three path by
the latter part, came five deep into upper stretch and was tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S GALAXY was extremely reluctant to load, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up five wide on the turn, made a bid outside the
five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed whip while still on her inside lead outside the furlong marker, drifted in
inside that marker and held under steady urging while remaining on her inside lead to the wire. ACE DESTROYER was hustled to the lead, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, kept on well in the final furlong but missed
while able to get the place. HOLD ME BLACK settled off the pace, was urged along while three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and finished willingly for the show. THERE AND BACK was hustled from the start, moved up to press the pace on the outside, vied in the three path
while urged along on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and was out-kicked. MORE THAN A. P. broke a step slow, was urged along at
the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TOM'S LAST GENERAL broke a step slow, moved up into
a good position just off the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn, shifted to the two path outside the quarter-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
UNCLE MOMO broke on top and quickly moved clear to set the pace inside up the backstretch, abruptly came out a path entering the turn, faced mild
pressure and some coaxing past the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out a bit despite right-handed use of the whip in upper- to mid-stretch, was given steady
urging to the wire and held sway. CAVALRY CHARGE was coaxed forward at the start, obtained forward position stalking the leader going three wide on the
turn, edged closer under encouragement out of that bend, was hard-driven in the lane but couldn't get past while just saving the place from. SYMPHONIC ,
who bumped the inside rival at the start, recovered and moved forward while shifting in to track the leaders along the rail through the turn, began to come
out leaving that bend coming in the four path past the quarter pole then angled out a further two paths near the three-sixteenths, took aim and was gaining
late. STEADYTILLREADY broke outwardly just a bit, was in good position outside runners pursuing the leader, went four wide through the turn coming five
wide past the quarter pole and still in range but weakened inside the final furlong. GREENBACK was bumped at the break and consequently lost his path in
the early going relegated toward the rear along the inside, saved ground through the turn advancing inside rivals and ran on evenly in the stretch.
HURRICANE DANCER was in good position tracking behind the leaders from off the inside up the backstretch into the turn going in the three to four path on
that bend, came out five to six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. DONTNEEDANAME broke a half-step slowly, raced wide on the turn going in the
four to five path and coming out seven deep past the quarter pole, was never near enough to threaten. TORNADO BOY raced between runners in the back
half early, went in the three path through the turn coming out a path leaving that bend and failed to produce a bid. KINGSTON STREET was outside rivals
early toward the back, went five wide into the turn moving in a path on that bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
PIECE OF MY HEART went four wide on the first turn, settled outside in the second flight, stalked four wide on the far turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, took the lead inside the quarter-pole, shook clear under a strong hand ride outside the furlong marker, drew away under strong hand urging
into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement while much the best. WASIYAH went to the front, set the pace on the inside through
moderate fractions, was asked while under heavy pressure from MOM'S PASS at the five-sixteenths, was headed near the quarter-pole, dropped back
under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while just able to earn the place. MOM'S PASS raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace
on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, led under a drive into the stretch, lost the lead to the
winner shortly thereafter and also proved no match then just missed the place. CAZADORA went around the first turn in the two path, settled in the second
flight, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, drifted out significantly under a left-handed whip in upper stretch,
switched to a right-handed whip while dropping back around the furlong marker and came up empty.
