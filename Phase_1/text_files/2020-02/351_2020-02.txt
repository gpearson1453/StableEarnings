Footnotes
SPECTACULAR ROAD broke readily, was urged to the lead dictating the pace off the rail racing to the turn, went clear into upper stretch and was kept to
steady pressure. SUM OVERTURE, urged inside rivals pursuing the pacesetter, switched outside that foe racing into the turn but couldn't gain even terms
with that foe while proving best of the others. GREELEY'S FAREWELL, restless in the gate, broke slowly while caught in close quarters, was urged to make
some progress inside foes racing into the turn but had no final bid. TAKEDOWN tracked off the second flight in the four path early, angled inside racing into
the lane and proved no real threat. FORTY FATHOMS shifted three wide tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, emptied out after a half.
STOCK proved no factor.

DRINKS ON MAGGIE was urged inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening stages, shook clear nearing upper stretch and extended the margin under
firm hand urging. ALLURING APPROVAL was urged prompting the pace outside the eventual, couldn't match that foe leaving the midway point of the turn
but continued grudgingly outside a rival into the stretch to prevail for the place honors. KONZA KHROME tracked just off the first flight between foes racing
to the turn, was urged to contest second in the closing stages between foes but was outkicked. THIRTY NINE SEVEN settled between foes in the last flight,
was prompted to advance while angling inwards nearing the lane but made no impact. IT'S TWO HOT BENNY was settled inside foes in the opening
stages, switched out three deep nearing the lane but offered no rally. PRIMA GOLD proved no factor.

Footnotes
SCAR, reserved well off the second flight while angling inside in the opening stages, was prompted to gain some position inside foes after a half, shifted off
the rail nearing upper stretch, angled out three wide entering the lane and produced a stout rally to collar AGRIPINO in time to gain the advantage under
firm left handed encouragement. The latter sped to the fore along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace in hand through the backstretch, went well
clear when prompted racing into upper stretch but was collared nearing the wire. LORD BYRON tracked the leaders between foes, then outside a rival in
second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep leaving the midway point of the far turn while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards a bit
pursuing the winner into upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with that foe and had no late response. O'HAIRE was settled outside foes in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, continued in that path to upper stretch but finished willingly gaining
position to the end. DOHKO, prompted to a forward placing while angling inside, tracked just off the the first flight inside foes racing to the far turn and came
up empty entering the stretch. PRETTY CHITU, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter in early stages, was prompted to briefly challenge that
foe midway through the far turn but soon gave way. OHIO EAGLE tracked off the first flight three deep to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half.
COOLISTHERULE angled inside tracking off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out to race between foes entering the far turn but offered no rally.
STARS IN THE PARK proved no factor. DRAMA AN VICTORY was always outrun.

Footnotes
BRANDT was urged through close quarters at the break to dispute the pace inside a rival while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, pressed
the issue through the turn while being headed between calls racing into upper stretch, then continued under firm left handed pressure to edge forward late to
prevail in a resolute effort. STRIKING HEIR tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three deep racing into the turn
advancing on the leaders between foes, struck the front between calls racing into upper stretch, pressed the issue to late stages but was just outfinished.
KING DADDIO broke awkwardly brushing the gate, then bumping J'S FLASHY HALO while being steadied off rivals at the start, was collected settling well
off the leaders, gathered momentum switching out racing into upper stretch, then angled back to the rail in the closing stages while finding his best stride
late to prevail for a share. NICOLE MUNNINGS, held up momentarily avoiding tight quarters at the start, tracked off the first flight racing in the four path in
early stages, angled inwards to make some progress racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. J'S FLASHY HALO, bumped at the start,
recovered to track the leaders between foes in the opening stages, was fanned four wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance in tandem
with a rival and came up empty racing into upper stretch. SAVAGE MUSIC angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival, then between foes racing into
the turn and gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
BARREL OF STOUT, off a step slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, gathered momentum splitting foes after a half, shifted out four wide advancing to
contention racing through the far turn, moved to challenge for command in that path in upper stretch and wrested the advantage in the closing stages under
firm handling. DOPO LAVORO was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, advanced three deep racing into the far turn to bid for
command nearing upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but proved only second best. TRAVEL AGENT tracked off the second flight
inside a rival in the opening stages, shifted out after a half gaining position between foes continued between foes to upper stretch but was outkicked by the
top pair. HAY BO settled along the inside in the opening half, shifted out racing into upper stretch and continued evenly between foes. BROWN ESSENCE
was settled outside foes in the last flight early, was caught wide racing through the far turn, then angled six wide entering the lane to gain some position in a
belated effort. THREENINETYTWO moved to the fore while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half, dueled
inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the stretch. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, never gained
contention. CREDIT CYCLE, caught wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued five wide on the far turn and steadily faded. SKY
KNIGHT tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening stages, was prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn but proved
empty in the drive. GARBAR BOY, forwardly placed along the rail, was steadied sharply off the pacesetter nearing the first turn, tracked just off that rival
along the inside to the backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
TRACY ANN'S LEGACY, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command through the turn to the lane and gamely held FIGHTRESS to the
end under firm left handed pressure. The latter angled inwards to force the pace outside foes racing into the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch
contesting the issue in a prolonged drive but was outfinished. WINNING QUALITY, urged along pursuing the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn,
shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly. CHECOTAH, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, bid inside that foe
racing into upper stretch but flattened out late. SUNSET EMPIRE broke slowly, angled to the inside, then improved position between foes late after altering
course slightly racing into upper stretch. ANIMAUXSELLE settled between foes, shifted out five wide leaving the midway point of the turn and continued
outside foes while finishing willingly to close the gap late. FACTS DON'T MATTER tracked off the second flight between foes, angled out four wide leaving
the turn and made some mild progress late. SUMMER FROCK tracked off the second flight inside foes, shifted out racing into the lane but had no rally.
DOMESTIC VIOLET was a brief factor tracking outside foes in second flight, raced four wide into the stretch and faded between foes. MINTAKA BELLE
dropped out early.

Footnotes
PLEASANT BUFFY broke readily, angled inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin outside a rival racing into the turn, lost the advantage to that foe
nearing upper stretch but continued resolutely under right, then left handed pressure to produce a second effort to prevail in time. SWEET GELATO, urged
to gain a forward placing along the rail prompting the pacesetter, bid for command leaving the midway point of the turn to gain a brief advantage but proved
only second best. ELUSIVE AURA tracked off the second flight five wide in the opening stages, advanced on the leaders four wide racing through the turn
but lacked the needed final bid. BOSS OF THE HOUSE was settled outside foes in early stages and passed tiring rivals into the stretch. VICTIM tracked off
the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded into the stretch. TRACK MAGIC tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages and
never seriously menaced. MONJA, restless in the gate, exchanged bumps with TORNERO at the start, made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes on
the backstretch but emptied out early. TORNERO restless in the gate, exchanged bumps at the start with MONJA, switched out four wide just after the start,
was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders in the opening quarter but gave way early. ALLEZ ALLEZ settled while angling to the inside nearing the turn but
never seriously menaced.

Footnotes
JACK THE CAT reserved outside foes racing out of striking distance three deep to the backstretch, readily advanced when prompted racing four wide into
the far turn, continued outside foes into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. I AINT TELLIN, off slowly,
was settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, split foes just off the inside
racing into the stretch advancing in close quarters to challenge for command nearing the wire but was just outkicked. STUNNING BABY was rated tracking
just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out while being urged to challenge in upper stretch, gained a brief advantage but was
collared nearing the wire. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT, settled between foes off the second flight in the opening half, steadily gained position between foes
between foes on the far turn, shifted out three deep to challenge for command between foes but was outfinished for a share. EMBATTLED moved to the
fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, shifted out while being roused to resist a rival's bid but gave way in the drive.
GENERAL was settled between foes racing to the backstretch and failed to seriously menace. FLEDERMAUS tracked off the second flight along the inside
and faded into the stretch. PAUL CANE saved ground to no avail. ENGLISH SECRET was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter for six furlongs and
gave way into the lane. YOU'LL LIKE IT was a brief factor outside a rival tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but was through after a half.
