PATROL coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, nudged WANDERING WEST
straightened away for home, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final eighth taking command a sixteenth out, then inched away to
the finish to prevail. TWELTH MAN broke in when hustled from the gate and bumped SIXTEEN TONS, prompted the pace from the outside four then three
wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair, got
collared a sixteenth out and ran on to preserve the place honors safely on the wire. SIXTEEN TONS bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased
six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid to the eighth pole,
weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. WANDERING WEST coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, got nudged straightened away by PATROL, then weakened through the stretch. FIXATION coaxed from the
gate, chased two to three wide growing detached at the tail of the field, came under a ride from three furlongs out, went three wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. SPEAKING OF CREDIT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from TWELTH MAN to the
outside through swift splits, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then folded in the
drive.

Footnotes
INCLUNATION away in good order, tipped to the outside on the chute, patiently kept watch towards the rear for the opening half, departed the backstretch
stationed near the four path, steadily advanced into contention, was given his cue challenging in earnest entering the stretch, charged to the front during the
ensuing furlong and kicked away. FIRST DAWN sat reserved in the two path for a good portion of the opening six furlongs, swung into action by swinging
four wide into the lane, rallied with enough willingness to win the place. BRONXVILLE grabbed a narrow advantage after the field had been released,
showed the way, well rated early, and feeling some pressure from a pair of opponents positioned in paths two and three for six furlongs, got turned loose for
the drive home, relinquished to the winner soon afterwards, then got collared late for second. TRUE BLUE GIANT worked out a tuck into the two path at the
top of the bend, was moved to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, went wider and wider until approximately six wide a furlong later, closed in, ultimately
settling for the final significant slice of the purse. SPLIT VERDICT pressed the issue as the widest of three from path three for nearly three-quarters, stepped
into the lane and gave way. SMIDGE prompted the pace two wide from between rivals until the end of the bend, faltered. OUR AMERICAN STAR quickly
spotted along the rail, failed to slip by a rival in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, ventured onward and retreated to last.

Footnotes
STONEZAPPER retained a prominent position after breaking forwardly placed, stalked the pacesetter three wide until the end of the bend, got cued up
issuing a challenge as the field turned into the lane, took charge during the ensuing furlong, then held well late to stay in the clear. SHARP STARR was
gathered after bumping lightly into the left side of the starting gate, settled in stride bringing up the back of the pack on the backstretch, kept an eye on the
leader going about the turn from the four path, as the widest of all, angled one farther off the inside for the drive home, straightened away and rallied for the
place. BANKERS DAUGHTER raced at or very close to the two path drafting behind CHARLOTTE WEBLEY until the quarter pole, angled out three wide for
the drive home, made no headway in the final furlong. DANCING KIKI pursued the front runners from the three path, was more in the second one entering
the stretch, mustered up a mild response en route for the last major check. STEAL MY HEART three wide entering the turn, was in path four exiting it,
lacked the needed response. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY established the top after the start, showed the way at or near the two path until the quarter pole, was
put to test springing from that station, succumbed and readily backed away. GIRL'S WAVE took up the chase towards the two path, inched closer to the rail
in time to cut the corner into the lane under a drive, failed to fire appreciably. MAD FOR FAME kept watch from the two path in midpack, went one wider into
the lane, had no rally. HAVIN' A PARTY hard to load, broke without incident, tracked the pace from along the inside route, without the benefit of being
covered up, stepped into the stretch and folded.

ITS A CHANCE coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, took over narrow and brief command at the three-sixteenths before being headed a furlong out, dug in dueling through the final
eighth taking back a slight advantage a sixteenth out, dug in gamely to prevail. DAZZLING SPEED four then three wide in aim of the front, remained
patiently handled until set down four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong out, dug in dueling with the aforementioned foe and
drifted out slightly near the sixteenth marker getting headed for the front, fought on game to the finish but was ultimately staved off while clear of the rest for
the place honors. REMEMBERING BOBBIE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn placed to coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. KINKY SOX chased along the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. ORBILICIOUS four to five wide in pursuit down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun three wide at the head of the stretch and passed
tired rivals in the stretch. BECCA TAKES CHARGE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from ITS A
CHANCE to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded
the front with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened through to the finish. APPRECIATE three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs
from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. SHE'S A LUMBERJANE chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail at the half mile pole,
came under a ride three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HERE COMES HELEN brushed the near side stall at the
start, chased five wide down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn and steadied off the heels of REMEMBERING BOBBIE who tucked in front,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. BARBARA P took the overland route seven to eight paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, came under a ride at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. HEARTSTRINGS brushed the near side stall at the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch and tired. SUMMER FANTASY three wide in pursuit from just off the pace,
tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ARISTOCRATIC established control in short order, got guided onto the two path, showed the way on a lead that was loosely-contested until the final stages
of the run around the bend, saw the runner up hitch up as the second fraction was being finalized, settled in as a spirited tussle got ignited before getting
asked for his best in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, was craftily maneuvered inward beginning from deep into the furlong grounds, putting
the squeeze on LIFE IN SHAMBLES just a bit but not enough so as to light up the inquiry sign, battled on with good determination directly abreast of the
nemesis and would not be denied. LIFE IN SHAMBLES got set up in the pocket on the backstretch, was rated along keeping an eye on the winner, without
another providing much cover, crept up springing from the five-sixteenths marker, turned into the lane side by side with the top one and got asked for more,
didn't appear intimidated as ARISTOCRATIC was guided over closer for the final furlong, was valiant to the wire only to fall short. WIN WITH PRIDE
pursued the pace from path three, stepped into the lane then had a good finish down the center of the strip to earn the show. NO DISTORTION took up the
chase from the four path on the turn, went into the lane about as wide, lacked a solid closing punch. HAWAIIAN NOISES stalked the winner two wide for a
half, and gave way. BLESSED HALO travelled three wide, doing so from between rivals for a good portion of the journey on the bend, came up empty.
SWIPING DAN sighted in path two and pulling left on the turn, angled five wide into the stretch, had no offering. PREAMBLE off a length the slowest, raced
two wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one wider, failed to make its presence felt.

BRONX BOMBER established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path until tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently
handled through the turn, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, dug in under a drive holding well and safe to prevail. MORGANTOWN
chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, ran on to
secure the place honors on the wire. FREUDIAN SIP four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths near the eighth pole and kicked on belatedly shying in a bit and brushing QUINTARELLI inside the sixteenth
marker and then once more at the finish while along for the show honors. QUINTARELLI chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting brushed inside the sixteenth pole by the aforementioned foe while
offering up a mild kick. BULWARK five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and was outkicked through to the finish. TEN TWENTY NINE four to five wide down the backstretch,
tucked three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch, made up ground through to the finish
while making no headway position wise as the rider paused through the final forty yards in behind BULWARK and QUINTARELLI. CENTRIST seven paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. POSSETIZZLY chased along the inside, was bumped in tight along the rail by OH MY PAPA near the half mile pole as VENTUS
tucked in to the three path putting the squeeze on QUINTARELLI and OH MY PAPA from the outside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
swung just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. VENTUS broke out at the start bumping COOLBOY, chased four wide down the
backstretch, tucked three wide near the half mile pole and in turned put a trio of rivals in tight to the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
six wide for home and tired. OH MY PAPA chased just off the inside down the backstretch, got put in tight between foes and was jostled around bumping
with POSSETIZZLY, to his inside before steadying off the heels of QUINTARELLI into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off
the inside for home and made no impact. COOLBOY bumped at the start by VENTUS who broke outwards, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. PAPA JIM chased five to six wide
down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven wide for home and tired. BUSTIN HOFFMAN a
bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased three then two wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no
impact.

Footnotes
KEPT TRUE one of three breaking in line with each other, disputed the pace from the two path, spun into the lane on near even terms with
STONESINTHEROAD, issued a three wide challenge a sixteenth down the road, emerged at the eighth pole in charge, drifted out slightly with
approximately a sixteenth remaining, but held on well to stay in the clear. CASH OFFER got taken back after the start, pursued the front runners towards the
two path, with the rider applying pressure on the right side all the while, swung three to four wide into the lane, failed to dent into the margin, went on to
secure the place. HAY FIELD off the inside throughout, travelled three wide on the turn, got set down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, angled one
path farther off the rail for the drive home, vied with CASH OFFER for second, came up the vanquished one. BLUEGRASS JAMBOREE brought up the
back of the pack during the initial stages, stepped onto the turn from the two path, got taken to the outside leaving the five-sixteenths pole, wound up in the
five path upon completion of the move, made no headway. STONESINTHEROAD away well, grabbed the advantage early, moved over to the inside route,
showed the way, shadowed by the top one to the outside, succumbed when put to the test by that opponent at the three-sixteenths pole and steadily backed
away. OUT OF ORBIT remained along the inside route after the start, got checked when in a bit tight while directly abreast of the second place finisher at
the top of the turn, got going once more after losing some momentum for about three jumps, was asked for more prior to the quarter pole, got steered into
path two in midlane, had no rally.

Footnotes
LET'S MAGA broke out at the start bumping TAKE IT ALL BACK, showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down
spinning three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. QUEENOFEVERYTHING broke
awkwardly in the air and conceded two lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn,
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide at that station, ran on to chase the winner home along well clear of the rest and second best.
MISS ROSS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors.
TAKE IT ALL BACK bumped at the start by LET'S MAGA, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch
and weakened. ANGELS AND US seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. FUNDERELLA chased three to four wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. MAGICAL ROMANCE chased just off the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. SASSY SECRET eight to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired. UKIAH chased along the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. LOVELY ESCORT hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside
early on before tipping to the three path as the leader took to the two path five furlongs from home, got taken hold of near the half mile pole and lost some
ground and position into the turn, chased along the rail through the bend, cut the corner into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.
