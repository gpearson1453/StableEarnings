SHOOTERS ALLEY set all the pace from the inside and drew away in the lane to be well clear under a strong hand ride. HYPER DRIVE stalked the pace,
raced towards the inside and was no match for the winner. I CALL SHOTGUN stalked the pace, raced three deep through the drive and had no response.
SUPERSTYLE was slow early, saved ground and never was a factor. NAIVASHA MONTANA broke sharply to the outside, raced three deep and never
threatened. BEAR'S THE NAME pressed the pace and tired readily. Due to a timer malfunction some fractions have been omitted.
