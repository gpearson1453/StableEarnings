ones. QUEETEN raced within contention and faded. KANSAS CITY ZIP went to the front, drove clear and was finished early. ADIOS YANKEE raced within

Footnotes
PURIM KING bothered at the start, racing from the back, moved up down the backside, came around the final turn four wide, was challenged by HARD
STORY at the head of the stretch and pulled away before the wire. HARD STORY raced within contention, made a bid at the head of the home stretch,
couldn't keep up with PURIM KING, but was a clear second. U COMPLETE ME pressed the pace, raced forward throughout, finished wide and proved third
best. JR'S SAUVAGE bumped at the start, raced near the back, made a mild bid, but was no factor. CLEAR THE NILE was an early factor, dueling on the
front end, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. IZZY B WINN broke out, bumped, raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even
effort. HOLD ME KAT raced near the middle of the pack and lacked a bid. PRIVATE REALITY lacked early speed and was never a threat. HAPPY
JOURNEY always raced near the back and showed little. BLUEWATER CAT went to the front, drove clear and stopped.

speed, made a steady gain and was a clear second. SET HUT dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. SHOOTERS
ALLEY pressed the pace, eased back and finished evenly. SHIP STALKER lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. WHO DATAWAKI

advantage and was finished early. CHIEF KNOCKAWAY raced near the back, came around the first turn five wide and showed little.

Footnotes
UNION REBEL stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up around the final turn, got through on the rail, drifted out entering the stretch, took command,
was all out and held on well for the win. HAWKS PEAK void of early speed, moved up wide around the final turn, made a late rally and finished willingly.
ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a bid and proved third best. LANDONESE raced
near the middle of the field, made a rail bid and hung late. COWBOY CITY raced in the middle of the pack, eased back, moved up and finished evenly.
CAJUN DUDE raced near the back, came around the first turn five wide and was never a threat. TRULY THE ONE challenged for the early lead and was
finished early. JOBIM went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and dropped back. BROKE IN A FLASH dueled for the early lead and retreated to the
rear.
