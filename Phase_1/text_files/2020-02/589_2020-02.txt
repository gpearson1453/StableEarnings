terms with that one. GENERAL PADDY stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the second turn, dueled with LAST PROMISE from
mid stretch and finished on equal terms with that one. DOX FOLLY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the
stretch and held the show. WHISTLE ME HOME well placed and outside, looped three and four wide through the second turn then flattened out in the lane.
NATIVE HAWK fractious in the gate was unprepared at the start and had a mild gain in the lane. SLICK AS ICE mid pack and inside bearing out, steadied

Footnotes
SAMMY'S TOWN tracked the pace, angled out and moved to a striking position outside the leader, shook clear through the turn, then drew off the final
furlong. WILDCAT MERRY unsettled in the gate, broke out at the start, sprinted clear, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then held the place
under steady pressure. DONNAMEUP exchanged bumps after the start, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady
gain and missed the place. KATIE FALOONA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out mid
stretch and got up for a share. K KITCHEN unsettled in the gate, hopped at the start, looped widest through the turn and into the stretch and passed tiring
rivals. DATING exchanged bumps after the start and steadily lost ground. COCOA KEELY well placed, looped four wide through the turn and had no rally.
AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DONNAMUEUP AGAINST THE RIDER OF SAMMY'S TOWN WAS NOT ALLOWED

one. SWEET DADDIO stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, dueled with that one
and hung. SIMPLY GREAT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out the final furlong.
SUNSET EMPIRE well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. FEISTY CHI CHI
ran evenly three and four wide. MS. AMETHYST broke a step slowly at the start and passed a tiring rival, widest. ADONAI BLESS broke out slightly at the
start and showed little.
