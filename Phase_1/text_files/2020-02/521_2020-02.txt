Footnotes
OVERBEARING moved on pace dueling inside of rival on the turn, began to assert control near the eighth gradually edging away as best. I'M EVER
READY hustled up early pressured dueling abreast rival to upper stretch, ceded to rival outside the eighth pole becoming leg weary late hanging on for
place. LABYRINTH off slowly lagged well back through the turn, showed some life from the eighth pole gaining ground to the wire. I'M FEELING LUCKY
away alertly pressed early then faded on the turn laboring down the lane. STORM PEAK was always outrun.
