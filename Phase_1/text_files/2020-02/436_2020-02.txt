Footnotes
TOMS CHUCHU pressed for the lead abreast rival on the turn dueling from the three and four paths down the lane prevailing under full extension. ASTRO
ORBITER broke sharply to the early lead, hooked on the inside on the turn dueled from the rail down the lane battling to the end. CAZMAN flashed early
speed then dropped off into the turn, swung out seven wide in mid stretch would finish with a rush. FRIENDLY WAGER tracked the pace coming in range to
upper stretch going all out there four and five wide lacking late response. SANTO BRUNO faded on the turn. BACARDI TRICK played no factor. VOLCANO
BAY was always outrun.

others. EVEN IF was well back early. SAINT GLORIA stalked the pace dueling abreast rival on the far turn wilting in upper stretch. BETTER VIBES bucked

Footnotes
VOW'S SON prompted the pace shaking clear along the inside in upper stretch holding to outside pressure late. ESCALERA well back early fired five wide
in upper stretch closing in quickly at the wire. CLYDE PARK stalked the pace pressing up to duel on the far turn, extending into upper stretch would weaken.
REPLAY slow early cane five wide into upper stretch improving position from mid track. CHAIRMAN GAREY hustled out pressured the pace through the far
turn wearing out the final eighth. WAR AT SUNRISE played no factor. PUGET SOUND was never involved. FLIGHT MISSION chased through the far turn
wearing out in upper stretch. GUEYDAN raced mid pack giving way in upper stretch.
