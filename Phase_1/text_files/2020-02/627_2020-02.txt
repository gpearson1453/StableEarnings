Footnotes
SPECIAL LIAISON was away last then raced two to three wide entering the first turn, steadily edged up into closer contention down the backstretch, loomed
a danger late on the far turn, given cue upper stretch, responded willingly and pulled away. ANDIAMA secured inside position on the first turn then settled
near the inside in early backstretch, switched out a path and steadily moved up into closer contention around the final turn, was put to a drive five wide top
of the lane, continued a steady bid and cleared second best. MADAME MOON was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, picked up the pace
then swung out leaving the final turn, roused six wide top stretch then came in a couple paths under right handed pressure and rallied up to capture a share.
CAMELLIA GAL applied pace pressure to LIZA down the backstretch, briefly matched strides then held a slim lead at the quarter pole, could not match with
the sharp winner top of the lane then steadily weakened. GINGERONMYMIND tracked the pace along the inside through early stages, launched a bid
entering the far turn then had to wait for racing room at the quarter pole, switched out a path top stretch, hustled along then moved back to the inside but
failed to kick on. PINK PEPPERMINT was forwardly placed and stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced to duel for the lead with CAMELLIA GAL
near the quarter pole, stayed on with response at head of the lane then gave way. MALIBU TOO raced off the early pace, angled out wider at the quarter
pole, was under a drive five wide entering the lane and failed to advance. LANESBOROUGH raced in range along outside then faded in the final turn. LIZA
was off to a good start and led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace along the rail to the far turn, briefly matched strides with CAMELIA GAL
then came up empty near the quarter pole and dropped back. GREY JAZMINE dropped to last after the opening quarter, trailed then lost contact with the
field, pulled up before the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LEXI was never far back, began to get rolling approaching the three-eighths pole, collared PICK UP THE FONE from outside turning for
home, and drew off under confident hand urging merely flashed the whip late. PICK UP THE FONE grabbed the lead early and moved inside, was
powerless to deny the winner coming off the turn, but ran on clearly best of the others. PRINCESS ULELE saved ground to the stretch, drifted out under
left-hand pressure into the last eighth of a mile, and plugged along clear for the show. LADY ARCHA was driven along three wide with no response on the
turn, and dropped back. MISS MAC was outrun three wide. ABARRIO FOREVER prompted the pace outside PICK UP THE FONE, and faltered after a
half-mile.

EXTRA EXTRA was away in good order and quickly advanced to the lead, continued on top around the first turn then set the pace and saved ground down
the backstretch, remained comfortable on top while still unleashed around the final turn, roused for more top of the lane, responded, had more in reserve
and held clear. WINNING FACTOR settled nicely and raced near mid-range along inside to the far turn, picked up the pace along the rail then roused two
wide top of the lane, drifted out wider under left handed encouragement and continued a steady bid for second best. RAGS FOR BRITCHES was forwardly
placed around the first turn, stalked along the inside down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid late on the far turn then chased one evenly through
the lane. BARBIE'S KING raced four wide off the pace then moved to the inside around the final turn, urged up the inside in the lane and had a mild improve
without threatening. DILLON ROCKS steadied slightly entering the first turn then stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, launched bid for the lead near the
three eighths pole, kept on with response into upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. KINGS HIGHWAY raced near mid-pack positioned outside of
a rival, raced off the top trio and ridden along entering the far turn, flattened out near the quarter pole then offered no late rally. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH was
a bit slow into stride at the start then raced five wide entering the first turn, raced two to three wide in the last flight the hustled up two wide top stretch and
failed to move on. QUICK CHARGE got in tight and was forced to be taken up sharply nearing the first turn then showed little.

Footnotes
PHILOSOPHY became edgy in the gate prior to the start, bumped with AMERICAN ROCK SALT while coming away alertly, dueled inside KEEP IT UP
around the course and held on gamely. KEEP IT UP alternated for the lead outside the winner through a race-long dispute, and came up second best. GINS
AND TINS eyed the battling leaders from the two-path to the stretch, moved out a bit and rallied mildly. DOCTOR DUB was pocketed on the rail behind the
duel nearing the stretch, lugged in thwarting the rider's attempt to slip out to a readily available seam in the three-path through the furlong grounds, and
could not be fully set down. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA bumped lightly with DOCTOR DUB at the start, lacked speed and passed only stragglers.
STRATEGIC OUTLOOK raced in striking range three wide to the stretch, and lacked a bid. WAHOOWAH was outrun three wide. AMERICAN ROCK SALT
bumped with PHILOSOPHY at the start, and was through early inside.

Footnotes
ROMAN EMPIRE was allowed to settle out of the gate then raced in range and tracked the front runners along the inside, angled out and headed in pursuit
upon entering the far turn, loomed a danger three wide at the quarter pole then swept by along the outside at head of the lane, drew off on top under right
handed pressure then stayed sharp while ridden out in the final sixteenth. FREEDOM FORCE was forwardly placed racing three to four wide in striking
range of the top two leaders, roused forward and vied for the lead with SHAW around the far turn, was no match when the winner swept by upper stretch but
stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. SHAW vied for the lead from the outset and continued to duel with SOUL REFLECTION down the
backstretch, fought back when challenged by FREEDOM FORCE on the far turn, had no kick left in reserve to move on upper stretch, weakened but
remained well clear over the rest. CHINOMADITO was edgy in the gate then a step awkward at the start, raced in range along the outside down the
backstretch then came up empty and retreated in the far turn. SOUL REFLECTION vied for the lead at the start and continued to battle down the
backstretch then came up tired and retreated leaving the three eighths pole. CRUMB CAKE had no response, trailed and eased in stretch.

Footnotes
HE'S SUPER LUCKY ambled along unhurried early, moved fast five wide to contention nearing the quarter-pole, hooked up outside VERDICT IS IN as they
kicked away from the others, and prevailed after a stretch-long dispute. VERDICT IS IN dropped over inside letting the early leaders fight it out, was content
to follow along to the far turn, responded readily with a four-wide run to maintain position just inside HE'S SUPER LUCKY as they ran past the leaders
together, and was edged after a long drive. MR. CESCO trailed inside for most of six furlongs before shifting three wide late on the far turn, and rallied mildly
on the far outside to pick up the show. MY MAE DAY was four wide entering the backstretch in the middle of the group, joined the battle up front after a
half-mile still well out in the course, and gave way into the lane. FREDDY SOTO was three wide in range early, moved in tandem with MY MAE DAY putting
in a bid between horses after a half, but faltered through the stretch. EL GRAN CACAO bumped with DR G'S HOPE after the start, vied for command inside
to the top of the stretch, and weakened on the rail. DR G'S HOPE bumped with EL GRAN CACAO after the start, vied outside that one through the first half,
remained in the thick of things to the end of the far turn, and could not keep pace from there.

Footnotes
KILLA DEE raced five wide in range of the leader through the backstretch, let out a notch and moved up to duel three deep for the lead nearing mid-turn,
shook free leaving the turn then kept clear under steady encouragement. VERY AMUSING raced in contention and chased along the rail through the
backstretch, swung out leaving the turn and continued a steady effort for the runner up spot. RAYO MY KING held a slim lead through early stages then
vied for the lead around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner out of the turn but stayed on with response for show. BEAST MODE was hustled
along from the gate then came under whip action but had no early speed and trailed in the opening quarter, moved into upper stretch three wide, showed
interest and improved. C'ERA UNA VOLTA chased the pace racing in close contention through early stages, flattened out near mid-turn then chased on
evenly through the lane. STATE OF WAR was forwardly placed and raced just off the early leader, vied between rivals mid-way around the turn, could not
move on with the winner out of the turn but stayed on with response then faded in the final furlong. GRAN CAUSEWAY began to advance up the rail then
lacked room and checked past the five-eighths pole, swung out and raced wide into the lane and offered no late rally. SLICK STAR chased up close two
wide between foes through the backstretch then weakened around the turn. CAN'TTAKEITWITHYOU raced five to six wide and failed to move into
contention.

Footnotes
AMERICAN NINJA broke in at the start bumping GOSILENTLY into LEAVEEMATTHEGATE, settled in the middle of the pack three wide for six furlongs,
rallied in the four-path into the stretch, shifted in joining the leaders from outside a sixteenth out and edged clear. CHEYENNE BULL raced well back toward
the inside after six furlongs, moved out a bit finding his best stride entering the final furlong, and finished with good courage to get up for second.
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL was outrun inside to the far turn, moved off the rail starting to gather momentum four wide approaching the stretch, and finished
well outside the top two. G Q COVERUP vied outside GREAT KAHUNA through demanding fractions, and weakened in the final furlong. GREAT KAHUNA
dueled inside G Q COVERUP through a sharp pace, and weakened in the late stages. NATIONAL HONOR raced in the two-path in midpack to the stretch,
and was crowded and checked in traffic between horses late. DAKOTA'S DUDE saved ground in range to the stretch, and was crowded and steadied along
the rail a sixteenth out. DISCREET HEAT raced in striking range three wide for six furlongs, challenged for command into the stretch, was crowded a bit
when AMERICAN NINJA ranged up to his outside past the furlong marker, lugged in with his head cocked toward that rival and checked between horses
near the sixteenth pole, and dropped back. LEAVEEMATTHEGATE got bumped by GOSILENTLY at the start, and was outrun in the two-path.
GOSILENTLY got bumped into LEAVEEMATTHEGATE by AMERICAN NINJA at the start, and was no menace through a four-wide trip. SLOT RECEIVER
was strung out five wide going to the first turn, and never reached contention. MR. PINOCCHIO entered the backstretch widest of all, and made no impact.
THERE WAS A GENERAL STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

switched out a path upper stretch and continued a steady bid for second best. WE MISS SUSIE was forwardly placed and raced just off the leader down the
backstretch, prompted to go after FASHION BABE near the quarter pole, hustled along entering the lane, could not eventual winner but stayed on five wide
and cleared show. EVE OF WAR stumbled the steadied a step at the start, coaxed forward and raced near mid-range near the half mile marker, headed in
pursuit racing three wide entering the turn then flattened moving through the turn and chased on evenly through the lane. LAVI raced in the back along the
inside then shifted out entering the turn, prompted six wide at head of the lane and improved position without threatening. CURLINESQUE raced four wide
off the early pace, hustled along and raced four wide into the lane but failed to move into close contention. SILVER DAHLIA raced two wide to the inside off
the pace and failed to respond under pressure. GLORY DIA broke on top then conceded position and chased six wide through the backstretch then moved
into stretch run three wide and had no late response. CEE'S OVERTURE chased the top two leaders through the backstretch then came up empty in the
turn.

SOUPER COURAGE was allowed to settle, cruised up four then three wide to join the leaders near the quarter-pole, took over outside CRUPI'S PIZZA
DOM in upper stretch and drew away under pressure. SIR HOSKI lagged well back early inside, fanned widest into the lane and was up in the last strides to
get the place. BODIE CODY was never far back while three wide, rallied into second late but was edged out for that spot at the wire. SPINNING KITTEN
saved ground throughout, lodged a mild bid on the rail through mid stretch but did not have enough. SON OF GREATNESS raced in the second flight three
wide for six furlongs, and improved too late between horses. NINJA DUST yielded inside to CRUPI'S PIZZA DOM after the opening quarter-mile, moved out
to track that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, and remained a factor to upper stretch before weakening. RED FOG stalled in traffic along the
inside around the far turn, and was cautiously handled behind horses through the last eighth of a mile. LOOKIN FOREVER saved ground at the rear turning
for home, and made no headway. CRUPI'S PIZZA DOM took charge in the three-path around the first turn, moved inside showing the way to the end of the
far turn, and folded up once collared by the winner.
