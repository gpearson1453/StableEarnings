the rail midway on the far turn, drew clear approaching the top of the lane and held on under steady encouragement. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE stalked
the earlier pace in the three path, took aim at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well to close on the winner. MISCHIEVOUS
JESSE rated a short lead inside but was met at even terms into the backstretch, drew clear of Brilliant Bolt toward the three eighths pole but was caught two
deep midway on the far turn, drifted nearing the head of the lane then flattened stride. BRILLIANT BOLT settled close inside the opening turn and moved to
even terms into the backstretch, but, dropped back toward the three eighths pole and faded through the far turn. SWAY'S GODSEND RVF saved ground

Footnotes
MAJOR MEDALLIST angled to the inside to rate the pace, was hand urged past the quarter pole, came under pressure leaving the far turn, was steadily
handled to just inside the sixteenth pole then taken in hand later yards. FIRE TIGAR saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced
at the rail rounding the far turn, was gaining mildly on the winner through later yards but had to settle for second. WISPER FREEDOM rounded the opening
turn in the four path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn five wide and was
along for third. MOLOKAI saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn four wide and
showed little further. BINN GOODE showed little response through the backstretch. WINDSOR CALLING settled off the pace then picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole, though, started to weaken on the far turn. CHARITABLE GOLD came away a step slow then mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
MOJO MATTERS angled to the outside to give early chase and steadily improved, came through the turn three wide, dug in for the lead later yards and
raced clear under the wire. SATAN'S LAST TRAIN was hustled to the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, came under steady
urging leaving the turn but was caught later yards. BREAK DANCIN gave chase through the backstretch and raced in the six path of the turn, drifted out
leaving the turn but dug in to take third mid-stretch. BADS LIL LADY pressured the pace four wide then weakened leaving the turn. HONEY CHILD R V F
set the pace most of the opening quarter mile then gave chase from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened down the lane.
SHARP'S MISSION engaged in close early chase three wide but dropped back on the turn and weakened. MEGS SQUIRELLYGIRL was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY MAGICIAN saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, was carried to the five path leaving the turn, dueled to the lead
mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. SWEET TWEET was carried out into the first turn and settled close into the backstretch, started a bid
approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead midway on the far turn, but, bore out leaving the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch and flattened stride
through the final sixteenth. ONE TOUGH ANGEL stalked the pace three wide then took the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the
quarter, raced at the rail through the far turn then flattened out. Z NATION raced well back to save ground the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane while passing some rivals. GIMME KIMMY was forced out entering the
first turn and settled off the pace outside leaving the turn, bid from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. PIKI PIKI
GIRL pressured the pace through the front stretch then dropped back into the first turn and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. I'M WARNING YOU set a pressured early pace inside then ceded the nod toward
the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back and faded into the far turn. I AM ON MY WAY bore out into the first turn and was
never a factor. MY LIDO LADY never factored and appeared to be sore upon returning.
