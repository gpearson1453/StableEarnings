Footnotes
CHATTERMAN saved ground with a rail rally inside of rivals around the turn, tipped three wide turning for home to engage the dueling leaders from the
outside, produced a bid at the furlon pole and drove past. TRAPALANDA shied outwards at the start, but rushed to duel for the lead outside of MYSTICAL
IMAGE, sustained the duel in upper stretch, but was surpassed by CHATTERMAN passing the furlong pole while prevailing over his inner counterpart.
MYSTICAL IMAGE dueled inside of TRAPALANDA around the turn, but weakened passing the furlong pole. J SERINO settled off of the pace in the three
path, but failed to menace. THE COMMON MAN stalked in the three path before being floated to the four, then five, path by a bearing inner rival around the
turn, and subsequently weakened. LODE THE GOLD raced close to the early pace along the inside, but shifted off of the rail to the three to four path into
the turn, but bore out around the bend, came into the lane in the seven path, and weakened.

Footnotes
WILLINLILVILLIAN dueled outside of ALOHA SPIRIT into the turn, forged a clear advantage from that rival approaching the quarter pole, drew off turning for
home, and held SHINE ON ME safely at bay through the lane. SHINE ON ME was sandwiched between horses at the start, advanced from midpack along
the inside through the turn, tipped to the three path turning for home and commenced a grinding rally, but did not have enough to catch the leader.
GOFARGOGO broke in and bumped a rival at the start, raced two wide in midpack between horses, shifted four wide around the turn, and finished willingly.
ALOHA SPIRIT broke a bit outwards and bumped an outer foe, dueled inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but failed to keep pace passing the five
sixteenths pole, dug in for place in upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong. LADY IN GREEN raced three to five wide in midpack around the
turn, but failed to menace. EBB AND FLOW was sandwiched between horses at the start, trailed in the five path around the turn, and never got involved.
GEE CEE CEE had a rank start but vied for the lead between horses early on, was taken back to stalk, but pulled keenly into the turn, then bore out
substantially around the bend, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
EASTER DREAM rushed after a flatfooted start to chase the leader from the inside, made a rail bid approaching the furlong pole as the leader left the rail
opened, and drove past that rival at the sixteenth pole. BABY ROSE held a clear lead through the turn while staying in the two path, was confidently handled
in to the furlong pole despite a foe making a rail bid, was shaken up passing the furlong pole, but got outfinished. SHARP MIND saved ground from
midpack, and prevailed over outer rivals for show without threatening the leaders. VICTORY ICE trailed early on,swung to the six path turning for home, and
produced a mild late kick for a minor reward. DERBY ROYALTY stalked two wide, drifted from the three to four path while failing to keep pace with the
leader turning for home, then got outfinished for minor rewards. HIT THE DECK saved ground while far off of the pace, tipped to the three path turning for
home, but failed to factor. SINGLEFORTHESUMMER took the turn in the five path while midpack, but weakened through the lane, and was eased late.
BONA FIDE IMAGE drifted from the four to the seven path turning for home, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
OVER EZ saved ground close to the pace, surged through a rail opening in upper stretch, and drove clear through the final furlong. ROBERTO GATO
rushed after taking a bump after the start to force the pace along the inside, inched forward under urging to duel for the lead inside a rival but in the two path
into the turn, drifted to the three path while holding an advantage turning for home, but by doing so created racing room for OVER EZ, was surpassed by
that foe approaching the furlong pole, then just held place at the wire. FENDER BENDER was fractious in the gate, hopped at the start, commenced a five
wide rally into the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but got outkicked in upper stretch, then kept on to just miss place. THISISMYSTORY prompted
the pace between horses early on, stalked in the three path around the turn, but got outmoved by rivals turning for home, altered course to the six path at
the furlong pole, and produced a late kick to miss place. WARRENSDIRTYDANCER dueled outside of ROBERTO GATO through the turn, but was floated
to the four path by that rival at the quarter pole, and weakened. DUDLEY STUDLEY was under a tight hold along the inside into the turn, guided off of the
rail to the five, then seven path, turning for home, but came up empty and weakened. GOTTA GET LUCKY weakened to be far off of the pace in the four to
five path around the turn, and failed to get involved. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY was slow into stride, trailed in the six path around the turn, and showed little.

Footnotes
OF GOOD REPORT saved ground while rating off of the pace through both turns, shifted off of the rail to the four path in upper stretch, rallied past inner
foes to reach the lead passing the sixteenth pole, and drew off while being geared down. OSTINI pulled keenly to a clear lead early on, settled down
approaching the half mile pole, met a challenge from PAYNTER'S BOY at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled inside of that rival, dug in gamely while shifting
off of the rail in upper stretch, but got outfinished by an oncharging rival in the late stages. PAYNTER'S BOY inched forward to duel for the lead outside of
OSITINI into the far turn, but drifted to the three path turning for home and got outfinished by multiple rivals. UNLEASH THE TIGER stalked from the pocket
around the far turn, but lacked a kick through the lane. COURAGEOUS trailed along the inside, swung to the five path around the far turn, and offered a mild
kick through the lane. MARICOPA COUNTY was jostled between horses early on, got pushed six wide around the far turn by the simultaneously rallying
COURAGEOUS, but got outkicked by that rival in upper stretch, drifted inwards, and failed to rally. MINSKY MOMENT advanced to a stalking position in the
three path into the far turn, but came under pressure passing the five sixteenths pole, then weakened in upper stretch and faded. OLD SCHOOL IKE stalked
in the four path early on, but weakened to trail the field into the far tune, was eased through the lane, and showed little.

UNINVITED prompted the pace setter from his outside, inched a lead away from that rival approaching the half mile pole, forged clear turning for home, and
drew off under driving pressure through the late stages. ACT UP got caught in the five to four path around the first turn, was driven to advance from midpack
into the far turn, produced a bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, causing him to get outkicked by the leader, then
held place through the lane. DEPUTY'S COMMAND saved ground far off of the pace, swung five wide around the far turn, and offered a late mild rally, but
missed place. DURTDOBBR was hustled from the gate to set the pace inside of UNINVITED, but was headed by that foe at the half mile pole, dug in
around the far turn, but proved no match turning for home, and weakened. PURPLE SKY trailed two wide early on, saved ground around the far turn, but
failed to produce a rally. THIN LINE saved ground while midpack, inched closer to be in the pocket around the far turn, but got outmoved by multiple foes at
the quarter pole, shifted to the four path turning for home, but weakened and was eased late. RIDE HARD KOWBOY stalked in the three path early on, but
was through after a half, and eased through the lane, then walked off.

Footnotes
EMPIRE KNIGHT had a slow start and was pinched back early on, made a five wide sweep past the field while rank around the first turn to clear off on the
lead into the backstretch, met a challenge from DESERT BACK around the far turn, but found more, repelled that foe turning for home, and held sway to the
wire. BANZE NO OESTE (BRZ) rallied three wide around the far turn to forge place at the furlong pole. OLDTIMERS VISION shifted off of the rail to the five
path into the far turn, quickened in upper stretch, but missed place. FIRST TO THE WIRE saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the five path at the furlong
pole, and rallied mildly. DESERT BLACK stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of EMPIRE KNIGHT around the far turn, but was repelled turning for
home, then got outfinished for minor rewards. ARTAKSEZ saved ground while trailing, but failed to factor. WALLY'S GOT CLASS saved ground, but was
driven into the far turn and lacked a response. CHARLIE'S DEERE stalked four wide early on, angled to the inside into the far turn, but weakened in upper
stretch. THAT DOG WILL HUNT was rank inside of horses early on, steadied into the first turn, swung to the five path into the backstretch, and failed to get
involved thereafter. SUM CANDY set the pace in the two path while a bit rank around the first turn, but lost the lead to the eventual winner into the
backstretch, steadily faded, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ITS A BOY patiently waited for racing room behind horses turning for home, split the leaders as FACTORY MADE drifted out at the furlong pole, and drew
off. BROZILIAN (BRZ) rallied five to six wide around the far turn, and offered a late kick to get up for place at the wire. COOL HAND LUCAS stalked two
wide, split foes as EMPIRE WICKET drifted outwards around the far turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was herded outwards at the furlong pole
and got outfinished for minor rewards. TERYN IT UP stalked along the inside and produced a rail bid as the leader drifted out in upper stretch, but lacked
the needed kick. FACTORY MADE set the pace along the inside through the far turn, but drifted outwards approaching the furlong pole, weakened, and got
outfinished for minor rewards. BIG SKY LOGAN saved ground, but was put in tight quarters along the inside at the half mile pole, shifted from the three to
the four path around the far turn, but hung on her left lead in upper stretch and lugged inwards. PURELY POLITICAL trailed early on, and was never a
factor. EMPIRE WICKET broke inwards, but was hustled to be forwardly placed, shifted to the two path to stalk outside of the leader around the first turn,
but bore out substantially around the far turn, and weakened in the seven path in upper stretch. ELUSIVE REALITY was three to four wide around the first
turn, but weakened around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.
