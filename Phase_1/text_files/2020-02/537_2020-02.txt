Footnotes
KALLISTE ROSE in the second flight early off the inside, in some traffic while tilting out three wide late in the turn, roused for the drive, outside bid just
inside the furlong ground, drove well clear. ANITA MARIE close up front the start, showed the way into the turn closest to the inside, gained a larger
advantage when straightened for home, offered little resistance to the winner when that one came alongside with less than a furlong remaining, no match for
that rival, clearly second best. WISE EYES behind the leaders inside, continued to save ground through the turn, got through along the inside, lacked a
meaningful closing response, best rest. SYRAH pressured the issue up front in the three path, weakened in the drive. SHOWIT broke on top, showed the
way early, relinquished the advantage to the runner up before a quarter, vied between foes through most of the turn, was beginning to weaken when in tight
with a quarter to run, continued to faded. LETHAL LEANNE prompted the pace four wide into and through the turn, faltered in the drive. CRITTER off a step
slow, trailed.

Footnotes
GET ONE MORE bothered and shuffled back to the rear at the start, remained well back for five furlongs, began to rally far turn, circled 5w into the lane,
collared the leader in upper stretch, drove clear. HISSY MISSY settled off the pace and the inside, made a good gain to challenge four wide late in the final
turn, showed the way into the stretch, could not match the winner late, well clear of the rest. DAT GIRL in mid pack early toward the inside, closer into the
far turn, boxed in along the rail early in that bend, moved out slightly for the drive, rallied mildly to earn the show, no threat to the top two. LUCKY ROAD
chased the leader, advanced to lodge a brief bid in the second turn, weakened in the drive. DIXIE WAYNE broke out, lacked speed, improved position when
in the two path, not a serious threat. WISH FOR CANDY forwardly placed while racing three wide, gave way in the drive. KELLY BE KRUSIN fractious
loading, broke back, was used a bit to move up early, had little left for the drive. ELUSIVE SECRET void of speed, trailed well back, passed some tiring
rivals while not a serious threat. DANZIG STAR failed to menace while racing three wide. MARY ALICE sprinted clear to set a quick early pace, stopped
when headed in the second turn. NANABANANA settled off the pace, in some traffic into the far turn, also stopped.

Footnotes
EL ASESINO broke on top, set all the pace toward the inside, drew off midstretch, won geared down. HOLLYWOOD STAR last to leave, raced back early in
trailing, swung out widest for the drive, rallied midtrack for the place, no threat to the winner. LIONITE settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through
the turn, improved to chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT lacked speed, four wide out of the turn,
went evenly in the drive while remaining out in the strip. DAHIK in the second flight, two path through the turn, had little for the drive. GREY MASK within
striking distance in the three path, weakened. BLENDED LUTE saved ground to no avail. BARRY LEE closest to the winner for a half, asked along late in
the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CARLOS SIXES stalked the the early leader off the inside, advanced on that foe far turn, took over, headed upper stretch, battled back while closest to the
inside to prevail in game fashion. DEFENDER within striking distance, advanced three wide to challenge turning for home, put a head in front in upper
stretch, outkicked to the wire. ROAR OF THE LION broke back, void of speed, rallied four wide into the lane, rallied for the show, no threat to the top pair.
ZING ZANG lacked early foot, three wide, improved position, no real threat. GOLD BACKED raced in mid pack, improved slightly, no real threat. PAYNT
YOUR EGGS pinched back at the start, raced well back, flashed some mild, belated interest after racing four wide through the final turn. BROADWAY ICE
broke in, settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. POWER SONG reluctant to load, held position inside in showing the way into the first turn, got
out to bother outer rivals, continued to show the way the middle half, gave way when headed far turn. COME ON DOVER forwardly placed off the inside,
bothered then steadied when the leader came out midway on the first turn, began to fade after a half. TIZPURE also bothered in the first turn, five wide,
finished after four furlongs as well. RICKHOUSE prompted the early pace, stopped before five furlongs.

Footnotes
SHESHED broke sharp, got clear early, rated through the turn while continuing to hold a daylight advantage, not threatened in the drive under steady
handling. HEFFINGTON last away, trailed well back, angled out four wide late in the turn when advancing, came widest for the drive, finished up willingly to
be well clear for the place, steady gain on the winner late. STARVANA lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, brushed stretch, mild late interest,
nod for the show, no threat to the top two. ARKYARKYARKY within striking distance well out in the strip, four down to three wide when moving closer in the
turn, lacked a further response in the drive. A REAL GEM well back early, four wide through the turn, improved position without posing a significant threat.
OUR LIZZY LOU near the back early just off the inside, dropped to the rail midway on the turn, improved into the lane, never dangerous. LIL' SHOPPER in
early traffic, between horses into the turn, lacked a closing kick in coming up empty. LITTLE SLEW in mid pack outside, five wide turn, brushed nearing
midstretch, tired the final furlong. SYLVIA'S ROCKET forwardly placed early, steadily faded. D R C'S ARM CANDY in a bit tight at the start, swerved early,
chased the winner for a half then gave way in the drive. PLUS SIZE VALUE steadily faded while racing off the inside. FOXY BOX broke out, was finished
early.

KISS THE GIRL closest to the early leader, advanced and made a mild bid between rivals entering the stretch, fell back off the new leader past the furlong
marker, switched to the outside and came again to be in time. RAGGEDY ANNIE floated out a bit at the start, raced back off the pace three wide, advanced
and challenged on the outside into the stretch, shook clear, could not contain the winner. SWEET KISSES came out just after the start, was straightened to
race forwardly along the inside, boxed in late in the turn while continuing along the inside, got through in upper stretch, finished up evenly while not a threat
to the top two. ELITE SONG broke sharp, set the pace toward the inside for a half, gave way entering the stretch. PARTY LIGHTS last away, trailed just off
the inside, moved out widest for the drive, lacked a closing response.

AUCTION FEVER raced in mid pack outside, advanced three path second turn, collared the leaders nearing midstretch,drove clear late. CHATEAU HOPE
prompted the pace while off the inside, advanced and challenged into the stretch, vied between horses past the furlong marker, cold not match strides with
the winner late, clear for the place. ELUSIVE RIDE broke back, saved ground, continued inside when improving through the second turn, continued a mild
rally up the inside to annex the show. DAWDLE broke on top, showed the way inside, continued to set the pace into the stretch, briefly responded when
confronted by the top two, gradually weakened the final furlong. HUNGRY N SCRAPPY lacked early foot just off the inside, three wide through the final turn,
improved position with some mild late interest. GOLDEN LILY back early, saved all the ground and turned in an even effort. MI BELLA broke out to bother
an outer foe, was straightened, went one paced in the two path. BIG LUCK steadied when bothered at the start to be off slowly, raced well back for five
furlongs, passed tiring rivals. IT'S ALL CASH four wide through the first turn, continued well wide, five path through the second bend, lacked a closing
response. LIL RED VETTE forwardly placed inside early, three wide through much of the second turn, tired in the drive. CRUZIN COMO settled off the pace,
had little for the drive. CHALDEA gave way four wide in the second turn, stopped, jogged in.
