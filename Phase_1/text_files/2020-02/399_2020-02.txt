behind the leading trio at the quarter-pole, rallied outside into the stretch, closed well to get the lead into the final furlong then kicked clear under the whip

was asked at the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide near the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to
get the show. KENAI COOL broke out at the start, contested the pace in the two path for the opening quarter mile then moved clear, was challenged again

the rail outside the three-sixteenths and faded. LOOKIN BACK AT IT broke out at the start, contested the pace on the outside while in the three path for the
opening quarter mile then dropped back off the pace, moved up again to challenge for the lead approaching the three-eighths, vied in the three path on the

Footnotes
PAPAJUDGY sped clear shortly after the start, dictated terms in the two path and extended the margin under some urging on the turn, continued to widen in
upper stretch under steady handling. TORNADO BOY exchanged a bump with the outside foe then was bumped by the inside rival, thereupon shifted to the
rail trailing the field up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and gained the place inside foes in late stretch under urging. LITTLE WISE GUY
chased the winner from outside in the early going, went three wide and outside a rival on the turn, lost place late. TEMPLE OF HEAVEN shifted in early and
pulled against the rider's restraint briefly midway up the backstretch, continued the pursuit inside a foe but a path removed from the rail on the turn and
failed to threaten late. MISTER MISTER came out just after the start bumping a rival, was kept well off the inside going in the three to four path through the
turn, came into the stretch five wide and failed to rally. RONNIE'S REASONING was mid-pack well off the inside, encouraged along outside the
five-sixteenths racing in the four path through the turn, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and came up empty. WICKED STATEMENT was fractious behind the
gate then reluctant to load, exchanged a bump at the start, raced outside a foe at the rear early, went in the two to three path on the turn and was never
near enough to threaten.

CLEANUP TIME broke out then was corrected by the rider and hustled, went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed in third position, ranged
up three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch,
drew away under the whip into the final furlong, switched back to his inside lead around the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire
while much the best. MOM SAID YES broke out and bumped with a foe, started the first turn five wide, dropped to the three then two path on that bend, was
reserved off the pace, moved closer in the two early on the far turn, raced in hand while behind horses passing the five-sixteenths, was asked in the three
path outside the quarter-pole, swung four wide into the stretch then came in before being corrected by the rider, passed the three-sixteenths between
horses and earned the place while no match for the winner. SUNRISE KITTEN hit the inside of the gate at the start then bumped with foes on both sides,
was reserved on the inside, advanced leaving the backstretch, waited behind horses while the winner made his move from the five-sixteenths to the
quarter-pole, was asked at that point then moved out while put to a drive, fought with the runner-up for the place in the final furlong and missed that position
while clear for the show. DRAX was off about two lengths slow, angled in at the rear of the field, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the
back, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and improved position. END ZONE went around the first
turn in the two path, set the pace while accompanied by an opponent to the outside, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost the lead coming to the
quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. ATLAS MOON went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, advanced
alongside SUNRISE KITTEN leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide early on the far turn, checked behind horses coming to the five-sixteenths then
moved to four wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in between the eighth-pole and the sixteenth-pole then failed to rally.
CALCULATE bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, advanced three wide early on the far turn then shifted
five wide, chased outside into upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and weakened. WICKED WORRY was hustled from the start, went four wide
on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. TRUENO bumped with an opponent
at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, came four wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. BATTLE OF RAMADI broke a step slow, saved ground towards the rear of the field, came out in the stretch and was
no factor. GROOM LAKE bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was roused
leaving the backstretch then hard ridden in the two to three path on the far turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole, was carried in some after turning
into the stretch and stopped. (Rail at 25 Feet)

ESPERANZA DIAMOND forced the pace from outside a rival going three wide on the turn, took command in upper stretch and edged away through the final
sixteenth while kept to task. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR came in a bit after the break, pressed the aforementioned from inside going on or just off the rail
through the turn, was no match for that one but secured the place. REBECCAS TRUTH was taken up at the start then coaxed forward up the backstretch
racing outside, went in the three to four path through the turn angling six wide at the top of the stretch, evened out late. CARONDELET switched off the
inside heading up the backstretch in pursuit of the leading pair, was within striking distance four wide on the turn, came out a further path turning for home
and had no late kick. CALLMEONMYCELLFONE raced along the inside up the backstretch, switched out early on the turn having dropped back to last, went
in the three path through that bend coming four deep into upper stretch, drifted in a bit in mid- to late-stretch and ran on. MADEFORLIFE shifted in to the rail
leaving the backstretch and entering the turn, saved ground to no avail and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
ALMS was carried out on the initial straightaway then taken back while tugging hard at the bit, went four wide early on the first turn then tucked into the three
path while under restraint, settled into a comfortable stride on the backstretch, stalked four wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then kicked
clear when set down, powered away under a strong hand ride into the final sixteenth, switched back to her inside lead when given one crack of a
right-handed whip inside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best then galloped out full of energy. DOMINGA broke out at the start, went around the
first turn in the two path, settled last but one, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the rear late on that bend, swung four wide into the
stretch under the whip, passed foes while still on her inside lead in the drive and safely secured the place. PASS THE PLATE dropped well behind early,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, advanced quickly while three then four wide on the far turn, loomed a major threat while five wide
into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths while just behind the winner, chased that foe into the final furlong and flattened out then just earned the
show. TRICKLE IN went four then three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead after turning into the stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and weakened then
just missed the show. LADY JENNEVIERE was carried out some early, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, drafted in the
two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then driven three wide into the stretch and came up empty. AMERICAN LEGEND came out on
the initial straightaway, set the pace in the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and stopped. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
BEAU OXY was lightly brushed in the hind end at the start, set the tempo from outside PREDATOR, went three to four wide on the turn drifting out a further
path leaving that bend and having edged clear, continued to drift out a bit in the stretch despite a few right-handed taps, was eased up through the final
sixteenth. PREDATOR broke outwardly and a half-length slowly bumping the outside rival and corrected by a tug of the left rein, was thereupon urged to
keep pace with that rival pressing inside up the backstretch but in the two path entering the turn, lost ground on that bend and switched out four to five wide
past the five-sixteenths, could not keep pace and was eased up in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
I LOVE TO RACE bumped hard with a rival at the start and was slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along on the outside, moved
closer late on the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, dueled outside of
the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. LISTEN UP pressed the pace outside of three rivals while on the far outside, vied four
wide while on even terms for the lead on the turn, led into the stretch, drifted out while under attack from the winner inside the three-sixteenths, dueled with
that rival in the final furlong and missed while well clear for the place. FREEDOM PASSAGE bumped hard with the winner at the start, settled off the pace,
went three wide on the turn, paused in traffic while foes checked and steadied around her at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch, moved in
inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. GOLD STAR MAMA pressed the pace between horses, vied three wide
on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. LOOKIN SHARP showed good speed and contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path while
between horses early on the turn, checked while dropping back a bit at the five-sixteenths, came out into upper stretch and capitulated. AMEERAH B broke
a half-step slow, moved up to dispute the pace, vied inside on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, jumped the gate tracks while falling out
of contention at the furlong marker and also capitulated. SAINTSATION broke a half-step slow, was taken up early then rated on the inside, saved ground
on the turn, checked behind a rival at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. (Rail at 25 Feet)
