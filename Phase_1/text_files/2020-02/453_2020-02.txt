GOOD GENES rated the early pace and was urged clear to enter the turn at the rail, bore outward nearing the top of the lane but drew off when
straightened away. VAULTED SON gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the five path then dug in through the lane to get up for
second later yards. OPPORTUNITY CALLS pressured the pace inside but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail through the turn then
flattened stride the final sixteenth. REALLY BOPPIN pressured the early pace two deep while between horses but dropped back toward the five sixteenths
pole and faded at the rail rounding the turn. STERLING REBEL chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn in the four path then finished evenly.
ENASOIT gave chase outside, raced in the six path of the turn and showed little more. TOO MANY CORONAS hopped from the gate, was never a factor
and saved some ground on the turn. CHURCH MONKEY broke a bit awkwardly then picked up the chase, but showed no response in the three and four
paths of the turn.

GRACE ELIZABETH settled close in the three path then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled two deep on the far turn, took the nod into the lane and
dug in under determined handling to draw clear later yards. PUNK ROCK PRINCESS became a bit edgy just as the gate opened and was unprepared then
saved ground, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the six path of the far turn and closed well to take second the final yards.
SHERWOOD LADY stalked the pace off the rail then bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead approaching the quarter, contested the edge nearest
the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod into the lane but continued a close factor to late stretch before flattening stride. LIES AND SCANDALS saved ground
the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide then weakened. C R CASE'S LEGACY
settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened leaving the far turn. ALL FLATTER stalked the pace inside, gave
chase from the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn. AUSSIE GOLD rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, was caught toward the quarter and faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MACANAO saved ground off the pace then bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path, met the runner-up at even
terms mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to edge that one out later yards. COBH steadied off the heels of Cherubim leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole
then stalked the pace two deep, challenged from the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear into the lane, was
met at even terms mid-stretch and dueled gamely to the final yards before ceding; grudgingly. GOODBYESEEULATER came away a step slow and raced in
the five path the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the five path of the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and finished
evenly. CENT COMM settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but flattened stride off the
rail on the far turn. I CAME TO PARTY settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response in the four path of the far
turn. CHERUBIM angled to the inside early on and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the
far turn then weakened. BIG BAD DUDE raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside and galloped the course.
