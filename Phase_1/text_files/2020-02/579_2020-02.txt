DUN SOBER set all the pace and drew off to be well clear late under strong handling. JUST DUE tracked the leader while racing two wide and finished
second best. FERRARI ROAD stalked the pace, saved ground and had no late response. RISKY BOY stalked the pace, raced three deep in the lane and
never was a factor. HOLIDAY JOKE dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. SOPHISTICATEDBLING was off very
slow, raced towards the inside and never was involved. WELL MANNERED reared at the break and trailed throughout.
