Footnotes
PINE GROVE ROAD broke awkwardly, vied three across, assumed command on the second turn, was under pressure through the stretch and held on
gamely. LIBERTARIAN stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, bid six wide to challenge for the lead, had the rider lose his whip past
the eighth pole, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. PLAYOFF BOUND was never far off the pace, went seven wide at the top of the
stretch, had little left for the drive, held safely for show and finished best of the rest. WATER WAGON saved ground while racing in the back, angled out on
the turn, lacked a bid and did not threaten. MIDNIGHT REVERIE dueled inside to the second turn, tired and stopped. NUDIAMOND dueled between horses
to the second turn, tired, stopped, was eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
BLUE DANCER vied two across to the second turn, assumed command, drew clear and held well under urging. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE was unhurried
early, saved ground, shifted out on the turn, closed under left handed urging and was gaining late. THETRAILERGUY stalked the pace, challenged three
across on the turn, fell back, continued willingly to the wire and earned show in a good effort. BOXER BOY lagged while racing outside, went six wide
entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. PARCHED was hustled along to vie inside to the second turn, tired and gave way.
BETATHANABOYFRIEND trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
DESTINY'S STORM bobbled a bit at the start, set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and just lasted under steady urging. TIZ YOUR WAY got
away alertly, raced close to the pace, bid five wide leaving the turn, closed steadily, was wearing down her rival and gaining fast late. NOT TO CODE came
in at the start, was slow early, bid four wide and earned show while no threat to the top two. EBB AND FLOW lagged early while racing outside, went eight
wide entering the stretch and improved position. SWEET SOPHIE GRACE broke in, raced close to the pace inside, lacked a stretch response and faded.
SURF THE TURF showed speed to the turn, swung seven wide and gave way. TIS MATT broke awkwardly and was crowded at the start, trailed the field
and passed a tiring rival. CANDYS IN FASHION showed good early speed, stopped, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
LESEDI held a good position inside, angled out for the drive, bid six wide and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. CASHMERE BLISS set the
pace, responded to pressure on the turn, inched clear, led to the final strides and was caught. MARIA saved ground to the second turn, shifted out, finished
well and gained late to get up for show. EXTRA GORGEOUS pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back, continued willingly to the wire,
hung late and lost position. POCO SUENOS raced close to the pace, went seven wide entering the stretch and closed well. HERE'SLOOKINATYA raced
mid pack, went seven wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally under mild urging. BARBELLO (NZ) raced wide in an even effort and was outrun. LOVABLE
LILLY was not a factor.

JANET'S MAE raced close to the pace, closed under steady urging and wore down SURF KITTEN to get up late. SURF KITTEN was sent to the front to set
the pace to the final strides and couldn't last despite left handed urging. NAT GIO was crowded at the gap, void of early speed, went seven wide entering
the stretch and closed well. MIZZEN AIR broke in the air to be off slowly, raced outside and lacked a bid. SUMMERLAND stalked inside, gave way into the
turn and lacked a further response. GOOD LUCK TO YOU was outrun in an even effort. B C Z MIDDLETON raced in the back, lacked room in the upper
stretch and failed to gain.

Footnotes
MY CRAFTY GAL set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held well in a driving finish. MCKENZIE HONEY raced close to the pace,
bid five wide, closed steadily and earned place while no match for the winner. DIANKA was unhurried early, saved ground, bid inside leaving the turn and
got up for show. IT'S ALEXUS saved ground, bid inside, failed to rally, hung late and lost positiion. GAZING was never far back, went six wide at the top of
the stretch, closed well and didn't have enough late. CONVINCE pressed the pace to the second turn, fell back and leveled off. PEACH COVE (NZ) failed to
threaten in an even effort. FIRST HUNTER was not a factor. Hand timed.
