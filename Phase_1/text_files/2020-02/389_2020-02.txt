Footnotes
AS FAST AS YOU CAN broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed late in the turn, well clear past the furlong marker,
maintained a daylight advantage under steady handling. GEMINI JOURNEY in the second flight toward the inside early, angled three wide turning for home,
could do little with the winner in the drive, held sway for the drive. LOUISE THE LASER in the second flight while racing outside, floated out four wide
turning for home, long drive for the place, outkicked. MOLLY'S GAME last to leave, trailed while off the inside, steered out four wide turning for home,
displayed some mild late interest to improve position. HIGH CLASS EURO dueled up front while racing off the inside, gave way. WENEEDTOTALK lacked
speed while racing outside, angled in a bit through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. HONOR WITH PRIDE remained always
back. NEVER SOBER forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat before a half.

remained clear until late, lasted. LOVELY LOU ran off in the post parade, lacked early foot, saved outrun while saving ground into the lane, steered out for
the drive, finished willingly to be steadily getting to the winner late. LIL TATER in the second flight toward the inside for a half, tilted out turning for home,
lacked a closing response. DAIGLE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, showed the way for a half, began to weaken when headed by the winner
upper stretch. HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY went one paced while racing in the four path. QUINCY BE QUIK back off the early pace, angled out three wide late in
the turn, was never dangerous in the drive while improving position slightly. KELLY BE KRUSIN broke in and slowly, saved ground turn, picked off some
tiring rivals to improve position. DANZIG STAR five wide through the turn when with the main body, had little left for the drive. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT broke

Footnotes
FUTILE forwardly placed while moving off the inside early, stalked three wide turn, asked along late turn, engaged the two leaders from the outside past the
furlong marker, edged clear under firm handling. ENDER lacked speed while racing in the two path, steered to the far outside when straightened for home,
finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. TRE LEE DIVINE dueled up front off the inside, narrowly showed the way into
the stretch, gave ground grudgingly when confronted the final furlong. HE'S NO BULL last away, raced back early, closer three wide entering the stretch,
flattened out in the late going to lose the show late. MAIN ROAD settled off the pace while well out in the strip, four wide entering the turn, angled in, two
path into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. VIRGA dueled up front closest to the inside, faltered when the real running began
at the head of the lane. SNAGGLETOOTH came out early, raced back, failed to muster a rally. TWIN FARMS bothered in the early going, was never a
factor.

Footnotes
ZEROED IN broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, well clear into the stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage through the lane under token
encouragement to win ridden out. CAMPAIGN SPY in the second flight off the inside, three wide when roused turning into the stretch, slowly trimmed the
winner's margin, clearly second best. MAJESTIC DAY void of speed off the inside, floated out four wide when beginning to advance turning for home,
finished willingly down the middle of the strip while too late. BATTALSTOWN back early, advanced steadily while four wide through the turn and into the
lane, flattened out a bit late, not enough for the show. PEWTER forwardly placed while racing off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, had little left for
the run to the wire. SHAKE IT void of speed, angled three wide in some traffic late in the turn, went evenly the final furlong. DELTA SURPRISE closest to
the winner for a half, gave way in the drive. SUPERADO failed to menace while racing toward the inside. GRASSETTO tired from early efforts while racing
three wide. PRIMORDIAL BOY off slowly, raced well back early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. GASPERGOU was finished early.
FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN steadily faded in the two path.

BEEMIE AWARD away in good order, raced forwardly and four wide turn, engaged the leader past the furlong marker, wore down that rival, edging clear.
YOUNG HENDRICK broke alertly, sprinted clear, set the pace toward the inside, responded briefly with the winner came alongside with a furlong remaining,
gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best. ICE SPHERE void of speed, angled three wide turning for home, along for the show, no threat to
the top pair. STASH THE CASH back off the pace inside, continued to save ground when improving exiting the turn, closest to the top two a furlong out,
flattened out, caught for the show. TELETAP bothered at the start, raced mid pack outside, four wide late turn, bothered by a rival pulling up, evenly through
the stretch. WINGS UP void of speed, was beginning to advance late in the turn well wide when late in the turn when bothered by the foe pulling up, five
wide soon after, improved position. JOHNNY CHADDA raced back, saved ground through the turn, made little impact in the drive. STRONG ARM void of
speed, in some traffic into the turn, lacked room behind horses late entering the stretch, failed to menace when clear for the drive. SANDBAGGER AL
chased the leader for a half and gave way. G. C. CRACKERJACK in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, bothered slightly turning for home, faded.
ENDGAME bothered at the start, moved up, began to fade before a half. OCCAM'S RAZOR forwardly placed, shortened stride, pulled up late in the turn,
vanned off.

SPECIAL RESERVE within striking distance, four wide into and through the turn, challenged turning for home, shook clear a furlong out, enough left to hold
the runner up safe late under firm handling. GALLANT PLUNGER dropped to the inside behind the first flight, moved out to be three wide turning for home,
set down, slowly getting to the winner late. MAJESTIC JAZZ vied up front while three wide and between rivals, could not match the winner in the drive nor
contain the runner up, saved the show. SWINGIN' SAM off the pace and the inside, came three wide out of the turn, went evenly the final furlong. ALL
WEST bothered off slow, raced back for a half, displayed some belated interest while not a serious threat. SMACK ATTACK vied up front along the inside,
faltered in the drive. MAYAN GHOST saved ground through the turn when lacking speed, no rally in the drive. DATA CAT failed to menace while racing four
wide. CHAIN MOVER broke in, bothered foe, vied between horses in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
SARA SEA away in good order, raced behind the first flight in the two path, firm restraint when boxed in late in the turn, split foes past the furlong marker,
brushed, drove well clear to prove best. GEORGIA CLAY forwardly placed, raced three wide through the turn, advanced and challenged three wide turning
for home, held a brief advantage with a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. TRUE CASTLE vied up front off the
inside and between rivals, bid, vied past the furlong marker, weakened a bit, gained the nod for the show. GOLD CREDIT broke out, fell back off the pace,
three wide turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest, narrowly missed the show. GOLDEN SECRET broke out, prompted the pace well out in the
strip, four wide turn, bid midstretch, had little left late. AL SHAMKHAH void of speed while just off the inside, two path turn, improved position out in the strip.
MUCHO MAS saved ground to no avail in remaining back. WISHFUL QUALITY showed the way early, vied along the inside turn, gave way when
straightened for home. HOPPA off slow, pinched back at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to be five wide into the turn, four wide
exiting, faded. FIELD DAISEY was never a threat.

WHAT A FOX within striking distance, raced behind horses up the backstretch, continued behind traffic turn, split foes inside the furlong marker, proved best
in determined fashion. PERUVIAN APPEAL shuffled back a bit before a quarter inside, moved out and advance to challenged two path late in the turn, held
a narrow advantage with a furlong remaining, outkicked by the winner late. SKAMANIA sprinted clear to set the early pace, into the stretch, weakened the
final furlong. ESTILO FEMENINO broke out, lacked speed, came three wide out of the turn, staged mild interest to garner the show. AWE EMMA chased
the early leader, three wide out of the turn, had little left. THREE CHORDS four wide in the turn, tired in the drive. MAYBE WICKED last to leave, trailed
throughout in a dull effort.

EXECUTIVE BRANCH settled behind the leaders in hand, continued to stalk off the inside into the far turn, advanced and challenged three wide in upper
stretch, edged clear late under steady handling. RUNNIN' RAY broke well, allowed leader to go first turn, moved out, pressed into the second bend,
challenged exiting that bend, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner late, held sway for the place.
AGGRESSIVITY in the second flight toward the inside, asked along final turn, between foes with a mild bid midstretch, flattened out, manged to gain the
show. GOOD SCOUT rank in the first turn off the pace outside, continued to race outside to be four wide in the final turn, within striking distance
midstretch,hung in the late going. ROAD GAME advanced and took over in the first turn, angled in when clear, set the pace the middle half mile, weakened
when confronted in the drive. REVENIO lacked speed, continued one paced throughout, lacked a closing response. AWESOME EKATI broke back, was
never a factor. PAST VISIONS five wide into the first turn, stopped and finished far back.
