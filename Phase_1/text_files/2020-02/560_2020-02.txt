Footnotes
PERFECT SALE had good speed, was on the pace to the backstretch then pressed the leader to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, responded
determinedly in the final furlong and got the nod. REV REE contested the pace to the backstretch, inched to the front and set the pace from the rail to the
stretch then dug in gamely, resisted to the final jumps but was nailed. AROUSE N GO tracked the top two from the rail to the stretch, offered a bid between
those rivals nearing the eighth pole then could not sustain the needed response and was outfinished. RAELEE was settled to the half, raced two wide on the
second turn then could not make an impact late while closing some ground. SHEZ A GRINDER trailed to the stretch while three wide and also was gaining a
bit late. MAMANUCA was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response.

LADY OF PERCEPTION hopped slightly to begin and trailed to the turn, was off the rail to mid turn then swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied when
set down and closed steadily to prevail. THRILL'S LEGACY stalked the pace to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid
stretch then could not stall the winner but saved second. SHE'S SO PRETTY tracked the leader from the rail to the stretch then shifted out and was making
up ground belatedly. ROCKETANN hustled to the lead, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. ONLY THE
FACTS had no speed, raced outside the winner on the turn, swung out widest into the stretch but came up empty in the drive. DOUBELIEVENMAGIC
pressed the pace to the turn, made a run at the lead three wide to the stretch but tired through the lane.

SHE'S IN LUCK had good speed, dueled inside of HOPE WINS and off the rail to the stretch, pushed away from that one to mid stretch and held driving.
SECRETLY PARANOIDE chased the leaders to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but bested TIZ A RULE for second. TIZ
A RULE broke in the air and lost about four lengths to begin, raced two wide to the stretch, was a threat to mid stretch then flattened out. HOPE WINS
attended the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. RUN FOR A MILLION had no speed, lagged to the stretch
then had a belated rally.

ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed response. FUEGA was chasing to the turn, raced outside a rival to the stretch and did not rally. ACADIA

Footnotes
PRINCESS VIVIAN was outrun to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, eased out for room, rallied when straightened and closed with a late
surge to get the nod. MORNING CYNN was chasing to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied and collared MYANGELCINDY nearing the sixteenth
pole, led to the final jump then was nailed. TRINA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch and finished in a rally inside. MOMMY ROSE was also
chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and closed willingly to the line. REBALATION broke in the air and lost about six or seven lengths to
the field, trailed, saved ground on the turn then swung out widest for the drive and finished in a rally. MYANGELCINDY attended the pace outside PLUM
WILD, pushed away from that one to mid stretch but was tiring in the late stages. PLUM WILD dueled from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked to mid
stretch and gave way.
