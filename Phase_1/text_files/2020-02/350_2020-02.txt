Footnotes
TIGHT FITTIN JEANS set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, held rivals safe and edged clear for the win. TUTTA TERLINGUA was
allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. DELIGHTFUL HIPS was unhurried early, raced off
the rail into the turn and offered a mild late rally. NEW ADVENTURE tracked the early pace, loomed four wide into the turn and was empty late. MA REE LA
VOO was taken back early and was no factor. SUTAH WHO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
QUINCY EXPRESS stalked the pace of HESA PROSPECTOR while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew off
through the final yards. HESA PROSPECTOR broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way
grudgingly to the winner late. RATE THE GAIT lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. EMPEROR'S CHOICE
settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished willingly. RIO CUTIE was away in good order to press the pace of HESA
PROSPECTOR while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. VIVARO raced off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and failed to
rally. FEISTY HALO lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. INDIAN DIVA lagged throughout.
