racing four wide and was a clear second. LIL ALLIE DANCER raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid, but proved no
match for the top two. MISS GURETTA pressed the pace, weakened and finished evenly. JOKERS QUEEN void of early speed, showed late interest, racing
wide, but was no factor. CELTIC LASS raced near the back, made a bid around the final turn and was finished early. SPANISH ARCH raced evenly near the
back and was never a threat. GO SELMA T reserved in the beginning, moved up down the backside and was done. MISS KATNISS was an early factor and

Footnotes
CANDIZAR stalked the leaders in the early going, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI vied
for the early lead and followed the winner down the stretch. HEY CHATAIN broke in, checked at the start, racing in the back, made a late gain and was
clearly third. SCRIMMAGE raced within striking distance, came around the first turn wide and weakened. BROKEJAW broke poorly, racing in the back,
showed late interest, but was no factor. GRIP TIGHT raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. ROBBER lacked early speed, moved up
and finished evenly. WHOOZ THE KING raced within contention and was finished early. MAUK POWER void of early speed and was outrun. MAINICHI
HARBOR dueled for the early advantage and dropped to the rear.
