GRAY HAZE pressed the pace, took command, pulled away and won under confident handling. SPEED ON TAP raced within contention, moved up on the
outside around the turn, drifted in down the stretch, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second. STOP THE FRIEND broke out, raced
within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and proved no match for the top two. NOON'S BABYGIRL went to the front, saved ground, forced in
down the stretch, faded and finished evenly. GUILTY CONFESSION raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was never a threat. TAYLOR'S
LIGHTNING was shut off at the break, saved ground and was never a threat. SHE WANTS HALF broke in, raced in the back, had a wide trip and showed
little.

Footnotes
SWIFTOWN MISS raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside, dueled down the stretch with GLORIETA and was just up. GLORIETA
challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the second turn, dueled down the lane and just missed. TEMPLE
SHADOW vied for the early lead, eased off the front end, rallied down the home stretch and was getting to the leaders. HOLDONAMINIT void of early
speed, made a late gain, but was no real threat. CROWNED STYLE hopped at the start, racing in the back, showed late interest, but was no threat. MISS
BILLIE K broke out, went to the front and faded. PITCHER void of early speed and passed tired ones. SONG AND A SAINT raced in the middle of the field
and faded, while racing wide. JEWELS OF SORCE raced near the middle of the pack in the beginning and dropped back. PROUDMONEY dueled for the
early advantage and retreated to the rear.

ATOMIC CANDY early factor, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground, was all out and held on for the win. DOORAG JIMMY unhurried in the early
going, moved up on the inside around the second turn, rallied down the stretch, four wide and was outfinished. C H MY LAST DOLLAR pressed the pace,
raced close throughout and couldn't keep up with the top two late. INTERACTIF MOMENT went to the front, drove clear and lacked a late kick. GO GET
THAT raced within striking distance, weakened and finished evenly. JACK'S KISS always raced near the back and was outrun. FATS raced within
contention and was finished early.

within contention, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage down the stretch and was caught at the wire. TENACIOUS FAITH raced near the back in
the beginning, moved up around the turn, angled out, made a wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. PEACEFULLY went to the
front, drove clear and weakened. FICKLE FLASH lacked early speed, entered the stretch wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SOMETHING FOR
MAMA raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. PRINCESS ORTHODOX challenged for the early lead, saved ground and dropped
back. DEBS GIRL bumped at the break, raced near the middle of the pack and retreated. SELENAS JEWEL broke slow, pulled up, lost rider down the
