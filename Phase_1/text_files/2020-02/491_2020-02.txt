Footnotes
SCARLET BOW broke readily, was urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing in the two
path to upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. MAMBO DANCER gained a forward placing along the rail to track just inside the
pacesetter to the far turn, switched out racing into upper stretch while being roused to advance and made a mild bid to close the gap while always only
second best. SPEEDING STARLET tracked the pace between foes as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out to the four path racing into
the stretch while being roused to advance but finished evenly late. FLASHY PATCH, forwardly placed three deep tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight to the far turn, angled inside rivals racing into the stretch and faded late. FIRST HOOSIER, off a step behind the leaders, tracked off the
second flight off the inside to the far turn but had no rally. SHINY SURPRISE, caught four wide through the first turn into the backstretch, made some brief
progress in that path after a half to gain terms with the second flight but emptied out early. SECRET TEMPLE was slow to gather stride and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
DOC KANE tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance along the rail in the opening quarter, shifted out racing through the turn advancing on the
first flight on his own courage to bid for command three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage entering the lane and went clear
late under some firm left handed encouragement. SMOKY BLUES tracked off the first flight three deep between foes in the opening stages, advanced on
the leaders in that path racing into the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual
winner, couldn't match that foe through the stretch but prevailed for the place honors. I'M A COOL MAN broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival racing
into the turn, dueled between foes to upper stretch, weakened in late stages and shifted inwards bumping ROCKYSBUCKAROO nearing the wire.
JUNCTION, tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing four wide to the turn, shifted out five wide entering upper stretch and regained a position
in an even effort. ROCKYSBUCKAROO, urged to dispute the pace while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside foes to
upper stretch, gave way leaving the furlong marker and was bumped nearing the wire. PERFETTO, restless in the gate at the start, broke slowly losing
position to the field and failed to menace. CRUMLIN NIGHT bobbled at the start and was soon outpaced.

Footnotes
JOY NIDERA (ARG) was rated outside rivals in second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper stretch and continued
with a steady late response to wrest command, then hold safe the challenge of RED CURLS under firm encouragement. The latter was settled along the rail
racing to the backstretch, came under some prompting after a half to maintain contention, shifted off the inside leaving the midway point of the far turn,
swung out to the five path racing into upper stretch and finished willingly to close the gap nearing the wire. DECORATING was rated near the inside tracking
just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, altered course to bid in the four path between foes leaving
midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. CLASSY WOMAN, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter under light restraint in the opening half,
pressed the issue racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but gave way near midstretch. KEEPER REAL, pulling between
foes in the second flight racing to the first turn, was wrangled back to track off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn but lacked a closing
response. BELLO PORTE moved readily to the fore, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into the far
turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
ONEWAYTICKET was held up between foes avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, angled inwards to track just off the second flight racing to the
turn, was prompted to advance while shifting out six wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady rally to late stages to wrest the advantage in
time under firm encouragement. ELVIS COLE was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward entering the stretch to
gain a clear advantage between calls late but was collared nearing the wire. YEI YEI vied with the first flight four wide between foes into the turn, pressed
the issue in that path to upper stretch and weakened late. THREENINETYTWO, urged along in pursuit of the leaders six wide through the backstretch, then
five wide through the turn to upper stretch, lacked the needed final kick. R D HAVE FAITH pressed the pace three wide between foes into the turn to upper
stretch and gave way. FAFA FOOEY broke slowly, angled seven wide racing into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. FLASH MAN, reluctant to load, tracked
off the first flight between foes racing into the turn but had no closing bid. LEAVING HOME angled inside early dropping just off the second flight and failed
to menace. NATION U S A broke awkwardly and proved no threat. GATOR FIFTY TWO, urged between foes disputing the pace racing into the turn, was
spent after a half. ARCHIVERO flashed brief pace five wide between foes pursuing the first flight but emptied out early.

MIRABELL MEI tracked just off the second flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the far turn, was prompted to
advance on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage in that path entering the lane and went clear under firm encouragement.
THAT'S MY CUE settled along the rail in the opening half, continued to save ground into the far turn, shifted off the inside advancing in close quarters to
split foes just off the inside nearing the furlong marker and proved best of the others. TOMORRA was rated just off the second flight along the inside racing
to the far turn, shifted out a bit briefly awaiting an opening between foes, angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a
share. SNEER tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance inside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half, shifted out racing into the far
turn advancing on that foe to bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch but came up empty entering the lane. DREAMING OF PARIS tracked the
pacesetter outside a rival in second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance in tandem with a rival to challenge for command three deep
racing through the far turn but proved empty in the drive. SENSE A MILLION sped clear of the field while angling to the inside while pulling a bit against
restraint, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn, briefly resisted when challenged but gave out racing into upper stretch. DIAMANTINE bobbled at the
start, was soon outpaced, then outdistanced racing to the backstretch but walked off under her own power.

I'M A G SIX broke sharply, was rated just out of striking position while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep racing into the far turn
while commencing a sharp advance to wrest command racing into upper stretch, went well clear and was taken in hand in a ridden out effort. EXCHEQUER,
forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to challenge for command between foes on the far turn, couldn't match the winner
but edged rivals for the place honors late. ZITMAN was settled inside in the opening half, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with
an effort to gain some position. DEPUTY CZAR, urged to a forward placing along the inside in the opening half, emptied out racing into the far turn. TAOS,
caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, was urged to gain a clear advantage racing into the backstretch, set the pace just off the inside racing to the far turn
and gave way into upper stretch. JOSIE'S RIDDLE was rated tracking the leaders between foes from out of striking distance in the opening half but offered
no closing bid. FUN PADDY proved no factor. STREET LEGACY, unprepared for the start, broke in the air losing position to the leaders and soon trailed.

QUALITY STEP, restless in the gate before the start, gained a forward placing stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch. was urged to
challenge for command nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage, then drifted out leaving midstretch but PURE LUCK to the end under firm handling.
The latter was steadied out of tight quarters along the rail racing into the first turn to track off the second flight, continued unhurried along the inside to the far
turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch to bid four wide for command in late stages and was floated out while just failing to gain even terms.
PROFESSIONAL, caught in close quarters between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to bid three deep racing into the lane while
caught in close quarters leaving midstretch and was just outkicked by the top pair. HONEY DONT was urged to the lead, angled to the rail once gaining the
advantage leaving the chute, set the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and weakened late. YABBA DABBA DUDE angled to the inside early
tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. WHAT A HOOT, held up off the second flight between foes avoiding tight
quarters racing to the first turn, never gained contention. FADE AWAY, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, soon faded. JOHNNY ACTION made
brief pursuit of the leaders three wide into the first turn and emptied out early. FALSE INFO, bumped at the start, was caught wide to the backstretch and
proved no threat.

KILLYBEGS CAPTAIN broke outwards brushing at the start, was quickly righted to set the pace on a narrow margin between foes in the opening quarter,
steadily asserted himself to go clear on his own courage nearing upper stretch, was prompted to extend the advantage into the lane and was taken in hand
in the closing stages in a ridden out effort. HE HATE ME was rated outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, advanced five wide on the turn to upper
stretch and proved best of the others. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) exchanged bumps with DEBBIE'S PASSION at the start, switched out four wide while
being urged in pursuit of the leaders racing into the turn, continued three deep between foes to upper stretch and faded between rivals late while just edging
a rival for a share. MUCHO, held up avoiding close quarters nearest the inside in the opening stages, was prompted to gain some position inside foes racing
into the turn, shifted out to bid between rivals nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final response. DEBBIE'S PASSION exchanged bumps at the
start, was held up between foes, shifted out four wide nearing the lane but offered no rally. SINGANOTHERSONG, urged to dispute the pace in the opening
stages while angling to the inside, emptied out racing into the stretch. DEVILEYE was settled last, angled out six wide in the stretch and had no rally. MOOJI
MOO JR., reluctant to load in the starting gate, joined the pace three deep in the opening stages prompting the eventual winner but emptied out racing into
the turn. KING HUMOR, fractious when being saddled in the paddock, angled to the inside in the opening stages and dropped out early.

BYE BYE NICKY broke readily to track just off the leaders while angling inwards racing into the turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch while
being prompted to advance, took over leaving midstretch and kicked away under some right handed oressure. BUCKY'S DRAMA angled inwards prompting
the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, dueled with that foe through the turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch but proved no match when confronted
by the winner. I LOVE SHOPPING, bumped at the start, was held up outside foes racing to the turn, angled five wide racing into the stretch and came
around a drifting foe to prevail for a share late. SANGUINE angled inwards to track off the first flight just off the inside racing into the stretch but had no late
kick. EARECKSON (GB) tracked off the second flight along the rail, then continued evenly saving ground to the lane. FLAMING INDY tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the turn, drifted out nearing midstretch and gave way. MIAHSOLOMIAH urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset
into the turn, emptied out into upper stretch. LA WAPA tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and soon faded.
UNITEDTORUN broke awkwardly and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LADY'S ISLAND bobbled at the start, quickly righted herself to go clear while shifting out to the three path setting the pace through the backstretch, opened
a command advantage racing through the turn and held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement. INTO CHOCOLATE broke a step slowly,
angled quickly to the inside gaining a position just off the second flight racing into the turn, saved ground through the bend, then switched off the inside to
gain the place honors between foes in the closing stages. CAUGHT UP IN YOU tracked well off the second flight between rivals in the opening quarter,
angled out five wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share nearing the wire.
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT angled inwards in the opening stages to track between foes from well out of striking distance racing to the turn, advanced to split
rivals just off the inside entering the stretch and was just outkicked for a share. LOVESICK, urged to a forward placing along the rail in the opening stages,
continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper stretch and gave way. MOLTO BELLA was urged between foes in second flight pursuing the pacesetter
into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. SEAN'S IDEA, restless in the gate, broke slowly and failed to menace. BOUJIE GIRL tracked well off the
second flight five wide in the opening stages and never gained contention. MIDTOWN ROSE tracked the leaders four wide between foes from out of striking
distance racing to the turn and steadily faded. PUNTSVILLE shifted out early making brief pursuit of the pacesetter four wide racing into the turn, continued
three wide on the bend and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
HONEST TO GOODNESS, reserved well off the field racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals racing through the far turn, swung
out five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail in time under strong handling. MY COWBOY sped clear of the field along the
rail, dictated the pace in hand to the far turn, resisted several challengers to maintain the advantage past midstretc and just failed to contain the winner.
TOSS tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance inside a rival as part of the second flight, steadily advanced in tandem with several foes to bid
between rivals nearing upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the top pair but edged forward to prevail for a share nearing the wire. DOVER CLIFFS
angled inwards to track the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight, was urged to challenge for command three deep nearing upper stretch but
quickly flattened. ENDURING HONOR, reserved between foes dropping well off the second flight, angled to the inside entering the far turn while being
prompted to advance inside foes but lacked the needed late bid. COMPLETELY BONKERS tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted
out four wide nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but quickly came up empty. JIMMY D settled last early and failed to menace. HARV WON'T TAP,
caught wide early, proved no factor. RIVER EVANGELIST bobbled at the start, tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, shifted out
four wide on the far turn, was taken up nearing upper stretch but walked off the course under his own power. GREELEY'S FAREWELL dropped out early.
