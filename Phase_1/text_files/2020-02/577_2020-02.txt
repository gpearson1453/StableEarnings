TAPIZEARANCE broke in at the start brushing DANEGELD, chased four then three wide in aim of the top pair, advanced and took over command just
outside the quarter pole, got roused spinning four wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. DANEGELD brushed at the start by the
aforementioned foe breaking inwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one while running on clear of the rest for the place honors. BETA broke out at the start and bumped solidly with INVASION BOUND who broke
inwards and in turn bumped MARINER QUI, chased five to six wide until tucked four wide at the nine-sixteenths, went three wide through the far turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. BRUNATE five then four wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. VON ALDENBRUCK
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. MARINER QUI got bumped at the start by BETA due to pressure outside from INVASION BOUND, chased two to three wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered three wide for home and tired. FRIDAYBEERS hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with
CATZALIONBYTHETALE to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got displaced near the quarter pole and went three wide into upper
stretch, then tired in the drive. TRUE PALACE broke in at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside put to coaxing at the half mile pole, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. INVASION BOUND broke in at the start bumping solidly with BETA, chased six wide coaxed along
from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CATZALIONBYTHETALE hustled from the start, dueled inside of
FRIDAYBEERS from the get go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to fade near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, then
faltered in the stretch.
