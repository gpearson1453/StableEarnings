Footnotes
RED SORRELL was allowed to settle inside for six furlongs, tipped to the three-path in upper stretch, and ran past the leaders readily under a mild drive.
PALACE KITTEN prompted the pace outside BEBEAU for six furlongs, challenged reaching even terms turning for home, and could not kick on with his
stablemate while clearly second best. SIR CHUBBY tucked in off the leaders, eased off the inside approaching the stretch, could not go with the top two and
was along for the show. BEBEAU set the pace inside, and gave way once challenged at the top of the stretch. CAUSFORCELEBRATION stayed in range
early, was ridden along for a response three wide into the far turn, and was empty. LUCKY KISS was steered over to the inside after a slow start, and
remained well back throughout. INGREIDO cornered very greenly well out in the course around the first turn, moved inside after that and dropped far back.

Footnotes
FRANK FIRST tracked the top two leaders through early stages then headed in pursuit around the turn, took over the lead entering top stretch, quickly
widened to a clear advantage then wrapped up in late stages. HANDSOME PRINCE raced up close in opening stages, continued forwardly placed around
the turn, was no match for the pulling away winner in stretch run but continued a steady effort and secured place. BLIP slightly hopped and broke outward at
the start, raced off the early speed while ridden along to pick up the pace then roused five wide in the drive and advanced to gain a share. ISLE OF MAN
was off to a good start but had no early speed and lagged behind despite being asked by the rider, continued well back entering top stretch then shifted to
the inside and gained position in final stages. KING SHAWN held a slim lead out of the gate then cleared on top and led the way around the turn, could not
hold off the bid from eventual winner entering top stretch then gave way in the lane. W W ARCHIE bumped the gate hard then steadied at the start, chased
the pace under steady urging then had no late response. CAPTAIN YENNER raced off the early pace, prompted three to four wide upper stretch and failed
to move on.

Footnotes
DAYS OF SPRING lunged at the start and came out last, entered the backstretch four wide near the back, moved inside advancing around the far turn,
tipped outside DONDER 'N BLITZEN in upper stretch, outdueled that one through the furlong grounds and pulled clear. BEASAICHI was unhurried early
inside, encountered traffic in the three-path early on the far turn, gained clearance taking closer order after six furlongs, rallied through the stretch going
clear for second, and was carefully handled lugging in through the final yards. DONDER 'N BLITZEN stalked ANGELIC KNUGGET in the clear up the
backstretch, wrested the lead away on the far turn getting clear between calls, battled inside the winner through mid stretch and weakened. LADY NOGUEZ
settled in midpack for a half-mile, lodged a mild bid between horses nearing the quarter-pole, and flattened out into the lane. R SEA SMOKE trailed for a
half, put in a four-wide run around the far turn, but could not sustain the rally. BLOSSOM BOW raced three wide, loomed outside the leaders coming off the
far turn, but faded in the drive. ONEZY'S DREAM saved ground to no avail. KERRY IT was forwardly placed early inside, and dropped back into the far turn.
ANGELIC KNUGGET sped off early, got inhaled by DONDER 'N BLITZEN into the far turn, and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
FOUR OF SWORDS sped to the lead out of the gate and took the inside position, continued on top and held off the bid from THREE DEEP near the quarter
pole, opened back up to clear command then stayed sharp in response and finished ridden out in final sixteenth. THREE DEEP tracked the leader through
early stages then launched a bid for command around the turn, could not reach the winner but kept on with response and secured place. RISE N' SHINE
was unhurried, raced in the rear and saved ground, given cue along rail entering top stretch, showed response and advanced up the inside to clear the rest.
NOT NOW RAND bobbled at the start then raced in range off the top two leaders through early stages, kept under a ride near the inside on the turn then
faded in the lane. POSEIDEN was not far back and ridden along to maintain tempo down the backstretch, continued a bid in range around the turn then
retreated.

Footnotes
SABINA PARK tracked outside the leaders three wide early, rallied through the stretch and edged CULTIVATION through the final strides as they overtook
the pacesetter from either side. CULTIVATION saved ground stymied behind the leaders approaching the stretch, went around a tiring BELLA GIANNA a
sixteenth out, moved back to the rail with a last-ditch bid and just missed. MISS LORETTA raced without a whip, broke alertly and vied three wide into the
turn, gained command and edged away after a half-mile, but was overhauled from both flanks in the final yards. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB was outsprinted to
the stretch three wide, and was going well too late. COOKIE COVE was a step slow to begin, raced four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid bid.
HOLLY HILL was in a crowd up the backstretch, got shuffled back, checked and steadied along through the entire turn, remained bottled up into the stretch,
moved out very wide and finished gamely when finally clear. NERISSA lagged at the back four wide after three furlongs, and gained some ground without
threatening. BELLA GIANNA vied inside rivals for three-eighths of a mile, yielded to MISS LORETTA in upper stretch and retreated. CAPELINE saved
ground outrun to the end of the turn, angled well out in the course and made no headway. WHER'D DA LOVE GO contested the pace between horses to
the quarter-pole, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MISTRESS quickly cleared on top and widened advantage around the turn, roused for more entering top stretch, stayed on with good response
but BLUE BLUE ICE began closing fast in late stages, kept on under firm handling and just lasted. BLUE BLUE ICE raced off the early speed and dropped
to the inside late backstretch, saved ground then shifted out leaving the turn, kicked in gear, rallied on the winner then surged to the wire and just missed.
PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL raced in the back near the inside then swung wide entering top stretch and rallied to clear show. TONG SHU was forwardly placed in
opening stages and chased after the leader around the turn and into upper stretch then faded a furlong out. PAYNTER FEST was not too far off the early
pace, hustled along between foes leaving then backstretch then failed to sustain bid mid-turn and gave way. QUEEN KANTHAROS got bumped steps out of
the gate then hustled along and raced in contention, roused up the inside at the quarter pole then came up empty and faded in the lane. STORMY BOSS
showed brief response five wide near the half mile marker then flattened around the turn and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
LOVELY LUVY was unhurried in the two-path to the far turn, shifted out five wide beginning to pick up rivals approaching the stretch, rallied smartly while
hand urged and flashed the whip, and drew clear late. GHOSTLY BEAUTY went along covered up into the far turn, came clear in the three-path once
straightened away for the drive, bid through the furlong grounds but was outkicked by the top one. GIOIELLI got clear soon after the start, rated along at an
even clip through the middle stages, fought off a challenge from VALLEY DATE past the quarter-pole, but could not withstand the top two late.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN saved ground to midway on the far turn before moving to the two-path, went back in rallying through mid stretch, and lacked room
behind GIOIELLI a sixteenth out. VALLEY DATE raced in closest attendance to the pacesetter from the outset, challenged but was rebuffed turning for
home, and faded through the final furlong. TRILBY saved ground to the far turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch and passed tired horses.
HERE COMES JACKIE stayed in range early, came under a ride three wide outside the quarter-pole, could not reach the leaders and gave way.
BIONDETTI'S CHOICE raced three to four wide on the turns, and proved no factor. DANCE TILL DAWN was well placed off the leaders inside for a
half-mile, but was finished before reaching the stretch. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT tugged her way along three wide into the first turn, raced in the middle of the
pack four wide into the far turn, and tired.

Footnotes
WONDER IN tracked the leader through the early going then launched a bid for command around the turn, responded racing three wide entering top stretch,
took command then kept clear under steady pressure. ATTHEPEARLYGATES raced off the leader positioned inside of eventual winner through early
stages, remained forwardly placed around the turn, cut the corner entering top stretch then quickly shifted out, kept on with good response but could not
reach the winner. ISLAND TAP quickly cleared on top and held clear and comfortable into the turn, prompted to pick up the pace nearing the quarter pole,
got headed for the lead by eventual winner upper stretch then kept on and lasted for show. MINTZ raced off the second flight through early stages, kept
under a ride along inside leaving the turn then shifted out three to four wide, moved back to the inside in final stages and narrowly missed show. MOON
PISTOL hustled along three to four wide through early stages then coaxed five to six wide in stretch run and lacked a needed rally. ROAD TO PEACE got
bumped at the start and came away last, raced widest in backstretch then briefly gained position along outside on the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
CATHARSIS pressed the pace three wide, responded to pressure turning for home, rallied past OVER GATORS in deep stretch and drew clear. WAR
STAR was bottled up along the inside around the turn, got an opening when OVER GATORS shifted out a bit into the stretch, rallied along the rail and
nipped HEIR BALL for second. HEIR BALL broke in the air, raced two wide around the turn, moved further out and finished with good courage.
PROSPECTIVE DIVA was outrun to the stretch, and gained too late on the far outside. OVER GATORS set the pace inside, moved out a path into the lane,
could not fend off the winner and was overrun late from both flanks. VILARO saved ground through an even effort. BELLS IRISH FANCY leapt and veered
in at the start to spot the field several lengths, trailed to the stretch and gained a bit of ground late. SWEETSWEETSWEET pressed the pace outside OVER
GATORS to the stretch, and gave way through the late stages.

GEA was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, rated off the early pace racing three to four wide to the far turn, began to
pick up the pace then prompted near the quarter pole, was set down five to six wide in stretch run, gathered momentum under steady pressure and kicked
clear. A BEAUTIFUL DAY held a slim lead around the first turn then set a pressure pace down the backstretch, shook free and led the way around the final
turn, kept on gamely then got outkicked in late stages. JOSEFA raced between foes near mid-pack through middle stages, sat patiently then angled out and
prompted late far turn, roused along the outside then shifted out wider in final furlong and got a nose up for show. LOOKN FINE AS WINE raced five to six
wide entering the first turn, raced in range down the backstretch then launched a bid around the final turn, kept under steady pressure then got nipped for
show. POLISHED COPPER stalked in a forward position to the far turn, launched a bid and coaxed along upper stretch then flattened near the furlong
marker. KAYSERI raced in range and tracked the pace near the inside, urged for response along the rail on the final turn then faded in the lane. QUIET
DRAMA raced off the early pace, was put to a drive along outside but failed to advance around the far turn and offered no late rally. SNOW AND
LILLYLYNN was forwardly placed around the first turn, applied pace pressure to A BEAUTIFUL DAY down the backstretch then retreated in the final turn.
CAPTURED LIGHT raced five to six wide entering the first turn, raced widest off the pace, had no response when called upon and eased up in the lane.
QUEEN LETIZIA raced in the back then checked sharply to avoid loose horse on the far turn then eased up in stretch. FREE FALLING raced near the rear
down the backstretch then was taken up along the rail when rival lost the rider in the far turn then eased up in the lane. TERRIBLE TARA raced along the
rail not too far back then slammed into the rail and lost the rider on the far turn, ran loose then corralled and walked off.
