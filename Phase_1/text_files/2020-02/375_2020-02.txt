Footnotes
SWIRLING CANDY quickly gained command and crossed over to the inside, rated along with the rider taking a glance back leaving the turn, spurted away
from I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT when roused mildly in upper stretch and widened hand urged. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT broke out in front of DE PURA
SANGRE at the start, chased outside the winner throughout and was much best of the others. R U ROYALTY lagged well back for three furlongs, came five
wide into the lane and improved position on the far outside. IM THIRSTY TOO saved ground around the turn and through the stretch, and posed no threat
with an even effort. SHELL BEACH PARTY advanced four wide around the turn, but could not sustain the rally. CATALINA R was no factor three wide.
MIRIANA'S QUEEN was finished early inside. BRATOUTTAHELL raced three then four wide around the turn, and made no impact. TRINNI FLOWER broke
alertly while veering out, stayed in range to the quarter-pole and faded in the two-path. DE PURA SANGRE was shut off and steadied behind I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT at the start, was forwardly placed three wide to the top of the stretch, and gave way mildly urged. JIMMYS LASS took a bad step while
near the back at the three-eighths, was pulled up midway on the turn, and walked off.

Footnotes
ICONIC brushed with rival after the start then switched out a couple paths and gained closer contention, responded when prompted near the half mile
marker, put a head in front at the three eighths pole then cleared on top, kept under a drive three wide into stretch run, repelled the bid from BLAKEY then
widened advantage under steady pressure and finished clear. BLAKEY was forwardly placed and tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, given cue
nearing the midway point on the turn, hustled along racing three path past the quarter pole then remained in pursuit for the leader, was fully extended in late
stages and had to settle for second best. FALSE ACCUSATION stalked through early stages then advanced three wide to race in aim for the lead entering
the far turn, could not move on with eventual winner but continued a steady bid through the lane and secured share. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) bumped with
rival just after the start then saved ground tracking the early pace, inched up along the rail to race in striking distance three furlongs from home, got in a bit
tight, flattened out then chased evenly along the rail through the lane. CAPE MARCO DRIVE got bumped just after the start then remained reserved in the
back saving ground, shifted to the outside and passed tiring foes in the lane. MYSTERIO raced off the pace and six paths wide through early stages, angled
in to save ground around the turn then moved back out and failed to rally. ORGANIC JENNY raced two wide near the rear, put to a drive late backstretch
and had no response. SKY POINT was off a step slow at the start then positioned not too far off the early pace but failed to move on when called upon.
AMERICAN ROCK SALT bumped with rival just after the start then held a slim lead out of the chute, cleared on top and raced two off the inside down the
backstretch, got headed by eventual winner near three eighths pole then dropped back.

CAMP RANDALL sprinted to the front at the start, raced out in the three-path past the quarter-pole while pressed from outside by HIGHER AUTHORITY,
shifted in drawing clear through the furlong grounds and widened under a mild drive. OHANZEE bumped with CREEDMOOR at the start and again a few
strides later, chased outside the leaders around the turn, altered course inside CAMP RANDALL at the top of the stretch, and turned back HIGHER
AUTHORITY for the place. HIGHER AUTHORITY tracked the early pace toward the inside, got carried out by CAMP RANDALL in a bid for the lead
approaching the stretch, got shaken off after straightening away, and went evenly late outside the runner-up. OROSCOPO saved ground to the stretch, and
lacked the needed response. RED MULE had the two-path on the turn, moved out in the stretch and made no headway. THOUSANDYARDSTARE broke
awkwardly and bumped with NOTHING FOR FREE, then got pushed in by that one, and raced well back throughout. NOTHING FOR FREE bumped with
THOUSANDYARDSTARE at the start, then came in pushing that one in a few paths, and was always far back. CREEDMOOR broke out and bounced off
OHANZEE at the start, then bumped with that one again after a few strides, pressed the pace outside CAMP RANDALL into the turn, got out badly late on
the turn and wound up in the middle of the course, and continued to drop back.

FIRST RATE stalked down the backstretch then loomed up to challenge for the lead nearing the quarter pole, vied with CHILL HAZE into stretch run, battled
outside of rival under steady pressure then shook clear in late stages. NILES CHANNEL settled nicely near mid-range through middle stages, raced off the
top trio and prompted near the quarter pole, sustained bid in stretch run and got up late for place. CHILL HAZE was forwardly placed and stalked the
pacesetter down the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead at three eighths pole, edged by FIFTY CENTS and took on the challenge from FIRST
RATE, battled back gamely inside of rival in stretch run then weakened in final stages. BLESSED JOURNEY raced in range through early stages, came
under a ride around the turn, sustained a bid along the far outside in stretch run but needed more for serious impact. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER got
slammed sideways at the start, raced in the back then rushed into contention along the inside, kept under a ride along the inside around the turn then tired
in the drive. BOURBON STREET drifted in and slammed hard into foes then stumbled and steadied at the start, prompted along the outside around the turn
but failed to respond. FIFTY CENTS set the pace down the backstretch, got collared by CHILL HAZE near the three eighths pole then faded. LEMON DROP
CANDY raced five wide off the pace and failed to move into contention. EMBRACE MY UNCLE got slammed back at the start, ridden along not too far off
the pace then quickly retreated around the turn and eased in the lane.

MR ATILA prompted the pace outside JAMAICAN, took over approaching the quarter-pole in the three-path, and turned back challengers from both flanks
through a long drive. PEPPI THE HUNTER was never far back, bid inside the winner turning for home, and finished gamely to get the place narrowly.
KAHRAMANI advanced three then four wide around the turn, had aim on the far outside through the drive but did not have enough. JAMAICAN set the pace
inside, got collared shortly before completing six furlongs, and gave way on the rail. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF
KAHRAMANI FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

ROMAN CITY bumped with rival just after the start and raced off the early speed, dropped inside leaving the backstretch then shifted out wider turning for
home, was set down five wide for the drive, kicked in gear and surged clear. MYFIRSTEXWIFE vied for the lead with TRULY AMBITIOUS in opening stages
then edged back into tracking position, launched a two wide rebid top of the lane, got by rival to briefly hold the lead then got outkicked when the winner
surged by. KAYLA'S TUNE bumped with rival after the start then raced in range along the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out three wide upper stretch,
kept along in steady pursuit and up late for show. CHOUCHOU DE BOO bumped after the start then raced off the top pair, was ridden along the inside
around the turn, switched out a path and kept on with interest in stretch run but lacked the needed response for serious impact. TRULY AMBITIOUS vied for
the lead with MYFIRSTEXWIFE in opening stages then held clear around the turn, remained the leader along the rail then got collared near mid-stretch and
faded. FERNANDA chased along the outside in range then flattened out on the turn and chased on evenly. NATIONALIST lacked early foot and raced near
the back, was ridden along into stretch run, raced three wide at the furlong marker and passed tiring foes. I'M A GINGER raced along the inside not far off
the speed in early stages then gave way around the turn. MUSIC CITY WOLF raced off the pace along the outside, steadied near three eighths pole and
failed to move into contention. MISS OVER THERE showed early interest racing between foes then checked near three eighths pole and faded. LADY
DENISSE was ridden along out of the gate but lacked speed, trailed in the back and failed to factor.

Footnotes
DAY emerged with the lead leaving the chute, rated along slightly removed from the rail, dug in when confronted by LONDON WEREWOLF in upper stretch,
dueled inside that rival to the wire and prevailed narrowly. LONDON WEREWOLF tracked the pacesetter from the outset, moved off the rail to challenge
turning for home, reached even terms past the sixteenth-pole and just missed. STEADILY bumped repeatedly with WOLF RIDGE at the start and was slow
to begin, came four wide off the turn and rallied to best the others while never a threat to the top two. LIL BULL was no factor through an inside trip. GONE
DIESEL stayed in range near the three-path early, and faded after a half-mile. ALL STAR SEILER settled in the middle of the field early, and lacked the
needed response when roused. BODIE CODY moved out five wide leaving the turn, and faded. WOLF RIDGE bumped repeatedly with STEADILY at the
start, dropped far back after a half and was not pressured in the stretch.

Footnotes
SOLDADO hustled up to vie inside GOLDENLION and TRAVELLING MIDAS, poked a head in front approaching the half-mile pole, was confidently handled
around the turn with a slim lead, edged away through the furlong grounds and was hand urged home. TRAVELLING MIDAS pressed the early pace outside,
tried to get past SOLDADO in earnest approaching the stretch, could not match strides once straightened away but ran on clearly best of the others. AND
SEEK raced three wide around the turn, could not threaten the top two but edged ALLURSTRA for the show with an even finish. ALLURSTRA raced four
wide around the turn, and lacked the needed bid. THE GIPPER took a slight hop at the break and got shut off between AND SEEK and ALLURSTRA, and
never reached contention. JOE DI BAGGIO dropped well back around the turn and continued to fade away. GOLDENLION led early, vied briefly between
horses approaching the half-mile pole, and retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
GUNSLINGER (IRE) cleared on top and angled inside entering the first turn, rated on top under slight restraint to the far turn, vied for the lead with
KRACHENWAGON around the far turn, shook free upper stretch then just lasted over gaining KING LEONARDO. KING LEONARDO tracked the pace
down the backstretch, launched a bid around the far turn, sustained a steady bid into stretch run, kept on gamely after GUNSLINGER, was inching up
approaching the wire and just missed. THE MIGHTY JUDGE raced off the early pace, edged up closer along the outside around the far turn, set down
driving six wide top of the lane, finished strongly and gained to the wire. KRACHENWAGEN stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, prompted and
vied for the lead with GUNSLINGER around the far turn, could not match strides top stretch but kept close then lacked a closing kick. PAWNBROKER
saved ground through the backstretch and got through along the rail on the far turn then produced a mild inside bid through the lane. KEEP IT UP was
unhurried, saved ground to the far turn, raced three wide at the quarter pole, roused five wide in drive but lacked the needed response for impact. MR
STARK tracked the early and saved ground, came out a path and prompted around the far turn, failed to advance position then gave way. SOLAR
WARMING raced near midpack down the backstretch and failed to move on when called upon in the final turn. LOOKIN SAVVY was reserved in the back
near the inside, shifted out wide and put to a drive entering top of the lane and failed to rally. SEEMEE raced along the outside not far back then lacked
response when urged entering the turn and faded in the lane.
