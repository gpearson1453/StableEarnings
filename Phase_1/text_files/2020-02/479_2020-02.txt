Footnotes
WALKNTHEPLANK settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn then started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn and continued at even terms through the upper stretch before inching away the final sixteenth and raced clear under
the wire. QUEEN OF ANYTHING stalked the early pace from the three path then took the nod approaching the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled gamely at even terms through the upper stretch but was taken in hand through the final sixteenth. CUTTER LANDING
saved ground off the pace, bid from the three eighths pole and raced in the four and five paths of the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane then dueled through
the final strides to hold third. SING FROSTY settled close to the early pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the six
path and was gaining late on third. THUNDEROUS saved ground early and raced well back outside into the backstretch and showed little response.
LIZZIE'S LAST was hustled along at the rail to set the early pace but ceded the advantage nearing the seven sixteenths pole, engaged in close chase from
that point but steadied nearing the quarter pole and faded on the far turn. LILBITSOFDRAMA was shuffled back at the start, raced in the five path the first
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CASHMEIFUCAN rated a short lead off the rail, came under pressure leaving the quarter pole and was kept alert through the lane. DOWN WITH BROWN
chased the winner from the inside, was gaining through later yards, though, settled for second. BODHICITTA gave chase and rounded the turn about the
four path, bore out toward the head of the lane then finished evenly. BEAUTIFUL ESTRELLA chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn in the two and
three paths then flattened out inside the eighth pole. LINEA VERDE chased the pace inside, raced at the rail through the turn then showed little more.
HOMEMADE MARGARITA chased the pace outside then saved some ground into the turn, but, drifted outward through the lane. J C THE DESTROYER
gave chase toward the outside, came through the turn in the six path then weakened. INFLIGHT gave chase toward mid track though never factored.

mid-stretch, then widened through later yards. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced well back saving early ground then eased out into the backstretch, started his
bid with the winner nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path but was ultimately outfinished. SPECIAL SEASON (GB) rated a
short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but was caught mid-stretch and flattened out the final
sixteenth. GIANT DREAMS rounded the opening turn in the four path then settled close from the seven eighths pole, started a bid toward the three eighths
but dropped back at the quarter pole then flattened stride through later yards. JOHNNY BANKS settled close to the early pace inside then picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path but showed little further. DEPUTY DREW raced well back and off the rail early on,
picked up the chase from the five sixteenths pole, angled to the six path on the far turn and showed little more. RAMBAM ROCKER stalked the pace two
deep and raced between horses into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. PRIMARY ACCOUNT rated

Footnotes
HATTITUDE angled to the inside to rate a short lead, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at the rail rounding the far turn and dug in
to ward off the challenge of LADY MADISON, who was forced to the five path into the first turn and settled close three wide entering the backstretch, bid
leaving the three eighths pole to take aim toward the head of the lane and finished evenly at the outside girth of the winner in spite of the rider losing his
whip. DI COLAS COWGIRL saved ground through the opening turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole, angled four wide to come between horses
leaving the far turn then dueled for third mid-stretch. FIRE COMMAND saved ground off the early pace then eased outward into the backstretch, started a
bid at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn six wide then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. PRISS settled back about the three path the first turn then
eased out entering the backstretch, bid mildly from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path, angled widest into the lane and
passed rivals in an even finish. CATHERINES WARRIOR saved ground just off the early pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
at the rail, angled four wide into the lane then weakened the final sixteenth. CALCUTTA raced in the five path the opening turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. KATEANDLILLIAN stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced close to the top
of the lane before weakening. MISS SIMON drifted into the first turn and was not a factor.
