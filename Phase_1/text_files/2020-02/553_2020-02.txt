Footnotes
THE GREAT KATH broke sharply to gain the advantage, dictated the pace racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a widening margin to upper stretch and was
kept to steady left handed pressure. THIRTY NINE SEVEN tracked the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and
continued well enough to edge rivals for the place honors late. NERVE LINE ducked out a bit at the start, was righted, then urged to prompt just outside the
pacesetter racing to the turn but steadily faded in the drive. MI TIA CHRISTINA tracked the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the turn and faded between
rivals in the closing stages. YES IT'S ERIE, held up momentarily, then switched outside foes in the opening sixteenth, raced four wide into the turn and
steadily faded. BEKKI'S DANCE was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages but dropped out early.

RATTLESNAKE RIDGE broke readily, was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin in the opening stages, forged clear racing into the turn
and came under steady left handed pressure through the stretch to maintain a safe margin. SOUL OF THE HERO, reserved last racing to the turn, shifted
out four wide commencing a steady advance leaving the midway point of the turn and continued in that path to prove best of the others. TINY DANZA, held
up in the opening stages, switched outside foes to track the pacesetter four wide, then three wide into the turn, but had no late response. RELISHMENT
tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. ABSALOM tracked
the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SINATRA DEVIL took up a position just off the second flight while caught four wide leaving the chute, continued under light reserve three, then four wide
through the backstretch steadily advancing on the pacesetter in tandem with several rivals, moved to challenge for command three deep racing through the
far turn, continued to dispute the issue outside a rival past midstretch and edged forward in time under firm handling. HAY HAY MY MY tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight, advanced three deep between foes after a half to gain terms with the first flight racing into the far turn, pressed the issue
between foes on the second bend, then continued to resist the winner's challenge along the inside entering the stretch but was outfinished. VERY
REPLACEABLE, reserved off the second flight while angling in a bit racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide midway through the far turn advancing
on the leaders and continued willingly into the stretch to close the gap on the top pair. CHAOS KID tracked the pacesetter outside a rival to the first turn, led
the second flight into the backstretch, lodged a brief bid between foes racing into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. FED XMAN, urged to the lead
while angling to the rail, set the pace on a clear margin into the backstretch, was headed racing into the far turn, then shifted out while continuing in brief
pursuit but had no late response. SANDY BY THE BEACH broke slowly, then was bumped by LUPRIAN, settled into stride, switched outside foes nearing
the far turn but had no closing bid. LUPRIAN swerved at the break bumping SANDY BY THE BEACH and never gained contention. IMPERIAL IVOR,
reserved along the inside early, failed to menace. BUDDY'S PEAK'N tracked off the second flight along the inside but faded early. RUBENSLEGACY was a
brief factor while angling to the inside racing as part of the second flight but retreated early .

Footnotes
FLAN broke sharply, was urged along inside a rival pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, took over entering the bend and held sway on a widening
advantage under left handed encouragement. SOLD ON SALSA, urged to gain the lead outside a rival in the opening stages, proved no match for that foe
racing into the turn but continued with interest to save the place honors. RISEN CHANGE tracked the leaders between foes in the opening quarter, angled
to the inside entering the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. THEY CALL ME LUCKY ducked a bit at the start, was settled last,
angled inside foes racing into the turn, then shifted out to gain some position between foes late while no real threat. PASS IT ON, under pressure to contend
along the rail tracking off the second flight, never gained contention. FLUGEL BINDER was rated outside foes tracking off the second flight, was fanned five
wide into the stretch and proved no threat. BONSAI BENNY tracked the leaders three deep in early stages, made brief pursuit of those rivals racing into the
turn but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
VALIANT VIRTUE gained a forward placing along the rail, switched outside a rival racing to the first turn attending the pace under light rating, pressed the
issue entering the far turn, took over leaving the midway point of that bend and went clear under firm handling. MATTY'S EXPRESS, reserved last in the
opening stages while angling to the inside, saved ground steadily gaining position inside foes on the far turn, came around a tiring foe entering upper
stretch, then shifted back to the rail while finishing with a steady late response to gain the place honors. HIGH HEATER came through inside foes when
presented an opening racing into the first turn to track just off the pacesetter along the rail, continued in that position into the far turn, shifted out nearing
upper stretch while being roused to advance but couldn't gain terms with the winner, then was outkicked for the place honors. FROSTED ROSE tracked off
the second flight between foes under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but
had no rally. BATS CHANCE, carried wide racing into the first turn, dropped off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained
contention. HATS OFF TOO YOU, prompted to a forward placing in the opening stages, drifted out racing into the first turn, was righted nearing the
backstretch to track just off the leaders in the three path on the backstretch, was prompted to make a brief bid in that path racing into the far turn but quickly
came up empty. FREE DANCER sped to the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn and gave out once headed
by the winner.

Footnotes
J'S INDIAN CHARM broke readily to gain a narrow advantage racing in the two path in the opening stages, dictated the pace shifting further off the rail
nearing upper stretch and held sway on a widening margin under firm encouragement. CLEARWATER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight,
shifted inwards nearing the lane to bid inside the pacesetter entering upper stretch but proved no match. SELECT FRIDAY, urged to gain a forward placing
in three path prompting the pacesetter into the turn, faded losing ground to that foe racing into the stretch but produced some late energy to regain a share
nearing the wire. RUSSIAN ROULETTE tracked the leaders four wide, then three wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn, angled inwards nearing
upper stretch to make some progress between foes but had no late kick. MY GIRL ANNIE was settled last, shifted out four wide racing into the turn while
being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. STARSHIP REINA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled to the rail nearing the turn
while making brief progress to gain striking distance but flattened out in upper stretch. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY tracked off the second flight inside, dropped
out early, then shifted out five wide in the lane.

Footnotes
MORE THAN GRACIOUS, reserved last in the opening half, commenced a steady advance outside foes nearing the far turn, came through close quarters
to split rivals three deep nearing midstretch, then continued with a sustained response to reel in MARCHENWALD in time under firm handling. The latter
gained a forward placing along the rail to track just inside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted to challenge for command nearing upper
stretch, came through entering upper stretch to hold sway through the lane but just failed to contain the winner. V K LEGACY tracked off the second flight
inside foes in early stages, shifted out entering the far turn, was held up momentarily in close quarters midway through the far turn, swung out five wide
entering the lane and continued with a belated effort to gain position to the end. FLORIDA RUST, reserved between foes early, angled to the rail nearing the
far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. TWO STEP BEAT tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the
opening half, angled out four wide racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed late bid. HIGH CLASS PLAYER
shifted out four wide racing into the first turn gaining a position just off the leaders, tracked those rivals three deep through the backstretch into the far turn
while being prompted in a brief bid but came up empty in the drive. ALEXACRAT, urged to gain terms with the first flight three deep racing to the first turn,
pressed the issue between foes to the far turn and gave way. UNITEDTORUN, pulling against restraint between foes tracking between foes in second flight,
angled to the inside entering the far turn while continuing to race a bit erratically and gave way while held up out of tight quarters entering the lane.
BELLABLUEBAYOU moved to gain a narrow advantage between foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace to the far turn and gave way.
AJ'SLITTLEDANCER dropped out early.

Footnotes
MERMAID KISSES, in touch with the leaders four wide, then three wide attending the pace, was urged to press the issue outside a rival racing through the
turn, forged clear in upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. LADY DENISSE, slow to gather stride, gathered momentum racing into the turn
advancing outside foes, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch to split rivals just off the inside in the closing stages and edged a rival for the place honors on
the wire. STRAND DE ORO tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the stretch to race four wide leaving the
furlong marker and was just outkicked for the place honors. OLGA AGAIN settled between foes, then angled to the rail entering the turn, continued with an
even effort and shifted out to split foes just off the inside in the closing stages. TESSIE'S RED SOX, urged to prompt the pace between foes from the outset
racing into the turn, lost ground to the leaders entering the bend and gave way into the lane. I AM A. LURING tracked off the first flight racing four wide to
the turn and gave way. CAPTAIN ANGEL, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset, dueled for command inside the eventual winner to upper
stretch and gave way. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE proved no factor. IMPAZIBLE GIRL broke a step slowly and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BURN THE BOATS tracked the pacesetter between foes leading the second flight on a narrow margin racing to the first turn, steadily moved to terms with
the pacesetter entering the backstretch, prompted that rival racing into the second bend, took over racing into upper stretch and held the late challenge of
DRILLOMATIC to the end under firm handling. The latter tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, then
continued with a steady effort to challenge the leader racing past midstretch but was outkicked. HOLD THE SPICE, three deep racing to the backstretch
tracking off the second flight, shifted out four wide leaving the far turn and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share nearing the wire. CHIEF OF JOY
angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out through the stretch to race three wide
between foes late but lacked the needed final kick. LUIS TWO GUNS, pulled his way to the lead along the rail racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace
on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way. PAUL CANE tracked off the second flight in the opening half, angled to the inside nearing the lane but had
no rally. I AINT TELLIN settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling out five wide through the
stretch but made no impact. IRISH EXPECTATIONS, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, proved no threat. SPIRIT OF YORK hopped at the
start, was settled last along the rail, steadied off a rival nearing the backstretch, then again approaching the far turn and soon dropped out.
