ROBIN'S DESTINY stalked the pace outside leader, took the lead near sixteenth pole and drew off. VESTED VENTURE set the pace along the rail and was
no match late. GRANDE BESO, three wide on final turn, drifted in stretch and was no threat. SYDNEY TIME, widest, never threatened. VELOCITA
BRILLANTE saved ground and tired. VIVA NEVADA broke slowly, raced between foes and was no factor.

Footnotes
MAKE THE RULES dueled between foes, took the lead on the far turn, drifted out through stretch and held on. HONOR AND COURAGE left the gate in
tangle, saved ground for five furlongs, swung wide on the final turn, drifted in early stretch, had dead on winner deep stretch but hung. FREE FOR
NOTHING raced wide while advancing, drifted in through stretch and flattened out. DON POLO, in the three path early, split rivals on the final turn, eased
out in stretch and lacked a strong closing bid. VOCAB, between rivals while just off the pace, tired. JONES TAXI stumbled and broke to the right, raced wide
and didn't threaten. QUENCH MY THIRST dueled for the lead three wide before tiring. ALMOST PERFECT saved ground setting the pace and had nothing
left. CLEVER CALIBAN saved ground just off the pace then tired.

Footnotes
GOTTA GET AWAY was bumped leaving gate and then was steered wide, remained outside and challenged near stretch, took the lead deep stretch and
gamely held on. CHELIOS came out at the start bumping WILD HAVEN into GOTTA GET AWAY, raced in traffic between foes near stretch, continued
between foes through stretch and was up for place. COUNTY CORRECTIONS, two wide early, angled out near the quarter pole, drifted wider under left
handed pressure early stretch, was straightened away and finished gamely. BRIO MAN, three wide early, took the lead near stretch and then gave way
grudgingly. WILD HAVEN, bumped into winner leaving gate, was outrun while inside, swung very wide into stretch and closed well. RINGS OF JUPITER
was just off the pace between foes then tired. THESE BLUES broke slowly, saved ground and didn't threaten. BLINDING set the pace in the four path then
stopped suddenly. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CHELIOS AGAINST GOTTA GET AWAY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN EARLY
STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
SENIOR INVESTMENT, in the five path while just off pace, rallied to the lead entering stretch, opened a long lead with a furlong to run and was under
pressure to the final yards. WAIT FOR IT, between foes, waited for racing room near stretch, angled to the rail and gained place. SEMI EXCITED broke
slowly, was two wide early, swung very wide on the final turn and into stretch and flattened out. TYBALT came out and bumped foe leaving the gate, saved
ground to the final turn, swung extremely wide into stretch, drifted wider under left handed pressure, was straightened and passed tiring rivals. RUBY BLEU
set the pace along the rail, drifted a bit entering stretch then faded. FOREST FIRE, bumped leaving the gate, raced wide and failed to be a serious threat.
GRASSHOPPIN stalked the pace two wide, remained a factor to early stretch then gave way. ASPHALT PAVING saved ground and stopped.

Footnotes
ROSE OF DUBLIN settled off the pace in an outside stalking position, chased two wide on the far turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, closed steadily
and wore down her rival in deep stretch after a long drive. ALTAR OF SPEED raced three wide early, then vied two wide for the lead, took over soon after,
showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. SUNFEST stalked the pace, advanced on the far turn,
rallied mildly for third and lacked a winning bid. KISSKISS TELLTELL raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn and bested the
others. LITTLE CAT GEE was off slowly, trailed the field while saving ground, raced inside into the stretch and lacked a rally. WISE TRADE raced off the
pace inside and did not factor. SAVANNAH'S DREAM raced four wide early and was outrun. GLAMOROUS THUNDER bobbled at the break, vied inside for
the early lead, then tracked inside and gave way.
