Footnotes
PRINCESS MO prompted the pace outside the runner-up then between foes leaving the second turn, battled outside the runner-up through the stretch and
gamely got up in the final stride under urging. MERNEITH sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inside, fought back from the rail through a
long drive and was narrowly edged on the line. NORA'S JOY stalked three deep then outside a rival, bid three wide leaving the second turn, continued three
wide into the stretch, drifted in between foes in midstretch and held third. CLASSY RULER pulled inside then came out sharply on the first turn, stalked
outside, entered the stretch four wide and lacked the needed rally. REGAL BEAUTY saved ground stalking the pace throughout and could not offer the
necessary late kick. MY HAPPY GIRL broke outward, went four wide into the first turn, angled to the inside on that turn and saved ground chasing the pace,
came out a bit into the stretch then drifted in and weakened. TOWER SMASH three wide into the first turn, chased off the rail or outside a rival, came out
into the stretch and had little left for the drive. DON'T UNZIP ME chased between rivals then a bit off the rail, dropped back on the second turn, gave way
and was eased in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PROUD PEDRO (FR) stalked inside then between horses, came three deep into the stretch, rallied under urging to bid three wide a sixteenth out, gained
the lead in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. FARQUHAR pulled along the inside and steadied twice in the stretch the first time, chased inside then
between horses on the second turn, steadied in traffic nearing the stretch, came out for room in midstretch and finished well. RED KING chased between
horses then outside a rival, went up four wide on the second turn and three deep into the stretch, took a short lead outside the pacesetter in midstretch,
fought back between foes in deep stretch and was edged for second. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT three deep on the hill, angled in and chased inside, came out for
room in midstretch and bested the others. TURN THE SWITCH took the early lead and set the pace inside, dueled on the backstretch, inched away again
on the second turn, fought back inside in the stretch and weakened some late. GO DADDY GO stalked three deep then between horses on the backstretch
and second turn and could not quite summon the needed late kick. CRYSTAL TRIBE (IRE) off a bit slowly, settled off the rail then came out four wide on the
first turn, chased three deep on the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. M TOWN GEM chased three deep then
outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary late response. SOUTHERN KING pulled along the inside stalking the
pace, fell back some on the first turn and backstretch, was shuffled back along the rail into and leaving the second turn, steadied into the stretch, came out
for room and was in a bit tight off heels a sixteenth out and lacked a rally. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) pulled a bit off the rail then came out three deep in
the first stretch with a move forward, bid alongside the pacesetter on the clubhouse turn and backstretch, dropped back between foes on the second turn,
steadied in traffic leaving that turn and weakened.
