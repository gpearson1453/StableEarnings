finished second best. FLYIN FALYNN tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn and was along for the show position. WOMAN AT THE WELL set
a pressured early pace, raced along the inside and weakened. LAKOTA PRINCESS pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead
and faded. LITTLE VALLEY GIRL was up close early, raced between rivals into the turn and gave way.

IRISH POLO tracked the early pace, advanced seven wide through the turn, took control at the eighth pole and held for the win. A CEE DOO CEE was void
of any early speed, circled nine wide through the turn, was gaining late and just missed. JIMBO'S BIZ broke out at the start, was allowed to settle early,
raced eight wide into the turn and was along for the show position. JUST CALL ME KEN pressed the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and
weakened. EMBELLISHING BOB raced in mid pack, raced between rivals into the turn and never fired. PORT AGGREGATE forced the early pace, raced
between rivals and tired. HOT SURFING set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn and gave way. MOOSEWOOD was taken back and was
no factor.

Footnotes
FLYING BLUE pressed the pace of PRINCESS JADA from the inside, moved up to engage that rival nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, vied, opened a
clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. MORE SMORES showed no early speed, advanced three-wide through
the turn, moved between foes with a furlong to run, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. PEACEOUTYOURHONOR
was away alertly to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, angled in nearing the three-eighths pole, failed to gain in the drive and gave way in the drive.
PRINCESS JADA broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-eighths
marker and gave way after going a half. THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the
drive. SHIVERHERTIMBERS lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and did not reach contention.
COMMUNICADO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. BLUEGRASS BANJO showed brief speed and
weakened. DIAMANTE APPEAL was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
