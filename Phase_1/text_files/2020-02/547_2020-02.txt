MESS'N AROUND chased the pace while off the inside, came under heavy pressure three furlongs out, angled four wide approaching the lane and took aim
of the dueling leaders, forged to command a furlong out and drew away under left handed rousing. STAKES ON A PLANE , three under urging leaving the
far turn, shifted five wide for the drive, kept on willingly and got the nod for the place over a tiring rival. DANCIE grabbed command soon after the break, set
a rated pace towards the rail, was joined leaving the far turn, dueled nearing the lane then weakened in the final furlong. CALL ME JELLY ROLL prompted
the pace outside DANCIE, moved to apply more pressure mid turn, battled on near even terms into the lane then tired with a furlong remaining.

PUTTHEGLASSDOWN lacked speed, circled foes around the turn, entered the stretch four deep, closed determinedly and was up late. EASTERN BAY
prompted the pace outside CHARGE TO VICTORY around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. W W SPRINGTIME ,
showed early speed between horses, was shuffled back leaving the backstretch, raced well off the rail and rallied. FORTUNATE FRIENDS lacked speed,
swung to the four path in upper stretch and showed a belated move outside rivals. CHARGE TO VICTORY set the pace along the rail and gave way.
COLONEL SHARP chased the pace three wide around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
ITS A JOURNEY , well off a duel up front, was under pressure leaving the far turn, close in under left handed rousing, bid inside rivals leaving the furlong
grounds, gained command about a sixteenth out then drew clear. DOCTORSOFMISCHIEF disputed the pace two wide and to the inside of ANGEL AT
WAR, ceded to that one past the three sixteenths, fought on between runners near the sixteenth marker and kept on gamely to be clear for the place.
ANGEL AT WAR dueled three wide outside a rival, moved to the front past the three sixteenths, wandered outward past mid stretch and weakened late.
FRIGID SISTER lacked speed off the inside, came six wide for the drive and belated action while racing on her left lead. LIMITED VIEW brushed with DEEP
RED while drifting out a bit in the early going, stalked three wide and to the inside of that rival around the turn, was under pressure into the lane and faded.
DEEP RED , brushed and floated out some early, stalked four wide, edged up mid turn, came five wide for the drive then weakened in the final furlong.

SILENT FLUIDITY lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses and was up
late. OLIN'S HONOR stalked the pace three wide around the turn, was carried to the four path by JUDI BLUE EYES in upper stretch, gained a short lead
between horses inside the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. SI MAMACITA prompted the pace outside TALKBACK, overtook that one in
upper stretch and weakened late. JUDI BLUE EYES chased the pace two wide on the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and flattened out.
TALKBACK sprinted to the early lead, angled in leaving the backstretch, hugged the rail and weakened the final furlong. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE was
outrun. RED HOT KITTEN showed brief speed along the inner rail and faltered leaving the turn.

Footnotes
UNEQUIVOCAL settled in the clear, steadily advanced outside a rival mid turn, bid four wide in upper stretch, gained command a furlong out, kept on under
repeated left handed pressure and held firm. BATTLE READY advanced inside rivals leaving the chute then rated back off the leader heading to the three
quarter pole, angled out and prompted three wide, bid mid turn, shook clear soon into the lane, was taken on near the three sixteenths, battled inside the
winner through the final furlong and held well. SIR DOUGLAS , unhurried early on about the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, worked his way
between rivals leaving mid stretch and closed steadily to gain. FINBAR , towards the inside, moved up mid turn, swung five wide into the lane, chased,
drifted out late and was out finished. KIERLAND lagged well back, raced four wide into the lane, shifted out a bit wider in the final furlong and offered a mild
kick. CALADAN settled in mid pack while well off the inside, circled six wide into the lane and failed to kick on. SEBRAY saved ground off the pace, was
under a ride leaving the half mile marker but lacked a response. HOLY WEEK dropped off the early pace, raced two to three wide in upper stretch but failed
to threaten. PARADE OF NATIONS cleared early, set the pace off the rail, took pressure mid turn, stayed on to the head of the lane then surrendered.
