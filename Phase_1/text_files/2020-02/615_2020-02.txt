Footnotes
IVORIAN was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, responded when roused, split rivals in the final furlong and edged away driving.
SECOND BOLD set the pace to the turn, was overtaken but continued to push on, dueled to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but bested CHIEF
EAGLE EYE for the place. CHIEF EAGLE EYE pressed SECOND BEST early, moved up two wide to take a short lead into the stretch then was collared by
the latter, dueled then was outfinished for the win and nipped for second. BILLTOWN BANNER got outrun to the turn, raced three then four wide to the
stretch and was making up ground belatedly. KENJI'S JOURNEY stalked the leaders three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished
evenly. PEGASUS SPRINT chased the pace to the turn, saved ground to mid turn then eased out to the two path but swung out widest for the drive and
lacked a closing response.

slow and was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. UR

MULHIMA (IRE) was unhurried to the half, bid two then three wide on the second turn, shifted out for the drive and responded determinedly to wear down
PAPAYA late. PAPAYA pressed the leader to the backstretch, pushed up to duel to the second turn, edged away to the stretch then dug in to resist the
winner but was bested. IRISH AFFAIR was settled to the half, swung out four wide on the second turn then shifted widest for the drive but could not impact
the top two. JAIMI JAMES had no speed while three wide to the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.
OURSENSATIONALGIRL hustled to set the pace early, was collared and dueled to the second turn but tired after six furlongs and gave out in the stretch.

YANGTZE RIVER was unhurried to the second turn, raced two wide then shifted out for room once in the stretch, responded when set down and closed fast
to win going away. FIRE DIAMONDS pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up two wide to engage DANIEL THE DREAMER for the lead in mid
stretch, battled on but was no match for the winner while saving the place. BORN TO REIGN stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the
stretch, was on terms leaving mid stretch then also was outkicked by the winner and missed second. DANIEL THE DREAMER set the pace from the rail to
the stretch, was overtaken in mid stretch and weakened. BILLY'SGOTASINGLE was four wide throughout, loomed a threat on the second turn but came up
empty in the drive.
