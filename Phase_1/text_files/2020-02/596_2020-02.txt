MASTERLY went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and held on for the win. FORGOTTEN COAST void of early speed, made a steady
gain and needed more ground. PHILLY raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn five wide, rallied late, four wide and was gaining on top
two. WABASH CANNONBALL lacked early speed, made a late rail bid, but proved no match for the top three late. BORN AGAIN GEORGE pressed the
early pace, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. HANDSOME HARVE raced near the back in the early part, came around the final turn on the
outside, improved position, but was no factor. REDDY TO BET was an early factor and faded down the home stretch. BELLARMINE void of early speed and
was never close. ZENDELPHIAN raced within contention and dropped back. CROCODILE JACQUES raced within striking distance and was finished early,
retreating to the back.

Footnotes
BLUNT FORCE unhurried in the beginning, came around the first turn four wide, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the stretch and
got up in time. THE AURELIA FACTOR went to the front, drove clear and got caught at the wire. MI CHACHIS INTENTA lacked early speed, moved up,
within contention and finished evenly. SWEET AMELIA lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. FLAT OUT FLIRTY raced near the middle
of the field and lacked a late bid. MADISON'S WILD ONE hopped at the start, raced in the back and was never a factor. GUEST APPEARANCE was an
early factor, racing behind THE AURELIA FACTOR, faded around the second turn and was no threat late. WHISPER SOFTLY pressed the early pace and
made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
MISS BITTERS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and drove clear before the wire. SASSY SETA was an early factor, challenged for the lead
throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. UNBRIDLED HARLAN unhurried in the early part, raced outside around the turn,
made a wide bid and got up for third. THAT'S A SONG raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and was outfinished for third. QUIET TRIP
pressed the early pace, weakened and finished evenly. LADYGOGENTLY lacked early speed, finished wide and was no threat. FANCY MALLORY always
raced near the back and showed little. ISADORA went to the front, drove clear and stopped.
