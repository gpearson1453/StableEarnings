Footnotes
SPOT OF GOLD was unhurried inside, angled into the four path on the turn while rallying, closed a gap from the outside through deep stretch, came in,
bumped lightly with WIDGET FACTORY and was up in time. WIDGET FACTORY took command at once, stayed out from the rail once clear before a
quarter, settled into the final seventy yards with a clear lead, came out late, bumped lightly with the winner and failed. JOHNY LIGHTNIN was slow to settle,
raced the two path around the turn and finished willingly. PENNY'S LEGACY wasn't far back in the four path into the turn, remained wide into the stretch
and weakened. A T M AWESOME was close up three wide between horses into the turn then tired in the lane. HUNTIN' THE RUT broke slowly, trailed
early, swung wide into the stretch and wasn't persevered with. RIVER BAPTISM RVF pressed the early leader from along the rail into the turn, fell back,
stopped in the lane and was eased up.

Footnotes
LIGHT MY PATH was driven into the far turn to gain ground three wide in the four path, got floated to the five path turning for home, but sustained her rally
to drive past the inner leaders at the furlong pole and draw off through the late stages. INCLUDE GOLD pressed the leader from outside of her flank, inched
forward to commence a duel into the far turn while being kept in the three path by her inner counterpart, drifted to the four path turning for home, but then
back inwards approaching the furlong pole, and brushed with her inner foe while getting bested by an outer charging rival. PLATINUM AFFAIR set the pace
while staying in the two path, met a challenge from INCLUDE GOLD into the far turn, dueled with that foe through the bend and into the stretch, but drifted
outwards in upper stretch, brushed with that rival at the furlong pole, and subsequently gave way. HEAVY TIPPER trailed in the three path into the far turn,
passed a tired rival in upper stretch, and finished evenly without menacing. OUR HONEY BELLE saved ground around both turns while settling off of the
pace, but weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
NICK PAPAGIORGIO set the pace under a loose rein, met a challenge from MAIN COOL CAT turning for home, dug in, drifted outwards many paths under
right handed pressure through the final furlong, but never made contact with his outer rival, and fended off that foe gamely to the wire. MAIN COOL CAT
stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, dueled with the inner leader in upper stretch, but was herded outwards by that foe through the final
furlong while keeping multiple paths of space away from his inner drifting counterpart, and was fended off by that rival to the wire. BOYS OF QUEENS
advanced position by saving ground around the far turn, shifted to the three, then four, path in upper stretch, and produced a mild rally without closing the
gap on the leaders. NOT FAKE NEWS stalked the leader from outside of his flank, held position into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader and
MAIN COOL CAT at the five-sixteenths pole, as that ranged up along side, and weakened through the lane. SAN ELIJO saved ground in midpack through
the first turn, but shifted to the four path while failing to keep pace with the leaders around the far turn, then further weakened turning for home. DOWNHILL
RACER broke outwards and about a length behind the field, was caught in the four to five path around the turns while far off of the pace, and failed to factor.

OLDFASHIONED CLUB came in sharply leaving the gate, was rated within easy striking distance in the three path, quickly moved to a clear lead on the far
turn and widened under mild urging. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR wasn't far back along the rail into the far turn, came out into the three path then tired while
clearly second best. HIGH FLYING GUY had early position three wide, faded steadily then outfinished a tired foe for the show. FED FEVER stayed out from
the rail once clear into the first turn, stopped in the lane and lost the show in the final strides. LONG TOM was outrun. FLASHY BARON trailed.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY HATTIE raced in midpack two wide and between horses early on, shifted to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to engage the leaders
from the outside, commenced a rally, bid for the lead at the furlong pole, drove past and drew off. JEWELS AND PEARLS pressed two wide while drifting to
the three path around the first turn, inched forward to bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, assumed command passing the five sixteenths pole and drew
off to a clear advantage in upper stretch, but was collared and surpassed by the eventual winner passing the furlong pole. BIG SHOT POSSE raced in
midpack between horses while in the four path through the first turn, angled down to the rail into the far turn and advanced inside of rivals passing the five
sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but continued to drift outwards, and failed to produce a rally to threaten the leaders. PRIDE IN THE
BIZ saved ground from midpack around the first turn, but shifted to the five to six path into the far turn, and failed to produce a rally while drifting out through
the late stages. SO WHO'S BACK trailed early on, advanced slightly in the four path down the backstretch, but faltered to trail around the far turn and failed
to factor. UNEMOTIONAL set the pace along the inside, but was headed by JEWELS AND PEARLS into the far turn, weakened, and faded through the
lane. TWO WAY ROAD had a slow start, pulled into the first turn while being caught four to five wide, advanced to a three wide stalking position into the far
turn, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole and was eased through the lane.

O K GAME ON was rated outside in good position, was urged closer three wide on the final turn then quickly ran clear through late stretch. ROLLING
PALISADES bobbled leaving the gate, took command before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail while making the pace into the final turn, regained
command leaving the furlong grounds but was little match late. THUNDER GRUNDER stalked in the three path outside the early leader, moved to a short
lead midway on the final turn then weakened in the drive. GOLDEN SPUN LAD wasn't far back along the rail into the far turn, was put to a drive then
stopped in the lane. STARRY SKY was outrun. POCOPSON STATION bobbled leaving the gate, fell far back and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
DRUMMER DON trailed early on, began a rally in the two to three path around the far turn, swung to the five path to be outside of the leaders in upper
stretch, and sustained his rally to sweep past the leaders at the sixteenth pole. STOLEN LOVE was forwardly placed four wide around the first turn, angled
inwards to the three path and bid for the lead into the far turn, dueled with his inner counterpart around that bend before forging a lead in upper stretch, dug
in as multiple rivals made bids approaching the sixteenth pole, but was surpassed by the eventual winner before fending off HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME for
place. HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME was bumped between horses at the start, advanced from midpack in the three to four path around the far turn, produced
a bid for the lead approaching the furlong pole, but hung, got outfinished by an outer rival, and failed to catch his inner foe foe place. MONEYBAGS saved
ground far off of the pace through the first turn, commenced a mild rally in the three to five path around the far turn, but finished evenly. ALGORIX pulled
keenly to a two wide stalking position in the three path through the first turn, but came under a drive to keep pace at the half mile pole, failed to keep pace
with his rivals at the five sixteenths pole, but kept on through the lane before getting outfinished for a minor reward. THERE HE GOES established a clear
lead in hand early into the backstretch while staying in the two path, dug in when confronted by STOLEN LOVE into the far turn, dueled with that foe through
that bend, but weakened approaching the furlong pole. CLINIC vied along the inside early on, but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole and faltered
through the far turn. NIGHT SPREE failed to get involved while caught in the four to five path around the turns. BRIGHT BLUE bumped an inner foe at the
start, was outrun in the three path, and showed little.
