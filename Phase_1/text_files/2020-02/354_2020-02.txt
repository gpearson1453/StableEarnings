Footnotes
THEODOSIA raced close up stalking the leaders, bid three wide on the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and edged away, driving. IF YOU ONLY
KNEW vied inside for the lead, dueled with DOUBLE THE BET, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and earned the place spot. DOUBLE THE BET
broke out bumping a rival at the start, vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn, dug in and then was outkicked. EMPTY HOUSE raced off the pace
between rivals, gained mildly and bested the others. MIDDAY PRAYER was reluctant loading, raced four wide early, three wide off the pace, saved ground
on the far turn, angled out and lacked a rally. GRANDE BESO raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DEREYA tracked along the inside and tired.
PHYLLIS DRILLER was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and did not factor. HALLUCINATION raced off the rail, off the pace and was outrun.

Footnotes
AMI'S ARTIE, well placed four path, steadied off heels on the turn, moved and split rivals into stretch, took the lead near sixteenth marker and edged away.
AWE MUN set the pace just off the rail, drifted leaving the turn, was straightened and lasted for place. PANAMA ED stumbled at the start, saved ground,
steadied on the turn, continued along the rail and finished well. NO HITTER, just off the rail, split foes near quarter pole, drifted out and held on well. TU
EXAGERES very wide early, made his way to the rail and had no rally. RUCKUS, three wide stalking the pace, tired. TOMMY'S TOP CAT drifted out on the
backstretch then failed to menace. BRAZEN PRINCE took up in tight in the opening quarter mile then was not a threat. DADDY'S PLACER drifted in on the
backstretch then showed little. HAIL TO THE KING, very wide, failed to menace. BILL'S MAFIA drifted out backstretch, dueled early then stopped.

ground to stretch, moved out and gained place. MIDNIGHT GAMES steadied after the start, raced very wide early, angled in and passed faders. ASPHALT
PAVING raced wide, drifted wider through stretch. INCENSED came out leaving the gate, chased in the four path then tired. MR. ROMANCE, racing just off
the rail, failed to menace. TOMATER GATOR, wide in second flight, tired badly. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) took up after start then showed nothing.

V. I. P. CODE raced five wide early, then pressed the pace, quickly took over, opened up on the far turn, was kept to the task through the lane and in hand
the final yards. FLAT OUT FLYING trailed the field, advanced on the far turn and rallied inside for second. CRUSH IT raced off the rail, off the pace, rallied
into second on the far turn, then stayed on to earn the show spot. CONTROLLED FURY chased three wide, raced three wide on the far turn and weakened.
REFUSEING raced five wide early, settled off the pace inside, went four wide on the far turn and had no rally. MASONS TURN pulled in the early stages,
tracked along the inside, lacked a bid and tired. WE B JAMMIN set the pace and gave way on the far turn. BRILLIANT RICHIE chased between rivals, gave

ZOOMER off slowly, saved ground early, looped the field racing into stretch and closed determinedly, getting up in the final yards. CATCH FIRE saved
ground in second flight, waited briefly for racing room entering the stretch, split foes, took the lead but was nailed near wire. FOX RED prompted the pace
two wide, took over and was clear mid stretch but then weakened. E J'S REVENGE, just off the rail, split rivals into stretch and was too late. FOREST
RIVER, three wide and just off the pace, tired. SHOCK TREATMENT, fanned out leaving the gate, was lapped on winner early and failed to threaten.
ADMIRAL ABE stumbled and came out leaving the gate, raced wide and tired. WILL'S PIONEER angled to the rail early, set the pace then stopped.
