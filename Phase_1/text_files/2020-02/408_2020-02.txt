TOWN JAK came out and bumped BLACKJACK JEDI while breaking alertly then fell back, steadied briefly on the backstretch, steadied again near quarter
pole when lacking room, split rivals and won going away. BLACKJACK JEDI, bumped at the start, drifted out on the backstretch, raced wide, took over and
was clear mid stretch but was unable to keep pace with winner. MANIPULATE saved ground, lacked on the room turn, split foes near stretch, rallied but was
too late. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE, very wide, finished with good energy. OBVIOUSLY DRAMATIC drifted out on the backstretch, challenged three wide the
turn then faded slightly. JUMP SHOT failed to be a serious threat. KINETIC STRIKE dueled for command two wide then tired. YES IT'S BONIFIDE vied for
command along the rail and then gave way.

run and dug in gamely to prevail. BIG RAY raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, bid on the rail passing the quarter pole, rallied on the rail in
upper stretch, dug in gamely while in a tight spot through the final furlong and battled to the wire. EMANCIPATION GOLD raced off the rail, off the pace and
rallied mildly outside for third. ODDS ARE away alertly, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and weakened in the lane. SCORPION DYNASTY

BLISSFUL BREEZE just off the rail and just off pace, got through along the rail entering the stretch, took the lead and edged away. KAREN'S GEM was
lapped on winner, steadied along lacking room near quarter pole, angled in then drifted out a bit and held place. STORMBEAM stumbled leaving the gate
then was crowded soon after, raced in the five path early, angled in and was tooo late. DANCIN DEBBIE steadied in tight near the end of the backstretch,
raced between on the turn and through stretch and had no rally. LENDAR vied for command between foes then gave way. PROSPECTIVE BELLE was very
wide throughout and no real threat. FLIPPITY FLOP joined for command four wide, dropped back through the drive. CONGRESSIONALSTORM, three wide
in top flight, had little left. ROCHELA saved ground and tired. NORTHERN HEART came in leaving the gate, was far back and was eased.

Footnotes
CORN OFF THE COB, widest and never far back, rallied to the lead near sixteenth pole and edged away. HERAWAY stalked two wide, took the lead near
furlong grounds but was no match late. CARDI G set the pace just off the rail and weakened slightly. TERPEYE broke slowly, raced wide, drifted wider
through stretch and was too late. RUMOR RIDGE, between rivals early, moved wider near quarter pole and came up empty. OCEANO ROSSO eased out
between foes after the start, was angled to the rail soon after and tired.
