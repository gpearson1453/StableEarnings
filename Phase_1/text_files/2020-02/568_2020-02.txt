Footnotes
POWERFUL VENEZUELA, two wide early, split rivals on the far turn, took the lead in early stretch and fought determinedly to preserve the win. BOSS OF
BOURBON ST stumbled leaving gate then was angled to rail, set the pace inside, resisted when challenged and gave way begrudgingly. KAIROS was
outrun early saving ground, continued inside through stretch and was no threat. INTERNET OF THINGS, extremely late to the paddock, raced wide while
not far back and then tired. SPEED SYNDROME broke slowly, saved ground while outrun, swung very wide into stretchy. ARRIVE IN STYLE saved ground
just off the pace, drifted out and tired. KING'S GOLD took up entering the first turn, raced between foes and was no factor. ALLIUM, racing in the four path,
showed little. SURFER BOY GEORGE raced wide and wasn't a serious threat. OFFERHECANTREFUSE showed little. KOAN stalked the early pace two
wide then stopped. KION saved ground and tired badly.

Footnotes
NEOM broke sharply and was steered to the rail soon after, set the pace inside, opened a long lead with a furlong to run and won under strong handling.
PECAN PATTIE bobbled then came out and bumped SWEET BLAME leaving the gate, raced between foes while never far back, drifted out through stretch
and couldn't gain. LORDEN'S LOVE, racing between second flight, took up chase after a half but then had no late kick. B B'S BUSTED, two wide early,
swung out very wide into stretch and faded. DIVA DRAMA, racing just off the rail while unhurried, angled out and passed faders. SWEET TURN, three wide
in second flight, tired. RED WAGON was never a serious threat. SWEET BLAME, bumped around leaving the gate, raced very wide. LIKE A PRO showed
little. GATOR GIRL came in and bumped SWEET BLAME leaving gate, saved ground and stopped.
