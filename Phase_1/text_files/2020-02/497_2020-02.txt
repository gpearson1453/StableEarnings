Footnotes
RUEFUL'S NIGHT OUT stalked the leaders to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied between rivals in mid stretch and pushed to the front driving.
ENCHANTING EVA attended the pace, was three wide to the stretch, responded to pressure to deep stretch then could not stall the winner but held the
place. PLEASE ZIP IT was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied to loom a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished. PAPA
SAID YA had good speed, dueled in the two path to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. FRANK'S FRIEDA had no speed and was
never a threat. NOBLE GIRL tracked the pace from the rail to mid turn, checked briefly leaving the quarter pole of the winner's heels then was crowded
inside by PAPA SAID YA from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth pole and steadying then did not recover.

Footnotes
LA WAUN had the best speed, rated on the front end for six furlongs while off the rail, responded when set down for the drive and held on stubbornly. GAIN
GROUND hopped at the start, had no speed and trailed to the second turn, swung out four wide into the stretch then closed steadily but too late.
CAROLINA ISLAND pressed the winner for six furlongs while three wide, got outkicked to mid stretch by that one but kept to task to the line. SPEED
SAVER had no speed, settled to the second turn, was outside the runnerup and had to circle five wide to the stretch then angled out leaving the furlong
grounds for room and surged but also too late. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT settled mid pack to the half, was three then four wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to
mid stretch but was outfinished late. IZ INVINCIBLE was reluctant to load then was unprepared for the start and broke slow, settled mid pack to the second
turn, came two wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. AWE tracked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but
also did not rally late.

PRINCE DE PRINCE had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then dug in determinedly in the final furlong to hold. RETURRAY chased
the pace inside to mid turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch then angled out in mid stretch and finished in a rally. ACTIVE PASS had no
speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch and was gaining steadily late. VASTLY DEEP tracked the pace three wide to the stretch, rallied to loom a
threat to mid stretch but was outfinished late. TIZ PERFECTION hesitated and broke about three lengths last, trailed to the turn, was two wide then swung
out widest for the drive but came up empty. RUN HEAT pressed the winner two wide to the stretch then tired.

MY MAN DRAYMOND chased the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, caught the leader leaving the furlong grounds then held off
CURRY NATION late. CURRY NATION was allowed to settle to the half, was two wide then swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied once clear in the
drive but was too late. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY set the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was tiring and
could not hold. MR. PAPAS chased the pace also to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch but finished evenly.
HERDSMAN was tracking to the half, got fanned four then five wide to the stretch then also could not offer the needed late response. CLASSIC CHAMP
broke a bit awkwardly, had no speed, was pushed out to the five path on the second turn and lacked a late rally. SMILING MATT was outrun to the second
turn, swung five wide to the stretch but also did not rally. NERVOUS NELLIE stalked the pace to the second turn, made a bid two wide to briefly loom a
threat into the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. WHEN JESUS WALKED had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ELEGANT TANNER stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, eased out for room, rallied once clear, collared RUXIN late then held CLEM LABINE safe.
CLEM LABINE had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn then finished full of run. RUXIN was sent for speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch,
was clear to mid stretch but could not stall the winner and lost the place late. WHOA BUDDY was outsprinted to the turn, bid three then four wide to the
stretch and was making up ground belatedly. DADDY JONES also had no speed, came two wide to the stretch and was closing some ground late.
DON'TTEASETHETIGER was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was in some traffic in mid stretch, checked and lost momentum.
VICENTE'S SHADOW bobbled at the start, had no speed and saved ground to no avail. COUNTRY ROAD tracked the pace three wide to the stretch then
weakened. CANNONBALL COMIN pressed the pace from off the rail to the stretch but was tiring through the drive.
