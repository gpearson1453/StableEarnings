Footnotes
BABY BROTHER broke readily, was urged to gain a clear advantage outside a rival in the opening stages, steadily widened the margin racing into the
stretch and held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement. ACTION WARRIOR ducked out at the start, was urged inside a rival prompting
the pace, switched outside that foe after the opening furlong while continuing with a steady effort but proved only second best. TITHED, off a bit slowly,
shifted out three wide early while prompted to pursue the leaders in that path racing into the turn but had no closing bid. SIR SWAYSALOT, off a step
slowly, was held up in tight quarters between foes in the opening stages and never menaced thereafter. HE HAD A SECRET was settled outside foes in the
opening stages and failed to menace thereafter. RUBENSLEGACY angled in racing through the backstretch and steadily faded.

Footnotes
OX TROT was rated from out of striking position near the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three deep racing through the turn to split foes in that path
nearing upper stretch commencing a steady rally, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. J B QUICK was
settled last well off the field to the turn, swung five wide nearing upper stretch to advance between foes and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the
place honors late. GIANT TRICK, urged inside foes from the outset disputing the pace, dueled into upper to stretch and weakened in the closing stages.
CALL ME HANDSOME joined the pace three deep in the opening quarter, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside a rival while gaining a brief advantage
nearing upper stretch but gave out late. R HOT TWENTY'S vied for command between foes racing into the turn and gave way. ONE FINE RIDE was a brief
factor between foes in the first flight but retreated early while drifting out six wide into the stretch. MR JOSHUA tracked off the first flight racing four wide to
the turn while making brief progress but had no closing bid.

Footnotes
LUNDQVIST tracked just off the first flight between foes under light rating in the opening half, was fanned four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn
while coming under pressure to advance, then continued to make steady progress in that path through the stretch to just edge ED'S DOG on the wire under
firm left handed encouragement. The latter sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, turned back a challenge to
regain a clear advantage between calls in the stretch and just missed. VINTNER tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening stages, bid for
command between foes nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. SNOW LION was rated off the second flight along the inside, shifted out three deep after
a half, was prompted to advance on the leaders in tandem with the eventual winner racing three deep between foes on the far turn to upper stretch but
flattened out late. FLEDERMAUS angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, saved ground to upper stretch while being urged
to advance but had no late bid. MORE THAN TEDDY broke slowly and failed to menace. SLEEPLESSDREAMMORE, caught wide to the backstretch,
proved no threat. HAY BO was a brief factor prompting a rival's pace but emptied out early. AWESOME ROMEO, fractious in the gate before the start,
proved no factor. SON OF SO raced erratically to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FLYING BANKROLL, carried outwards at the start by BOY SCOUT, was quickly righted to stalk that rival under light reserve racing to the turn while
remaining well outside the pacesetter, took over when given his cue racing into upper stretch to open a clear margin and held sway to the end under mild
urging. OHIO EAGLE tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn, advanced three wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to
close the gap. ONE CRAZY RIDE tracked off the second flight inside rivals racing to the bend, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position
nearest the rail in the last furlong. BREWEDTOBEPERFECT tracked the pacesetter between foes, then along the inside as part of the second flight racing
into the turn but had no closing bid. NOBLE KING dropped back to last early, swung out five wide racing into the stretch but made no real impression.
ODESSA GOLD shied outwards at the start, was righted to track off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and soon faded. BOY SCOUT ducked out
sharply at the start momentarily impeding rivals, was collected, then urged to the lead just off the inside racing into the turn and emptied out abruptly in
upper stretch.

VENETIAN PRINCESS was rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance in the opening half, shifted out nearing upper stretch
to bid between foes, readily wrested command and went clear under firm encouragement. CAPOEIRA tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight
to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing the far turn, was fanned four wide nearing the quarter mile and prevailed for the place
honors late. CHASING HELICITY, reserved along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, came around a tiring foe to bid inside foes entering the lane
but was outkicked for second. SHENU SHENUME was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled five wide nearing upper stretch and
gained some position in an even effort. PURO BLANCO, held up off a rank foe in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the far
turn but offered no rally. CENTSLESS DRAMA was rated tracking the pacesetter along the inside leading the second flight on a narrow margin, shifted out
on the far turn to lodge a brief bid between foes but proved empty in the drive. MISS MARGARET ANN sprinted clear of the field, held sway to the far turn
and gave out abruptly entering the stretch. CASCABELL QUEEN became rank after breaking a bit slowly, pulled her way to position four deep in second
flight racing through the first turn and dropped out early.

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS bobbled slightly while breaking on terms with the leaders, shifted out three deep racing into the first turn attending a rival's pace,
came under some prompting to maintain terms with that foe racing into the far turn, then continued with a steady bid to wrest command leaving midstretch,
edging forward under left handed pressure. UNTITLED broke sharply, angled inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, held
sway through the far turn but proved no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. LETMENO tracked off the first flight just off the inside racing into the
backstretch, shifted out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance but could make no impression on the top pair while edging a rival for a share
in the closing stages. SOUNION was rated just inside the pacesetter stalking that rival in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid inside foes
racing into the far turn but steadily faded into the stretch. DUDLEY SQUARE stumbled at the start, dislodging his rider, was collected by the outrider
following the race and walked off the course under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.

Footnotes
ALLEY OOP JOHNNY broke sharply to gain the advantage between calls, was rated along the rail to stalk just inside the pacesetter to the backstretch,
advanced inside that foe to challenge for command leaving the midway point of the far turn, struck the front, then lost the advantage near midstretch, shifted
out under left handed pressure brushing EMPIRICALLY while carrying out that rival through the final sixteenth but narrowly prevailed on the wire. The latter,
caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to position in second flight, steadily advanced on the pacesetter three deep racing into the far
turn, bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch striking the front, was brushed while being carried out in the closing stages and just failed to contain
the winner. WINTER'S WONDER angled to the rail to track off the first flight racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch,
came through inside foes, then shifted outside the top pair to challenge but was floated wide in the closing stages while failing to gain terms with the top
pair. SECLUSIVE settled off the second flight racing to the far turn and passed inside tiring rivals late. IT'S MANDATORY tracked the pace outside foes in
second flight, was fanned five wide, then six wide racing into upper stretch and had no rally. ARBA pulled his way between foes to gain the lead outside a
rival racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin racing off the rail to the second bend, briefly resisted challenges from the top pair, then gave
way racing into the stretch while drifting out. LAW OF THE LAND, pulling a bit against restraint in early stages, switched outside a rival to track the
pacesetter between foes, was prompted to make a brief bid on the far turn but quickly proved empty in the drive. HALEL proved no factor. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CAVE RUN, a bit outpaced in the opening stages, shifted off the inside nearing the turn gathering momentum, advanced between rivals nearing upper
stretch, split foes just off the inside to wrest command entering the lane and went well clear under firm encouragement. ANDREW THE BULL settled well off
the leaders while angling to the rail, saved ground on the turn to bid inside foes for command nearing upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but
prevailed for the place honors. FORTLITE was firmly rated tracking just off the first flight while shifting outside those foes to race in the four path on the turn,
was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. DRILL'S LI'L MAN was hustled inside a rival disputing the
pace through the backstretch, shifted out to the three path dueling between foes nearing the lane and quickly came up empty. ZECHARIAH, urged to terms
prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the turn, was fanned four wide between foes nearing upper stretch and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
FOX ROX was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide on the bend while being prompted to advance, made steady
progress in that path to challenge for command in upper stretch, then held sway to the end under strong handling. SINDARIUS, reserved between foes in
the last flight racing to the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to close the gap nearing the wire.
NOTACATBUTACARD tracked off the second flight just off the inside under light rating in the opening stages, briefly awaited an opening on the turn,
advanced along the rail when gaining a clear path racing into upper stretch but finished evenly inside the top pair late. DIAMOND MINT tracked the
pacesetter inside foes in second flight, was prompted to challenge that foe while shifting out nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick.
WELOVECANDY settled between foes in the last flight early, angled out five wide nearing the lane but had no late bid. SAVAGE NATION lost his footing at
the start while breaking a bit awkwardly, angled to the inside while being prompted to advance but had no rally. MERANGO TANGO urged between foes in
the second flight pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, emptied out into upper stretch. FAR FROM AWESOME, urged along three wide tracking the
pacesetter in second flight racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. CALL ME COWBOY sprinted clear of the field while angling over, set the pace to
upper stretch and abruptly gave out. CRIMSON SPADE broke slowly, raced outside foes in the last flight and failed to menace.
