DANCE AND DANCE settled in the clear while tracking a contested pace, cruised up five wide to have dead aim into the lane, forged clear under solid right
handed rousing leaving the three sixteenths then steadily pulled away under a vigorous hand ride. FAIRY WISH , off the pace while saving ground, eased
out a bit for the drive, advanced between foes leaving the sixteenth marker and just got the place. MIXWAYS settled to the outside of FAIRY WISH, raced
three to four wide into the lane, swung out for the final furlong and finished willingly. LIZ'S SMILE came away in good order and prompted the pace outside
PEARL GEM, moved alongside after a half mile, dueled then put a head in front mid turn, wandered outward while being confronted entering the lane and
gave way in the final furlong. PEARL GEM accelerated inside and took over leaving the chute, set the pace towards the rail, was joined around the far turn,
sparred to the five sixteenths then gave way heading towards mid stretch.

BETHABARA tracked the pace three wide, swept to the front near the eighth pole and quickly drove clear. KEEPER IN SPITE set a clear pace a bit off the
rail, led to midstretch and was clearly second best. KHALOS VISION lagged off the pace along the inside, swung four wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole
and was along for the show. BOURBON STYLE was off slow, raced two wide and never threatened. INFINITYPOWERSIWIN had early speed under a
rating hold, angled in nearing the lane, angled back out in upper stretch and faded through the final furlong. DEIRDRE OF LEGEND saved ground and failed
to menace.

PIGEON CREEK broke a step slow, angled out and edged up nearing the turn, took closer order between rivals past the three eighths, angled out and
circled four wide into the lane, forged clear under strong handling past the three sixteenth, kept on under pressure and held sway. LAUREL LADY chased
the pace, raced three wide into the lane, churned on willingly and nabbed the place in the final jumps. BLESS THE RAINS moved up between foes near the
five eighths, dropped in and took aim mid turn, got through along the rail and spurted clear soon into the lane, failed to resist the outside charge of the
winner, gave willing pursuit past the furlong grounds and faded very late. THIRSTY AGAIN , fractious in the gate, disputed the pace to the inside of SIPIN
ON BOARD, came two wide for the drive, altered out near the three sixteenths and weakened. NOW OR EVER saved ground, dropped back around the
turn and came up empty. SIPIN ON BOARD disputed the pace outside THIRSTY AGAIN, gave chase past the half mile marker, drifted out around the turn
and tired. DOROTHY M was outrun.
