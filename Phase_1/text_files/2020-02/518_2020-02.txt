OUT OF BALANCE bobbled a bit at the start, saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and again in upper stretch, rallied under urging to
gain the advantage nearing the wire and gamely prevailed. SAPPHIRE KID angled in and set a pressured pace inside, fought back in the stretch and held
on well but was caught late. PRETTY POINT came off the rail and stalked outside a rival then went up three deep leaving the first turn, tracked the leaders
outside a foe on the backstretch and second turn, came three wide into the stretch and finished with interest to be edged for the place. ETERNAL
ENDEAVOUR (GB) broke out a bit, prompted the pace three deep then battled outside the pacesetter in midstretch and deep stretch and was outfinished.
KYNANCE (IRE) also broke out a bit, pulled her way along to press the pace between horses, fought back into the stretch and weakened some in the final
furlong. KITTYHAWK LASS stalked a bit off the rail then inside on the second turn and in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.

TIZ WONDERFULLY stalked three deep then outside a rival, bid three wide into the stretch, took a short lead, drifted inward in deep stretch and held on
gamely under urging. MESO chased three deep then four wide on the backstretch and second turn and into the stretch, also drifted in past midstretch, bid
three deep then outside the winner late and just missed. RUBY BRADLEY pulled along the inside and was in tight into the first turn, came out and stalked
just off the rail, bid between horses on the second turn to put a head in front a quarter mile out, fought back off the fence in midstretch, drifted to the inside in
deep stretch and bested the others. REDS SACRED APPEAL angled in and was in a bit tight between horses into the first turn, settled outside a rival to the
stretch, split foes in deep stretch and bested the others. ATINA (ARG) stalked off the rail then between horses on the backstretch and a bit off the fence on
the second turn, came out in midstretch and lacked the needed rally. DISCREET DIVA four wide into the first turn, stalked three deep to the stretch and
could not offer the necessary response. CIMARRON saved ground chasing the pace, went around a rival in deep stretch and also lacked the needed rally.
WHOA NESSIE sped to the early lead and angled in, set the pace inside, dueled on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
