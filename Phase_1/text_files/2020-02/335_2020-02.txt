Footnotes
SMART RAGS set the pace three path, drifted out slightly through stretch and won under strong handling. PREP PRIDE, in the three path while just off the
pace, had no late gain. TATTERED, outside early, angled to rail near stretch, moved out wide again entering stretch and finished well. MARCH
SCREAMER, in the five back, remained wide and failed to menace. PAHALL REVEAR, very wide, passed tiring foes. VAUGHAN saved ground and failed to
menace. INCIDENTALLY, bumped leaving the gate, never threatened. LAY IT ON THE LINE, three wide prompting the early pace, tired. FAIRLY BOLD
came in leaving the gate bumping foe then wasn't a threat. PURE STYLE stalked the pace two wide, drifted out and stopped.

took up in tight entering and rounding the first turn, recovered and was well placed in four path then tired. PETER G. FOX was never far back racing wide
then tired. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE dueled for command between foes and also tired.

split foes then weakened. MBRACE GRACE, three wide early, took the lead on the far turn and faded through the drive. GORSUCH set the pace two wide
and then had little left. BELLY DANCER saved ground and failed to menace. DIMENSION, in the four path while just off the pace, tired. GINNER failed to
menace. CAR FIFTY FOUR, very wide, dropped back steadily. LIELIELIE was also very wide and was finished after a half. HOWBOUTDEMPATS showed
nothing. AS PER RULING 20040 FROM THE PA RACING COMMISSION, AMERICAN ROMA WAS DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.
