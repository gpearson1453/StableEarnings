Footnotes
DALARNA settled nicely and tracked the top two leaders down the backstretch, edged a bit closer then remained patiently handled on the final turn, tipped
out turning for home and given cue, responded willingly and kicked away to clear command. MY POINT EXACTLY raced behind the pacesetter and stalked
rival to the far turn, launched a two wide bid and raced in striking range, came out wider turning for home, was no match for eventual winner but stayed on
with good response for second best. ICE TEA rated off the top trio then urged for response around the final turn, moved into top stretch five wide under a
drive, continued a steady effort and prevailed for a share. TIGER BLOOD broke on top and set the pace on the inside down the backstretch, held a slim lead
over MY POINT EXACTLY near the quarter pole, stayed on with response entering the lane then got collared for the lead and had nothing left in late
reserve. CAUSE FOR PARDON settled off the early pace through early stages, given cue to head in pursuit entering the far turn, briefly raced two wide
upper stretch then angled out wider and lacked the needed response for impact. WISE TO LISTEN raced near the rear along the outside, moved into top
stretch five to six wide under pressure and failed to respond. KING ORB settled off the early pace then angled in a path leaving the backstretch and headed
in pursuit, was under a strong ride along the rail but failed to move on. HIGH NOON RIDER was unhurried through early stages then angled to the rail and
clipped heels when KING ORB came in a path leaving the backstretch, lost all momentum and never recovered.

Footnotes
VINNIE VAN GO stayed close from the start, slipped through inside the battling foursome up front near the five-sixteenths, came away with a short lead on
the rail approaching the stretch, lost the advantage through the furlong grounds but managed to prevail through a long drive on the rail. WHYRUAWESOME
pressed the pace in the four-path, battled outside the eventual winner and JERSEY JOE B appearing poised to go by in deep stretch, but hung through the
final yards. JERSEY JOE B contested the pace from the get-go inside horses, got joined from the inside by VINNIE VAN GO late on the turn, and fought on
tenaciously between foes the length of the stretch. WHO'S OUT pressed the pace in the three-path for a half-mile, and weakened between horses in upper
stretch. TRAVY BOY had his head turned to the left while in the process of breaking through the gate an instant before the other stalls opened, got away
slowest, moved five wide to reach contention midway on the turn, but could not sustain the bid and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
BAREEQA angled in and saved ground around the first turn then continued near the inside and tracked the clear pacesetter down the backstretch,
prompted to pick up the pace around the far turn then dug in three to four wide in stretch run, got by DYNATAIL then stayed on gamely and ran down
PUGILIST in final stages. PUGILIST quickly established the early lead and held a clear advantage around the first turn, remained clear on top positioned a
couple paths off the inside down the backstretch, prompted to pick up the pace mid-way around the final turn, continued clear a furlong from home then
struggled to hold on to a diminishing lead and got reeled in late. DYNATAIL was the closet pursuer of the clear pacesetter to the far turn, headed in pursuit
and roused two wide entering top stretch, gained closer contention in late stages and continued a steady effort. LUCKY LONG was allowed to settle three to
four wide off the early pace, prompted to head in pursuit around the final turn, moved into stretch run five wide under a drive then lacked the needed kick for
impact. ADMIRAL'S WIN raced in the back and saved ground to the far turn, angled out a path and put to a drive, produced a mild two wide bid upper
stretch but needed more to threaten. AMAZING AUDREY was unhurried and saved ground, prompted along inside around the final turn but failed to
respond. ITSMYLUCKYCHARM rated three to four wide down the backstretch then retreated around the final turn.

I'LL TAKE THE CAKE eyed the battling leaders three wide on the turn, moved further out rallying steadily through the stretch, and was along 70 yards out to
overtake LIZA STAR and draw clear. LIZA STAR vied for command inside FLASHIN DIAMOND into the turn, came into the stretch getting the best of their
dispute well removed from the rail, drifted out clear through the furlong grounds, and could not deny the winner while able to hold second. FREE TO FLY
broke a bit awkwardly, trailed in the two-path for a half-mile, and rallied mildly inside the top two finishers. FLASHING DIAMOND vied outside LIZA STAR
through most of the opening half-mile, and fought on past the eighth-pole before giving way. BARGAINAIRE raced four wide around the turn, and failed to
threaten. LADY ALIDA retired early inside, and was handled sympathetically through the lane.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF GOD tracked the pace two to three wide through early stages, launched a bid near three eighths pole and hustled up around the far turn, kept
under a drive three wide a furlong out, moved up to race in aim of the leader in final stages then edged by under a driving finish. LA RUSIA sped to the lead
and continued on top down the backstretch, held off challenger's around the final turn and remained clear into stretch run, fought back gamely when
QUEEN OF GOD moved up into striking distance then got edged out in final stride. TOURNESOL steadied not long after the start, settled inside off the pace
to the far turn, saved ground entering the lane then made a game bid up the inside, gained close contention then lacked the needed surge to get by the top
pair. RICHIES GREAT GIRL bobbled at the start then was a bit keen heading into and around the first turn, settled and stalked down the backstretch, waited
at the quarter pole then switched out a path and given cue top stretch, raced in close contention then hit some traffic, tipped out wider but had no closing
kick. RISING BELLA rated not too far off the early pace, prompted three wide entering the final turn but failed to advance then swung wide into the lane and
had a mild improve. WICKED SOLUTION was unhurried then picked up the pace three to four wide around the final turn, moved into stretch five wide then
failed to move on. LA CARA BONITA stalked the pacesetter to the far turn then launched a two wide bid, raced in close contention at the quarter pole then
failed to keep pace and gave way. QUEEN FIELD steadied not long after the start, settled near mid-range along the inside, prompted for more two to three
wide around the final turn but failed to move on.

AYE AYE SIR settled within range early, shifted out to the four-path into the stretch, rallied to overtake the leaders from outside past the furlong marker and
skipped away without benefit of a lead change. CAJUN CASANOVA chased outside ZAINO BOYZ for three furlongs, loomed a threat reaching a short lead
in the three-path between horses through mid stretch, could not kick on with the winner but continued well. MUCHMORETHANTHIS saved ground outrun
early, moved to the far outside for the drive and gained mildly for a share. FACTORINO lunged at the start, hustled up and stayed within range inside
around the turn, got through inside ZAINO BOYZ with a rail bid in upper stretch, but flattened out. ZAINO BOYZ sped clear early inside, came under attack
from both sides turning for home, and weakened in the two-path. GOLDEN CANDY raced three wide and could not reach contention.

Footnotes
QUENANE was unhurried and raced along the outside to the far turn, was under a ride five wide around the far turn, raced wide into stretch, rallied up to
challenge YODEL E. A. WHO for the late lead, dug in gamely and got a nose up for victory. YODEL E. A. WHO settled nicely and stalked on the rail down
the backstretch, moved off the inside and prompted near the quarter pole, shifted out to race six wide entering head of the lane, roused forward to a slim
lead then came under attack from QUENANE, fought back gamely from inside position and got nipped on the wire. DIZZY GILLESPIE tugged while rated
sitting not far off the frontend, settled more late backstretch then moved up three wide to challenge for the lead nearing the quarter pole, began to edge
away then got collared by YODEL A E WHO, stayed under strong handling and lasted for show. YES I SEE raced off the early pace then hustled up for
response around the far turn, altered course to race wider in stretch run and had a mild improve narrowly missing out on show. TO DARE raced off the pace
and saved ground down the backstretch, stayed inside around the turn then angled out upper stretch, raced four wide in range but ran on evenly in late
stages. SYCAMORE LANE was forwardly placed racing in striking range of the leader then edged up and vied for the lead around the turn, fought back top
stretch then had nothing left in late reserve and weakened. SENSATIONAL RIDE established the early lead and set the pace down the backstretch, vied for
the lead around the turn and entering top stretch then was all out and gave way. IL FARAONE had no response and trailed far back then gained ground and
caught up with the field in stretch run.

Footnotes
SCARTO emerged with the lead exiting the chute, rated along inside for a half-mile, shook off FAST LOADED into the lane while moving out a path or two,
and responded to pressure to remain clear. DISC JOCKEY stayed in range four wide early, came under a ride five-sixteenths out without making much of an
impression, kept to task outside through the lane but could not reach the winner while clearly second best. FAST LOADED prompted the pace outside the
winner to the stretch, and weakened on the wrong lead. BLOOD MOON was outrun through the opening half, swung four wide off the turn and offered a mild
response to go clear of the rest. MAKABIM broke about four lengths behind the field, trailed far back to midway on the turn, and passed tired horses on the
far outside. CAUSALISTIC hit the left side of the gate breaking inward, raced four wide on the turn, and went by faders. BEYOND GONE gave chase
outside the leaders for a half, and faded steadily while moving inward. AIN'T WASTING TIME was finished early three wide. IBERICO was never prominent.
CAPTAIN D was forwardly placed toward the inside early, and had nothing left past the midway point of the turn. K W CAPTAIN HOOK was done early
inside.

Footnotes
MONFORTE cleared on top out of the gate and angled inside entering the first turn, stayed inside and opened up to a clear advantage, remained
comfortable and well clear while continuing to pull away around the final turn, stayed sharp with willingly response and remained unchallenged while tapped
a couple times and ridden out in stretch run. UNCORK THE BOTTLE settled off the early pace and saved ground down the backstretch, angled out and
prompted past the three eighths pole, headed in pursuit and raced four to five wide entering the lane, switched in a couple paths under right handed
pressure, produced a solid bid but was no match for sharp winner. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME rated off the clear pacesetter to the far turn, given cue and
headed in pursuit racing three wide, responded and advanced to take the position behind the clear leader then raced evenly in final furlong lost position but
held well for a share. VINTAGE KITTEN raced three to four wide off the pace, prompted around the far turn, was under a drive six wide top of the lane,
offered a mild bid but needed more for late impact. RECKLESS SPIRIT got bumped then pinched back at the start, was reserved racing in the back, shifted
out and raced wide into the lane, continued a bid along the far outside and passed tiring foes. PRINCE KHOZAN raced off the pace through early stages,
saved ground around the final turn then angled out entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally. K W CAPTAIN FLINT tracked the clear pacesetter down
the backstretch, prompted near the three eighths pole, showed response two wide then failed to sustain bid out of the far turn and gave way. ASSERTIKO
secured inside position around the first turn, saved ground to the far turn and had no response when called upon. ALLGORILLA was the closest pursuer of
the clear pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid along the rail entering the final turn but failed to gain position then faded top of the lane.
FENTYNOLA raced four wide off the pace, hustled along and raced wide into the lane but failed to move into contention.

HOME BASE prompted the early pace outside EARLY ENTRY, turned up the pressure reaching even terms after a half-mile, and prevailed after a
stretch-long battle. EARLY ENTRY sprinted clear early in the two-path, responded when hooked by HOME BASE past the five-sixteenths, moved to the rail
fighting back bravely through the lane, but was bested in the closing stages. FORTUNE COOKIE went along in the second flight four wide to the stretch,
lugged in slightly on the wrong lead 70 yards out and narrowed the gap to the wire. STORM ADVISORY broke out bumping COLOUR GUARD at the start,
saved ground in range early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and finished one-paced. COLOUR GUARD got bumped by STORM
ADVISORY at the start, and could not menace through an inside trip. FIRST DEAL was no factor three wide. NOON TIME GEM raced two wide on the turn,
and made no headway on the rail in the stretch. BENEFACTOR stayed close two wide for a half, and faltered.

AQUAPHOBIA was well placed and settled nicely racing in second flight to the far turn, picked up the pace and edged closer racing two wide at the quarter
pole then shifted out wider entering top stretch, set down for the drive, roused forward five wide, briefly matched strides with MUGGSAMATIC then forged
ahead. MUGGSAMATIC raced off the top flight down the backstretch, prompted three wide and loomed up late far turn, advanced and vied for the lead with
AQUAPHOBIA at the furlong marker then failed to kick on with the winner. TEMPLE settled two to three wide through early stages, prompted on the final
turn, got carried out wider by AQUAPHOBIA entering top stretch, set down racing wide upper stretch, steadily gained and secured show. CLASS AND
CASH was forwardly placed around the first turn, edged up and vied for the lead down the backstretch, got by one foe and took on new challenger near the
quarter pole, fought back near inside upper stretch then was all out and gave way. DR. EDGAR raced three wide in close range on the first turn, remained
forwardly position and raced in striking range for the lead down the backstretch, edged up and vied for the lead around the final turn, continued up close
upper stretch then weakened. DR. SHANE came away slowly at the start, remained in the back and saved ground, shifted out upper stretch and had a mild
improve. GRAND JOURNEY raced off the early pace, hustled up along outside leaving the final turn, shifted in closer upper stretch, briefly gained position
then evened out. BRUCARITA was unhurried then raced wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. BASHA raced off the pace and saved ground into
stretch run then switched out a few paths and failed to move on. DUBBY DUBBIE raced near the back, moved into upper stretch four wide, shifted out wider
and lacked a needed rally. CREATE AGAIN held a slim lead on the first turn, continued with the edge and vied for the lead down the backstretch, continued
into the final turn then came up empty near the quarter pole. SALUTE THE COLONEL raced near mid-range then retreated in the final turn.
