EBB AND FLOW settled off the pace, bid five wide entering the stretch, closed steadily, dueled late and inched away to prove best.
SHESAIDSHESPERFECT drew off on the first turn, set the pace with a clear lead, responded when challenged in late stretch to duel and was outfinished in
a good effort. ESTRELLA POLAR was off slowly and veered out at the start, was unhurried early, bid inside, challenged for the lead past the eighth pole,
didn't have enough late, yielded and settled for show. TAYLOR GALS was never far back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, was under steady urging
in the drive and failed to rally. LOVEUTHREETHOUSAND raced inside early, shifted out, lacked a bid and was not a threat. FORT DODGE RD was through
after a half, was eased and walked off.

NO HARBOR IN SIGHT was fractious and reluctant to load, swung wide on the first turn, challenged for the lead on the second turn, swung wide, dueled
past the eighth pole, inched away and held well. PURELY POLITICAL broke slowly, was void of early speed, angled out on the turn, bid ten wide, contended
for the lead in deep stretch and couldn't get by the winner. PARKING PERMIT stumbled at the start while getting away well, was never far off the pace,
found his best stride late and was gaining ground. ROAD ROMEO set the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to vie past the eighth pole
and faltered. ACROBAT stalked inside to the second turn, tired and was not urged in the stretch.

SHESAHEATWAVE broke in, settled off the pace, closed steadily under left handed urging and wore down her rival to get up at the wire. BELLA'S BACK
came in at the start, sprinted clear to set the pace and was caught at the wire. SIERRITA chased the pace, narrowed the gap in a steady effort and finished
best of the rest. NOT THAT I RECALL raced evenly in a wide trip and was outrun. SHARP MIND bumped and was crowded at the start and was not a
factor. COLLEGE QUEEN saved ground to the turn, angled out, went seven wide and lacked a response. TIZ THE STORM bumped and was crowded at
the start, raced in the back and lacked a bid.

ACT UP was never far back, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, was in tight between horses in the upper stretch, closed steadily and wore down his
rivals to get up near the wire. EMPIRE KNIGHT pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew away for a clear lead, shied from the whip late to
have an uneven course and was caught. BANZE NO OESTE (BRZ) raced in the back, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed steadily to get up
late for show. SAXON LORD raced close to the pace, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, bid and hung late. CLASSY COVE improved position in a
steady effort. C C EXPRESS bumped and was squeezed at the start and was not a threat. WALLY'S GOT CLASS broke out, set the pace to the second
turn and flattened out. CASH REWARD bumped at the start, went eleven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a response. ARTAKSEZ bumped at the
start, failed to contend and was eased late. PARTY FOR ONE was through after a half and stopped.

Footnotes
MRS TAYLOR set the pace, drew off past the eighth pole for a clear lead and held well in a driving finish. IF YOU WANT IT was unhurried early, closed
willingly mid track and was gaining fast late. WINNER'S DREAM raced mid pack, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and was gaining
ground. PASZ THE PEPPER chased the pace, bid inside to loom a threat and gave way past the eighth pole. MY EXPRESSION chased the pace to the
second turn, swung seven wide and dropped back. FLASHY GOLD raced in the back and improved position in an even effort. DAWNS MORNING was not
a factor. BONITA RAPIDS was through after a half. UH OH SEVEN broke in the air to be off slowly and was not a threat.
