ONE ODD STORY gave chase about the three path then dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. AWESOME PARK drew clear and angled to the
inside to set the pace, had a long lead at the rail on the turn but was caught the final yards and just lasted for second. LIL LINDER chased the early pace
outside and rounded the turn in the four path then steadily improved through the stretch and just missed second. SILKEN BELLE chased the pace toward
the inside, steadied and angled off the heels of K's Machen Em at the five sixteenths pole, came through the turn in the three path, angled to the outside into
the lane and finished evenly. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW angled to the outside to give chase, raced in the five path of the turn but proved empty down the
lane. K'S MACHEN EM chased the pace then lugged inward in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened.

GREAT QUEST raced with the pace three wide and put a head in front at the half mile pole, came under pressure to draw clear toward the five sixteenths
and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. EJE GAMA set the early pace inside then ceded the nod into the backstretch, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn four wide then flattened stride. CAN DO TOO stumbled leaving the gate then raced with the early pace two deep
while between horses, dropped back toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. START FROM SCRATCH settled just off
the early pace about the four path, made a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened from the head of the lane. GI JO MAN showed little
response while racing well back.

then withdrew from a boxed in position toward the quarter pole, angled to the four path to recover stride through the turn, took over second mid-stretch and
finished well while holding onto second. MALIBU SPLASH chased the pace and raced in the five path on the turn, then finished well and was gaining on the
runner-up. COLLEGE KID exchanged light contact with Best To Be Me leaving the gate then steadied on the chute, picked up the chase toward the inside,
eased to the four path approaching the top of the lane and finished evenly to pass rivals. GANDHI'S CASTLE pressured the early pace and raced close two
deep into the turn, then faded through the turn. BEST TO BE ME exchanged light contact with College Kid leaving the gate then hustled to the lead, was

sixteenth. AFFIX saved ground racing well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and was along for
third inside the sixteenth pole. OWL RUN exchanged contact with Swiss Sunrise leaving the gate and settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and showed little more. SWISS SUNRISE was forced in and into Owl Run

the lead past the five sixteenths, drew clear into the far turn and held on well. LADY'S LADY was jostled at the start and raced in the four path the first turn,
started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path, took over second mid-stretch then flattened out later yards.
ALLEGHENY DBL LIME raced off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then
flattened out the final sixteenth. UAINTSEENMECRAZYET saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail, though, flattened stride the final sixteenth. ELLIE'S CORK saved ground off the pace then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn at the rail and passed some. HATTA DOUBLE came out at the break and made contact with Lady's Lady, raced well off the pace and showed little
response through the backstretch. LITTLE MAXIMOVA rounded the opening turn in the five path and showed no response through the backstretch. GOIN
GANGSTA tapered in and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths and faded readily at the
