Footnotes
ROYAL BLUE GRASS stalked the leader from off the rail, bid outside OUR MANEKI CAT and challenged around the turn and into the stretch, dug in late
and proved best in the final sixteenth. OUR MANEKI CAT set the pace clear of the field, angled over to the inside, challenged around the turn, fought back
into and down the lane and yielded grudgingly. BAJA WARRIOR settled off the rail, raced two wide and outside a rival around the turn and edged rival for
third. HEAT THINGS UP traveled a bit off the rail tracking the pace, saved ground while inside a rival to the stretch and was edged for the show. CAT BLUE
trailed the field in the early going, angled over to the inside, saved ground into the stretch and could not rally. RADIO TIM chased the pacesetter from off the
rail to the turn, injured and pulled up on the turn and was vanned off.

collared rival near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. HAVASU HUNNI set the pace up the backstretch, led clear in the two path to the lane, challenged by
the winner mid-stretch and could not match CARACORTADA in the final sixteenth. CAT'S DESSERT bumped twice leaving the gate, chased the speed a bit
off the rail, continued near the inside to the lane and went evenly late. BEYOND THE CLOUDS pinballed at the start, raced off the rail, three wide around
the turn and never rallied. REDHOTNREADYTOWED shifted in and bumped rival away from the gate, traveled wide up the backstretch, went four wide

BOUND TO GO bumped leaving the gate, stalked the leader off the rail, bid outside on the turn, drifted out a bid then cleared into the stretch and drew away
under hand urging. SEATTLE ENCOUNTER settled in the early going, traveled along the inside, put in tight quarters by HYRDOSTATIC and checked on
the turn, then finished willingly for the place. HYDROSTATIC chased outside a rival, angled in on the turn then shifted back out entering the stretch, lacked a
rally but held the show. IRISH JACK showed no early speed, saved ground around the turn then angled out but lacked a rally. ROYAL SONG bumped both
sides leaving the gate, recovered quickly showing good early speed, took control of the rail and led to the turn, challenged from the outside and fought back
on the turn but gave way in the final furlong. STREET MACHINE bumped at the start, raced two wide into the turn, injured around the bend and vanned off
following the race.
