Footnotes
BIG MONEY MACHINE raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of SUMMER MISCHIEF in a long stretch drive,
drifted in late, bumped that rival and prevailed at the wire. SUMMER MISCHIEF set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, dueled into the lane, dug
in gamely along the inside in the final furlong, drifted out a bit, was bumped late by BIG MONEY MACHINE and battled gamely to the finish. TALK TO THE
MEDIA raced off the pace, had a three wide trip, rallied mildly outside and dug in to earn the show spot. HIGH ROLLING DUDE stalked two wide, chased
inside on the far turn, finished evenly and was outkicked for third. THANK YOU raced off the pace, advanced two wide on the far turn and closed belatedly
to best the others. GLOBAL HERO raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and did not factor. CRUMLIN NIGHT was off slowly, raced three wide
on the first turn, went four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. GINGER SKY raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three wide
on the far turn and faded. CHISELED tracked inside and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection, BIG MONEY MACHINE was
disqualified and placed second for interference in deep stretch.
