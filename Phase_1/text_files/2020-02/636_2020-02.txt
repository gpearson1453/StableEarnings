Footnotes
GRAYCLIFF shied slightly outwards while breaking a step behind the leaders, tracked just off the first flight between foes under light reserve in the opening
stages, shifted out three wide entering the turn, moved to challenge for command leaving the midway point of the bend, took over racing into upper stretch
and went clear late under left handed encouragement. HIFALUTIN broke readily, attended the pace outside a rival, then pressed the issue between foes
nearing the turn, dueled for command inside foes through the bend to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while edging a rival for the place
honors. DREAMS OF SHIRLEY tracked just off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, advanced to press the issue racing into the turn, dueled
between the top pair to upper stretch and weakened late. ORNERY ANGEL, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals in the opening quarter, gave way racing
into the turn. TALK NICE made brief pursuit of the leaders along the rail and emptied out early. SPEEDY RUNNER switched outside foes early and proved
no threat.

Footnotes
PUBLICIST broke inwards at the start lightly bumping SAPPHIRE JUBILEE, was quickly righted to gain terms with the pacesetter attending that rival under
light reserve in the opening half, pressed the issue nearing the far turn to gain a narrow advantage midway through the second bend, then turned back a
rival racing into the stretch to go clear under firm left handed encouragement. ALEXBABE tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half,
shifted out three wide entering the far turn, advanced to challenge for command three deep racing past the quarter mile marker but proved no match.
ACCOLADES GALORE tracked the pace outside a rival as part of the second flight, angled four wide nearing midstretch and edged edged a rival for a
share. U KNOW I B LION broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's
challenge entering the far turn, then gave way into the stretch. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE,hopped at the start, then was bumped, tracked off the second flight
along the inside, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn but never gained contention. CASPIAN TALE dropped out early.

Footnotes
PIONEEROF NEW YORK broke outwards bumping BIG ANGEL, was quickly righted while switching outside the pacesetter gaining terms with that foe
racing to the first turn attending the pace under rating, was prompted to wrest the advantage racing into the far turn, then held sway through the final three
furlongs under firm handling and some right handed encouragement. STRONG GEM was settled last, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch,
advanced on the leaders four wide racing through the far turn to gain striking distance in upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. PURO
BLANCO tracked the pace outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, advanced three deep racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid between rivals
but flattened out in upper stretch. BIG ANGEL, bumped at the start, was settled in the last flight along the inside, swung out six wide racing into the lane and
made some belated progress. JUSTA JILL tracked off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing into the
lane but had no rally. HALO'S FOR DUDE settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. TEGLA tracked the leaders inside a rival as part
of the second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn but came up empty entering the stretch. SPICED RUM PUNCH was
urged to the lead along the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
MALIO'S urged to the lead from between foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin off the rail into the far turn, was roused to repel a
rival's challenge nearing upper stretch, continued in a protracted skirmish with that foe to late stages and edged forward nearing the wire under firm right
handed encouragement. OSVALDO, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just inside the pacesetter, was prompted to challenge foe command along
the rail nearing upper stretch, struck the front in a prolonged drive but came up second best nearing the wire. GUERRERON switched out four wide racing
to the backstretch, was urged to prompt the pacesetter three deep nearing the far turn and faded into the lane while continuing well enough to earn a share.
CIRCLE AWAY settled near the inside in the opening stages, angled out four wide racing into the lane but made no impression. FOUNTAINSTREETKID,
bumped at the start, tracked the leaders outside foes to the far turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and steadily faded. UPPER CROWN broke
inwards bumping FOUNTAINSTREETKID, was urged in brief pursuit of the pacesetter three deep to the backstretch and soon emptied out.

Footnotes
UNCLE BUD came through close quarters at the break to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, moved to force the issue racing into the
turn, took over nearing upper stretch, then turned back the challenge of POINT DRIVEN through the final three sixteenths under firm left handed
encouragement to prove best. The latter broke outwards brushing the eventual winner at the start, was settled last in the opening furlong, shifted out four
wide racing through the backstretch commencing a sharp rally, advanced three deep nearing the lane to gain terms with the winner in upper stretch but
proved no match. DENY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening quarter, was eased back conceding some position racing into the
turn, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch and produced a second effort to regain some position late. EYES OF GLORY tracked the leaders inside
foes in second flight, shifted out nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid between rivals but came up empty leaving midstretch. MR. QUALITY tracked the
leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn but offered no rally. WEST SIDE WARRIOR sped to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dueled for
command along the inside entering the turn and gave way into the stretch. TINKER'S PAL was through early. BURL was scratched before the start after
dislodging his rider and running loose following the post parade.

Footnotes
KID DRAMA was rated out of striking distance while switching off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter three
deep racing into the far turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch but continued with solid momentum to wrest command and go clear under firm
encouragement. PALIZA sprinted clear of the field while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin into the far turn, held sway
into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner while lasting for second. BOATSWAIN, reluctant to load in the starting gate, was
settled just off the inside, shifted out racing into the lane and found some late response to gain position between foes in the final sixteenth. YADI, urged to
forward placing just outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, conceded some position tracking that rival along the inside through the backstretch into
the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. DYNAFORM was rated while angling inside racing to the first turn, switched out after a half to make some brief
progress between foes racing through the far turn but proved empty in the closing stages. NEAT STREET angled inside early dropping well off the leaders,
swung out four wide racing into the stretch but had no rally. SCAR trailed throughout.

POSEIDON'S PASSION, a bit restless in the post parade, dislodged his rider and was loose momentarily just before the start, was held up out of tight
quarters at the break to track just off the second flight near the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three deep, then four wide racing into upper stretch
while being roused to advance and rallied to the front under firm handling. NORMA'S LOVE ducked out at the start into the path of the eventual winner, was
quickly righted while being prompted to pursue the pacesetter between foes racing into the turn, took over from that foe racing into upper stretch but couldn't
fend off the winner. SILVER BANK ducked inwards at the start while breaking slowly, angled to the inside early, came around a tiring foe to bid inside the
top pair late but was outkicked. FREE THE BEAST settled outside foes racing to the turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position four wide in late
stages. MATINEE GIRL was hustled to gain the lead outside foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage, dictated the pace to
upper stretch and gave out once headed. REITERATE, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter racing into the turn, was steadied along the rail
avoiding tight quarters in upper stretch and had no further response. SOLID AS A ROCK was settled between foes in the last flight, was held up
momentarily when caught in close quarters racing into the turn and had no rally. SIENA'S TICKET, urged along three deep pursuing the pacesetter as part
of the second flight racing into the turn, emptied out early and drifted wide.

Footnotes
DON'T FIGHT took up a position between foes, then was steadied out of tight quarters racing into the first turn, was prompted to split foes after a half while
advancing on the pacesetter, continued with a steady bid to wrest command leaving the far turn, then widened under some hand urging while his rider
flashed the whip right handed and was taken in hand nearing the wire. FASHION FRAME, caught five wide while being prompted to contention racing
through the first turn, shifted on the backstretch to track off the second flight between foes, followed the winner's path splitting rivals racing into the far turn
and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors late. CSILLA, urged to dictate the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing to the
backstretch, edged forward while angling to the rail on the far turn but proved no match when confronted by the winner and lost second late. BEV'S
STRENGTH, caught four wide between foes racing to the backstretch while being prompted to contend, faded into the stretch. AND I KNOW switched
outside rivals early to race six wide into the backstretch but made no real impression. WINDY COUNTY angled inwards while being urged between foes to
gain a position just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch but emptied out early. LANGUE LIEE, urged to a forward placing along the rail prompting the
pacesetter into the backstretch, lost terms with that foe after a half and emptied out nearing the lane. VUYELWA tracked off the second flight along the
inside and retreated early. RATTLE ROUSER , caught outside foes to the backstretch, proved no threat. DISCRIMANATION proved no factor.

Footnotes
CLASSY LYNN, never far back, tracked just off the first flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, advanced three deep entering the
second bend to wrest command when given her cue nearing the three furlong marker, moved well clear racing into the lane and held sway on a widening
margin in a ridden out effort. BEACHTREASUREGIRL, reserved along the inside in the opening half, angled outside foes racing into the far turn, advanced
four, then five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors in time. CLASSY OF COURSE, held up in close
quarters just after start, was pulling against restraint tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, was urged to split foes just off the
inside racing into upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. BROKEN ENGLISH, held up out of close quarters in the opening stages, tracked off the
second flight along the inside racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside to trace three deep between foes late and gained some position while no real
threat. SWEEPENO tracked off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to race four wide between foes through the far turn to the lane and had no
rally. MALLIE CRAMP, in touch with the first flight three deep prompting the pace in the opening half, gave way racing into the far turn. RACHIELY'S
DREAM vied between foes in the first flight from the outset to the far turn and emptied out. MI KARLITA proved no factor. LITTLE MARIA was urged inside
foes prompting the pace in the opening half, was taken in hand avoiding close quarters nearing the second bend and gave way into the far turn.
