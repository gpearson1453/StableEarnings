Footnotes
SOUL SONG crossed over while going to the front, dictated terms while inside through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, maintained
a length advantage under a strong hand ride into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed whip coming to the sixteenth-pole and held under strong
handling. GEM OF CARLOS settled in the back half off the field towards the inside, was coaxed along while inside to the two path on the turn, came under a
drive in upper stretch, gained into the final furlong, moved out under a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted further out and finished fast
but missed while able to get the place. HEZA PRIORITY was slow into stride and spotted the front a couple lengths, settled at the rear under some urging
while the rider tried to get him on the proper lead, was urged along in the three path on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, came under the whip on the
far outside around the three-sixteenths and finished well to just get the show. FRIDAY'S BEST bumped lightly with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the turn, was roused late on that bend, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. TOO MUCH
BOURBON was coaxed along on the inside of a rival, came under stronger encouragement while four then three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. AW ITE broke a bit awkwardly and was off a half-step slow, settled on the far outside, chased five
then four wide on the turn, dropped back while still on his inside lead in upper stretch and tired. FREE INDEED bumped lightly with an opponent start,
settled under some restraint, went four then five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
NIIGON'S GLORY had the assistant starter correct his head from being sideways just as the gate opened then broke out a bit, settled nicely off the pace,
was roused while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, came out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong and
closed strongly to win going away. CATALOGUE moved up under urging then chased the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the four path on the
turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into upper stretch, led under a drive until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able
to get the place. RIV came in early and sideswiped SPECTROLITE, was urged along on the outside, dropped in some leaving the backstretch, was urged
along while four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. MARK OF THE Z showed good speed and set the pace,
was challenged in the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. WARRIOR'S
KID was away alertly then dropped off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two then three path near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. FIRE BLASTER was last into stride then urged along at the rear, went five wide early on the turn
then moved seven wide to the outside of SPECTROLITE as that foe fell back quickly, continued seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
SPECTROLITE was bumped by a foe after the start, raced outside towards the front under strong urging, dropped back fast while five then six wide on the
turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and faltered. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU stalked the early leader, edged closer three wide on the turn taking the lead four deep at the quarter pole, was clear by
mid-stretch while drifting out just a tad, was kept to the task and lasted. B W P EXPRESS had his head turned just prior to the break and exchanged a
brush, quickly recovered to move forward inside tracking the leaders, continued inside coming just off the fence on the turn, came out four deep into upper
stretch, moved out a further path near mid-stretch, veered out bothering rivals inside the final sixteenth while continuing to gain steadily. SENOR BLAIR
broke outwardly, raced outside rivals mid-pack going four deep through the turn and coming out six wide into upper stretch, drifted out in upper stretch then
back in bumping CONTAINMENT near the sixteenth pole then was bumped by that rival as he was forced out. CONTAINMENT raced mid-pack inside up
the backstretch, entered the turn just off the fence switching out a further path early on that bend, came into upper stretch five wide, was bumped inside the
final sixteenth by the outside foe then forced into that rival and checked sharply as an inside foe came out, pulled up near the three-quarter pole after the
race and was vanned off. WHISKEY BRAVO exchanged a bump at the break, switched out midway up the backstretch, was outside foes five wide on the
turn coming seven wide into the stretch and closer to the leaders by mid-stretch but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. CARSON KAN cleared
soon after the break and moved in to the two path to set the pace, was challenged late on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. SUPER FACTOR was
outpaced racing off the inside in the three to four path on the turn and five wide past the quarter pole. MONO was off about a length slowly, raced off the
inside going in the three to four then five path on the turn coming seven deep into upper stretch and failed to produce a bid. Following a stewards' inquiry, B
W P EXPRESS was disqualified from second and placed fourth behind CONTAINMENT for causing that rival interference in late stretch.

Footnotes
KATIE THE CUTIE was hustled to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, raced inside on the far turn, was asked outside the three-sixteenths, lost
the advantage just after turning into the stretch, fought back inside of two foes into the final furlong, regained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under strong handling. YES I'M EVIL went three to four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was urged along while four wide
on the far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch under the whip, closed well to make an outside bid near the eighth-pole, fought outside of two foes in the final
furlong and missed while able to get the place. GYMNASTIC was well placed just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the two path then was asked at the
quarter-pole, advanced to take the lead just inside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive while between foes into the final furlong, lost the advantage back
to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the show. GIRLS LIFE broke in and was off a bit slow while last away, raced in
hand into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, settled in the middle of the field, went around the far turn in the two path, was roused outside the
quarter-pole and failed to rally. COLOR ME PRETTY went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged along late on the
backstretch, went two then three wide under strong urging on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS BROOKSIDE
went four wide on the first turn, dropped to the rear of the field, was urged along while five to six wide on the far turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and
failed to respond. SINGMEBACKHOME broke a step slow, entered the first turn in the three path then moved to five then six wide, settled on the far outside,
was ridden along while four then five wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and also failed to resapond. GLANCE was very reluctant to load,
came away in front, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped back while
four wide into the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
HEART OF A DREAMER moved clear soon after the start setting the pace just off the fence through the first turn, was a bit nearer the rail up the
backstretch allowing rivals to edge a bit closer, began to extend the margin while in the two path on the far turn, put to urging by upper stretch and drew
away then was eased up late. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS was just a bit slow into stride, switched off the inside nearing the midpoint of the first turn coming
out to the three path by the latter part of that bend, raced outside foes up the backstretch entering the far turn four wide then moving out a further path
midway on that bend, came to the head of the stretch six deep, ran on willingly late to get up for place while no threat to the winner. SMART ARCH was
encouraged forward after the star in range of the leader racing in the three path, continued outside POCHO'S DREAM up the backstretch, asked for run
past the three-eighths going three wide on the far turn, outfinished that rival but lost the place late. POCHO'S DREAM saved ground on or just off the rail
close up through the first turn, continued inside a rival racing on or just off the rail through the far turn before coming out a path at the top of the stretch, was
outkicked for the minor awards. DEMI PATRICK raced in the four path through the first turn, edged away from rivals to pursue the leaders in the clear up the
backstretch before being joined by an inside foe late up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn coming out further into upper stretch and
failed to rally. TRUENO was urged at the break, shifted in entering the first turn going on or just off the rail through that bend, edged a little closer up the
backstretch inside a foe going two to three wide on the far turn then weakened thereafter. DISTORED HALF bumped the outside rival and steadied at the
start then moved to the rail, advanced inside foes up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn as well, evened out in the lane while appearing to shy
from the whip. MEANINGFUL was bumped at the break, eased back from between rivals and tucked in to about the three to four path entering the first turn,
dropped back heading up the backstretch then went between foes two to three wide into the far turn, was never near enough to threaten. WARRIORS
WOLF was caught outside foes five wide into the first turn then dropped in a path late on that bend in behind rivals, dropped back heading up the
backstretch, was asked for run past the half-mile marker going three wide and between rivals to the far turn, was eased through the lane, crossed the wire
and walked off.

Footnotes
HALF A BITE crossed over while moving clear early, hugged the rail while opening up a very large advantage, remained well clear under his own power
through the far turn, was asked a bit just inside the three-sixteenths while continuing to hug the rail then a bit more coming to the furlong marker, remained
under a light hand ride into the final seventy yards then was geared down while much the best to win handily. AMAVI was bumped at the start, shifted three
wide early on the first turn, settled in third position, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
safely secured the place while no match for the winner. CREOLE CANDY broke in and bumped with a foe, was taken back between horses early, went
three then two wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten while best of the rest. IBEAM
moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, followed the clear leader from second, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch under a drive and came up empty. LES PAUL went four wide on the first turn, settled well back on the
outside, was urged along outside the half-mile pole, went five wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LASTCHANCEFORLOVE broke on top and moved clear shifting in to the two path to dictate terms up the backstretch, continued on or just off the rail
through the turn, was asked approaching the three-sixteenths and responded, given a few right-handed reminders through the stretch and vigorous hand
urging the final sixteenth to hold sway. FREEDOM PASSAGE bumped the outside rival reasonably hard at the start, settled into stride racing off the fence
last but one up the backstretch, went in the three path through the turn coming out a path late on that bend, kept on and secured the place. FAIRYWREN
broke outwardly just a bit, was well-placed in range of the winner outside a foe going three wide on the turn, was encouraged a bit past the five-sixteenths,
offered no late kick in the drive. SAINTSATION was bumped twice at the start, shifted in while tracking the leader, saved ground on the turn, weakened a
touch in the stretch. SHE'S GOT MOVES bumped the outer foe at the start then stumbled while being bumped by the inside rival and being forced into the
outside foe once again, saved ground at the rear through the turn, swung five wide out of that bend and never threatened.

Footnotes
DACK JANIEL'S went around the first turn in the four path, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead inside the three-eighths, was asked in the two
path on the far turn, moved clear under a strong hand ride approaching the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a right-handed whip in upper stretch
and held under strong urging. LOOKIN HIGH was forced out eight wide into the first turn then dropped to the six path early on that bend, moved to the four
path later on that bend, settled at the rear, moved in near the half-mile pole, made his way to the rail by the seven-sixteenths, raced inside under some
urging early on the far turn then moved to the two path, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished with good energy
but was too late while clear for the place. BANDIT SWANSON bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the
pace, chased three wide on the far turn, was put to the whip inside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong then weakened
but was clear for the show. MIGHTY HEART bumped with a rival at the start then bumped with another shortly thereafter and was taken up, lugged out
badly into the first turn, went six then five wide on that bend, settled towards the rear, was ridden along while moving from two to four wide on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. IZZY IN A TIZZY bumped with a rival after the start then brushed with
another foe early, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace with company to his outside, was asked leaving the backstretch then
headed inside the three-eighths, dropped back under urging approaching the quarter-pole and capitulated. OXBURGER was hustled from the start, brushed
with a foe early, went five wide on the first turn, was urged along while outside on the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
SECRET PRINCESS bumped with a rival at the start but came out in front, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, responded well when
asked at the three-sixteenths and proved best under a brisk hand ride. EZEE ENOUGH was forwardly placed on the outside, went six wide early on the turn,
dropped to four wide near the three-eighths then three wide before the five-sixteenths, chased the winner under the whip in the stretch and was second
best. HALF HEROINE was restless in the gate, settled under some urging, moved in late on the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn, dropped to
the two path while going between horses around the three-eighths then moved back to the three path, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out
significantly in the drive and just earned the show. SHEZA MEAN BROAD broke a step slow, was ridden along on the far outside, went five wide early on
the turn, dropped to three wide near the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. ORTHODOX BEAT chased the pace,
went around the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch under a drive and tired. TOSHITA FOREVER lacked speed under urging, went three then four
wide early on the turn then shifted six wide, floated eight wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. PRAY FOR LISA
broke out a bit at the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the five to six path and came up empty. VEGAS MEMORY was off slow then came
outward after leaving the gate, spotted the front several lengths, raced at the rear under urging, went five then four wide on the turn and was no factor.
SHARP BUZZ was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved in under urging around the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail
nearing the quarter-pole and never reached contention. LADY BROOKLYN bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, moved up into the middle of
the field, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and failed to respond. STONE CLASSIC broke out a bit at the start, was urged along off the pace,
went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and faltered.
