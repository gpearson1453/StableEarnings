four wide and got up late. ROMAN JEWELS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled with INTERATIFWITHIEU down the stretch, outfinished
him for second, but got caught late by the winner. INTERATIFWITHLEU went to the front, drove clear, dueled late with ROMAN JEWELS and was
outfinished by the top two. SABER QUEEN raced in the middle of the field in the early part, made a late gain, but was no factor. TWN TAWFEERS PARTY
raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, came around the first turn six wide, moved up, but was no threat. RUNNING ROSADO raced evenly near the
back and lacked a bid. GOLDEN EXPRESSO vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and was finished early. IN CHARGE MARG dueled

pulled away and was caught at the wire. SECOND GUESS raced in the back of the pack in the early part, came around the final turn on the outside, made a
bid and proved third best. ODYSSEY EXPLORER lacked early speed, made a late gain, but was no factor. KING FORMEREDITH raced in the middle of the
field, came around the first turn four wide, made a bid and hung. WHISKEY'S GONE raced in the middle of the pack, weakened and finished evenly.
CACHITO pressed the early pace and faded. FREDDIESLILWILDCAT raced evenly near the back and never mounted a bid. BLUE HOUDINI challenged for
the early lead and dropped back. OPPORTUNITY COST raced near the back, showed little and trailed.
