GEORGE HERMAN RUTH pulled between horses then stalked outside a rival, bid three deep leaving the second turn, was fanned four wide into the stretch
but gained the advantage, inched away in midstretch and won clear under urging. TROPICAL TERROR sent inside to stalk the pace, pulled his way up a bit
off the rail on the backstretch then was in a bit tight between rivals into the turn, came out four wide into the stretch and finished well. SQUARED STRAIGHT
had speed three deep then dueled outside a rival, took a short lead between horses leaving the second turn, drifted out into the stretch, drifted inward in
midstretch and just held third. ROCKS AND SALT chased outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch and off the rail on the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch, drifted in some in the final furlong and was edged for the show. DESCARTES stalked outside a rival then between horses leaving the
backstretch, continued three deep on the second turn and into the stretch, drifted in and lacked the needed rally. EL DIABLO ROJO pulled along the inside
early, saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MALAKAI MOXIE had speed inside to duel for the
lead, fought back on the second turn, steadied in a bit tight a quarter mile out and had little left for the stretch.

RIVER BOYNE (IRE) angled in and stalked the pace inside, came out into the stretch, bid alongside the pacesetter to gain the lead in midstretch, kicked
clear under urging and proved best. CAMINO DEL PARAISO chased outside a rival then three deep on the second turn and four wide into the stretch,
drifted in a bit and got up for the place between foes late. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) threw his head around and steadied early, angled in and tugged a bit, saved
ground chasing the pace, waited some leaving the second turn, came out for room into the stretch, angled in and moved up inside in midstretch, came out
again and split horses late for the show. KINGLY had speed outside then angled in and set the pace inside, inched away again on the second turn, fought
back in midstretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong but gave ground grudgingly to the others. FRONTIER MARKET broke a bit slowly, angled
in and settled outside a rival then a bit off the rail, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and was edged for a minor award five
wide on the line. MAJESTIC EAGLE stalked inside then outside a rival, continued between horses on the second turn and three wide into the stretch, was
between foes through much of the drive and also was edged for a minor share. RONALD R (IRE) chased inside then outside a rival, came out leaving the
second turn and five wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. THE HUNTED between horses early, saved ground chasing the
pace, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. TAKE THE ONE O ONE three deep early, stalked outside a rival or a bit off the rail, bid
outside the pacesetter a half mile out, continued outside the winner leaving the second turn, fell back between horses in midstretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MANHATTAN UP stalked outside a rival, came out leaving the turn and bid four wide into the stretch, gained the advantage nearing midstretch, inched away
and drifted in some under some urging in deep stretch and proved best. OLIVER close up stalking the pace off the rail, bid three wide between foes into the
stretch, drifted in and fought back past midstretch and could not quite match the winner late. ROUTE SIX SIX a bit slow to begin, saved ground chasing the
pace, was in a bit tight along the rail in midstretch then got through in deep stretch and edged rivals for the show. SPEED PASS had good early speed and
dueled inside, fought back into the stretch, came a bit off the rail in upper stretch, drifted in from the whip some in deep stretch and was edged for third
between foes on the line. ADENS DREAM dueled outside a rival, fought back between horses into the stretch and also was edged for a minor share three
deep on the wire.

the backstretch, came out for room leaving the second turn and five wide into the stretch, lugged in some in midstretch and was edged for the show. IRISH
