Footnotes
OUR EASTER LILY broke out, vied for the early advantage, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. JOZZY BELL
raced in the middle of the field, moved up around the final turn, dueled with ANGEL CAT down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but got up for the
place. ANGEL CAT raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, moved up around the final turn, dueled down the lane and was outfinished for second.
MITCH'S PINS dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. BULLETSANDBOURBON lacked early speed, showed late
interest, but was no factor. SKYLAR'S WAY was bumped at the start, vied for early lead and was finished early. SHE'S A PENALTY shuffled back at the
start, moved up to the middle of the field, weakened and finished evenly. ADIEU MALLORY raced within contention, came around the first turn four wide
and dropped back. CANADIAN GIRL always raced near the back and was outrun.

LACI LU lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied, four wide down the lane and got up in time. LODI MIST bumped at the start, pressed the pace,
drove clear down the stretch and was caught late. GUILTY CONFESSION was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top
two. LUKES SECRET raced near the back in the beginning, made a late gain and was outfinished for third. SHE WANTS HALF bumped at the start, went to
the front, drove clear and weakened. JERRY'S LEGACY raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. I'M ALL MIXED UP raced within
striking distance, faded and was no threat late. NOON'S BABYGIRL challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and was finished early.
ASUKA raced evenly in the back and showed little. B G'S DREAMCATCHER always raced in the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAVALLOTTO vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away late and proved the best. SPIRIT OF CALEDON unhurried in the beginning,
raced wide around the first turn, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MAGNANIMUS MAN went toi the front, drove
clear, raced close throughout and was outfinished for second. TRAPPER PEAK pressed the pace, made a bid, hung and finished evenly. RED WINED UP
raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside, weakened and went to the wire evenly. QUALITY PRODUCTION raced in the middle of
the field and put forth an even effort. OVERNIGHT STAY lacked early speed and was never close. LEFTFIELDJUNCTION always raced near the back and
was outrun. CAJUN CARMELIZED raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
INTERACTIF MOMENT went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. SHOT ON WINDY HILL pressed the pace, followed INTERACTIF
MOMENT around the track, steadied slightly around the turn while moving up on the rail, angled out down the stretch and was a clear second. GRAND
LITTLE MAN raced within contention, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. SPEEDACTUS pressed the early pace, forwardly placed
throughout and weakened. A LITTLE RISKY raced in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was no factor. HERE COMES HOMER had a tight start,
racing in the rear, moved up to the middle of the field and finished evenly. AND YET ANOTHER void of early speed, raced wide around the first turn and
was never close. CLASSIC HEATH raced within striking distance and dropped back. DR HESSE always raced near the back and was outrun. THE JOCKEY
OF #3 SHOT ON WINDY HILL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #4 INTERACTIF MOMENT FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FINAL TURN.
AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
