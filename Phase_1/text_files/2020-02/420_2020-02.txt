Footnotes
MERCY RULE tracked the leaders to the turn, shifted out three wide into the stretch, rallied when asked and pushed to the front in mid stretch then held
driving. SAYIN GRACE was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly but could not impact the winner. AIDAN'S HARBOR
also was tracking the pace, got fanned four wide on the turn and was outfinished in the final furlong. FALCONE trailed to the turn, swung out from the three
path to be five deep into the stretch then lacked the needed late response. BABY FRANKIE had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but did not rally.
SIZZLING EVENING attended the pace outside of PERSISTENCE, was two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. PERSISTENCE was
also on the pace inside, continued to save ground to the stretch then also tired.

Footnotes
CHIRP tracked the pace mid pack to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, had room inside of LYDIA O LYDIA and rallied smartly to the front in mid stretch
then cruised away from the field. LYDIA O LYDIA set the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, left room for the winner inside in upper stretch, was
overtaken but saved the place. LA GUAPA VELOS was outsprinted to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late
response. REBEL AT HEART was chasing to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty. TERAJOULE
had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but did not rally. BREAKING THE CODE pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and
tired. WHATA FLIRT had no speed and was never a factor.

FOREIGN PROTOCOL was outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive, collared SMILEFORME and prevailed
despite not switching leads. SMILEFORME set the pace while racing in the two path to the stretch, responded determinedly in the drive but could not stall
the winner while holding second. ADMIRABLY was chasing mid pack to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch and made a bit of a run late. CALL ME
PEPPY also chased the pace while saving ground to the stretch, was a threat in mid stretch but flattened out late. CAJUN BETTOR had no speed, raced
three wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. LITTLE JOHN also had no speed then saved ground to no avail. RED'S SHOWTIME
also chased the leader to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but tired in the drive. SHUSTER pressed the pace three wide to the stretch but gave

RESILIENT pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and held driving. EUSTACE stalked the pace to the turn, bid three
wide to the stretch then finished willingly to hold second. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK broke slow, trailed to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then finished
in a mild rally. GALLANT WARREN was outrun to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then finished with interest. EL CENTENARIO chased to the
turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. RUNKERRY hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken
in upper stretch and weakened. TRABIESO AVELITO also chased the pace, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the drive. KNOWN had no speed
and was not a factor. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF was always outrun.

TIZ A SPEED BOMB zipped to the front, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded in the drive and held. INQUISITION had no speed, was two
wide to the stretch then got to terms with CONTINENTAL UNION in second place and dug in gamely to outnod that one. CONTINENTAL UNION pressed
the winner early, stepped out leaving the seven sixteenths and caused HOLLYWOOD HEAT to clip heels, was two wide to the stretch then was outfinished
for the win and hung to miss second. MAJOR KONG had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch and closed steadily in the final furlong.
DYNAMIC DUO chased the pace to the turn, was fanned out five deep to the stretch and got outfinished late. EMERALD MAGIC was outsprinted early, also
was five wide on the turn and did not rally. TRASH TALKIN CAT tracked the pace to the turn, was four wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive.
HOLLYWOOD HEAT stalked the pace early, was crowded and clipped heels with CONTINENTAL UNION leaving the seven sixteenths, took up sharply and
lost any chance. MY LUCKY BID trailed throughout. The stewards conducted an inquiry into incident at the seven sixteenths and disqualified
CONTINENTAL UNION, placing him eighth for interference to HOLLYWOOD HEAT.

Footnotes
DETANGLER was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then rallied when set down, pushed to duel CROSS CREEK to deep stretch,
bested that one and held off TAP IT CHAMP late. TAP IT CHAMP The latter was outrun to the turn, swung out six deep into the stretch then closed steadily,
surged late and just missed. CROSS CREEK had no speed, got pushed out four then five wide to the stretch, rallied to battle the winner in the final
sixteenth, was bested by that one and nailed for second. HONEYMOONZ OVER pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, responsed to duel for the lead
from the eighth pole to deep stretch but then was outfinished. SUNRISE JOURNEY stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, shifted off the fence in mid
stretch for room but could not offer the needed late response. SOUND JUDGMENT tracked the leaders to the turn, was two wide to the stretch but finished
evenly in the late stages. MR. FIREBALL was bumped off stride by SMOKIN BLACKJACK shortly after the start, had no speed, got fanned four wide on the
turn and could not offer the needed late response. SMOKIN BLACKJACK broke out, bumped HONEYMOONZ OVER and drifted inward off that bump to
make contact with MR. FIREBALL, pushed to the front to set the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL
tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch, got caught in traffic in mid stretch, had to check and finished evenly late. SIZZLING JAMIE had no speed, raced
three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. CONCENSUS got outsprinted to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then did not rally.
VICENTE'S SHADOW had no speed, trailed and was never a threat.
