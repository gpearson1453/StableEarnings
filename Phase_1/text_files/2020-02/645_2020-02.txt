three paths then challenged toward the five sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail through the far turn and dug in down the lane to maintain second. THE
BETTER ONE saved ground off the early pace then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to the four path on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch
duel for second. CANDYFORACAUSE rounded the first turn in the four path and settled toward the outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the five
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and finished evenly. CAMPANIA rounded the first turn in the five path and settled outside into the

FLATTER HYMN settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, closed to the lead two deep
approaching the top of the lane, drew clear inside the sixteenth pole and widened later yards. KING NEKIA came away a bit awkwardly then stalked the

the final sixteenth. BALLYHOO PRINCE was hustled clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, gave up the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and gave
chase from that point, but dropped back approaching the quarter and faded at the rail on the far turn. DON'T CARE stalked the pace from the three path,
picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded nearing the far turn. LONG HEIR rounded the opening turn in the five path and showed little
response through the backstretch. RICHIE'S B L became a bit fractious behind the gate and loaded reluctantly, then saved ground. ECLIPTICALS DEWEY

JACKS CITY angled to mid track to pressure the pace, raced close three wide on the turn then dug in through the stretch to get up the final yards.
WINDSOR CALLING set a pressured pace inside and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, raced clear into the stretch and dug in under steady
handling but was caught the final yards. LUCKY LEONARD gave chase and raced at the rail on the turn, finished evenly and just lasted for third. SYNERGY
UNBRIDLED raced well back and off the rail then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, angled to the outside toward the head of the lane and finished well;
widest. GRAN TOGOSHI chased the pace outside, raced in the three path of the turn and finished evenly. GIANT VIKING was bumped soundly on the
chute then picked up the chase, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly. IFURNOTFIRSTURLAST broke in to make contact with I'm Able on the
chute, picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn in the six path and showed little more. I'M ABLE broke in to make sharp contact with Giant Viking and
was bumped from the outside a half stride later, then pressured the pace, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn but dropped back into the
stretch and weakened. LETS DANCE JACK gave chase off the rail then weakened at the rail on the turn. Due to an equipment malfunction, this race was
hand timed.

SOUND OFF settled off the pace and off the rail then rallied to the lead three wide past the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn and was steadily
encouraged to widen. COZZE CAT rated a slim lead inside but was met at even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point, raced
at the rail through the far turn and had to settle for second best. ROHRBACHER stalked the pace three wide into the first turn and raced outside entering the
backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole while
holding on for third. LITTLE BIG SIME raced well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and passed some faders
in the lane. NO MORE TALK stalked the early pace two deep and took a slim lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure from the three
eighths but was caught approaching the quarter and weakened off the rail on the far turn. POOL BOY CHARLIE rated close to the early pace, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole then faded at the rail rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
FLASHY READY RICK rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail through the far turn and was
steadily encouraged to hold on well. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced in the five path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, couldn't improve on the winner and flattened stride later yards. BRO LATTE saved ground off
the pace the opening turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and was along for
third mid-stretch. CASTLE ONE broke awkwardly and outward then settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened out the final sixteenth. BASKETBALL ZACH became fractious in
the gate and raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, then showed little response through the backstretch. JACKZILLA came through the opening
turn about the four path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn.
GOVERNOR MACHEN and ALTERNATE ROUTE were not factors. SALERNO steadied off the tail of Flashy Ready Rick past the five eighths pole, dropped
back at the rail through the first turn then faded down the backstretch.
