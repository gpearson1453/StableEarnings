Footnotes
EURO ME closest to the early leader, moved out and engaged that rival to duel through the turn, disposed of that same foe when straightened for home,
drew out steadily under a firm left handed stick. MICHELLE'S GRACE settled off the pace toward the inside, moved out for the drive, could do little with the
winner, second best. WILLOW MOON took over soon after breaking in good order, cleared to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled inside
the winner turn, could not keep pace through the stretch nor could contain the runner up, saved the show. SATTERSFIELD off a step slow, raced back and
inside, improved position without posing a serious threat. SHE'S A QUEEN broke sharply, steadily faded. SEASIDE SURPRISE failed to menace while well
wide in the drive. DIXIE FOREST raced mid pack early three wide, then retreated in the drive.

Footnotes
SIRENIC within striking distance outside, advanced three wide late turn,engaged the leader in upper stretch, wore that rival down to edge clear under
steady handling. CHEROKEE COWGIRL broke alertly, clear in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the turn, responded when the
winner came alongside in upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end. COLLUDE broke to the inside, was straightened to race forwardly and inside,
continued inside of traffic along the rail late in the turn, brushed with ONE STEP in upper stretch, no match for the top two in the final furlong, determined for
the show. ONE STEP prompted the pace off the inside, bit closer two path turn, brushed upper stretch, outkicked for the show spot late. HOUSE DRUNK
went evenly while racing in the two path. WORTHAPRETTYPENNY void of speed while along the inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a
serious threat. BELLA MISCHIEF remained back in the two path. PROMISES KEPT was outrun while four wide in the turn.

Footnotes
PORTAL CREEK broke to the outside, stalked the pace on the outside in hand, advanced to challenged three wide when called on turning for home, put a
head in front nearing the furlong grounds and dove clear. ENJAY'S BRASS in the second flight while between rivals, tipped out three to four wide turning for
home, finished willingly for the place. JOSIE THE E F FIVE behind the pace toward the inside, behind some traffic into the lane, steered in a bit for room,
gained the nod for the show at the wire, not enough for the place. SWEET TATUM dueled up front while off the inside, gained command in the turn,
continued to show the way upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly until late. URBAN KAT off a bit slow, raced back and off the inside, roused entering the
stretch, staged mild rally with some late interest. VIOLATION back off the pace and the inside, three out to four wide late in the turn, was not dangerous in
the drive while remaining out in the strip. SUNSET PAULA JO off slowly, raced always back. GIRO KATE broke on top, set or forced the pace closest to the
inside, gave way turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
ALL WEST with the pace from the start, continued to apply pressure in the run up the backstretch, vied between foes final turn, kicked well clear the final
furlong. COPPER KING also was forwardly placed from the start, prompted the issue from the three path, three wide bid in the second turn, proved no
match for the winner late, clearly second best. ON D'ORO set the pace along the inside, responded when confronted in the second turn, vied upper stretch,
weakened gradually the final furlong, saved the show. AZTEC EMPIRE pinched back at the start, dropped inside, went one paced while continuing to save
ground through the second turn, improved slightly. EKATI'S VERVE broke in, raced forwardly placed toward the inside, two path through the second turn,
asked along, empty, faded. RUNNIN' RAY lacked early foot while five wide into the first turn, continued outside, failed to threaten when three through the
second bend, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ZACHRY four wide into the first turn, continued well out in the strip, crept
closer while again in the four path second bend, weakened in the drive. SECULAR STAGNATION was not a factor while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
WAR VETERAN within striking distance from the start off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide through the second turn, continued to vie past the
furlong marker then drove clear steadily in the late going. COWORKER pressed the early leader off the inside, dueled up the backstretch, vied between
horses through the second turn and into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. DUBNATION away in
good order, showed the way into the first turn, dueled up the backstretch under light restraint, contested the issue into the lane while remaining closest to
the rail, gave ground grudgingly. DIVINE DHARMA raced in mid pack while off the inside, two path second turn,. roused for the drive, went evenly through
the stretch. ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE settled off the pace while along the inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, closest to the top
three a furlong outs, also finished up one paced in lacking a closing kick. NEW YEAR'S LUCK raced in some traffic into the fist turn when racing back,
moved out a bit for the second turn, made little impact in the drive. KNIGHT ERRANT angled in a bit to save some ground first turn, two path through the
second bend, lacked response when called on for the drive. SERGEANT MCNERNEY remained back. PICTURE PAINTED with the early pace between
rivals, washy, remained forwardly placed for three furlongs then began to weaken. HARD TO IMPRESS last away, remained always back while racing out in
the strip. JERSEY LUTE steadied in traffic into the first turn, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ALWAYS unhurried early while toward the inside, angled out steadily to be four wide turning for home, challenged outside the first flight just inside the
furlong ground, proved best under firm handling. SUMMER REVOLUTION steadied just after the start in some traffic, checked up behind rivals into the first
turn, raced back, dropped to the rail when advancing entering the stretch, finished willingly. PINSON away in good order, set the pace along the inside,
came off the rail just a bit exiting the final turn allowing the runner up the inside into the stretch, outkicked by that one for the place spot. DRIVEN TO
COMPETE forwardly placed from the beginning off the inside, crept closer to challenge three wide into the lane, weakened in the late going to lose a couple
of positions. CONQUEST BIG E in mid pack along the inside in the first turn, took up in some traffic, settled in the run up the backstretch, same ground
through the second turn, lacked a closing kick in the drive. FLAT LUCKY five to four wide in the first turn when moving up, pressed the issue up the
backstretch, challenged and vied between horses into the stretch and gave way. FRONT DOOR back off the pace off the inside first turn, same some
ground in the second turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. CHICAGO BLUES shuffled back at the start, raced five wide into the first turn,
remained back. HE WILL forwardly placed while racing three wide, tired.

Footnotes
FRA MAURO last to leave, settled off the pace while saving ground, tipped out three wide when advancing into contention late in the final turn, collared the
leader from the outside with a furlong to run, drew strongly clear. LIGHTHAWK broke through the gate prior to the start, broke in good order the second
time, stalked the pace three wide advanced and took over turning for home, proved no match for the winner, clear for the place. MISSISSIPPI pressured the
leader from the two path, bid between foes second turn, briefly dueled inside the runner up late in the final bend then could not keep up, narrowly saved the
show. CANDY STORE popped stall doors prior to the start, raced back off the pace just off the inside, continued one paced while remaining in the two path,
not enough for the show. COSMOLOGIST void of early foot, continued well back into the far turn. MORE ICE back off the pace and the inside, four wide
turning for home, failed to muster a rally. DETERMINANT remained always back. CHARLIE'S SCHILLER broke on top, sprinted clear, stopped when
headed midway on the final turn.

Footnotes
ROCKIN READY broke sharp, got clear to set the pace, rated kindly the middle half mile, plenty left in drawing out through the lane under steady handling.
READY ORB NOT raced in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground when called on for run in the second turn, no match for the winner
in the drive, clearly second best. CRYSTAL LAKE a bit reluctant to load, raced within striking distance off the inside, three wide trip, came up empty for the
drive, all out to hold the show. GRANDEZZA last to leave, trailed early, angled out to be three wide into the stretch, showed some mild interest to be gaining
for the show spot. LADY GUSTO saved ground to no avail. FASHION ISLAND lacked speed, was three wide late in the final bend, also failed to muster a
closing kick. SOCIALITE closest to the winner off the inside, stopped turning for home, was eased late, walked in.
