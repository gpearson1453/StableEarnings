Footnotes
EMPEROR'S GOLD sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace unchallenged while well off the rail and won under right
handed urging near mid track. BURKIE trailed, swung out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, angled in to the four path and rallied for
second. DARKNESS BEAUTY well back for six furlongs, closed a gap late in the six path. THORNY ISSUE chased the winner for six furlongs then faded in
the seven path. BATTLE CROSSING was outrun. TAK'IN THE RED EYE had speed for six furlongs then stopped.
