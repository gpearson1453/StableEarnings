JOYOUS pressed the pace to the turn, bid three wide to go after the leader, caught BRITE ECHO and pushed away to mid stretch then held under steady
urging. PROPEPPY was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and finished willingly inside in the final furlong. CEDARS OF LEBANON (IRE)
stalked the pace early, was two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then could not save the place. TIZFIT was chasing to the turn,
had to circle four wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. BRITE ECHO hustled to the front, set the pace to the turn, was overtaken into the
stretch and weakened in the drive. KATYA ANTIPOVA trailed throughout.

VASTLY DEEP was well placed off the leaders, bid three then four wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and drove clear in the final
sixteenth. TRUMP UM hustled to duel for the lead outside of RUN HEAT, was two then three wide to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but
had enough of a cushion to hold second. LITTLE JOHN lagged to the turn, was two wide to the stretch but could only close the gap late. SUPER TONY was
chasing the leaders to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but slackened in the final furlong. RUN HEAT was used to duel inside of TRUMP UM to
the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and tired. PEPPERED APPEAL also lagged inside of LITTLE JOHN and two wide but came up empty in the drive.

COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up to engage for the lead, dueled into the stretch then inched clear to mid stretch
and held under steady urging. CONQUEST SABRE CAT was allowed to settle for a half mile, bid three wide on the second turn, loomed a threat in mid
stretch but was outfinished while holding off SOONER BETTER for the place. SOONER BETTER had no speed and trailed to the second turn, circled four
wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not get by CONQUEST SABRE CAT for second. RUN LIKE RHETT tracked the pace to the second
turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then weakened. MONSAJEM PERVADE also had no speed, settled
to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. SUNNY SPOT set the
pace to the second turn, was overtaken, stopped suddenly, was eased in the stretch and returned bleeding from both nostrils.

top two three wide to the stretch then kept to task to the line. SHAWNEE PASS was outrun to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch then shifted out
and showed some late interest. FIRSTCLASSTOPARIS got outsprinted early, shifted off the rail mid turn but lacked a closing response. LA CROIX tracked
the pace two wide to the stretch then also did not rally. PACIFIC SILENCE was erratic shorly after the start then straightened and chased the pace from the

Footnotes
SHEZA GIRLY GIRL was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, responded when roused in upper stretch and rallied steadily to wear down
SWEET REGARDS late. SWEET REGARDS The latter set the pace early, turned back TROUBLE N PARADISE to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch
then could not stall the winner. KISS RIDE GOODBYE had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. TROUBLE N
PARADISE pressed the pace early, pushed up two wide to try to engage for the lead mid turn, got outkicked in upper stretch and weakened. SURELY A
SMILE tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, also got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. BEAUTIFUL BABE chased
the leader to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch and also did not rally in the drive. JEMSEK had no speed and was not a factor. LA GATA
ELEGANTE saved ground to the stretch then gave way.
