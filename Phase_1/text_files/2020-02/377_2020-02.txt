sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. PUSH TO START was off a bit slow, rushed up inside to seized command early, set a clear pace off the rail
under a hold while racing a bit greenly, dug in between foes in upper stretch, vied inside of the winner to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. START
WITH YES tracked the pace inside, bid at the rail in upper stretch but flattened out. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND raced between foes in range early, dropped

MARY'S JEWEL took command at once, set the pace two wide under some rating, handled outside pressure from the three eighths to the quarter pole,
responded when shaken up and pulled away under strong handling. UTTERLY ENCHANTING broke a step slow, edged up inside the winner early on, rated
back off that one past the five eighths, shifted out, bid three wide leaving the far turn, pressed under a ride to the lane, failed to match strides in upper
stretch but kept trying and remained clear for the place. RED HOT KITTEN broke outward and failed to menace. HOLIDAY HOPES dropped in early, raced
off the pace, angled out in the lane but failed to respond.

WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY jumped tracks nearing the five-eighths pole, dueled inside past the eighth pole and drove clear. FIRST FIGHTER dueled outside of
the winner to mid-stretch and settled for second best. YES MAN stalked the pace three wide, lugged in in upper stretch, weakened and held for the show.
POWER BACK lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn and passed tiring rivals widest in the lane. LOTTO chased the pace three and four wide
and never threatened. VEE'S SUPER STAR raced off the early pace, advanced a bit two wide between foes around the turn but came up empty in the lane.
WINSTON'S WAY failed to menace while racing four wide. MASTER DISTILLER had some early speed between rivals then steadily faded around the turn.
CECIL THE LION was outrun inside. BANDOLINI played no factor while racing four wide.

two wide and inside the winner mid turn, fought on between rivals leaving mid stretch and held well for the place. HYDRA , up close between horses past
the five eighths, secured the inside for the run around the turn, bid under a ride approaching the lane, dueled past the furlong grounds and continued with
interest. HOLLY'S LADY had speed inside foes, eased back nearing the turn, came back along the inside past mid stretch, worked outward late and ran up
on rivals near the wire. STIVA , fractious in the gate, broke a step slow and bumped with a rival, pulled her way forward between foes then checked near the
five eighths, angled out and ranged up five wide around the turn, bid to apply more pressure past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on with the leading trio in
upper stretch, drifted in some in mid stretch and came up empty. NOT MY MONEY settled off the pace and angled out, edged up between runners leaving
the far turn, angled four wide approaching the quarter pole, shifted further out past the three sixteenths, ranged up and hung late. FONTAINE , bumped at
the break, raced off the pace while saving some ground, angled out in upper stretch and offered a slight response. SOLEA chased the early pace five wide
and dropped back.

Footnotes
BUCKED TOOTH prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch, seized command approaching the three-eighths pole, quickly cleared, angled into
the two path nearing the quarter pole and held clear under drive. DAPPER MUN settled off the early pace while racing in the two path, angled out nearing
the quarter pole, came six wide into the lane, rallied outside and was up for the pace in deep stretch. SHADOW BOXER chased the early pace inside, came
inside of the pacesetter near the five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide when the winner angled in soon after, chased outside through the lane and lost
second late. LUCKY JUNIOR lacked speed, raced three wide around the turn, swung widest in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. BELMONTE
chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. BARON OF BLUEGRASS broke through the starting gate but was immediately corralled, set the pace
off the rail, faltered nearing the lane and retreated while drifting out. VALADIER was outrun inside. PATRIOTIC QUEST played no factor while racing three
wide.

between runners nearing mid stretch, moved to a slim lead outside MEET MICHELLE with about a sixteenth to go, dueled then edged clear late. MEET
MICHELLE stalked three wide, moved to command past the quarter pole, spurted clear three sixteenths out, dug in when confronted, battled inside the
winner past the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. BOW MAKER settled four to five wide while not far back, commenced a run past the three
eighths, ranged up outside the top pair to loom leaving mid stretch but flattened out late. UNSTOPABULL BELLE , off the pace while saving some ground,
angled four wide approaching the stretch, moved up some in mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. LUCKY EMBER , outside rivals, circled the turn four
to five wide and lacked a stretch kick. COLD HEARTED GAL lagged off the pace, saved some ground into the lane but failed to menace. CHEERS N
APPLAUSE chased to the inside of a rival, remained in range to upper stretch then gave way. HOSS KITTEN lacked speed, raced wide and never fired.
SPECIAL POWER cleared early, set the pace, raced two wide into the lane, failed to resist a challenge past the quarter pole, drifted in and tired.

GONE HOME was bumped at the start, set a clear the pace well off the rail and held well clear while ridden out. LOST IN ROME was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace toward the inside, angled out in upper stretch and closed well to gain the place. FEATURE ACT came out and bumped the winner at the
start then bumped with LOST IN ROME soon after, advanced four wide around the turn and rallied for the show. HUNTIN' THE RUT tracked the pace three
wide, lugged in near the eighth pole, straightened out and lacked a rally. NONNA'S GLORY had early speed inside of the winner, chased inside to upper
stretch and weakened. THIRST FOR QUALITY raced in range between foes and came up empty in the drive. BABY BOY chased the pace inside and faded
through the lane. HE'S NOT TAPIT had brief speed while urging along, dropped back and was protected through the lane. The rider of FEATURE ACT
claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference at the start but the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
LET'S RUMBLE was well handled when keen to go early on, set a rated pace two wide, turned away a challenge mid turn, opened up under pressure in mid
stretch then held sway. SAVE ME PAULA , between rivals early, angled four wide for the drive and closed willingly. PATAZ had speed then rated off the
winner and angled out, mild bid three wide past the three eighths, was under a hearty ride pursuing into the lane and faded. CONFUSION BABY BOY saved
ground off the pace, angled out in the drive and failed to menace. FOURTEEN CARROT broke a step slow, was used wide early, came five wide for the
drive and gave way.
