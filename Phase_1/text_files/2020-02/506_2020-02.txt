HEBGONE broke readily, shifted off the rail to track a rival's pace, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command racing into the stretch and
prevailed under firm handling. EPIC DRAMA, restless in the gate before the start, broke a step slowly, was urged to the lead along the rail, maintained the
advantage to midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. THE GREAT LOUDINI tracked off the leaders outside foes, shifted out four wide racing into the
stretch with a mild bid while edging a rival for a share. REEDER, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders, was urged to advance in that path nearing the
lane but faded in late stages. VALUE VOUCHER was outpaced early. WANNA SALSA tracked the leaders between foes, angled to the inside and soon
dropped out.

Footnotes
SOUR KICKS broke readily, disputed the pace inside a rival on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shook clear when given his cue racing into upper
stretch while shifting out and maintained the advantage between foes to the end under firm handling. DANZO swerved a bit at the start, was righted to track
off the second flight along the inside, came through along the rail when presented an opening racing into upper stretch to challenge for command inside the
winner but proved only second best. WHITE DRILL tracked the pace outside foes just off the first flight, advanced to challenge three deep nearing upper
stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. PRETTY STORMY ducked out at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing along the inside tracking just off
the leaders to the turn, then faded into the stretch. COMPOUND INTEREST was urged to terms prompting the eventual winner's pace racing to the turn and
gave way after a half. DIAMOND PORT dwelt at the start losing contact with the field and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
PALIMPSEST, in touch with the pacesetter attending the pace four deep in the opening stages, continued three deep into the turn prompting that foe,
pressed the issue past midstretch in a long drive and just edged INDY RIDE in the final stages under firm left handed encouragement. The latter was urged
to a forward placing along the rail racing just off the pacesetter into the turn, came through along the rail to challenge for command racing into upper stretch
and contested the issue grudgingly to the end while just failing to contain the winner. BLAME THE MAKERS dictated the pace on a narrow advantage
between foes racing into the turn, then gave way leaving midstretch. GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY, in touch with the first flight three deep prompting the pace
between foes in the opening quarter, gave way racing into the turn. I HAVE HOPE broke slowly and failed to menace. ANDREZ CONQUIST proved no
factor.

Footnotes
PEARLS FOR JOSIE, reserved off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out after a half gaining position between foes
racing into the far turn, lost some momentum when racing in close quarters on the far turn, shifted out three deep while being roused to split foes nearing
midstretch and gained a narrow advantage approaching the wire to prevail. WRAPPING tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn, shifted outside a drifting rival to challenge in the four path racing into upper
stretch, continued to contest the issue shifting inwards making light contact with the winner nearing the wire and was just outkicked. WEST BURKE tracked
just off the leaders three deep racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn, was prompted to advance along the rail to challenge for
command inside foes leaving midstretch but was outkicked. BLAZINONBAYO,U reserved off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide racing through the far turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. NATOMA, forwardly
placed along the inside tracking the pacesetter in the opening stages, shifted out while being urged to advance on that foe racing into the far turn, gained a
brief lead while drifting wide entering the stretch and soon faltered. MILLIE, reserved near the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out entering the lane and
continued evenly. RENEESINHEAVEN, pulled her way to the lead, held sway to the far turn, briefly resisted a rival's challenge to regain the advantage near
midstretch but gave out near the sixteenth marker. MOMS LOVE tracked the pace between rivals in second flight, shifted out of close quarters nearing
upper stretch but quickly came up empty. TEA PARTY, restless in the gate, broke slowly and never gained contention. R D BLESSING ducked inwards
brushing a rival the start, tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight and retreated early.

Footnotes
TARTAN THE BULL broke readily, was urged to dispute the pace inside foes racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, edged forward to a clear
advantage entering the bend, then gamely held the challenge of SENT FROM HEAVEN through the stretch to prevail under firm right handed
encouragement. The latter tracked just off the first flight along the inside, advanced along the rail to challenge inside the pacesetter racing into the stretch
and continued willingly to dispute the issue to the end while just outkicked. I'M IN A HURRY, bumped, then shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, tracked
off the first flight between foes, steadily gained on the pacesetter three deep between foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair.
AMERICANO shied outwards at the start bumping I'M IN A HURRY, was urged along four wide on the backstretch prompting the pace racing to the turn and
gave way into the stretch. BRANDT made brief pursuit of the leaders five wide in the opening stages but gave way early. MOONWALKER ducked out at the
start, was righted to prompt, then attend the pace three wide between foes racing to the turn but was through after a half. CAPTAIN GAUGHEN was
outpaced early, angled to the inside but proved no threat.

Footnotes
CORCORAN, shuffled at the break, was reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the second bend while
avoiding some traffic, split rivals just off the inside steadily gaining contention nearing upper stretch, shifted out three deep and responded to brisk right
handed pressure to wrest the advantage in time. OLD FORT, caught four wide racing to the first turn as part of the second flight, shifted inwards nearing the
far turn to bid for command between foes midway through that bend, gained a narrow advantage disputing the issue outside a rival to upper stretch but
couldn't contain the winner. AMERICAN DRIVEN, forwardly placed outside the leaders racing to the backstretch, took over after a half, shifted to the inside
dueling for command inside foes racing into the far turn, pressed the issue to midstretch and weakened late. HUBBA BUBBA tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight, shifted out avoiding some traffic after a half while losing some position, angled six wide racing into the stretch and regained some
position in an even effort. PRIVILEGIO broke slowly, was prompted to position tracking the leaders three deep between foes in second flight, was prompted
between foes in that path to lodge a brief bid entering the far turn but soon flattened out. DISTINCTLY BREWED, checked of a rival along the inside racing
into the first turn, switched outside the leaders racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide after a half, continued to make brief progress in
that path through the far turn but came up empty entering upper stretch. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER angled to the inside tracking the leaders inside foes in
second flight, was steadied sharply racing into the turn while impeding a rival, switched out entering the backstretch but had no rally. DRAFTABLE was
urged to dispute the pace along the rail, conceded the lead to track a rival's pace into the backstretch, continued in brief pursuit into the far turn but quickly
came up empty. DONNERSBERG angled inwards prompting a rival's pace racing to the first turn, was eased back to track off the leaders between foes but
retreated early. KIKI N KING angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
CPL. DIONICIO broke inwards bumping, was quickly righted to race on terms with the first flight three deep between foes into the first turn, continued with a
steady bid to wrest the advantage nearing the second bend, went clear while angling to the rail and steadily widened the margin to the end under firm left
handed encouragement. THREE OLIVEZ, caught five wide racing through the first turn, tracked just off the leaders to the far turn, continued three deep
between foes on the far turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others. BATTLE CREEK was rated off the leaders inside foes in the opening half, was
roused to advance inside rivals racing into the far turn, switched out in upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. BIFF, reserved
between foes dropping off the second flight into the backstretch, made an effort to improve position racing four wide through the far turn to upper stretch.
GALAXY INVASION was hustled up the rail to gain the lead racing into the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin into the backstretch and gave way once
headed entering the far turn. INITFORTHELOVE, caught four wide between foes racing into the first turn, was eased back nearing the backstretch to track
outside foes, continued four wide into the far turn and steadily faded. WICKED WEDNESDAY, bumped at the start, tracked the pacesetter between rivals
while angling inwards nearing the backstretch and soon dropped out. FIFTH OF NOVEMBER dropped out early. SORCIER trailed.

Footnotes
MAD GRACE angled to the inside leaving the chute tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, shifted out three deep after a half commencing a
steady advance, bid for command in that path racing into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm handling. SHES DYNOMITE, urged to terms
prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes through the far turn to midstretch but came up second best. PAINTED
IMAGE tracked just off the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, was eased back nearing the far turn, swung out four wide leaving the far turn
and continued to make a mild gain. LIL HOOH'S HOOH was rated outside foes tracking well off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out five wide
racing through the stretch and improved position. QUEEN ROSE tracked off the second flight between foes, angled to the inside on the far turn and
continued evenly. LADY LOVE was settled early and never gained contention. ACCOLADES GALORE settled outside foes, was fanned six wide into the
stretch and never seriously menaced. CHOLLA tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted inwards racing into the far turn while making brief
progress but gave way into the lane. DREAMING DIAMONDS sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend and
gave way racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
TATTERAZZI angled in racing to the first turn while being prompted to join the pace, shifted to the rail nearing the backstretch dictating terms, turned back a
rival's challenge to go clear racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. TIZ HER WAY, held up off the second flight
between foes racing to the first turn, came through close quarters to gain position racing into the backstretch, continued with a steady advance to challenge
on the far turn but proved no match. CAPTUREMENOW, three deep between foes, then steadied off ABILIFY racing through the first turn, angled to the
inside nearing the far turn and continued evenly. GET BACK HOME, reserved early, shifted in on the far turn and passed between some tiring rivals late.
ABILIFY, forwardly placed along the rail leaving the chute, checked out of tight quarters racing into the first turn while ducking outwards losing position, was
prompted to gain position between foes near the inside racing to the far turn but faded between foes in the closing stages. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS tracked
the leaders outside rivals to the backstretch, altered course avoiding FINEST JEWEL racing through the backstretch, then continued three, then four wide
into the lane while no real threat. BEACH LADY was steadied a bit avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn while dropping off the second flight and
offered no rally. FINEST JEWEL, rank between foes and pulling hard against restraint, bore out while moving briefly to terms with the pacesetter racing into
the backstretch and was gathered up after a half. OUR GIRL IN RIO angled inside early but proved no factor. RONNIE flashed brief pace between foes and
faded after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF CAPTUREMENOW LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
