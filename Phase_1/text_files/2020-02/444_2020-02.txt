Footnotes
CATTLE DRIVE came in leaving the gate, bumped LONG TOM, stalked in the three path outside the early leader, was urged closer on the final turn then
drew out through deep stretch. FIFTY FLAGS stayed out from the rail while making the pace for just over a mile then gave way grudgingly. RANDOM
THOUGHTS was content to lag along the rail, swung wide into the stretch while rallying and finished willingly outside. SMART TWO A T wasn't far back
along the rail to the stretch, bore out under left hand whip and hung. LONG TOM was bumped by the winner leaving the gate, raced two wide between
horses then stopped in the lane. MANAHAWKIN stopped three wide after six furlongs.

Footnotes
WINNING KNOCKOUT broke out and bumped a foe at the start, but quickly cleared off, rated in hand while holding a loose advantage in the two path
around the turn, widened her margin in upper stretch, then was driven from the furlong pole to the sixteenth pole before being hand ridden late. GOLDEN
ACES settled in midpack, took the turn in the four path, then stayed on mildly to achieve place passing the furlong pole, but was only second best. PRIDE IN
THE BIZ settled far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, then swung to the five path turning for home, and passed tired foes for a minor
share. JEALOUS HEART saved ground while forwardly placed, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the turn, then got outfinished for minor rewards
late. STONE COLD chased the loose leader while in the three path around the turn, but was no match for that foe in upper stretch before weakening at the
furlong pole while hanging on her left lead. HOOF HOOF AWAY saved ground while trailing around the turn, and never got involved. MINNOW was bumped
by an inner foe at the start, recovered to be forwardly placed between horses, but weakened approaching the seven sixteenths pole, faded in the three path
around the turn, and subsequently stopped through the lane.

early, trailed in the two path into the stretch then outfinished tired ones. HASTA AHORA made a mild run in the five path into the stretch then flattened out.
HERE COMES GARY raced well out into the track into the first turn, made a run in the six path into the stretch then flattened out. CANT STOP THE RAIN
had his head turned to the inside at the break, left tardily by several lengths, improved position between horses into the stretch then tired. SHIPTHEGRIP

Footnotes
THAT'S HISTORY dueled outside of WARCRAFT through the early stages and into the turn, took over and forged clear from that rival approaching the
quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, then held sway under driving pressure. WARCRAFT dueled inside of THAT'S HISTORY, but failed to keep pace with
that foe approaching the quarter pole, shifted to the three path turning for home to reengage outside of the leader, but failed to make headway while gamely
holding place. TEN HUT took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, trailed turning for home, then made a belated rally between horses to get up
for show at the wire. TELLING YOU TWICE was two wide and midpack through the turn, then made a mild rally between horses through midstretch, but was
nipped for show at the wire. CUMBERLAND GAP shifted off the rail to the three path at the quarter pole to attempt a bid turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with the leader while being floated to the four path by an inner rival in upper stretch, made a place bid in midstretch, but was fended off, weakened
late, and got outfinished for minor rewards. YOUR SECRET'S SAFE hugged the fence while trailing through the turn, then passed tired rivals turning for
home. SUPER VISION stalked two wide, but was driven to keep pace at the seven sixteenths pole, failed to do so, faded in the four to five path around the
turn, then weakened further at the furlong pole. CALCULATED THINKIN took the turn in midpack in the five path, came into the lane in the six path and
widest of all, but weakened.

GRAB THE GOLD showed speed inside from the outset, edged clear before a quarter, drew out on the turn and was kept to urging.
DONTMESAWITHSISTER settled, was sent closer in the three path into the stretch but failed to sustain his bid. WELL IN TUNE was slow to settle, raced
the two path around the turn and gained mildly in the lane. SHADYS KEEPER chased two wide outside the winner into the turn then stopped. LORD OF
THE IDIOTS quickly fell far back after a slow break. PARLAY VOEUX stopped inside.

Footnotes
KAIJU stalked three wide in the four path, inched forward to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged clear from the field turning for home, then held
sway under driving pressure. MEADE saved ground from midpack inside of multiple rivals, surged through a rail opening turning for home to make a bid, but
was outkicked by the eventual winner and held place. TEAK was among trafffic two wide and between horses in midpack turning for home, shifted from the
two to the five path passing the three sixteenths pole, by doing so came across JEEZUM JIM's path, forcing that rival to brush with CINDERELA EL CROME
at the furlong pole, then finished willingly but not able to achieve place. SNOWDAY (FR) established a clear lead in the two path, but was headed by the
eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole, then gave way between horses at the furlong pole. HEY JABBER JAW was off a step slow and crowded
between horses at the start, advanced out of last in the five path and outside of horses into the turn, but flattened out turning for home, and weakened while
hanging on his left lead. GET THE W was midpack three wide between horses, but was shuffled out of that spot into the turn, trailed in the six path around
the bend, and failed to make an impact. JEEZUM JIM stalked inside of KAIJU while outside of the leader, shifted from the four to the three path into the turn,
but failed to keep pace with KAIJU as that rival forged clear turning for home, then began to weaken in upper stretch, was cut off and forced a bit outwards
by the outwards shifting TEAK approaching the furlong pole, brushed CINDERELA EL CROME, and continued to fade thereafter. CINDERELA EL CROME
was caught four wide and between horses in midpack around the turn, weakened turning for home, but was brushed by an inner foe at the furlong pole, then
continued to fade thereafter. Following an objection lodged by the rider the rider of #4 JEEZUM JIM against the rider of #6 TEAK, and an objection lodged
by the rider of #9 CINDERELA EL CROME against the rider of #4 JEEZUM JIM, the stewards disqualified #6 TEAK and place him Eighth due to interfering
with JEEZUM JIM and causing JEEZUM JIM to interfere with CINDERELA EL CROME approaching the furlong pole

GRAVEL ROAD was hustled to the front from inside rivals before going a quarter, stayed out from the rail once clear early on the turn, bore out under left
hand whip through the stretch and held. JOHNNY CAB was bumped leaving the gate, steadied to avoid running up on rivals midway on the turn, swung out
sharply into the five path then gained outside. SHANGHAISCHOOL ducked out sharply leaving the gate, was unhurried early, advanced the four path
around the turn, loomed boldly outside the winner into the final furlong, was carried out, steadied through the final yards and hung. GREAT AGAIN ducked
out into JOHNNY CAB leaving the gate, made a run along the rail into the stretch to get closer then flattened out. STONE SCULPTOR broke in the air then
ducked out sharply leaving the gate, trailed and passed eased up foes while eased up. BEYOND THE BEND was hustled to make the early pace, raced out
from the rail around the turn, stopped in the lane and was eased up late. I'M ABLE raced three wide with the pace into the turn, stopped in the lane and was
eased up.

Footnotes
AWESOME SIGHT settled far off the pace, took the turn in the five path and outside of rivals, swung to the six to seven path turning for home, then offered a
late rally while hanging on his left lead, and got up approaching the wire. MISTER HUMOR saved ground off of the pace, slipped inside of LITTLEIBTALILY
around the turn and commenced a rail rally turning for home, attempted to shift outside of the weakening leader at the eighth pole, but bumped his entry
mate, angled back in as the leader drifted outwards, surged through and built a clear lead at the sixteenth pole, but was worn down in the late stages.
LITTLEBITALILY was bumped by an inner foe at the start, settled two wide in midpack, swung to the five path turning for home, and finished willingly
between horses. NOT FAKE NEWS trailed in the three to four path around the turn, then passed tired horses with a mild rally through the lane. JUST DO
THE MATH set the pace in the two path, held a clear advantage through the turn, but weakened due to hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, drifted
outwards while tiring at the furlong pole, subsequently faded. KITTEN STREET broke in and bumped a rival, stalked the early dueling leaders, inched closer
in the four path to make a bid approaching the quarter pole, but was outkicked in upper stretch, kept on to bid for place at the furlong pole, but weakened
late. REX'S LEGACY dueled outside of JUST DO THE MATH early on, stalked that foe into the turn, rebid at the quarter pole while being kept in the three
path, but weakened turning for home, was bumped by an inner foe at the furlong pole, then continued to fade thereafter.
