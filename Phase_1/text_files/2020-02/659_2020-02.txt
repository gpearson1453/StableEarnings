second best. FRED'S COUNTRY BOY chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. SKYSWEPT tracked
the pace early three wide, was off the rail into the lane and faded in the stretch drive. GRAY DONOVAN stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane
and empty late. SENOR WILBUR was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. ONE THIRTY NINE chased the pace early, was in the four
