under a strong drive and held well. MR BINGLEY bumped at the start, tracked the pace off the rail then angled to the inside, raced a bit off the rail through
the turn, looked to advance but had to wait for room leaving the turn, rallied outside a rival then angled inside the leader and finished a game second.
UNEXPECTED JOURNEY vied three deep into and around the turn, outkicked in the lane by the top pair but held on for the show. P TOWN TITAN stalked
the pace off the rail, two wide then lacked room and angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. DIXIE DOO RUN RUN stumbled, broke out and bumped
rival at the start, traveled a bit off the rail to the lane and improved position. ROYAL BAR sent for the lead and vied from the inside, in tight entering the turn,
continued to challenge from the inside to the lane and weakened in the stretch. ANGRY BOBBY settled off the pace, raced three wide into the turn, angled
five wide leaving the turn and could not rally.

SHEZA KATHY dueled with SIX EIGHTEEN to the stretch, dug in late and held off the late charge from the runner-up to the outside. MADAME JEANETTE
tracked from the inside, angled out and lacked room in the stretch, shifted to the outside of the leader, closed in the final moments but was not enough. SIX
EIGHTEEN dueled for the lead from the inside to the stretch, outfinished in the final sixteenth but was able to last for the show. LOUDER CALIFORNIA
reserved in the beginning, along the inside then moved out two to three wide leaving the turn, came back inside and rallied along the fence to earn the
show. VIRGINIA HALL tracked the pace up the backstretch, two wide into the turn, came out and entered the stretch five wide, then finished evenly. MILLIE
JOEL traveled near the back of the pack, three wide into the turn, four wide nearing the eighth pole and proved no menace.

Footnotes
BACK BEAUTY forwardly placed while four deep up the backstretch, gained command around and kicked clear on the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
urged right-handed then drew off under a hand ride. CIOPPINO PASADINO sped to the front, vied from the inside, chased the leader two wide into the
stretch and held second. ALLOTMENT off a bit slow to begin, angled to the inside, saved ground around the turn, angled out in the stretch and summoned a
late rally. ANA LISA chased from the inside into and around the turn but lacked a bid in the lane. WE WILL RE JOYCE pressed the issue between rivals,
gained the lead briefly into the turn, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. MANY LIGHTS hopped at the start, trailed the field in the early going,
went two wide into the stretch and never threatened. ROYAL ASTRONOMER vied three deep early, failed to match strides and chased four wide into the
lane and weakened.
