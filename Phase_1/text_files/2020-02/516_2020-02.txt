Footnotes
FROST OR FRIPPERY allowed to settled toward the inside, continued to race reserved while saving ground through the second turn, steered out for the
drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL prompted the pace off the inside, dueled into the far turn, outkicked that rival
inside the furlong marker then could not contain the winner in the waning strides. KENZOU'S RHYTHM forwardly placed while off the inside, crept closer in
the three path turning for home to loom a threat, hung in the drive. STUART HALL raced in mid pack just off the inside, went one paced while racing off the
inside. THE ROUGE DIESEL broke back, lacked speed, moved a bit closer in the three path second turn, lacked a further response in the drive. RED
AGAIN narrowly set the pace after clearing to the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch, gave way when confronted for the drive. HIGH RISK
STRATEGY was never a factor. TALES OF WAR never closer, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
SEKANI broke alertly, narrowly set the pace toward the inside, shook clear in the turn, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out.
MOONSHINE MISS within striking distance early inside, continued race along the rail turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, game for the place.
MANY SWEET TREATS settled off the pace just off the inside, three wide turning into the stretch, bid for the place, outkicked for that position while also
unable to do much with the winner. MS SASSY ATITUDE forwardly placed in the three path, had little left for the drive. JULIE ARKANSAS back off the pace
and the inside, two path through most of the turn, improved position in the drive while not a serious threat. MOCHA KISS in some early traffic in the main
body, three wide through the turn, continued in even fashion through the lane. COMANCHE MOON broke back, raced off the inside turn, made little impact
in picking off a couple of tiring rivals. DIXIE CAT made little impact while racing three wide. MARQUEE COWBOY was never involved. BRISA last away,
trailed most of the way in showing little. LUCK'S GOOD GIRL pressed the early pace while off the inside, stopped in the turn.

Footnotes
BANDIT POINT unhurried early outside, three out to four wide through the turn when beginning to advance, reached the leaders while widest nearing the
furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. SIR BRAHMS also raced back off the pace, three wide through the turn, traffic, in tight, brushed upper
stretch, could not match the winner late, second best. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR closest to the dueling leaders, three wide through the turn, four wide upper
stretch, not enough for the top two late, clear of the others. WASABI MOON void of speed, continued back early in the turn, came on the outside for the
drive, improved position with some mild interest out in the strip. DESTINY WAY broke alertly, helped set a quick set of early fractions, weakened in the
drive. I AM washy, in mid pack early off the inside, in some traffic turning for home, came up empty for the drive. BOGEY off a step slow, remained always
back toward the inside. SHOAL BAY off the early pace, fell back in the turn. MOON DOG SPOT dueled up front along the inside through some quick early
fractions and stopped.

Footnotes
TOWN CHAMP broke out but with the field, moved up to narrowly show the way up the backstretch, shook off the other speed to be clear when straightened
for home, kept to task. COURTING A KISS pressed the issue three wide the opening quarter, chased the winner into the stretch, had little for that one, held
sway for the place. REPLETE behind the leaders just off the inside, raced behind traffic entering the stretch, came out under a left handed stick nearing
midstretch, bumped with MIRACLE HILL, narrowly gained the show late while not a threat to the top two. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, REPLETE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH. EXULTATION off a step slow, trailed in the three path, swung
out widest for the drive, drifted in, bumped with MIRACLE HILL when rallying midtrack, missed the show. MIRACLE HILL in the second flight while racing off
the inside, came four wide when moving a bit closer turning for home, between foes when bumped from both sides past midstretch, finished up evenly.
LIGHT OF THE WORLD vied up front while between rivals, weakened in the drive. VICTORY ELEMENT saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
QUICK DECISION asked early to maintain forward position up the inside, narrowly showed the way early larger lead late in the turn, long drive, proved gutty
in the late going to save the win. LUCKY BETTY back off the pace after breaking a step slow, raced in the two path through most of the turn, moved out
widest for the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the winner. TIPSY GAL with the early pace three wide, prompted the issue into the turn, fell back a bit
late in the bend, brief rebid a furlong out then could not match the winner to the wire nor contain the runner up, saved the show. SACRED UNION lacked
early foot, saved some ground through the turn, showed some belated interest through the stretch to improve position. MISS NOTORIOUS with the early
while between rivals, chased turn, weakened in the drive. GURL YOU FINE stalked the leaders toward the inside, had little left for the drive. SHE'S
XTREMELY HOT off slowly, raced back and toward the inside, lacked a closing response. FRENCH CAFE remained always back. ADHWAA was also
finished early.

Footnotes
GO GOOGLE YOURSELF broke on top, allowed the leader to clear in the first turn, stalked that one onto the backsretch, was covered up through much of
the final turn, moved out for the drive, set down, kicked down rival to be in time. WHOA NELLIE trailed early but raced within striking distance outside, made
an early move to challenge outside the pacesetter into the far turn, dueled with that rival through that bend, shook off the other speed to be clear in upper
stretch, continued to hold daylight until late, could not contain the winner. CAIRENN lacked early foot, moved out three wide under restraint, three wide
through much of the final turn, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to be clear for the show, no match for the top two late. MOTION EMOTION off a
step slow, moved up race forwardly off the inside, remained with striking distance into the far turn, had little left for the drive. LADY SUEBEE broke with the
leaders, gradually cleared from the three path in the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled with the runner up through most of the final turn
then faltered in the drive. GOLD STANDARD within striking distance inside, maintained contact with the leaders for a half then beat a steady retreat.

Footnotes
HOME RUN TRICK broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, hard rated early on the backstretch, let out a notch into the far turn, shrugged off a
couple of foes through the final turn, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. STARSHIP ZEUS forwardly paced off the inside, stalked three wide the
middle half, moved a bit closer to the winner in the three path final bend, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. PICKFORD within
striking distance inside, pulled early, continued to track in the run up the backstretch, moved out for the drive, roused, finished willingly to be getting to the
runner up late. SOARING BIRD lacked speed outside, remained outside in the run up the backstretch, came four wide out of the final turn, staged a mild
rally to improve position. UCANTHANKMELATER fell back to trail just after the start, continued to race unhurried the middle half, began to advance in the
final turn, four wide into the lane, also displayed some belated interest to move up a few positions in the drive, no real threat. PARADE FIELD last to leave,
moved up soon after to race in mid pack, had little for the drive. GUM TREE LANE four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the
second turn, came up empty for the stretch run as well. GIGGING remained back in failing to menace. EAST MOON LAKE was never involved in remaining
back. POTOMAC was finished after a half. SONIC JET closest to the winner, moved briefly closer from between rivals in the second turn, stopped in the
drive.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S CHARGE broke on top, a bit slow to settle in the first turn, relaxed in the run up the backstretch, got a short breather early in the far turn, called
on for some run turning for home, responded when confronted by the runner up when straightened for home, held that rival at bay while drifting out a bit late.
BANKIT allowed to settle off the pace along the inside, patiently handled the middle half, tilted out to be three wide turning for home, engaged the winner
from the outside nearing the furlong grounds, floated out by that foe a bit, could not get by, well clear of the others. SNAPPER SINCLAIR four wide in the
first turn when with the second flight, continued outside and was four wide again in the second bend, had little for the top two with a clean trip in the drive,
narrowly gained the show. PIONEER SPIRIT dropped toward the inside midway on the first turn, pressured the pace, while continuing to save ground,
lacked a punch in the drive. CAMPAIGN last away, fell far back, continued to trail by a wide margin in the run up the backstretch, swung out widest when
exhibiting some interest out of the final turn, continued to close willingly while well out in the strip while too late. BRAVAZO within striking distance while
racing outside, continued one paced, five wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. RATED R SUPERSTAR void of speed, saved some ground
second turn, improved position while continuing toward the inside with some modest late energy. MATH WIZARD took back inside, moved out in the first
turn, continued outside and failed to fire. GUEST SUITE raced in mid pack, weakened in the drive. EXULTING inside some traffic through the first turn,
remained always back. JOEVIA prompted the pace off the inside, continued to force the issue into the far turn off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SILVER PROSPECTOR broke back, pulled through the first turn when in a forward position, continued to be patiently handled the middle half, inched closer
in the far turn, steered out to engage the leader entering the stretch, drifted out slightly, was straightened and put a head in front with a furlong remaining,
continued to drift slightly, edged clear under firm handling. WELLS BAYOU broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn, set an uncontested pace up the
backstretch and into the far turn, continued to show the way into the lane toward the inside, responded when the winner came alongside soon after, proved
stubborn in the drive, clearly second best. ANSWER IN five wide into the first turn, brushed, stalked the leader three wide in the run up the backstretch,
moved a bit closer in the three path late in the second turn, had little left for the top two while angling in through the lane. SHOPLIFTED lacked early foot,
raced inside of some traffic in the second turn, moved out for the drive only to finish up evenly. TAISHAN bobbled slightly start, raced four wide into the first
turn, brushed, continued well out in the strip, four wide into the far turn, roused for the drive, came up empty. VILLAINOUS pressured the leader in the two
path, had little left for the drive. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY steadied repeatedly behind and between horses in the first turn, raced back, moved out to be five
wide midway on the final turn, lacked a rally. CHASE TRACKER last to leave after bobbling at the start, was never involved in showing little. GOLD STREET
in some early traffic when close up early, shuffled back onto the backstretch, faded away and trailed home.

Footnotes
BACKGROUND away in good order, stalked the pace while racing three wide, advanced to the fore while remaining in the three path second turn, kicked
well clear. TIZ THE JOURNEY lacked speed, continued back into the far turn, swung out five wide turning for home, finished up willingly to earn the place,
no threat to the winner, held sway for the place. WILD UNION settled in mid pack off the inside, in some traffic in the second turn, asked for run into the
lane, finished up best of the rest. SHAKA off a step slow, continued back, swung out five wide into the lane, finished willingly while too late.
DREAMONMEBABY raced in the main body while three wide, tilted out four wide for the drive, finished up evenly. BOATING PARTY pressed the pace while
off the inside, had little left when the real running began at the head of the lane. FRONT MAN gradually cleared toward the inside through the first turn,
showed the way up the backstretch, began to weaken when headed turning for home. WARRIOR'S MAP forwardly placed in the early going, had nothing for
the drive. AHSAD prompted the pace for a half and weakened. RECKLESSNESS remained always back. WENT four wide in the first turn, staged a steady
retreat.
