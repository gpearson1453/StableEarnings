early, went five wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. LUCKY FLASH stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn,
angled out in early stretch and finished evenly late. HOT LIL MESS was unhurried early, raced six wide into the turn, angled in and finished with a mild late
rally. CRITICAL DECISION tracked the early pace, raced seven wide into the turn, angled out and was empty late. FOLLYS SECRET was outrun early,
raced along the inside, angled out and offered no late rally. CACTUS CHEQUE was taken back early, saved ground into the turn and never fired. SASSY

Footnotes
RED OR GREEN dueled for the lead from the inside with ATTILA'S TATTLE while racing from the inside, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and
gamely prevailed. ATTILA'S TATTLE broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied through a prolonged drive but could not
get by that foe in the closing yards. SHESAFASTCRICKET settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane
and finished with a steady bid. EXCITING SUMMER was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, gave way in the drive and was
bleeding through his mouth when returned for unsaddling. DANCING GEISHA was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced off the rail and did not
reach contention. IRON TUFF was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. REBELLIOUS ANGEL was bumped
at the start and lagged throughout.
