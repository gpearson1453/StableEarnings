Footnotes
ERICKA ROCKS pressed the pace, made a late bid and was going away at the end. HERE COMES LINDA raced within striking distance, made a bid, drove
clear down the stretch, but was no match late for the winner. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH raced in the middle of the field, saved ground, made a mild bid, but
proved no match for the top two. SOUTHERN GALAXY lacked early speed, raced six wide around the turn, moved up, but was no factor. TOGAROCK
pressed the pace, faded and finished evenly. NONCHALANTLY void of early speed, improved position, but was no threat. SASSY CAMILLE dueled on the
front end and was finished early. BAD GAL RIRI always raced near the back and showed little. REMI'S ROSE went to the front, drove clear, weakened,
ducked in, hit rail and lost rider.

Footnotes
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, entered the stretch wide, rallied down the lane and was
up in time. KAPELLMEISTER pressed the pace, took command down the stretch, drove clear and was caught at the wire. RUN ROCKET brushed at the
start, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide bid and was clear third. ZIPZAPTIME vied for the early lead, faded
and was no threat late. FORGOTTEN COAST raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and faded. GIANT MESA brushed at the start, raced in the back
and was never a factor. SHOTSOFT dueled for the early advantage and retreated to the rear.

SKYLAR'S WAY within contention, raced outside around both turns, drove clear down the stretch and won under steady urging. HEATHER DIVINE lacked
early speed, raced wide around the first turn, moved up around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch and was a clear second at the wire. ONE FINE
PINOT raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and proved third best. MY LITTLE CHARLIE challenged for the early lead, saved ground and
weakened. ORTHODOX BEAT vied for the early lead and faded down the home stretch. BOSTON BABY broke sharp, dropped back and finished evenly.
WE CAN DREAM raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. QUEEZER always raced near the back and showed little. TWO BAD SISTAS raced
within striking distance and dropped back. FLASHY MICHEL raced within contention, retreated to the back and was eased.

SILVER SQUALL dueled for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear and won under strong handling. DIXIE LADY challenged for the early advantage,
racing head and head with SILVER SQUALL, couldn't keep up late, but held on for second. ROCKIN SUNDAY raced in the middle of the field, moved up
around the turn and made a late gain. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS void of early speed, raced wide around the turn, gained ground late and finished willingly.
RACIN PRAYER raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. MISS INVADER raced near the back, moved up and finished evenly. SWEET
PRAYERS pressed the early pace, saved ground and faded. MY SISTER ANNETTE reared at the start, racing from the back and was never close. LUCKY
LILY BE raced within striking distance and retreated to the rear.

KENSLEY'S HIPPIE vied for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear and was kept to the task. CANRUNALITTLE unhurried in the beginning, moved up on
the outside around the turn, made a late bid and was clearly second at the wire. GOOD AIR raced near the middle of the pack, made a mild bid, but proved
no match for the top two. MEMORY OF SWIM void of early speed, raced wide around the turn, made a late gain, but was no factor. GROVER CAPOTE
lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but was no threat. GEAUX DUBAI raced within striking distance and weakened. POINT TO THE GREEN raced
evenly near the back and lacked a bid. SONG SPECTACULAR pressed the early pace, blew the turn, finished wide and was no threat. DESIARD dueled on
the front end and stopped. JAZZY PUNCH always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
FLASH DANCERLUCK dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. BUY IN raced within
contention, made a late bid and finished willingly. GUILTY AGAIN pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn and was no match for the top
two. COMMON LAW CAT raced within striking distance, eased back, showed late interest, but was no factor. TAKING NOTES raced evenly near the back
and was never a threat. CHEESEBURGER vied for the early advantage, raced four wide around the first turn and faded. SKIP CHASER void of early speed
and was never close. OKLAHOMA STORM hesitated, broke in, racing in the rear, moved up, within contention and dropped to the rear.
