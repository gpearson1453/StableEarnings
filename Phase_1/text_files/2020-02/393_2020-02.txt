INDEFINITELY was unhurried early, went six wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole and drew off as an easy winner. SNIGGLE set a pressured
early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up in early stretch, couldn't hold off the winner, was no match late and finished second best.
HENNESSY'S SQUIRT broke in the air at the start, was void of any early speed, checked off horses into the turn, angled out and was along for the show
position. MAGIC JOURNEY pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn and tired. POP QUIZ stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the
turn, drifted out and faded. CHAMPITO was outrun early, raced seven wide through the turn and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
SELECTION PARK was outrun early, made a middle move along the backstretch, advanced seven wide through the second turn, took control at the eighth
pole and edged clear for the win. REALREALGOOD was void of any early speed, circled eight wide into the second turn, was no match late and finished
second best. FLYING BLUE was up close early, took control early, raced five wide into the second turn, angled to the inside and weakened. INGLENOOK
was unhurried early, went four wide into the second turn and offered a mild late rally. MOMS FAVORITE was allowed to settle , went three wide into the
second turn and was empty late. THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU set a pressured pace from the inside and faded. CHOLULA CHARLIE was taken back early from
the inside and never fired. TRES TAURUS pressed the early pace, raced between rivals, was eased and vanned off.

Footnotes
PAC SUM HEAT bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter,
responded when challenged by E BAR GOLD with a furlong to run and held that rival at bay to the wire. E BAR GOLD was away in good order to stalk the
pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe in mid-stretch but could not get by in the drive. TETON was forwardly placed early,
raced off the rail through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. QUANTICO JOE was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished evenly. DANI'S CHOICE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three
furlongs. SWEET BEAU ROLL settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. HIT A LICK showed no early speed, saved
ground through the turn and did not reach contention.
