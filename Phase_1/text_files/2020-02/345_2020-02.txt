KISSES FOR TIZZY was off to a good start and raced in contention along the inside around the first turn, tracked the pace and saved ground down the
backstretch, was patiently handled around the far turn, shifted out top stretch, kicked in under a drive and drew clear. SPECIAL LIAISON settled near
mid-range to the far turn, raced two wide between foes near the quarter pole, shifted out five wide entering top stretch then switched in a couple paths under
right handed pressure and finished well. KAYSERI stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid and raced in aim for the lead at the
quarter pole, took command upper stretch and led the way at the furlong marker then got outkicked. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN was off to a good start and
moved in closer from the outside, took the lead and secured rail position on the first turn then set the uncontested pace down the backstretch, held a slim
lead over KAYSERI late far turn then got collared by rival upper stretch and gave way. DREAMINOFDASIES raced off the early pace and saved ground,
launched a rail bid and gained closer contention around the far turn then flattened out in the lane. POWERFUL WORDS was off a step slow at the start then
remained reserved saving ground to the far turn, shifted out six wide top entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally. JOSEFA raced in contention and
tracked the pace down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid and raced in close contention at the quarter pole then faded in the lane. BUNNY
PRINCESS settled four to five wide through early stages, raced wide into stretch run and failed to move on when called upon. FREE FALLING was reserved
along the outside through early stages, raced five wide into the drive and failed to respond. LOOKN FINE AS WINE was off poorly at the start, quickly pulled
up and walked off. STEWARDS POSTED AND INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE START, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
NAPA RULES set a pressured pace inside MARVA and PRINCESS CARRIGAN, edged away from those two late on the turn, was joined from the outside
by DOMINEER at the top of the stretch, and responded well to kick away from the latter through the final furlong. DOMINEER was a step slow to begin,
advanced inside after a quarter-mile, split horses past the five-sixteenths to loom boldly outside NAPA RULES, reached even terms through upper stretch
but could not match strides past the eighth-pole while clearly second best. BLESSED BEAST was outsprinted through the first half-mile, swung four wide
into the lane and rallied mildly to go clear of the others. PRINCESS CARRIGAN argued the pace three wide, weakened approaching the stretch and
dropped well back. MARVA contested the pace between horses, weakened late on the turn and had nothing left. ANGELIC KNUGGET was well placed
early off the leading trio, then retreated around the turn and dropped far back despite urging.

the far turn then raced in tight quarters and forced to be taken up near the quarter pole and lost all momentum. PORT HUNTER raced near mid-range down
the backstretch, launched a three to four wide bid around the far turn, raced in contention then failed to sustain bid and gave way upper stretch. FORK

FOREVER MARTA moved four wide launching a bid past the five-sixteenths, took over outside rivals through the furlong grounds and edged away on the
wrong lead. STROLL WITH BECCA had aim outside the leaders three wide into the turn, moved in a path challenging between horses at the top of the
stretch, and finished well to be clearly second best. SISTER GEMA vied outside TWICE AROUND early, cleared off and moved inside after a half-mile,
battled inside the top two finishers turning for home and weakened on the rail. TALKTHETALK stayed in close touch behind the early leaders, put in a brief
three-wide bid between horses approaching the stretch, but flattened out. DERBY DAY ZIP was outsprinted early inside, shifted out four wide leaving the
turn and made no headway. TWICE AROUND pressed the pace inside SISTER GEMA to the turn, gave way after a half and was not pressed late.

EVE OF WAR hustled through between horses to grab the lead after the start, widened the lead around the turn going comfortably inside, and was ridden
out through the lane under confident handling. SKINNY DIP broke a step slow, advanced while shifting off the rail past the five-sixteenths, rallied into second
after a half-mile and ran on best of the others. GIBBERISH raced widest early, angled inward to the turn, moved back out approaching the lane four wide,
and was a non-threatening third. GENEALOGIST was outrun early, came five wide off the turn and posed no threat. TEENAGE KICKS chased inside for
nearly a half-mile, and dropped back through the last quarter-mile. CHAMPAGNE LADY was finished early three wide. CONGRATSROSY was on the hard
chase two wide into the turn, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGER BLOOD broke alertly, quickly cleared on top and dropped over to the inside, remained clear and comfortable still unlashed around the turn, given
cue top of the lane, stayed sharp in response and finished clear. STURGEON was the closest pursuer off the leader in opening stages and continued to
chase after TIGERBLOOD in stretch run, roused two wide then along the inside and had to settle for second best. GO GONE GONE raced near midpack
and three wide near the quarter pole, came out wider top stretch and set down for the drive, hustled along in steady pursuit, steadily edged closer and
prevailed for a share. NEW YORK'S FINEST raced two wide and raced in range around the turn, tipped out wider for the drive, put to a drive, showed
response then flattened out in the final furlong. TAKE CHARGE DUDE was off slow at the start, raced in the back and saved ground near the inside, roused
two to three wide in stretch run and improved position without threatening. KITCHEN FIRE was forwardly positioned along the inside in opening stages then
came under a strong hold and steadied along into the turn, checked sharply near the quarter pole then gained a clear path top stretch but had no kick after
rough trip. TENACITY ZIP hustled along and raced two wide in range around the turn then gave way in the lane. BORDINI raced outside off the early speed,
hustled along racing widest at the head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. NO WAY NEVER (IRE) raced off the pace, hustled along into stretch run but
failed to move on. SLEEPING GIANT chased along the inside in early stages, kept under steady pressure then switched out five to six wide upper stretch
and lacked response.

and wore down JUST KIDDING from outside late. JUST KIDDING contested the pace between SWAGGER and UNPUBLISHED from the outset, got the
best of those two through the stretch and fought gamely to the finish. UNPUBLISHED bumped lightly with GREAT SUCCESS at the start, vied for command
outside, and fought on to deep stretch before giving way. SWAGGER vied for the lead inside JUST KIDDING and UNPUBLISHED, and weakened in upper
stretch. DON FAGER trailed inside throughout.

DRINKS ON ME moved into the first turn two wide and settled in range down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid for command at the quarter pole,
gathered sharp momentum under steady pressure, took command upper stretch, stayed strong on top and finished going away. AMAZING AUDREY settled
along the inside not far off the early pace, remained patiently handled around the far turn, angled out entering top stretch then finished with response and
gained place. FAITH N HOPE established the early lead and secured inside position, set the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, challenged by
SOME SAY SO near the quarter pole, dug in and held a slim lead top of the lane then got collared upper stretch and gave way. PICASSO MOON tracked
the pace along the inside down the backstretch, coaxed along the rail around the final turn, shifted out top stretch then finished evenly.
HOPONTHEBUSGUS steadied on the first turn then settled under slight restraint through early stages, launched a four wide bid late far turn, came out wide
entering top stretch and failed to threaten. SOME SAY SO stalked the leader to the far turn, prompted two wide and moved up to challenge FAITH N HOPE
for the lead at the quarter pole, remained in close position top stretch then failed to keep pace and gave way. WHITEHEELGIRL settled not far off the early
pace to the far turn, launched a three wide bid and hustled along in close contention then faded turning for home. BELIEVE INDEED was settled racing two
wide around the first turn then grew rank and pulled up by the rider then walked off after the race.

Footnotes
TROPHY CHASER veered out sharply at the start smashing WEATHER WIZ into OUTSHINE, prompted the pace outside MCERIN for six furlongs, took
over past the five-sixteenths with the rider taking a glance back, and drew off flashed the whip through the stretch. SCARS ARE COOL was strung out four
wide around the first turn, advanced to briefly loom a threat in the three-path after six furlongs, could not menace the winner but was along to wear down
MCERIN for the runner-up spot. MCERIN set the pace inside, got headed by the eventual winner with five-sixteenths remaining, yielded readily and
weakened through the drive. HARVEY WALLBANGER saved ground outrun for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and had no rally. WEATHER WIZ got
slammed into OUTSHINE by TROPHY CHASER at the start, raced forwardly three wide early, and faded under pressure approaching the stretch.
OUTSHINE hit the left side of the gate at the break and got clobbered by WEATHER WIZ and knocked off stride an instant later, saved ground early, and
dropped back three wide coming off the final bend.

advantage upper stretch and finished ridden out while going away. BROADWAY PEGGY was off awkward at the start, raced near the rear and angled
inside to save ground, roused along the rail around the turn, cut the corner then advance up the inside for place. MOON EYES veered out at the start,
chased the pace and raced in range around the turn then got carried wide and lost ground entering top stretch, set down under right handed pressure and
roused forward to take share. SHANGHAI BONNIE briefly vied for the lead the edged back into tracking position, continued along the inside then angled out
leaving the turn, prompted for more and finished evenly. BUDDY'S MEMORY got bumped then steadied at the start, hustled up and raced in contention
between foes near the quarter pole then drifted out wider leaving the turn and evened out. NO SE VENDE was stubborn to load then steadied at the start,
raced off the pace then hustled along six wide upper stretch, shifted out wider mid-stretch and needed more for late impact. AVOCADO TOAST brushed
with rival at the start then lacked early foot, raced wide leaving the backstretch then hustled along three wide near the furlong marker and passed tiring foes.
ALPILLES chased near midpack along the inside through the turn then angled out top stretch and flattened out. SHANGHAI MISTRESS vied for the lead out
of the gate, continued to battle with eventual winner into the turn then tired in the drive. PAPA REGALA raced off the early pace then got carried out very
wide entering top stretch and failed to move on. ZIP IT JESS raced wide off the pace and failed to move into contention. QUEEN KANTHAROS took a solid
