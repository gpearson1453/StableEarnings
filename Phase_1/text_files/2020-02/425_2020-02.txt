Footnotes
REELFOOT broke sharp, allowed the leaders to go early in the three path, advanced to challenge while continuing in the three path midway on the turn,
showed the way into the stretch, edged clear, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. STONEGATE broke out, within striking distance outside,
moved closer four wide in the turn, chased the winner to the wire without making any inroads, clearly second best. RUN AWAY BETT pressed the early
leader in the two path, asked along, vied between rivals and inside the winner through the turn, could not match the top two in the drive, well clear of the
rest. COPPER MOUNTAIN went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. GO FOR JIM moved up to set the early pace inside, continued to be a
pace factor through the turn closest to the rail, gave way in the drive. SEEK N JUSTICE behind the first flight while three wide, roused for the drive, failed to
respond. BREAKERS POINT saved ground to no avail. REVEREND DON last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ALL FACT behind the leaders for a half toward the inside, boxed in late in the turn, steered to the outside for the drive, set down, closed with good energy to
be up in time. MIZ NIGHTCAP vied up front in the three path, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home to be clear, could not contain the
winner, clearly second best. FRIGID off a step slow, raced back, angled out four wide turning for home, rallied for the show, not a threat to the top two.
FAIRLY HONEST raced back, saved some ground in the turn, improved position. ALMYRA pressed the issue while between rivals, vied turn, weakened in
the drive. LOVE TO LEARN went one paced in the three path. WESTERN ATTIRE also turned in an even effort while racing in the two path. SETTLE IT
stumbled badly at the start, fell far back, moved out. KEENE'S DESIRE broke on top, sprinted clear, stopped when headed.

SHE MIGHT TELL unhurried for six furlong while racing in the two path, moved out widest for the drive, closed resolutely to be up in time. BOATHOUSE
VIEW settled off the pace and the inside, advanced into contention three wide turning for home, outside bid a furlong out, led late, caught in the final strides.
BIG BASE off a step slow, raced within striking distance, continued to save some ground into the lane, bid inside the top two, missed the place. CHECK SIX
pressured the early leader from off the inside, challenged, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, could not last. MO'S M V P off slowly, moved
up to prompt the pace in the three path, remained widest of the first flight second turn, gave way in the drive. SUN DRESS broke sharp, set the pace,
faltered when headed. MIMI'S MONEY finished early, fell far back, showed little.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN DON broke sharp, vied early, allowed the leader to go into the turn, rebid late in the bend, drove clear. TRAFFIC CONTROL lacked speed, came
three wide out of the turn when advancing, widest in the drive, finished up willingly to be edging clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. SUNDAY
SERMON vied up front in the early going, shook clear into the turn, offered little resistance to the winner exiting the turn, could not contain the runner,
comfortably saved the show. JIMMIE T off slowly, moved out in the strip, four wide when rallying into the lane, continued to improve position. MR. COUGAR
one paced toward the inside early, came four wide turning for home, went evenly in the drive. BIGGS forwardly placed while racing toward the inside.
MOON IN THE SKY lacked early foot, passed tiring rivals. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR within striking distance in the early going, tired while three wide. INTO
ORBIT saved ground to no avail. A P DANCER void of speed, lacked a response in the drive. FREQUENT TRAVELER was finished early while racing three
wide. UNDEFEATED CHAMP steadily faded.

Footnotes
KISS MORE vied through the first turn while between rivals, dueled the middle half in the two path, continued to contest the issue past midstretch, edged
away late under firm handling. VISUAL MAGIC with the pace from the start, vied through the first turn inside, alternated up front in the run up the
backstretch and through the far turn, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, narrowly gained the nod for the place while remaining along
the rail. PROUDLY PACIFIC in the second flight while between rivals, set down for the drive while three wide, could do little with the winner in the drive,
narrowly missed the place. STRONG FLAG off a bit slow, recovered to race in the second flight toward the inside, not enough for the place in the late going.
PRETTI XTREME settled off the pace, dropped inside to save some ground, had nothing for the drive. SANTA ANA WINDS stumbled at the start, trailed
most of the way in failing to threaten. TIPAZAR bothered, off slowly, second group outside, tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
STRIKE THAT in some early traffic, worked way toward the rail through the turn, challenged up the rail nearing midstretch, drove well cler. COURTING A
KISS dueled up front off the inside, narrowly showed the way into the lane, could not match the winner late, proved determined for the place. BUMP BAILEY
dueled up front closest to the inside, also proved no match for the winner late, outkicked for the place. VICE VERSA forwardly placed off the inside, three
out to four wide late in the turn, lacked a winning kick the final furlong. MAKE NOISE took up early in some traffic, fell back, moved out to race five wide
through the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest down the middle of the track. GOLDEN TIGER last to leave, raced back, improved slightly while
not proving to be a threat. NEXT GEN within striking distance while racing inside, in traffic through the turn, two path into the lane, came up empty when
clear. HIDDEN RULER raced back and outside, four out to five wide late .in the turn, failed to muster a rally. SENOR JOBIM in the second flight off the
inside and between horses, came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
NIGHT OPS lacked speed while well wide into the first turn, continued on the outside onto the backstretch, four then five wide in the second bend when
rallying, took over on the outside inside the furlong grounds, drove clear, held the runner up safe late. SKY PROMISE devoid of early foot while racing off
the inside, swung out widest for the drive, finished with good energy to be closing the gap on the winner late. CHRIS AND DAVE lacked speed while wide,
five wide first turn, continued wide, five path again in the second turn, advanced and challenged when straightened for home, narrowly showed the way past
the furlong marker, could not contain the top two. LOMBO forwardly placed off the inside, fell back in the second turn, went evenly in the drive in picking up
a couple of positions. SHIVERMETIMBERS prompted the pacesetter toward the inside, had little left for the drive. C Z ROCKET in some traffic inside of
traffic in the first turn, continued to save ground, lacked a closing response. PLAINSMAN within striking distance while racing four wide, failed to respond in
the drive. LAUGHING FOX off a bit slow, raced back, was never involved. LENSTAR broke alertly, got clear early, continued to show the way up the
backstretch, gave way when confronted in the drive. CATDADDY settled off the pace and the inside, failed to respond in the drive. THIRSTFORLIFE
remained always back.

strip, raced four wide through most of the turn, steadily getting to the winner late, well clear of the others. SYMPHONY HALL broke with the field, moved up
to prompt the winner off the inside, had little left for that one or the runner up late. MANDY forwardly placed off the inside wide through the turn, three wide
into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. BREEZE RIDER mid pack outside, four wide into the turn, moved in a bit to three wide through most of the
bend, continued in even fashion through the stretch. FIESTA IN VEGAS settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, failed to
respond when called on for the drive. GIRL FROM BERLIN off a step slow, remained always back. DOGWOOD QUEEN failed to menace while racing
toward the inside. MAGINE finished early, trailed home.
