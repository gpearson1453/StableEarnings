Footnotes
MAKE OR BREAK away in good order, settled into path three by the conclusion of the backstretch, was coaxed along keeping an eye on the front runners
during the run around the bend, picked up interest when let out an additional notch at the five-sixteenths pole, closed the gap in a menacingly manner so as
to turn into the lane on near even terms with SUPERBLOODWOFLMOON, with the runner up lurking a danger too further inside, took charge soon
afterwards then drew off smartly down the lane. INDAWIN along the inside route during the opening phases, tipped into the two path after
SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON took up residence there herself early on the backstretch, drafted behind the shoulder of that opponent from the top of the bend
until its end, inched onto the rail and after being taken in hand, proceeded to slip by the soon-to-be former leader entering the lane, ventured onward but
proved to be no match. HARD WON off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from the two path, got sent out five wide from upper to midstretch,
went on to finish a non-threatening third. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON hustled from the gate, established the top in short order, cut over towards the inside,
carved out the pace, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, had the pressure pick up in intensity as three-quarters was being completed from both
sides, succumbed and steadily backed away. GETONMY GOOD SIDE tracked the pace from the inside travelling on the turn, faltered. TOURBILLON ROSE
came away without apparent mishap after breaking open the gate, raced in the two path on the turn, commenced the stretch one wider, was allowed to fade
away lightly urged.

Footnotes
MONEY RIDE got bumped between foes at the start due to pressure from FUTURE BOOK breaking inwards and in turn bumped YES FOR LESS into
CRYPTOGRAPHER in a chain of bumps through to BLUES CITY, vied from the three path early on before seizing sole command near the half mile pole,
tucked to be near the inside at that station, came under light coaxing midway on the turn and began to shake away, spun just off the inside for home, drew
off under a drive to prevail. CRYPTOGRAPHER got bumped at the start by YES FOR LESS due to pressure initiated by FUTURE BOOK and in turn
bumped REJECTED AGAIN into BLUES CITY, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, proved no
match for the top one while along clear for the place honors. REJECTED AGAIN got bumped just after the start by CRYPTOGRAPHER and in turn brushed
BLUES CITY while under hustling taking to the inside, got taken hold of and pulled his way to the front regardless at the nine-sixteenths before being
displaced from command to settle along the inside into the turn just off the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home and weakened. YES FOR LESS bobbled at the break recovering outwards and was bumped back to the inside by MONEY RIDE due to pressure
from FUTURE BOOK and in turn bumped CRYPTOGRAPHER into REJECTED AGAIN before being taken in hand and pinched lightly back, chased four to
five wide down the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact while passing a pair of tired rivals and showing some late interest. BLUES CITY brushed at
the start, grew a bit rank when taken hold of and briefly steadied as the rail closed down and tipped out to the three to four path six furlongs from home,
came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. FUTURE BOOK broke in at the start bumping MONEY
RIDE into YES FOR LESS and commencing a chain of bumps inwards through to BLUES CITY, led early on tucking to the four path and putting a trio of
rivals to the inside briefly in tight near the five furlong marker before being headed for command at the nine-sixteenths, tucked three wide into the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through the latter portion of the bend and went three to four wide for home, then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
JUSTICE OF WAR came in sharply after losing its footing springing from the gate, was corrected after some effort by the pilot but not before making contact
with another in additional to causing some crowding and other bumping that all told involved a total of three opponents, got set up in the three path
proceeding along the backstretch, sat within striking distance of the front runners from the top of the bend until its end, crept up as the second split was
being finalized, responded when cued up a sixteenth down the road, by this juncture stationed in the four path, saw a spirited tussle get ignited with the
second place finisher, was guided inward so as to give the mount a better view of the nemesis with under an eighth to go, battled on with determination and
got the job done. DODGED A BULLET sparred for control two to three wide, was more the latter at the start of the stretch run but soon shifted closer to the
rail, got engaged with the top one, relinquished reluctantly, fought onward but wound up denied. TONY SMALL squeezed in the shadow of the gate, settled
into stride, took up the chase from the two path on the turn, got sent out five to six wide from heading for the three-sixteenths marker, mustered up a mild
kick for the last eighth to grab the show. STATE OF MINE stalked the pace from path two after being bumped shortly after the field had been sent off and
running, swung into the lane, hung around as a forward factor until midstretch then gave way. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT sneaked its way into the pocket at the
half mile pole, slipped back to the outside in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, slithered its way into path five by the three-sixteenths pole only to
appear through by that station, backed away. WISECRACK argued for control from along the inside route to the five-sixteenths pole and faltered. AFLEET
MICKEY checked after being squeezed at the start, saved ground to the quarter pole, launched no bids after going three wide into the lane.

Footnotes
CREATIVE STYLE four to five wide down the backstretch at the tail of the field, tucked three wide at the half mile pole, came under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge inside the final eighth taking command just inside the sixteenth marker,
then edged away to the finish to prevail. JEROME AVENUE broke out a step at the start and was corrected, established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside under pressure from a pair, remained patiently handled through the turn and began to slip away nearing the quarter pole, got set down
spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat from LATER CAT to the outside, got collared by the top one just inside the sixteenth
pole and ran on to secure the place honors. LATER CAT seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide into the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the leader a furlong out, kept on to the finish getting
rebuffed by the runner up while well clear for the show honors. HIZAAM hustled from the gate, prompted the pace two to three wide down the backstretch,
came under coaxing at the half mile pole and was shaken off into the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. SARGEANT DRIVE
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SOMEBODY six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.
DOOLEY coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace from the five paths until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. ROCKIN JO chased two to three wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, went three wide for
home and tired.

Footnotes
QUALITY STONES cut over to the inside route with the advantage in short order, showed the way, well rated for the first half, was sighted still being
confidently ridden as the closest four pursuers were under drives themselves coming up to the quarter pole, stepped into the lane and after being lightly
hand urged herself for a few strides finally got turned loose at the three-sixteenths marker, drew off to a comfortable advantage before being geared down in
the final seventy yards. ELOQUENT SPEAKER attained a prominent position after being roused for almost the entire opening panel, departed the
backstretch from the four path, got set down at the five-sixteenths pole, shifted closer to the rail after entering the stretch, failed to dent into the margin but
won the place. POT OF HUNNY worked its way into the pocket nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, tracked the winner, was being heavily roused by
the five-sixteenths pole, angled out approximately three wide heading onto the stretch, lost out second honors. STEAL MY HEART raced towards the back
of the pack for the opening half, was two wide entering the turn and sent out five wide exiting it, narrowed in to earn the final significant slice of the purse.
CHASING LOSSES stalked the winner from the two path until the end of the bend and gave way. GRAETZ took up the chase from path three, came under
a drive after crossing midpoint on the turn, swung into the lane and folded. HOMERUN HONEY three wide on the turn, never reached a contending position.

Footnotes
AWILLAWAY chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge and take
command just inside the eighth pole, dug in dueling with the runner up to inside the sixteenth marker before gamely inching away near the wire. TROUBLE
FOR SKYLAR broke in at the start brushing with QUIETUDE, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the front a furlong out, came in to look her main rival in the eye dueling to the finish but was ultimately bested and
shaken off in the final jumps. QUIETUDE bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, went five wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. WAILIN JOSIE three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and kept on for the last major share. COLLEGEVILLE GIRL chased two to three wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. CAPE COD DIVA broke in the air at the start getting away last, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung four wide for home and was unable to make an
impact. ELLA'S SONG spurted away on the lead in the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole before being set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive growing leg weary nearing the eighth pole under threat from
flanking challengers, got overhauled inside that station and weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
FREEDOM PRINCE remained in the two path after the field had been released, was between rivals contending for the top during the opening phases, went
at it afterwards matched up with the runner to his outside, came under a ride spinning into the lane as was the nemesis, saw that opponent whittle away at
the deficit in the final furlong but held late to stay in the clear. TRAVELING cut over into the three path after the start, was the outermost of a threesome
disputing the pace for a good portion of the initial half, remained engaged with the top one after entering the turn, got roused heading home, gained late
during the stretch run, but fell short. SPECTATOR SPORT took up the chase from the two path after bumping lightly with QUALITY CHOICE, sat towards
the back of the pack for the first six furlongs, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, went on to secure the show. DANNY CALIFORNIA rated two
wide keeping watch on the contested pace from midpack, failed to fire appreciably when called upon. ESCAPE attained a forward position, was three wide
entering the turn and in the four path leaving it, gave way. QUALITY CHOICE sent over to the rail after brushing with SPECTATOR SPORT, failed to
menace. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT remained along the rail after the start, fought to the inside of two others for the front end for the first half, continued to save
ground on the turn, completed three-quarters and faltered.

MAX PLAYER raced just off the inside shortly after the start and grew a bit rank off heels climbing tipped three wide into the opening turn before settling
midway on that bend in pursuit from mid pack, took to the five path in the clear down the backstretch, tucked four wide half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out,
then edged clear to the finish kept to task. SHOTSKI away a beat slow without incident and was briefly in behind NEW COMMISSION while under coaxing
to be forwardly placed, ranged up three wide through the first turn to poke a head in front seven furlongs from home, showed the way lightly coaxed along in
the two path down the backstretch under some pressure from PRINCE OF PHAROAHS early on and then VANZZY and NEW COMMISSION with five
furlongs to go, tucked to the inside through the far turn coming under further coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
under a drive, dug in coming under threat a furlong out, fended off MONDAY MORNING QB latched on to the outside from that station to the sixteenth
marker when overthrown by the top one, then ran on to hold safe for the place honors. PORTOS just off the inside at the tail of the field through the first turn,
chased four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch
following the eventual winner and kicked on belatedly to just get up for the show honors in the final strides. MONDAY MORNING QB bobbled at the start
then got bumped solidly by MR.SHORTANDSIMPLE who broke outwards, climbed briefly into the first turn while just off the inside facing some kickback
before settling midway, chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch making headway, straightened away rallying to issue a challenge a furlong out getting on near even terms for command, dug in under a
drive and was rebuffed a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the very late stages. NEW COMMISSION along the inside early on, tipped three wide at
the seven-eighths pole nearing the backstretch top chase five wide before advancing to prompt the leader five furlongs from home, tucked four wide through
the turn steadily gaining to stack outside the top pair three furlongs from home put to coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
weakened in the final furlong. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS led early on in the two path before conceding the front to prompt SHOTSKI briefly before giving
chase just off the inside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, retreated through the far turn and went just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired
in the drive. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE bobbled at the start and came outwards bumping MONDAY MORNING QB, chased just off the inside and steadily
lost position to the rail of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home placed to brief coaxing, failed to pick it up, went four wide into upper stretch under no
pressure from the rider and eased through to the finish. VANZZY four wide through the first turn in range of the front, pressed the pace three then two wide,
came under brief coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got placed to a protective hold nearing the quarter pole, went four wide into upper stretch, was eased
through the lane, then got pulled up steps from the finish and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
O SHEA CAN U SEE kept watch on the runaway leader while loosely pocketed, swung into action by swinging three wide into the lane, closed in readily on
the one to catch, snatched away the advantage in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole then held on well to stay in the clear. NUCLEAR CODE was moved over
towards the rail after the start, tracked the pacesetter, spotted at a slight distance from off the inside, came under a drive for the drive home, gained ground,
tipped out late en route for the place. JAVELIN underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, got sent out six wide after departing it, closed the gap down the
center of the strip to get up in time for the show. RALLY CAP spurted off from the competition, showed the way unattended on the front end from just off the
rail, rattled off fraction after fraction unopposed, was traversing through the furlong grounds when switched over to stronger handling, relinquished with
approximately a sixteenth remaining and weakened. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK raced towards the back of the pack, stepped onto the turn from the three
path, completed the run around the bend and was maneuvered to the outside, winding up about seven wide, had some gain after mustering up a mild
response for the last eighth. READYHEARTANDSOUL chased the pace from path two in midpack, angled four wide into the stretch, lacked the needed
response. YOU TELL ME at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, travelled three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch two paths farther
off the inside, backed away. FUN PROSPECT pursued the pacesetter from near the inside for the opening half, got driven seven wide entering the turn, had
no offering. LE GROS BILL broke a length the slowest after hitting the left side of the starting gate, went on to save ground to the quarter pole, got steered
into two path at the head of the stretch to no avail.
