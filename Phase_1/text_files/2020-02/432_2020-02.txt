Footnotes
MACHISMO broke alertly, chased the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly three wide late and got up in the final strides. GRECIAN PRINCE sprinted
to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace and just missed hanging on in the three path. ROLLIN WAY OVER unhurried early, closed with a burst
of speed along the rail through upper stretch and finished determinedly. RULING EMPIRE well placed, altered course from the two to the five path in deep
stretch then finished evenly. GONE TOO SOON slow early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the six path. DOCTOR LEE failed to menace.

Footnotes
IF YOU BELIEVE away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under left handed urging to win as much the best. SECRET TRICK never
far back, moved up three wide on the far turn and finished clearly second best. REBEL LIONESS allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals.
FLYING PHILLIP'S offered a bid two wide after a half, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. LA PAROTA chased the winner near the inside into
the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. HEAD DRESS stalked the early pace and was through after a half. OPTIMISTIC SHOT was outrun and the rider
lost her whip near mid stretch. OUR PRINCESS BELLE was no threat.

TIZ WHAT matched strides for the lead two wide into the stretch then widened the balance of the trip under left handed urging to win as much the best.
PEARLS IN CHARGE stalked the pace from the four path into the stretch, dug in determinedly late and got up for second. SHE'S CRAFTY trailed into the
stretch then was steadily closing ground while drifting out to the middle of the racetrack. TREASURE WILBURNYA unhurried early, finished well along the
rail. SISTER'S CREED battled with the winner along the inside into the stretch then weakened. LIL'PRINCESSNELLIE was no factor. CHECK OUT LINE
was no threat. QUEEN CITY KITTY was through after a half.

Footnotes
SKY VISION always within striking distance, closed determinedly two wide through upper stretch, battled between horses two wide through the final furlong,
the rider lost his whip nearing the wire and proved best under a strong hand ride. TICKETY BOO well placed, loomed boldly along the inside, gained a short
lead late and just missed. JUSTICEINACTION settled near the two path into the stretch,altered course to the eight path and was steadily gaining ground
through the final furlong. RUN MICKEY RUN away alertly, set a pressured pace near the inside into the stretch, drifted out and weakened. MEET ME HALF
WAY trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. STATUS SYMBOL failed to menace. YURUBI chased the
pace two wide into the stretch then faded. MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE was no factor. BLUE COLLAR BABY was outrun. TOAST THE BULLDOGS was no
threat. ADVENTURE LAND with the second flight three wide, faltered in the stretch. SUCH APPEAL was through early.
