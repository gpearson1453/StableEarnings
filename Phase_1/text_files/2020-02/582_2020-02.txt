Footnotes
LUCKY EMBER sprinted clear leaving the chute, angled in, saved ground around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, repelled a challenge in mid stretch
and drew off under brisk urging. MEET MICHELLE , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, angled to the inner rail in mid stretch and rallied. KHALOS
VISION prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened. UNSTOPABULL BELLE saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path turning for home
and failed to menace. COLD HEARTED GAL , outrun, raced along the inner rail around the turn. SMART ENTRY , never a factor, circled the turn three wide
then was fanned to the five path entering the stretch. I AM AINE , two wide on the turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch and fell back.

Footnotes
TWIRLING LIZ , about four wide and well in hand contesting the early pace outside RAGING BLAZE, dropped in a couple paths leaving the far turn,
continued the duel past the three eighths, responded when set down and kicked clear near the three sixteenths, opened up under left handed asking then
continued to widen while solidly hand ridden the final sixteenth. FAIRY WISH stalked the leaders while saving ground, angled three wide into the lane, kept
on with some interest and was clear of the rest. TOMA , unhurried early while saving some ground, came under pressure past the three eighths, angled out
for the drive and could only get past a tired rival. RAGING BLAZE disputed the pace to the inside of TWIRLING LIZ, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole
and gave way through the final furlong.

hand encouragement through the final sixteenth. EDIT AND SIMPLIFY bobbled at the break, recovered and stalked the pace, drifted out from left handed
asking near the three sixteenths, was corrected and kept on willingly to be second best. NOT MY MONEY settled early, advanced towards the inside of

Footnotes
CAUSE I'M EDGY , right to the front, angled in soon after the break, set the pace along the rail, drew off and was under urging in the drive. WARM hit the
inside of her starting gate stall when off awkwardly, steadied soon after that when squeezed back, circled the turn four deep, was floated to the five path in
upper stretch and passed tired horses. THREE HAWK raced three wide around the turn and lacked the necessary late response. LE WEEKEND prompted
the pace two wide around the turn, drifted to the three path in upper stretch and gave way. GRACE ISABELLA raced in the two path between horses on the
turn and weakened. BUNTING hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way through the stretch. TIMELESS TREASURE trailed.

Footnotes
DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN settled off the pace while saving ground, crept closer nearing the lane, shifted out, worked her way between runners leaving mid
stretch, battled to the inside of TWO HOT BETTY through the final seventy yards and just got up under strong handling. TWO HOT BETTY broke a step
slow then was steadied out of close quarters, raced three wide early on, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane, rallied
outside rivals past the furlong grounds, gained a slim lead inside the final sixteenth, dueled outside the winner and just failed to hold. MARIE FROM PARIE
quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, widened two wide when set down in upper stretch, was confronted near the sixteenth marker and
weakened late. FIRTH , bumped at the break, was corrected and edged up outside rivals to gain a stalking spot, was put to a solid ride two wide past the
five sixteenths, raced three wide into the stretch but lacked the needed finish. VANIDOSA dropped back mid turn while removed from the rail then lacked a
solid stretch response. CASTLE RIDGE had speed then rated back off heels while saving ground, gave pursuit mid turn and faded. NANA'S SHOES leaned
in at the break bumping FIRTH, dropped off the pace and failed to menace.

the rail on the turns, angled out in upper stretch and failed to menace. MORTAL STORM chased the pace while two and tired. WAR TWEET bobbled
slightly at the break, was kept three deep down the backstretch and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
SEANY P had speed then eased back off of a dueling pair nearing the half mile marker, rebid three wide between foes mid turn, dueled to the inside of
MICE AND MEN from the quarter pole to mid stretch then drew clear under a steady drive. MICE AND MEN flashed speed then rated back off foes early on,
angled out, bid four deep mid turn, sparred outside the winner, failed to match strides past the eighth pole but kept on gamely to the line. PORT LOUIS was
sent up inside rivals and moved to a short early lead, dueled to mid turn, shifted out after the leaders cleared, chased and faded. CATONSVILLE was sent
up four wide early, dropped in and dueled outside PORT LOUIS into the turn, gained a slim lead near the three eighths, fought on for another sixteenth then
gave way.
