Footnotes
RIO ABAJO opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed close to the inside around the turn, ran out a bit entering the stretch, reopened a clear lead
in midstretch while getting out under left hand whip then held under right hand whip. DREAMING OF LOVE wasn't far back along the rail, swung to the
outside entering the stretch then closed a gap from the outside through the final yards. GOLDEN SPUN LAD chased the winner, gave his best two wide on
the turn then weakened through the final sixteenth. POCOPSON STATION was no factor. FORMER MARINE quickly lost contact and was eased.

Footnotes
DREAMIN N SCHEMIN was caught in the four to three path around the first turn, inched forward down the backstretch to make a four wide bid for the lead
at the five sixteenths pole, reached the front passing the quarter pole, then drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure, and held sway under a vigorous
hand ride. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF saved ground far off the pace around the first turn, advanced to midpack in the three path around the far turn, shifted to
the four path turning for home, and rallied for place. CATAPULT JACK stalked in the five to three path around the first turn, made a three wide bid into the
far turn, took over and forged clear, but was challenged and headed by DREAMIN N SCHEMIN at the quarter pole, then gave way to that foe in upper
stretch while hanging on his left lead. OMENED BY had a slow start, saved ground far off the pace through the first turn, advanced position three wide into
the far turn, sustained his rally and made a bid for the lead in the five path outside of foes at the quarter pole, but flattened out in upper stretch and
weakened. GOTTOASKCHARLIE saved ground from midpack, but to no avail. STILL THE ONE was forwardly place in the five to three path around the first
turn, dueled for the lead along with his inner counterpart down the backstretch as the early leader bolted exiting the first turn, but was surpassed by
CATAPULT JACK into the far turn, failed to keep pace, and weakened thereafter. DEPUTY ZAPPER trailed in the two path around the far turn, took the far
turn in the five path, but never played a factor. BEE KEEPER was forwardly placed inside the leaders while in the two path, inherrited a lead as the leader
bore out into the backstretch, dueled inside of STILL THE ONE, but weakened into the far turn. FIREINTHEPULPIT pulled clear in the four to five path while
being hard to handle around the first turn, bore out into and down the backstretch to the outside fence, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
TWEET KITTEN showed speed from the outset, moved two wide to a clear lead before a half then drew off under brisk urging. BELLOWS was slow early,
improved position along the rail on the turn then was best of the rest in an even effort. NINTH SYMPHONY was bumped by ROGUE PATRIOT leaving the
gate then was bumped into that one soon after, raced four wide outside horses around the turn then tired. CHASING MY HALO raced three wide between
horses and failed to menace. NEGRITO improved position two wide between horses on the turn then flattened out. SPIRITS LEGACY ducked into NINTH
SYMPHONY leaving the gate then was outrun. ROGUE PATRIOT ducked out into NINTH SYMPHONY leaving the gate then was bumped soon after by
that one, briefly showed speed then stopped. ZEUS ODIN broke slowly, was hustled along the rail to gain a clear lead before going a quarter and stopped
after a half. I'M A GENIUS fell far back and was eased up through the stretch.
