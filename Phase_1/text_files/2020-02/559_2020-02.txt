Footnotes
ZOOT SUIT was quick to begin from the outside, built a clear around the far turn and was in hand in the latter stages. HEISAYANKEE stalked the pace,
raced three wide and was no match for the winner. WARRIOR'S LULLABY dropped back early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and showed good
late interest. ROCKETRINGO was hustled along from the inside and weakened through the drive. BLABIMIR was hustled from the outside, raced three
deep in the stretch and had no response. WORLD FAMOUS SAM T raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. MALLORY'S BANDIT was slow
early, angled to the inside around the far turn into the lane and never was a factor. PRIMARILY GOLD showed little. ASTONISHING TWEET was off very
slow and trailed throughout.

dropped back early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and made a good late rally. OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY stalked the pace, raced along the inside
and had no final winning bid. CROSSBOW CIMARRON stalked the pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and had no response. TAYLOR'S PRINCE
dropped back early and failed to have a response. I'M ALL EARS was hustled from the outside, raced three wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor.
NATTYTYME showed little. PATRIOTIC OKIE dropped back early and failed to menace. COUNTRY KING trailed throughout.
