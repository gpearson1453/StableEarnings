early speed, raced outside around the second turn, moved up, but was no threat. CAJUN CARMELIZED raced in the middle of the field in the beginning and

Footnotes
MEDITATE vied for the early lead, raced four wide around the second turn, drove clear deep in the stretch and finished well. HALOS PRAYER dueled for
the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't keep up with MEDITATE late. WHISKEY'S GONE was an early factor, race close throughout
and proved no match for the top two. BLAISING GUITAR raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn seven wide and made a late gain.
CACHITO raced near the middle of the pack, made a mild bid, but was no factor. HE'S AN HONEST MAN raced in the middle of the field and put forth an
even effort. NOT TODAY ALFIE challenged for the early lead and faded. CLEVER LAD always raced near the back and showed little. FIRE MAKERS STAR
raced near the back and was never a threat. VIVINSKY raced in the rear, came around the first turn five wide, pulled up late and walked off. THE JOCKEY
OF #8 WHISKEY'S GONE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #10 MEDITATE FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER
VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

POINTMAN dueled for the early lead, drove clear around the second turn and was kept to the task. FREDDIESLILWILDCAT raced within striking distance,
made a late bid, proved no match for POINTMAN, but held off SECOND GUESS for second. SECOND GUESS raced in the back in the beginning, swung to
the outside around the first turn, moved up, rallied down the stretch and missed second. THUNDER AND RAIN raced evenly near the back in the early part,
came around the final turn on the inside, angled out , made a mild bid, but was no threat. MULTIPLE vied for the early lead, saved ground around the
second turn and weakened. SPEEDY HUNTUR void of early speed, raced wide around the final turn and was never close. OUTRUN flashed brief speed
and made a steady retreat. BLUE HOUDINI challenged on the front end and stopped.

at the start, challenged for the early lead and made a steady retreat. CANYON FIRE raced near the middle of the field and dropped back. TRULY THE ONE

drove clear, saved ground and proved no match for the top two late. MITCH'S PINS vied for the early lead, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick.
