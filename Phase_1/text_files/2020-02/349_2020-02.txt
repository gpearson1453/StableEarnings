Footnotes
WEST SIDER between horses early, stalked off the rail, came three deep into the stretch, bid three wide under left handed urging past the eighth pole to
gain the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and drew clear while under a hold late. CANDY FURY sped to the early lead off the rail, dueled inside, fought
back along the fence in the stretch, drifted out from the whip to bump that one late and came back for second. DOCTRINAIRE came out early and dueled
outside the runner-up, took a short lead into the stretch, battled alongside that rival then between foes a sixteenth out bumped with that one late and was
edged for the place. REPROBATE chased off the rail then outside on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a mild late bid while drifting in.
WESTERN SMOKE bobbled some just after the start, chased off the inside, came three wide into the stretch and did not rally. MASTERING broke slowly,
came off the rail to chase the pace, angled three wide into the stretch and lacked a further response. Due to a timer malfunction times are unavailable.

Footnotes
TIGER DAD sped to the early lead, angled in and set the pace inside, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and drew off under a brisk hand ride. IT'S TIZ
TIME chased outside then off the rail, angled in leaving the turn, found the fence in the stretch and gained the place. CITY RAGE stalked just off the rail,
came out four wide into the stretch and was edged for second. SOLDIER BOY had a shoe repaired in the paddock, broke a step slowly, saved ground
stalking the pace, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and weakened late. MAKE IT A TRIPLE close up stalking the winner between horses to the stretch,
lacked the necessary response. HECK YEAH stalked between horses then three deep on the turn and into the stretch and weakened. STREET VISION was
in a good position stalking the pace four wide then outside a rival on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and also weakened.

RSTARS AND STRIPES broke in a bit, had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away leaving the turn and drew off in the stretch under a steady
hand ride and a long hold late. AWESOME ALESSANDRA dueled three deep then stalked outside a rival leaving the turn, drifted in through the final furlong
and was clearly second best. SMART GIRL had speed between horses to duel for the lead, stalked just off the rail leaving the turn and bested the others.
LA CROIX saved ground stalking the pace, came a bit off the rail in the stretch then drifted in late and weakened. REDS TRIBAL HEART broke a bit slowly,
settled off the rail, angled to the inside on the turn, came out in the stretch and did not rally. EXCESS COIL stalked between horses then outside a rival on
the turn and weakened. SONGBIRD EYDIE broke in a bit, stalked three deep, dropped back and angled in some leaving the turn, gave way and was eased
in the stretch.
