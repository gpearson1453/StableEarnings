Footnotes
CAMPARI moved up two wide between horses entering the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch, took command in upper stretch, drew out
under steady handling and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. LAST CHUKKER saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, lacked room in upper stretch,
altered course to the four path near the eighth pole and passed tired foes. ALL CLEAR came in on TAPITONTHESIDE leaving the starting gate, gained a
short lead between horses near the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. MCLEAN HOUSE swung to the four path leaving the turn and failed to rally.
BLUE DANUBE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and gave way. TAPITONTHESIDE , bumped leaving the starting gate, steadied when
attempting to get out leaving the backstretch and failed to be a factor. I GOT THE BRAHMS , four deep chasing the pace down the backstretch, faltered on
the turn.

Footnotes
CREATIVE ALIBI edged up inside early then was shuffled back when attempting to lodge a rail bid leaving the half mile marker, regrouped and came back
while saving ground past the five sixteenths, angled out soon into the lane, wandered outward under left handed pressure near mid stretch and lightly
brushed with MY LILA, was corrected and bid bid between runners to take command a sixteenth out, kicked clear under right handed rousing and continued
eagerly through the line. MY LILA had speed then eased back off the leaders leaving the five eighths marker, moved up between foes leaving the three
eighths, angled out and circled five wide into the stretch, drifted out and was brushed by the winner when advancing in mid stretch, straightened and kept on
willingly though second best. SMOKING BABY broke a step slow, was sent up between rivals soon after and took command, set the pace in about the two
path, handled outside pressure past the five sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch, was taken on leaving mid stretch and faded late. RAPIDASHQUEEN
prompted the pace three wide, bid outside the leader early turn, pressed, steadied when in close near the three sixteenths and gave way. MICRO
MARGARITA , four to five wide, was not a factor. TIZ INCLUDED lacked speed while saving some ground, eased out in the drive but lacked a bid. OUR
REVEILLE , four wide with early pursuit, dropped back past the five sixteenths, came six wide for the drive and continued a fade. TORIA , four wide forcing
the early issue, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and retreated. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of MY LILA, CREATIVE
ALIBI was disqualified from first and placed second.

CALYPSO GHOST , unhurried behind horses down the backstretch and on the turn, swung to the six path leaving the bend, closed outside horses and was
up late. WIN THEN GRIN , five wide entering the stretch, advanced in hand to the eighth pole, was put to the whip near the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly. EVADE stalked the pace, was well placed three wide leaving the turn and flattened out between horses. VICS COOL CAT hugged the inner rail
disputing the pace, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and faded late. PRINCESS ANNE , four wide on the turn, lacked the needed response. OLIVE'S
BUMPA disputed the pace two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
TRY FLYING was nudged along tracking a contested pace, angled four wide and responded when set down into the lane, forged clear past the three
sixteenths then held firm under solid drive. SAVVY STREET settled in the clear, took closer order mid turn while following the winner, angled five wide into
the stretch, ranged up near mid stretch, kept on willingly but was second best. EVEN THUNDER dueled to the inside of CELTIC TREASURE, gained a slim
lead in about the two path after a half mile, continued the scrum around the turn, briefly went clear in upper stretch, failed to resist his entry mate and
weakened in the final sixteenth. MONKEY'S MEDAL , sluggish from the gate, moved up outside rivals heading to the far turn, circled five wide but lacked a
solid kick. CELTIC TREASURE vied outside EVEN THUNDER while holding an early lead, ceded command after a half mile, kept up the pace fight to upper
stretch then succumbed through the final three sixteenths. EARNED IT lacked speed, raced between runners nearing the turn and failed to respond.
PUMPKIN STAR saved ground and faded.

urging and raced a bit erratically the final sixteenth of a mile. TRADING CENTS hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and rallied.
IAM A DANCER lacked speed, swung to the seven path turning for home, remained on her left lead and passed tired froes. HOLIDAY HOPES saved
ground on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch and weakened. LINE OF ROSES , a forward factor in the two path around the turn,
weakened through the stretch. ESTRELLA GRANDE chsaed the pace outside horses around the turn, was five wide entering the stretch and gave way.
PERFECT PARTY GIRL set the pace along the inner rail and tired in mid stretch. MAJORIE MUGS , four wide on the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
EXPECT TALK stalked the pace off the inside, eased out and moved up four wide into the lane, bid outside rivals nearing the eighth pole, dueled briefly to
the outside of BROADWAY TROUPER and edged away under a drive. BROADWAY TROUPER vied inside, took over past the three sixteenths, dug in
when confronted in mid stretch, battled with EXPECT TALK past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. VARIANCE saved ground, moved up nearing
mid stretch, continued on with some interest and gained the show. FANCY GIRL rushed up between runners in the opening sixteenth and gained a short
lead, handled inside pressure into and around the turn, ceded the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. PERSONAL SERVER was
squeezed back soon after the break, lagged back around the turn, angled out and had belated action. FOUR LADY , off the pace while saving ground,
moved up towards the rail leaving mid stretch, eased out but failed to seriously sustain. BUDDHA KAI , off the pace, raced between runners into the stretch
but failed to menace. HONORABLE PROFIT broke a step slow, rushed up four wide and gained a stalking spot nearing the half mile pole, failed to kick on
leaving the five sixteenths and gave way. NOT INTERESTED , well out in the track nearing the turn, faltered.

MICE AND MEN , three wide entering the stretch, angled to the two path in upper stretch, bid for the lead inside I'MTHETAPITNOW near the sixteenth pole
and determinedly prevailed. I'MTHETAPITNOW , two wide on the turn stalking the pace, took the lead approaching the stretch, drifted wide in upper stretch,
drifted in near the sixteenth pole and failed to hold off the winner. CAPE LOOKOUT , two wide between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper
stretch and flattened out. FORT ROYAL saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and failed to rally. NAUTICAL NATURE sped to the
early lead, hugged the inner rail and weakened through the stretch. BAPTIZE THE BOY circled the turn, was four deep approaching the stretch and was not
a factor.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED OUTLAW sped clear early, set the pace in about the two path, edged away into the lane, kept on under right handed rousing and held sway
late. SUPER BUDDY drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and raced off the early pace while removed from the rail, gathered some
steam past the five sixteenths, angled five wide into the stretch, rallied between rivals and got the bob for second. FIFTY came out at the break and bumped
with FINBAR, dropped off the pace, raced three wide into the stretch, angled out, rallied between runners and just missed the place. JONATHAN MCD
stalked the pace, moved up three wide between rivals nearing the lane, drifted in when emerging as the closest pursuer in mid stretch, angled back out late
and kept trying. IWISHIWASPECIAL chased the pace, circled four wide into the lane, advanced between horses in the final furlong but was out finished late.
SMOKIN HOT FACTOR , bumped and in tight at the break, recovered and settled off the inside, circled six wide into the stretch and closed steadily. TOP
CZAR saved ground stalking the early pace, checked near the turn, regrouped to pursue along the inside, remained close to the three sixteenths then faded.
FINBAR , bumped at the break, was not a factor. FRENCH'S QUEST prompted the pace three wide, moved up a bit to loom past the three eighths, saw the
winner kick away nearing the lane, failed to go on under pressure soon into the lane and weakened. WILL MUNNINGS bobbled at the break, raced five
deep early while flashing some speed, failed to keep pace leaving the far turn and dropped back. An objection by the rider of SMOKIN HOT FACTOR
against SUPER BUDDY for alleged interference at the start was not allowed. Also, an objection by the rider of TOP CZAR against JONATHAN MCD for
alleged interference nearing the turn was not allowed.
