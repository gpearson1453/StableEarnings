Footnotes
SHANGHAISWEETHEART took command early, rated along removed from the rail, and faced no challenges through the stretch while shown the whip and
hand urged. IT'S A LOVELY DAY chased outside the winner from the start, came under a ride near the five-sixteenths in the three-path, could not cut into
the margin and ran on evenly to hold the place. MIA ANGELINA advanced mildly five wide on the turn, and finished evenly outside. KAUFY FUTURES
raced well back toward the inside to the stretch, and passed tired horses in the two-path. PASS IT ON put in an early move on the far outside, but flattened
out four wide approaching the stretch. MADELYN'S DANCER came four wide off the turn, and made no headway. DUDE'S SECRET raced forwardly
between horses early, and gave way three wide on the turn. GAROTA was in the four-path between horses heading to the turn, moved inward to wind up on
the rail into the stretch, and dropped far back while being eased up. DILLON'S KITTY showed brief speed inside, angled wide off the turn dropping far back,
and was eased up to the finish.

Footnotes
EDGE OF FIRE raced four wide in range then switched in a couple paths and positioned a bit tight near the half mile marker, settled patiently around the
turn then confidently handled entering top stretch, tapped on the shoulder and shook the reins near the furlong marker, assumed command with ease and
coasted home. TAPI FROST was positioned as a sharp factor sitting off the top pair in early stages, moved up three wide to challenge for the lead at the
quarter pole, vied into stretch run and held a slim lead at the furlong marker then failed to be a match when the winner moved by. SPEEDY MACK lacked
early kick and raced in the back, was put to a drive five wide in stretch run and edged up closer. DREAM D'ORO vied for the lead in opening stages with
LIVING VICARIOUSLY, continued to duel into the turn then took on the challenge from TAPI FROST at the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch then
gave way. AJHAR was off a step slow at the start then quickly advanced along the rail, continued in contention and saved ground around the turn then failed
to sustain bid in stretch run. CONFORMITY raced along the outside off the early pace, urged around the turn then raced widest in the lane and lacked a
needed rally. LIVING VICARIOUSLY vied for the lead in opening stages, continued to battle around the turn the tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE MOLLY took control leaving the chute, rated along inside through a fairly sharp pace, widened the advantage approaching the stretch, and was
hand urged through the last eighth of a mile. JUST A BIT SASSY raced three then four wide around the turn, and rallied mildly to be clearly second best.
YOLANDA'S PRIDE chased outside the winner to the stretch, and weakened while able to salvage the show. INTEREST raced four wide and was never in
the hunt. GLORIOUS GAL broke outward several paths at the start, stayed in range early, and faded steadily inside after six furlongs. REGGAE
REVOLUTION chased outside the leaders three wide, and was finished after six furlongs. AFROLINA stopped after a half-mile, was pulled up in the stretch,
and walked off.

Footnotes
FEARLESS hustled up out of the gate and angled in to race two wide around the first turn, applied pace pressure to MANICOMIO down the backstretch,
briefly matched strides with rival then took command near the three eighths pole, was put to a drive upper stretch, drew off from the field then finished
wrapped up. WINKING AT THEDUDE raced five to six wide off the early pace, launched a bid late backstretch and circled up closer around the far turn, was
no match for pulling away winner in stretch run but stayed on with response and gained second best. MANICOMIO held a slim lead around the first turn, set
a pressured pace along the rail down the backstretch, got collared for the lead by eventual winner around the far turn, kept under a ride along the inside and
stayed on for share. KID BOURBON was allowed to settle not far off the early pace, prompted near the half mile marker, advanced into closer contention on
the far turn then failed to sustain bid and gave way in the lane. GUMP raced in range through early stages, prompted near the half mile marker, responded
briefly then weakened. GRAY BEAU was off a step slow at the start, raced wide and reserved down the backstretch, stayed outside and failed to move into
contention. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN raced near mid-pack along the outside down the backstretch, began to launch a bid for the top pair entering the far
turn but came up empty and retreated. DONJI was forwardly placed while ridden along to maintain tempo then retreated after the half and ease up in the
lane.

Footnotes
IDENTIFIER tracked the leaders inside for six furlongs, moved out advancing to contention under a drive past the midway point of the far turn, collared
EKHTIBAAR from outside at the top of the stretch, had the rider briefly fumble with the whip while switching right-handed, and prevailed even as the rider
put the whip away through the closing stages. EKHTIBAAR got off to a flat-footed start and was last to begin, looped the field five wide intent on getting the
lead around the first turn, gained command before completing a quarter-mile and moved inside setting a brisk pace, shook off ARMISTICE DAY late on the
far turn, was set upon by IDENTIFIER at the top of the stretch, fought gamely on the rail but was edged to the finish. ARMISTICE DAY crept closer three
wide heading into the far turn, loomed menacingly outside EKHTIBAAR after six furlongs, could not sustain the bid and weakened through the drive.
VETTORI KIN (BRZ) chased outside the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved inside on the far turn and faltered after six furlongs. BASHA raced four wide
throughout, and dropped far back approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
TONALIST'S SHAPE raced in tracking position along the outside down the backstretch, let out a notch and raced in aim for the lead around the turn,
responded under right-handed pressure top of the lane, took command from COMPENSATE then pulled away and finished wrapped up. STREET OF
DREAMS raced in close range of the leader to the far turn, vied two wide for the lead between foes around the turn, was no match for winner upper stretch
but stayed on with response for place. NIKKI AND PAPA ducked in at the start and trailed the field down the backstretch, moved into closer contention
around the turn, came out briefly upper stretch then shifted back to the inside and stayed on with interest to edge foe for show. FUJAIRAH raced in early
contention and chased along the rail, roused for more entering the turn then shifted to the outside turning for home, kept under a ride four to five wide in the
lane and got edged late for show. COMPENSATE quickly cleared on top and set the pace down the backstretch, challenged entering the turn and vied for
the lead, dug in and held a slight advantage top of the lane then got collared by the winner and faded. NEW DAY DAWNING raced in range of the second
flight going by the half mile marker then had no response when called upon and dropped back.

Footnotes
PALM SPRINGS vied widest of a foursome up the backstretch, took over outside KING KHOZAN and cleared inside soon after completing after six furlongs,
was under an all-out drive through the lane and just held on. MISTER CANDY RIDE broke slowly and had ALFATEI cross over in front of him, lagged far
back early, advanced to contention with a big move two then three wide around the turn, rallied through most of the stretch on the wrong lead, then switched
over several strides before the wire and just missed. AWAKENED broke slowly along with the eventual runner-up, began to find stride around the turn in the
two-path, closed with good energy well clear of the others and galloped out well. BEAR ALLEY bumped lightly with KING KHOZAN at the start, stayed in
range early, lost ground to the leaders three wide on the turn, then ran on with good courage to earn a minor share. SIR KAHN argued the early pace three
wide between horses, and weakened around the turn. KING KHOZAN bumped lightly with BEAR ALLEY at the start, vied inside three rivals up the
backstretch, fought on inside PALM SPRINGS around the turn, but gave way after six furlongs. ROGUE ELEMENT was up with the leaders before backing
off leaving the chute, and was finished soon after going a half-mile. MAURO'S TEAM races widest up the backstretch, and dropped well back in the
four-path around the turn. ALFATEI broke inward, vied up front between horses in the two-path for a half-mile, and was finished around the turn.

Footnotes
CHEERMEISTER quickly cleared on top and shifted in entering the first turn, set the uncontested pace under a snug hold down the backstretch, let out a
notch and held firm over challenger's around the far turn, put to a drive upper stretch, kept sharp in response along the rail and prevailed under a driving
finish. MICHELINE was unhurried out of the gate and angled inside to saved ground on the first turn, remained in the back under slight restraint through
early stages, prompted near the quarter pole then hit traffic top stretch, altered course near the furlong marker then finished willingly. IVYETSU veered out
at the start then rated off the early pace, advanced into closer contention and raced four wide late far turn, swung out into stretch run, continued a bid with
solid response but could not catch the winner then got edged late for place. SHE'S MY TYPE (FR) settled along the inside through early stages, continued
patiently handled around the far turn, switched out and put under a drive top stretch, remained a strong contender then ran on evenly in final sixteenth.
MORAL REASONING broke out at the start then raced in tracking mode down the backstretch, gradually edged up closer and raced three wide off top pair
at the quarter pole, hustled along into stretch run, remained forwardly in contention then flattened out. RELUCTANT BRIDE settled off the early pace and
saved ground to the far turn, roused to advance near the three eighths pole, continued in the mix under steady pressure but needed more for late impact.
MOANA'S TALE was the closest pursuer off the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for command around the far turn, failed to
advance on the leader then gave way in the lane. This race was hand timed.

MISCHEVIOUS ALEX bumped with UNTITLED at the start, recovered to a forward position, held his spot at the rail contesting the pace inside FLASH PASS
and SHIVAREE into the turn, disposed of those two still going comfortably past the quarter-pole, shifted to the two-path getting set down through the furlong
grounds, drew well clear switching leads several times and was geared down late. SHIVAREE vied for early command three wide between horses, got
shaken off by the winner turning for home, and ran on with good courage outside foes to hold second. GREEN LIGHT GO was outsprinted early, took the
turn three then two wide, moved to the rail after straightening away for the drive, was late changing leads and finished evenly. UNTITLED got bumped by
FLASH PASS at the break, then was ping-ponged between that one and the eventual winner, went to the turn bottled up behind the leaders, was roused in
earnest three wide past the three-eighths without much of a response, and ran on evenly late between horses. NECKER ISLAND raced four then five wide
around the turn, and could not keep pace with the leaders after a half-mile. INTER MIAMI was forwardly placed early four wide, but faded before going a
half. POINT WINNER showed little far back throughout. FLASH PASS broke in bumping with UNTITLED a couple times, vied between that one and
SHIVAREE into the turn, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
FIELD PASS secured inside position around the first turn then settled nicely near mid-range, switched out a path and remained in range around the far turn
then headed in pursuit for the lead, steadily edged up closer then dug in gamely between foes nearing the wire and got up in time. GET SMOKIN was keyed
up around the first turn and took over the lead, set the pace under a snug hold while saving ground down the backstretch, held firm over challenger's around
the final turn, dug in gamely on top near the furlong marker, continued on top under pressure deep stretch then got caught in final strides. SOUTH BEND
stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch then launched a two wide bid around the far turn, remained in steady pursuit into stretch run, inched up closer
in final stages and got edged out for the win. MYAMANOI raced in the back three to four wide, swung wide into upper stretch, set down seven wide for the
drive and rallied late. FAMISHED was allowed to settle in early stages and raced near the inside, prompted at three eighths pole and coaxed five wide into
the lane, raced in range but needed more for serious impact. MR. KRINGLE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the top trio down the backstretch,
launched a three wide bid and gained closer contention around the far turn, continued in pursuit under steady pressure then lacked late kick. SPRAWL
raced off the early pace, briefly dropped to the inside late far turn then shifted back out and put to a drive upper stretch but lacked a needed rally.
HOMELAND was unhurried, saved ground down the backstretch, prompted around the far turn then gave way in the lane. DOMINATE THEMOMENT broke
alertly and led the way into the first turn then conceded position to GET SMOKIN, secured inside position and stalked the pace down the backstretch, lacked
kick around the far turn then gave way. PERUVIAN BOY rated near mid-range down the backstretch then failed to move on when called upon in the far turn.
This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
TIZ THE LAW broke to the lead in the three-path, moved inside getting wrangled back midway on the first turn, steadied along losing more position going by
the six-furlong pole, moved out for clear sailing and began to get rolling into the far turn, tackled ETE INDIAN from outside and gained command after six
furlongs, lugged in while clear in the stretch and was kept busy to the finish. ETE INDIEN broke out brushing CLEAR DESTINATION at the start, went into
the first turn four wide, came away with the lead before completing the first quarter-mile and began moving inward, rated along getting clear from
RELENTLESS DANCER after a half-mile, dug in as TIZ THE LAW ranged up but could not go with that one turning for home, and ran on with good courage
much best of the others. TOLEDO saved ground in range early, shifted out three wide being asked around the far turn, could not stay with the leaders but
ran on well enough for a share. RELENTLESS DANCER got brushed and pushed out by CLEAR DESTINATION at the start, went into the first turn in the
five-path near the lead, pressed ETE INDIEN from outside up the backstretch, but gave way after six furlongs. MAYBERRY DEPUTY was slow away from
the gate, trailed for six furlongs and did not make his presence felt. UNCORK THE BOTTLE went along in the second flight early, was four wide into the far
turn and faltered after six furlongs. CLEAR DESTINATION broke outward, and was pushed out further brushing with RELENTLESS DANCER, stayed close
early three wide, moved inside coming under a ride into the far turn, had nothing to offer and was eased up through the lane.

ROBINTAKINCHARGE raced in range while tracking the pace to the far turn, launched a four wide bid at the quarter pole, seized command leaving the turn
then widened to a clear advantage and held firm under a driving finish. KINGSVILLE raced in range along the inside, was patiently handled just off the top
trio around the far turn, moved outside and put to a drive top stretch, advanced closer four deep at the furlong marker then shifted in, could not reach the
winner but finished clearly second best. DOCTOR D J was unhurried and saved ground through early stages, roused left handed and shifted out top stretch,
raced five to six wide and secured share. GINS AND TINS was forwardly placed down the backstretch, vied for the lead racing three deep around the turn,
was no match for winner turning for home, kept along in pursuit upper stretch then gave way. STATE OF WAR vied for the lead out of the chute, continued
to duel down the backstretch and around the far turn then had nothing left in the lane. APPEALING BRIEFS raced five wide off the early pace, hustled along
three to four wide into upper stretch and failed to move into contention. BLUESKY KITTEN raced two wide off the pace, was under a drive three wide upper
stretch but failed to respond. DOCTOR DUB vied for the lead out of the chute, continued to battle down the backstretch and around the far turn then came
up empty in the lane. AMERICA'S SIMMARD was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back along the outside and failed to respond.
