MOONLIGHT NOW prompted the leader five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling with CLEVER FELLOW coming outwards under a near sided stick to brush his
main danger a furlong from home, got leaned on by his main rival from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker before briefly getting some separation, then
got bumped strides from the finish while gamely keeping a head in front to the wire. CLEVER FELLOW six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
four wide through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch taking over narrow command, dug in head
to head and was brushed by the aforementioned foe coming outwards under a near sided stick, got placed to an off sided stick and came inwards leaning
on his larger sized main danger from the eighth pole through to the sixteenth marker, continued under an off sided stick trading a bump nearing the finish
while battling gamely but was ultimately bested on the line. DANCERS FOR TOKEN five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the
half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to be along well clear of the rest for the
show honors. KINGFISH bumped at the start by FAST GORDON due to pressure from FREEDOM AND WHISKY, chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the half mile pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. FAST GORDON got bumped at the start by
FREEDOM AND WHISKY and in turn bumped KINGFISH, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, went five wide into upper
stretch and tired. MY PRIMO showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from MOONLIGHT NOW to the outside, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths now threatened by a pair, dug in inside those rivals yielding command near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
shaken off and tired. FREEDOM AND WHISKY broke inwards brushing the near side stall before bumping FAST GORDON into KINGFISH, chased just off
the inside growing detached at the tail of the field and trailed. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of
CLEVER FELLOW alleging interference against MOONLIGHT NOW in the stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to
stand prior to the race being declared official. Please note that due to a technical issue with teletimer, all times were hand timed.

Footnotes
GYPSY JANIE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes in a bit
tight and split those rivals to take command a furlong from home, dug in and held safe to the finish to prevail. SLIMEY six to seven paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to stack outside the top pair a furlong out, threatened through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE broke
open the stall door prior to the start, broke on top and showed the way in hand three then two wide, came under pressure for the initial time nearing the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, weakened in the late stages while
along for the show honors. POSSE NEEDED chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before darting to the inside at the half mile pole, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NEW YEAR'S WISH tossed her head at the start to
the off side and got away awkwardly and slow conceding four to five lengths to the front, advanced along the two path to be forwardly placed into the turn
and tucked to the rail, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole while losing position, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. Due to a technical
issue with teletimer all times were hand timed.

Footnotes
IMPUNITY got bumped askew just after the start due to pressure from HUDSON OVERPASS coming inwards after a slight bobble, chased three then two
wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, then
went clear to the finish getting geared down in the final jumps. KADENS COURAGE dueled four then three wide with HUDSON OVERPASS to his inside,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, took over sole command at the three-sixteenths, dug in and was headed a furlong
out, proved no match for the top one through the final eighth while keeping on to safely preserve the place honors. JUSTICE OF WAR chased four then
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. PRINCIPAL DANCER
broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. CAUSE OF ACTION got bumped after the start by CHARGE AHEAD due to pressure from
HUDSON OVERPASS and in turn bumped CAUSE OF ACTION, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into
upper stretch and tired. HUDSON OVERPASS bobbled slightly at the break and recovered inwards bumping CHARGE AHEAD into CAUSE OF ACTION
and in turn IMPUNITY, dueled from the two path with KADENS COURAGE to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. CHARGE AHEAD broke a half a beat slow then got bumped into CAUSE OF ACTION,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered. Due to a technical difficulty with
teletimer, all times were hand timed.

Footnotes
NASTY AFFAIR six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away and rallied to stack among the field coming together at the eighth pole, emerged with the lead
nearing the sixteenth marker, came in slightly at that juncture, dug in and held sway to prevail at the end. FIRST DAWN four then three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to be the outermost of the field stacked across the track at the eighth
pole, dug in through to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the finish. SMILES FROM SADIE three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, angled to the inside at the three-sixteenths and rallied up the rail to be the innermost of the sextet heads
apart a furlong out, ran on to secure the show honors. INTOXICOLOGIST pressed the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing between foes at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, poked a head in front under challenge from the entire field a furlong out, yielded inside that station and weakened
in the late stages. PETALITE showed the way in hand from the two path down the backstretch under some pressure from the aforementioned foe, tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under increased pressure from a pair through the turn getting placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cornered just
off the inside into upper stretch, dug in prominent between foes to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. CAUSIN' TROUBLE five wide in aim of
the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to prompt the top pair from the outside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart a furlong out, got briefly taken in hand as NASTY AFFAIR came inwards
while clearing outside and weakened in the late stages. Due to a teletimer technical issue, all times were hand timed.

COMBAT RIBBON broke in at the start bumping LUCKY E in tandem with TIPAZO, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five to six
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to roll by the leg
weary leader seventy yards from home inching away to the finish at the end. TIPAZO broke out at the start bumping LUCKY E in concert with the
aforementioned foe, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive rallying willingly
through the stretch to secure the place honors on the wire. CARTERS GOT SASS showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning four
wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in growing leg weary and was overhauled with seventy yards to the finish and just
preserved the show honors at the end. JUDITHS COUGAR four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for
home, kept on to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages. MACHO BOY chased three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away, dug in keeping on to the end but was outfinished in the
late going. ONESHOTATFOREVER hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. LUCKY E got bumped at the start by rivals who each broke his way and was pinched, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went three wide for home and tired. TUXEDO SUNDAY off to a hesitant beginning, chased along
the inside throughout and was unable to make an impact. Due to a teletimer technical issue, all times were hand timed.
