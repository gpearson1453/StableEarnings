Footnotes
LEXI EM bumped with a rival at the start then went to the front, set the clear pace, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn, responded
well when asked near the three-sixteenths then drew off, was put to a left-handed whip while well clear at the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed
whip with the lead diminishing coming to the sixteenth-pole and held determinedly under strong urging. SPACE COWGIRL settled off the pace, went three
wide early on the turn then moved to the four to five path while roused, was driven six wide into the stretch, passed foes on the outside under a right-handed
whip, switched to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, went back to a right-handed whip while gaining into the final sixteenth and closed well to just
miss while clear for the place. SANDY'S WAGER broke out and bumped with a foe, was hard ridden towards the rear, raced inside to the two path on the
turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out while gaining outside the sixteenth-pole then steadied briefly when TIZ DARBY drifted out,
was placed on a straight course into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy for the show. TIZ DARBY brushed with a foe at the start, tracked the
pace on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, was asked inside the three-eighths, chased under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. INTERSLEW settled in a good position off the pace, dropped back while
inside to the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SARAH ANN'S POINTE broke out but was corrected
very quickly, settled towards the rear, went four wide early on the turn then moved to the five to six path under urging, floated seven wide into the stretch,
was carried out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. FLOATIE came out just after the start and bumped solidly with an opponent, settled at the back
on the outside, moved in near the half-mile pole, was urged along while three wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and was no factor.
EMERY'S DREAM was bumped solidly shortly after the start, raced up close on the outside, chased three to four wide on the turn, dropped back under a
drive in upper stretch, was carried out while out of contention outside the sixteenth-pole and capitulated. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WAS

DRAGON DRAGON settled off the pace racing outside in the four then the three path into the first turn, was allowed to go late up the backstretch advancing
outside foes four wide heading into the far turn, continued four abreast on that bend with aim on the leader at the top of the stretch, got up late under steady
handling. BLAZING HERO broke just a half-step slowly and was brushed, was taken up briefly a few strides out of the gate as she lost her path, tucked in
heading to the first turn saving ground on the rail through that bend but coming out just a bit leaving it, continued to race well toward the rear up the
backstretch but advancing inside foes, continued to save ground on or just off the rail through the far turn, moved out four wide coming to the
three-sixteenths then out a further path near the furlong marker, was under urging to just get up for the place over LEMON DROP TWIST, who broke on top
and moved to the lead dictating terms mostly in the two path while at times racing nearer the rail through the first turn and up the backstretch, faced
moderate pressure midway up the backstretch but regained a clear advantage into the far turn going in the two path on that bend, was challenged in
mid-stretch, lugged out a little bit late and was outkicked for place. COLOR FASHIONED raced along the rail into the first turn moving out a path entering
that bend while just of the leading pair, continued to track along the rail early up the backstretch before switching out a path midway up the straight, was
encouraged along past the three-eighths pole going in the two then three path on the far turn, was in behind a drifting rival in late stretch and began to drift
out herself and was allowed to go out but failed to threaten. HOLDONAMINIT broke outwardly brushing a rival, raced in the three path on the first turn
mid-pack and not too far off the leaders, dropped back between foes up the backstretch, continued in about the four path on the far turn and offered no late
bid. PROUDMONEY pursued the leader from outside in the three to four path early, applied brief pressure up the backstretch, was done by the
three-eighths and dropped back in the three to four path, was eased in the lane, crossed the wire and walked off. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO

Footnotes
ZURLIN saved ground while rated just off the pace, was given her cue coming to the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied through a clear
opening on the rail to take over outside the eighth-pole, kicked clear into the final furlong and prevailed under strong handling. GOLDEN LOCH dropped
back early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn, gained into upper
stretch, lacking room behind horses at the three-sixteenths then paused while waiting for clear pace, altered out path outside the furlong marker and finished
with good courage for the place. CHAMPAGNE DIET went around the first turn in the three path, was rated just off the pace on the outside, went three wide
on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, floated five wide into the stretch, came under a left-handed whip before the three-sixteenths and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. FINE ONE WON moved in while going to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, set the pace
through moderate fractions, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked a bit at the five-sixteenths then put to stronger encouragement nearing the
quarter-pole, came under the whip in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner outside the furlong marker and gave way. TWIRLING FAITH switched to the
outside of the pacesetter near the wire for the first time, went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, was let out in the three
path on the far turn then roused inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and had nothing left.

Footnotes
MAGEEZ was just a hair fractious in the gate, urged at the break but lacking speed, shifted in up the backstretch trailing the field in the two path into the
turn, moved out to the four path by the five-sixteenths, continued to swing six wide coming into upper stretch, was thereupon put to a drive, gained steadily
while receiving intermittent left-handed encouragement and despite drifting in just a bit late and got up near the wire. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG was soon to
lead racing inside and with outside pressure, edged just clear of foes leaving the turn and extended the margin in upper stretch but was caught late.
YANKEE SEVEN raced last but one off the inside going in the three path through the turn and shifting five wide coming into the stretch, gained mildly
through upper to mid-stretch but was no match for the top pair while clearly best of the rest. FLASHY BREW stalked from outside rivals going three wide into
and on the turn, was still within striking distance in upper stretch but weakened thereafter. RECKLESS RANSOM pressed the pace two wide and between
rivals into the turn, lost some ground on the leader leaving that bend dropping back in mid-stretch and posing no late threat. INSPECTOR EDDIE tucked in
behind the leading trio about midway up the backstretch chasing those foes into the turn, saved ground inside on the turn before moving out in upper stretch
and was never near enough to threaten. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
EARLY MISCHIEF was moved inwards after the break trying to make the inside while just clear, dictated terms up the backstretch going on or just off the
rail through the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch under vigorous hand urging then again when put to a left-handed whip but had enough in reserve to
edge clear past the furlong marker and was given just hand urging late. OMEGA MOON was forced into the inside rival at the start, recovered to pursue the
aforementioned winner three wide through the turn, drifted about throughout the stretch under left- then right-handed urging and no match for the winner.
TWELFTH LABOUR bumped with the inside foe then was bumped into that rival by the outside foe at the start, stalked the pace from outside up the
backstretch going four wide on the turn, was asked for more about the five-sixteenths but could make no headway in the stretch. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL
was taken back past the five and a half allowing the winner to go to the front, tracked that one inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally in the
stretch. FEDERAL CASE exchanged two bumps with the outside rival at the start, raced between foes early up the backstretch then dropped back by the
turn going in the three path into that bend, shifted in a path near the five-sixteenths then back out a path in upper stretch and improved position inside rivals
late. IRRITATOR reared at the start spotting the leader several lengths, was keen to go on with it early pulling against the rider's hold and was forced to
switch outside of rivals up the backstretch, went four wide and outside into the turn emerging five deep out of that bend but had nothing left for the drive. MY
FRIEND FLAVIN moved in heading up the backstretch, was keen from about the nine-sixteenths till past the half-mile marker, was allowed rein at that
juncture and entered the turn just off the fence but quickly moved to the three path near the three-eighths pole while inside a rival, continued between foes
four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

PLAY ON tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up while two then three wide on the turn, made a bid into the stretch, took the lead while asked at the
three-sixteenths, held a length advantage passing the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging. HOTSHOT
ANNA was hustled from the start, settled outside under some urging, went three wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, chased the winner while
outside into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late, reached even terms for the lead one stride from the wire but was denied while able to get the place.
EYEINTHESKY settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then was asked once straightened for the drive, gained
just behind the leading duo while between horses, was in tight quarters into the final furlong, bumped with UNBRIDLED CLASS outside the sixteenth-pole
then steadied, found room in the final sixteenth and finished with good energy for the show but was unable to recover from the trouble while possibly best.
UNBRIDLED CLASS was well placed just off the pace in the second flight, drafted inside on the turn, came out while off heels into the stretch, was coaxed
along behind the leading duo while lacking optimal clearance in front of her, bumped with foes inside the furlong marker and was out-kicked. CHANGE OF
CONTROL broke a step slow, settled at the back, moved in near the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch
then was asked for her best and improved position. A THOUSAND REASONS showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action while
guided around the turn in the two path, was asked after turning into the stretch, lost the lead before the three-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the
final furlong, bumped with UNBRIDLED CLASS outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. BELL'S THE ONE broke near the back of the field, settled at the
rear, moved inside of a foe nearing the seven-sixteenths, raced between horses into the turn, went three wide on that bend, bobbled approaching the
five-sixteenths, was put to a drive in upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and was no factor. LAKE LOCAL broke out then brushed with a foe
and bobbled slightly, settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. AIKEN TO BE bobbled
ever so slightly at the start, settled on the outside, was roused while three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
ON PROBATION broke in but was quickly corrected, settled well back on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. (Rail at 8 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

DIAMOND PALACE broke very fast then was hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, shook clear
into upper stretch then was put to a right-handed whip, drifted out inside the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and held under a strong hand
ride to the wire. TAPIT ON RACE DAY broke a step slow, moved up on the far outside, tracked the leading duo four wide on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, chased the winner under the whip in the stretch and was outfinished while well clear for second. FIRST METAL COUNT was away alertly,
pressed the pace on the outside of the winner, drew even with that foe in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired
while just able to hold the show. MAGICAL CANDY was one of four horses to break a step slow then was grabbed with the left rein, raced towards the rear
while ridden along, went four to five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. READY REDDING bumped with a rival at
the start, moved up to race just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn and capitulated. AMAZING AMERICAN broke a step slow, moved up while
off the pace, swerved out five wide into the turn then dropped to the four path, remained in the four path under urging through the turn and came up empty.
