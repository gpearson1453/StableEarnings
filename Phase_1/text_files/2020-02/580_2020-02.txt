Footnotes
PISTON hesitated and broke half a step slow, chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and pushed away driving.
EUSTACE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, did not impact the winner but was not in danger of the place. BALIUS had
no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. EXHORT pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch
and weakened. KIND OF GALLANT had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch but tired through the drive. MARINO HEAT also broke a bit
slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER stalked the leader to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, got on terms leaving mid stretch, could not shake
loose but gamely got the nod. SMOKIN BLACKJACK set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when hooked by the winner, battled bravely after
being headed and just missed. MAKE IT A TRIPLE was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch, drifted out leaving
mid stretch and did not threaten the top two. MON CAMO also stalked the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch
then was carried out a bit by MAKE IT A TRIPLE leaving mid stretch and finished evenly. TOMAHAWK TUESDAY had no speed, saved ground to the
stretch but was never a threat. EXHORTATION got outsprinted to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but did not rally. MANILA MISCHIEF also had no
speed and was not a factor.

on digging for more and pushed clear late. KELLY pressed the winner to the turn, pushed up to engage for the lead two wide, responded in upper stretch
and inch clear to mid stretch then was outfinished for the win but saved second. AMBER LOUISE stalked the top two to the turn, was two wide to the
stretch, shifted out in mid stretch and finished in a rally. OYSTER SHOOTER was outsprinted to the turn, also was two wide to the stretch, angled out and
closed willingly but too late. SARI'S TIGER broke slow, had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. LUCKY

Footnotes
EMERALD MAGIC pressed BIG CHEDDAR to the turn, pushed up two wide to engage for the lead into the stretch, inched clear to mid stretch then off the
favorite stubbornly. BIG CHEDDAR zipped away to the half mile pole, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared in mid stretch then stayed close
but was second best. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. LUCK IS MY NAME
also chased the leaders, shifted off the rail nearing the quarter pole, raced two wide into the stretch but lacked a closing response. DYNAMIC DUO had no
speed, eased in and saved ground to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive. TRASH TALKIN CAT broke a bit slow, had no speed, was three wide to
the stretch but did not menace. CONTINENTAL UNION got outsprinted to the turn, was two wide to the stretch and tired in mid stretch.
