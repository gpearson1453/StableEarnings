Footnotes
MR. BANDINI'S BAND unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, took the lead and was going away at the end. SONG N A
CAT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held off ROSE NEEDS A CHECK for second. ROSE NEEDS A
CHECK void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a late bid and finished willingly. FANCY THIS raced in the middle of the field, came
around the second turn wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. OUR RAPIDASH raced within striking distance and weakened. PRIMETIME TIZ raced
within contention, came around the first turn wide and faded. MONTBROOKS MIRACLE void of early speed and was never a threat. TRULY THE ONE went
to the front, drove clear, saved ground and dropped back.

HAWKS PEAK unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn and drove clear deep in the stretch. ALEX'S TURN vied for the
early advantage, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner late and outdueled SI FAMILIA for second. SI FAMILIA pressed the
pace, raced outside around the final turn, dueled with ALEX'S TURN and was outfinished for second. DONWELL lacked early speed, saved ground around
the final turn, moved up and finished evenly. RANDY PAUL raced near the back in the early part, moved up, but was no factor. CHIEF KNOCKAWAY
hopped at the break, raced near the middle of the field and finished evenly. NAVY TYPIST pressed the early pace and faded. DUE APEAL always raced
near the back and was outrun. HOT TEN showed early speed and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
LANDONESE challenged for the lead, forwardly placed throughout and proved the best late. MEDITATE raced in the middle of the field, came around the
final turn four wide and finished willingly. POINTMAN dueled for the early lead, raced close throughout and was outfinished by the top two. BUSHIDO
SAMURAI pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS pressed the early pace, saved ground around
the final turn and weakened. CARBONATED raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. UNCLE BIRD lacked early speed, raced wide
around the first turn and was never a factor. CANYON FIRE raced evenly near the back, came around the first turn wide and was outrun. SPRING RODEO
void of early speed, finished wide and showed little. WATCHOUTFOR TAYLOR raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
UNDERPRESSURE unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, drifted in down the stretch and drove clear before the wire.
TREASURE TROVE vied for the early lead, took command around the final turn, altered course down the stretch, as UNDERPRESSURE drifted in and was
a clear second at the wire. PADDOCK PICK raced within contention, made a bid, hung and proved no match for the top two. STEPHEN'S ANSWER
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was just up for the show. EXTIRPATOR raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no
factor. GENTRIFIED lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, moved up, but was no threat. LATE NITE MISCHIEF pressed the early pace
and faded. POUND FOR POUND void of early speed and was never close. BENDING SAINT dueled on the front end and was finished early. THE JOCKEY
OF #3 TREASURE TROVE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 UNDERPRESSSURE FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH.

Footnotes
LITTLE WISE GUY unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late rally and got up in time. GOOD AIR pressed the
pace, waited around the final turn, lacked running room, angled out, split rivals and was outfinished for the win. CARLETTA went to the front, drove clear
and proved no match for the top two late. SCRIMMAGE raced within contention, hung late and lacked a late kick. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE lacked early speed,
drifted out around the first turn and was never a factor. CANRUNALITTLE broke slow and was never close. PURPLE HEART ROAD void of early speed,
saved ground around the final turn and was outrun. WAR SONG vied for the early lead and dropped back.
