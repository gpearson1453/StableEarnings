Footnotes
MOBEATYABAD came through close quarters to gain the advantage, sped to the lead just off the rail, dictated the pace on a widening margin racing to the
stretch, continued under mild hand urging to upper stretch and was gathered up in the final sixteenth in a ridden out effort. VEGAS LIFE, crowded at the
start, tracked the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the, shifted out entering the lane losing ground to the winner but prevailed for the place honors. TIZ
LIGHT THE WAY ducked out at the start brushing the eventual winner, was righted to track off the second flight along the rail and displayed some late
interest to challenge for second nearing the wire. MEDAL OF FACT angled inwards to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn
and gave way into the stretch. TAKE TO THE SKIES tracked the pacesetter outside foes in second flight racing four wide, then three wide into the turn and
gave way into the stretch. MAGICAL ILLUSION was never a factor.

Footnotes
FOURTH DESIGN shifted outside the pacesetter while being prompted to a forward placing prompting that foe racing into the turn,continued with a steady
bid to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. J'S FLASHY HALO broke
readily, sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner.
EARLY DELIGH, reluctant to load, broke in the air, was settled last racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with
interest to edge a rival for a share nearing the wire. NO CHOICE broke slowly, tracked off the second flight in the opening stages, gained some position
between racing into the turn but lacked the needed late kick. STRIKING HEIR tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, made brief
progress gaining position three wide on the turn but came up empty racing into upper stretch. NICOLE MUNNINGS tracked just off the leaders inside foes in
second flight racing to the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
AMERICANDY, prominent outside foes leaving the chute, angled to the rail racing to the first turn to dictate the pace on a narrow margin through the
backstretch, dueled inside foes on the far turn to upper stretch while being headed momentarily but regained a narrow advantage in time under steady
handling. ON A SPREE, reluctant to load, tracked the between foes in second flight in the opening half, advanced racing into the far turn to press the issue
between foes into upper stretch while striking the front but was outkicked. TETSU, three deep between foes in the opening stages, tracked off the second
flight while angling inwards a bit racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top
pair. FLIGHT DECK, off a step slowly, shifted out on the first turn to track the pacesetter three deep into the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that
path nearing upper stretch, then finished evenly between foes in the closing stages. JUAN PABLO settled along the rail tracking off the second flight, shifted
out racing into the stretch and made some mild progress. ELZABE'S ON BOARD tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the
backstretch, then steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE bobbled at the start while brushing a rival, was quickly righted, then sprinted clear along the inside racing to the turn, turned back a
rival's challenge leaving the midway point of the turn to regain a clear advantage shifting well off the rail racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end
under strong handling. LADY BREANNA, brushed at the start, was urged along to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced on that
rival to press the issue on the turn but proved no match while best of the others. DON'T FIGHT IT angled inwards to track off the second flight under light
rating racing into the turn, shifted out while being held up avoiding tight quarters momentarily nearing upper stretch but continued with interest three deep
between foes to gain some position while prevailing for a share. LOLANITA tracked the leaders four deep racing to the turn, was prompted to lodge a brief
bid in that path nearing the lane but soon flattened out. WEST HORIZEN angled inwards to track between foes in second flight just off the inside racing into
the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. ANIMAUXSELLE settled last in the opening quarter, angled inwards on the turn to split foes just off the inside to
make some brief progress racing into the lane but proved empty late. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW, held up avoiding close quarters along the inside just after
the start, tracked the leaders saving ground into the turn and steadily faded into the lane.

Footnotes
TEACHER DRAMA, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter under light reserve in the opening half, continued with a steady bid to wrest command leaving
the midway point of the far turn, shifted out racing into the stretch but maintained a clear advantage under firm handling. PEACE TAKER, pulling against
restraint along the rail racing to the first turn, tracked just off the leaders along the inside, switched out racing through the far turn while being prompted to
advance on the leader, shifted out wide racing through the stretch but proved always only second best. JACKIES DREAM tracked the leaders outside foes
as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while racing four wide leaving the far turn into upper stretch, shifted inwards
through the stretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. MELISSANI, reserved between foes just off the second flight in the opening half,
was caught int tight quarters momentarily nearing the far turn, was urged to advance splitting foes three deep nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed
final response. I'M THAT BIRD angled inwards to track between foes in second flight and continued evenly into the stretch. ARGENTINIAN ROOTS (IRE)
settled last early and failed to menace. TINK, brushed at the start, sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far
turn and gave way once headed nearing upper stretch. LASTING JOY ducked out at the start brushing a rival, was held up along the inside and soon trailed.

Footnotes
COMMANDER OF DEATH, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the outset, pressed the issue along the rail racing into the turn, shifted out under left
handed pressure bumping SHE'S AN ALPHA nearing the three sixteenth marker, then was righted and continued to dispute the issue in a prolonged drive to
narrowly prevail on the wire under firm right handed encouragement. SHE'S AN ALPHA broke sharply, angled inwards to dispute the issue on a narrow
advantage three deep in the opening quarter, continued to press the issue outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, was bumped racing into upper
stretch but continued grudgingly to the end to dispute the issue while just outkicked. SHARON'S LAW, urged to gain a forward placing between the top pair
in the opening stages, tracked just off those rivals racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. DRIVE IN broke slowly, recovered to track off the first flight
along the inside racing into the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. CHICA DIFISEL tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the turn and faded
nearing upper stretch. BATI BATI, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight between rivals but never gained contention. KEEPANEYEONME
tracked just off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and soon gave way. CALL ME MOONSHADOW broke outwards bumping BATI
BATI at the start, and trailed throughout.

SWEET BLOSSOM, caught wide racing into the first turn while being fanned to the four path by a drifting rival, pulled her way along outside foes into the
backstretch, was prompted three deep after a half to advance on the pacesetter, shifted inwards on the far turn to press the issue nearing upper stretch,
edged forward to a narrow advantage leaving midstretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm left handed encouragement. ALYDARIUS,
brushed at the break, was reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders racing to the far turn while
angling inwards, was urged to bid between foes just inside the winner leaving midstretch and proved best of the others. UNABRIDGED (IRE) settled
between between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide on the far turn and continued with an effort to gain some position
outside foes. ADULT IN THE ROOM broke inwards brushing a rival, was urged to gain a forward placing three deep attending the pace to the backstretch,
took over after a half while shifting to the inside, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch and yielded late. RIPROARING,
forwardly placed between foes, drifted out while being taken in hand racing through the first turn carrying out the eventual winner nearing the backstretch,
continued under correction while conceding position after a half, was prompted to split foes shifting out three deep nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid
between rivals but lacked the needed final kick. BETTYB angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight into the backstretch but faded after a half.
SWINDLE was a brief factor between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch but gave way early. TOLLY HO was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow
margin along the rail into the backstretch and emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
LEGACY AZTECA angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the second flight between rivals under light reserve, gathered some momentum shifting
out nearing upper stretch, came through close quarters to split rivals three deep racing into upper stretch and responded to brisk handling to wrest the
advantage and go clear in a sharp rally. SPECTACULAR ROAD sped to the lead from the break while angling to the rail, held sway on a clear margin to
upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. SAUCY DON was rated three deep as part of the second flight tracking the pacesetter to
the turn, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but flattened out in the drive. THE STIFLER, restless before the start, broke slowly,
switched outside foes to make brief progress four wide racing into the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and faded. WILD WINTER settled along the
rail early, angled out nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. NICK THE CARDSHARK tracked the pacesetter between rivals in second flight for three
and half furlongs, then faded into the stretch. NICK CAN FIX tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight and retreated early.

Footnotes
G FRIDAY was rated between foes tracking off the second flight in the opening half, angled out four wide racing into the far turn commencing a steady
advance and wrested the advantage in that path late under firm encouragement. LEVEL SEVENTEEN went readily to the lead, dictated the pace on a clear
margin to the far turn, held sway to midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. HUSBAND IN LAW tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight, was
prompted to advance in that path between foes racing through the far turn, then continued evenly through the stretch while prevailing for a share. LITTLE
GUY, reserved off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, angled out nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position.
TREASURE RUN, forwardly placed between rivals tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, continued under pressure into the far turn and
proved empty in late stages. DRILL BIT broke slowly, then was steadied avoiding STERLING JUDGE in the opening stages, switched outside foes while
prompted to gain position racing into the backstretch, made some brief progress while angling inwards racing into the far turn but proved empty in the final
quarter. GOOFY BOY, held up last avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, swung out five wide racing through the far turn but had no rally.
STERLING JUDGE drifted inwards in early stages impeding DRILL BIT, was carried out a bit by that foe racing into the first turn, continued under reserve
tracking off the second flight and never gained contention. DRILL DOWN worked his way to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch
but faded early.
