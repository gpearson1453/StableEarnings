Footnotes
GRINS N' WINS bumped at the start, was hustled up to stalk the leaders, inched closer between rivals through the turn, dug in determinedly late two wide
under left handed urging and proved best in a stretch long drive. JUDGE REESE trailed early, closed rapidly along the inside into the stretch, altered course
to the four path near the sixteenth pole, continued determinedly and just missed. JUDY'S PRIDE prompted the early pace from the four path, angled in a bit
on the turn, made the lead before the quarter pole, set the pace under strong pressured until deep stretch then was outfinished along the inside. RONNI'S
DAY set the early pace while in the nine path down the backstretch, angled into the five path on the turn, kept on through the stretch, drifted out late and
faded. JUST ZOEY well placed near the inside, shifted out to the five pat past mid stretch, was carried out inside the sixteenth pole and finished evenly.
DANCING GRACE was no threat. K FOR KATHY bumped at the start and was no factor.

RUN MICKEY RUN broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch under strong handling to win as much the best. LILA RUTH never
far back, had a mild late rally four wide and finished second best. YURUBI stalked the pace from the inside, dropped back on the turn then came in again
late along the rail. DREAM FEVER failed to menace. MISS BLISS chased the winner into the stretch and faded in the final stages. TICKETY BOO was no
factor. BAY JA VU trailed.

Footnotes
DITTEN WADDY prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, made the lead, shook clear, set the balance of the pace and just lasted under right handed
urging. EVEN IF trailed well back into the far turn, circled her field in the seven path while closing fast ans just missed getting up in time. MAGICAL TIME
bumped a rival at the start, was never far back, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. TURKICANUS FREAK bore out at the
start, raced in the eight path into the clubhouse turn then failed to menace. DREAM ON GORGEOUS was bumped and stumbled at the start, settled within
striking distance along the inside, lacked racing room on the far turn then finished evenly. GUN THING offered a bid four wide into the second turn then
came up empty. EOWYN'S PARADISE bid three wide on the far turn and also came up empty. PLATINUM GALE well placed, failed to respond. BETTER
VIBES broke in front, set the pace along the inside for six furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
ONLYATTHESHOE chased the early pace, rallied two wide on the far turn, made the lead before the top of the stretch and drew off under a hand ride.
ESCALERA far back early, closed fast in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. GUEYDAN stalked the pace for five furlongs, inched
closer three wide on the second turn then leveled off. CHARMING INDY slow early, rallied belatedly four wide. AMERICAN LUXURY broke in front and
quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace along the inside into the far turn then weakened. DEFINITELY TONIGHT was no factor. CHAIRMAN GAREY
well placed, lacked the needed response. OSTENTATION was outrun. MAGICAL EXPRESS moved closer along the inside on the second turn then
stopped.

steadily in the far path in the far turn and into the stretch, was corrected near the furlong marker and finished determinedly. BOOT LEGGER well placed,
offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. MOBIL AT LAST closed some ground late in the five path. TICO THUNDER had
speed into the far turn then faded. WEST LEONARD was no factor. LITTLE BLAKER tracked the pace three wide into the stretch and gave way in the final
furlong. DECADENT DOC pressured the winner two wide into the second turn then faltered.

Footnotes
DANZIG RAINBOW closed up from the start along the inside, shifted out to the four path on the turn, rallied late and got up in the final strides under right
handed urging. VAPNYARKA pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead, shook clear before the furlong marker and just missed hanging on.
MILBRA was in tight at the start, allowed to settle then closed a gap late six wide. COWGIRL CAL settled mid pack in the five path and finished
determinedly five wide. PUSHY GIRL was hard used and closed some ground late in the three path. CHARLIES HOT failed to respond. EXTREME
EXCESS pressed the pace two wide into the turn then gradually weakened. DON'T HOLD ME NOW was no factor. HY RAPID LADY was no threat.
WORLD IS MY CITY hopped at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn then faltered in the final furlong.
