Footnotes
FED UP FIRED UP , patiently rated while saving ground on the turns, remained along the rail in upper stretch, eased out to the two path in mid stretch,
closed inside rivals and took the lead late. LAKE PARIMA , two wide stalking the pace, moved up to gain the lead in upper stretch, drifted out a bit near the
sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. INSTINCTIVE hugged the inner rail on both turns, was taken to the three path in upper stretch and flattened out
outside the top pair. BIRD TYCOON went clear soon after the break, hugged the inner rail and tired the final furlong. DANCINGWITHPAYNTER stalked the
pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and weakened through the drive. JUMPSTARTMYHEART , outside horses down the backstretch,
circled foes on the far turn and failed to be a factor. DON'T CHARGE IT , along the inner rail entering the far turn, eased out and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MOONZANO tracked inside, steadied off the embattled leaders nearing the turn, recovered and angled three wide to stalk, circled five wide into the lane,
ranged up and took command nearing the eighth pole, dueled outside DON'T DARE ME from there and got the bob following an extended drive. DON'T
DARE ME prompted the pace outside WE'RE FROM BRISTOL, dueled past the five sixteenths, gained a slim lead into the lane, was hooked by the winner
past the three sixteenths, fought on gamely but lost the bob. PET'S NIGHT settled in the clear, came under pressure mid turn, raced three wide into the lane
but lacked a late rally. WE'RE FROM BRISTOL , reluctant to load, broke a bit slow, rushed up between foes soon after and gained a short advantage,
handled outside pressure into and around the turn, ceded command into the lane then tired through the final furlong. DIRTY DIRTY , urged along off the
inside, failed to menace. MAGIC OF LOVE flashed speed, drafted back towards the rail and failed to generate a response. I WANT MORE was outrun.
HARRY HOTSPUR broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
BOURBON WILDCAT hugged the inner rail around the turn chasing the pace, gained command in upper stretch and drove clear. WHO KNOWS WHAT
lacked speed, was four deep turning for home and rallied outside foes. TIDAL WATERS saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and flattened
out. FLAVA'S DREAM stumbled at the break, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. LADY PERRY saved ground on the turn and
failed to menace in an even effort. PHILLY CREED , fractious in the starting gate, set the pace outside BOURBON WILDCAT, drifted to the four path leaving
the turn and gave way. DIGGIN FOR DOUGH , stubborn going into the starting gate, was well placed off the rail on the turn and weakened. BULLETS LADY
was lightly steadied in close quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch. RUNAWAY PHYLLIS , three deep on the turn, gave way. ISLAND PHILO ,
wide on the turn, was outrun. MERRY MISCHIEF was not a factor.

Footnotes
LAMBEAU LADY prompted the pace three wide outside ASBUILT, took command past the three sixteenths, kicked clear under a strong drive leaving the
furlong grounds then held firm. GREAT CAUSE , fractious behind the gate, chased outside a rival mid turn, shifted out soon into the lane, straightened and
closed willingly. ADABEL settled off the pace while saving ground, stayed inside for the drive and closed steadliy. ASBUILT broke a step slow, rushed up
between rivals and took command, set a pressured pace two wide, ceded to the winner in upper stretch, battled past the furlong grounds and weakened
late. JENNA THE BOSS popped the gate when fractious, steadied when in close soon after the start, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled out four wide
into the lane and offered a mild response. SUNDAY IN L B C , brushed at the break, had speed inside, steadied back off the leaders when they went past
heading to the turn, stalked mid turn, raced two wide into the lane and faded. SHERIFF'S KID , four to five wide, shifted in past mid stretch but came up
empty. MERRY MAID bore out leaving the gate and brushed a rival, dropped off the pace, swung out in upper stretch but failed to menace. MYSTIC COMIN
HOME popped open the gate when acting up pre race, flashed speed, dropped back nearing the turn, raced three wide into the lane, steadied off heels near
the three sixteenths and gave way.

FAVORITE IMAGE set the pace along the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and was kept to his business in the drive. WAR LIGHT lacked speed, raced
outside horses leaving the backstretch, circled the far turn four deep and rallied on his left lead. GREY GIANT bumped with THIRSTY OWL leaving the
starting gate, raced inside horses on both turns, angled out in mid stretch and passed tired rivals. ONE MOST WANTED , checked on a rival's heels
approaching the first turn, was three deep on both turns and flattened out. HONEY ISLAND , three wide the first turn, offered a mild move entering the
stretch and tired the final furlong. STORM TOWER , rated between horses down the backstretch, failed to rally. BRIDGE OF HOPE hugged the inner rail
early and was done on the far turn. GRECIAN PHAROAH , no factor, was very wide on the far turn. SMART ENTRY was outrun. ICHIGO , a forward factor
inside horses for six furlongs, gave way. SOROLLA was outrun. THIRSTY OWL bumped with GREY GIANT at the start, chased the winner and faltered.

CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY sped to an early advantage then was deftly rated back off GATOR FIFTY TWO leaving the five eighths, tracked patiently two wide
past the five sixteenths, responded and went on the attack soon into the lane, spurted clear under a drive past the furlong grounds then steadily widened.
GOLAZO had speed between rivals then rated back to stalk, stalked off the inside mid turn, advanced between runners leaving mid stretch and lasted for
the place. EL ROJO , off the pace three wide, shifted out in the stretch and rallied between foes. JUSTICE OF WAR lacked speed, raced five to six wide in
upper stretch and finished well. GATOR FIFTY TWO , off slow when a bit rank, accelerated between runners and went clear heading to the half mile pole,
set the pace towards the rail, could not contain the winner past the three sixteenths then weakened in the final seventy yards. SEIZE THE DAY bore out at
the break, corrected and rushed up four wide, chased outside foes, had aim into the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded. SING A VERSE saved
ground off the pace, moved up towards the rail near mid stretch, angled and flattened out late. OUTSIDE THE BOX failed to menace. TALE OF DIXIE saved
ground leaving the far turn, angled out past the three sixteenths but lacked a solid finish. SAM AND SY , off the pace while wide, was outrun.

EVERETT'S SONG , in tight at the break, pulled his way forward while saving some ground near the half mile marker, tracked patiently mid turn, shifted out
five wide into the lane, responded when set down, ranged up to collar the leader leaving the furlong grounds then eagerly widened while kept to a drive.
PEDERSON'S COURAGE bore out at the break, corrected and tossed his head while a bit rank advancing towards the fore, prompted three wide then bid
into the lane, shook clear on his left lead in mid stretch, failed to contain the winner's charge but kept on trying and was clear for the place. AMERICAN
D'ORO pressed the pace two wide outside AWESOME DYNMAMO, drew alongside after a half mile, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth pole then faded.
AWESOME DYNAMO , studdish pre race, was hard sent to get a clear lead, set the pace towards the rail, dueled past the five sixteenths, continued with
interest to the three sixteenths then gave way. RIPPOLINO saved ground off the pace, was under a ride leaving the far turn and failed to respond.
TRADITION , towards the inside pursing the leaders, dropped back in upper stretch.
