MI CLEOPATRA AND I bumped at the start, vied inside for the lead, dueled inside on the turn, took over, led into the lane, drifted out in the final furlong and
held on determinedly late. TUFF BIRD vied between rivals for the early lead, dueled two wide on the turn, angled in behind the winner at the eighth pole,
then rallied inside of that rival and dug in gamely to the end. IWASBORNAWINNER vied three wide for the lead, chased on the turn, weakened and bested
the others. MEBS WEB raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and gained mildly inside. MY BLONDE MARY chased inside and tired.
POSITIVELY MINE stumbled at the start and bumped a rival, chased close up two wide, then inside on the turn and faded. TEA PARTY hopped at the start,

ROSELBA dueled with STRONGERTHANUKNOW from the outset, battled inside of that rival on the turn, dueled heads apart past the furlong marker and
edged away late to prevail. STRONGERTHANUKNOW dueled two wide for the lead, dueled outside of ROSELBA turning for home, dug in gamely in upper
stretch, then was all out late to save the place spot. BAND SWEETHEART stalked between rivals, rallied three wide into the stretch, finished well and just
missed for second. SHE BROKE MY HEART raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, rallied in the final furlong and just missed for third while
four wide at the wire. MEET THE BEAUTY tracked on the inside, rallied mildly inside in the stretch run. SECOND BITE raced off the pace inside, angled out
in the stretch and closed belatedly outside. PRETTI TRICKI chased outside, came five wide into the lane and weakened. TEMPERANCE raced off the rail,
off the pace and failed to threaten. THIRD TIME AROUND stalked three wide and gave way. O'MALLEY raced four wide early, pulled up on the turn and
walked off.
