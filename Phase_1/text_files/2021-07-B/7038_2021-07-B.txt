Footnotes
MARIANNA QUEEN saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch and edged away under moderate urging. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS stalked the pace
outside, loomed a stretch threat, continued well but was outfinished. ALMOST EVIL moved to the front along the rail with a clear lead, was collared inmto
the stretch and weakened. LADY MISTRESS ducked out at the start, raced wide trying to bear out. BOCA ROYALTY settled wide just off the leaders and
faded on the final turn. JUST A DREAM chased between rivals for five furlongs and faded. SHAKEM gave way readily before half a mile losing contact with
her field.

Footnotes
EL FENOMENO vied in the two path and then inside and edged away through the stretch driving. RULES vied along the inside then the two path and
continued willingly. CAPITAN FOFO stalked the leaders three wide and was outfinished for the place. GLACIER EXPRESS pinched back early, raced
extremely wide closing the gap. EL DULZURA chased in the second flight and lacked a rally. DOUGIE lacked speed and was never in contention. SAGE
CANYON dropped far behind then moved very wide on the turn and stretch. THE REIGN MAN raced far behind inside and was never a factor. BILL'S
MAFIA lagged far back and was always outrun. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD prompted the pace five wide down the backstretch and stopped. LITTLE VINNIE
urged close up between rivals early then faded badly.

Footnotes
SPEIGHT moved clear inside, repelled a challenge in the stretch and edged off while drifting out driving. DR ZRADA lacked speed, advanced inside to the
stretch, bid, loomed a danger and tired. BUCKS ARE MOVING lagged far behind then rallied inside closing gap while no threat. HORSE BE WITH YOU was
urged close up in the two path and began fading on the turn. COMFORTABLY COOL prompted the winner down the backstretch and gave way.
MACLEAN'S LEGACY chased very wide and stopped on the turn. OLYMPIQUE lacked speed and was never in contention. RICKIE'S MELODY lunged at
the break and was never a factor. BIZZY GILLESPIE chased wide on the turn and failed to menace. GOLDEN SPOKE hustled just off the leaders four wide
and stropped abruptly.

between rivals then inside, no threat. DANZAFIED raced within range outside briefly then gave way. WISE JUDE dropped far behind then passed fading

NURTURING settled wide well back, advanced into the stretch and eagerly pulled away under moderate coaxing. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD saved ground
throughout, bid to the front into stretch but was no match for the winner. SUPERHELPFUL reserved inside, swung wide into the stretch and rallied. BARN
QUEEN trailed far behind then offered some late energy. DIVINE CHOICE led briefly into the first turn and began fading after half a mile. LET'S
CELEBRATE hustled to the front inside for three quarters and faded. CIARRAI ABU rated three wide, close up to the stretch and faded. DAUPHINE
dropped back early and was always outrun. TISTAAHAL chased in midpack early and weakened steadily. MISHPOCHA was fanned very wide on the first
turn, bore out and stopped.

Footnotes
BILLIEANNE lacked speed between foes, swung wide into the stretch then surged clear. in the final sixteenth FINEST WORK settled inside then rallied
nicely to get up for the place. NYSSA took over into the far turn, drifted out badly through the stretch weakening. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS urged close up
inside for half a mile and flattened out. EIGHT DANZAS lagged at the back of pack inside, swung wide and closed well. SHAHAADA raced off the leaders in
the two path and lacked a rally. SKY QUEEN dropped far behind and was never a factor. QUEEN OF MINE forced the pace in the two path for half a mile
and stopped. SUPER DUPER FLY flashed speed outside and gave way readily.

MR. WALSH angled inside into the far turn, moved clear and remained safe while kept to a drive. CONQUISTADOR SHOW was outrun early then closed
well along the inside. GRANDFIRE dueled three wide down the backstretch and continued willingly. EDDIE'S CHARGE dropped back inside, angled out on
the turn but lacked a solid rally. THE METHOD trailed early, moved inside and passed fading rivals. MAINE earned a narrow advantage in the two path and
gave way. UNCLE TONY P dropped back outside and was never in contention. BAVARIA chased far behind throughout. LAWLESSNESS urged off the
pace outside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MT SURIBACHI came out the start, positioned well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid to the front at the top of the stretch and drew away. SOUND THE
CHARGE settled inside, slipped through into the stretch but was no match for the winner. DRAMATIZED engaged in a taxing duel outside, led on the final
turn then weakened in the stretch. REBEL TRAVELLER reserved in the two path then closed well while no threat. THANK YOU RICKETTSmade a
menacing move wide on the final turn and flattened out. OVER SENSUAL chased three wide off the leaders and lacked a r4ally. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT
lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. BOUNCING AROUND lacked speed and was never a factor. ABDAA bothered just after the start and was
outrun. SMOKUM PEACE PIPE was roughed at the break and retreated. PYLON vied along the inside in a blistering duel and stopped. COURT SKY was
knocked about at the start and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
RITTENHOUSE set the pace inside, repelled challenges, raced an erratic course, in the stretch but remained clear. MOUNTAIN TREE stalked the pace
inside, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. SPIRIT WOLF pressed the winner to the stretch and weakened slightly. TEMPTING THE TIGER
lagged far behind then passed rivals without threatening. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL dropped far behind inside and lacked a solid rally. CITY GUY settled wide
off the leaders and faded. SECRET MAGICIAN lacked speed after sluggish start and was outrun. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD saved ground off the pace and
retreated. PRINCE ORB dropped back in the two path then inside and was no factor. ILOVECHARLYBROWN stalked the pace outside for half a mile and
gave way. BRIDLECREST lacked speed and was always outrun. PARTNER'S POWER displayed poor action in the opening quarter and was eased. An
objection by the rider of SECRET MAGICIAN against the rider of RICHIE GOES GLOBAL for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
