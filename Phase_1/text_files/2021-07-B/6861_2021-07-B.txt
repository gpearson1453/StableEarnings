POP A CHOC forced the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn, rallied determinedly, led mid stretch and drove clear. PILOT EPISODE led early, set
a pressured pace, moved clear on the turn, was engaged a 16th out, yielded and held place. BEYOND MYBUDGET bumped with SHE'S GOT MOVES
leaving the gate, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. TWIRLING FAITH moved up to force the pace on the
main track, chased from the rail on the turn, rallied along the fence but evened out in deep stretch. MONASTERY LANE broke outward and settled off the
pace, closed along the rail through the turn but failed to menace. LA CROIX VALMER raced in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn but lacked
a closing response. SHE'S GOT MOVES bumped with BEYOND MYBUDGET at the outset, settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
then flattened out in the stretch.

CLOSE IMAGE had speed, set a pressured pace, moved clear into the turn, hustled into the stretch, was under a ride but was caught in the late stages.
BOSSALINA settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. CRUMLIN TIME raced in mid
pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch and finished with good interest. POST TO POST settled off the pace,
stayed on the second path through out and finished all out. ALICE'S WAR raced off the pace, rode the rail and was hustled on the far turn then finished
gamely to no avail. LINE OF VISION got away slowly and settled off the pace, came three and four-wide through the first turn and was hustled three and
four-wide through the far turn but lacked a closing response. YES PLEASE showed a brief turn of speed then was headed and stalked the pacesetter, rode
the rail throughout, was hustled on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th.

GOLDEN VISION, in range despite being at the back of the pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied
outside, bid a 16th out and edged ahead under a drive. SUMMER SUNDAY broke sharply but was headed by SPANISH BALLERINA, stalked the pace,
closed up and lapped onto the speedster who now had a head advantage through the turn, challenged in earnest at the 1/4 pole, took command at the top
of the stretch but was collared with a 16th to run and gave way grudgingly. SPANISH BALLERINA sprinted clear early, set the pace, was under serious
pressure through the turn, was engaged late turn and headed at the top of the stretch then chased determinedly to the wire. SAV stalked the pace in hand,
saved ground on the turn, was up close to the front runners at the top of the stretch, lost her path, had to move off the wood and finished evenly.

Footnotes
ROLLING SLOAN raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, took the lead in the final furlong and held under a drive. VALLEY GIRL was away slowly and
settled off the pace, circled two to six-wide late turn, bid in the final furlong but was outkicked. GO GIGI GO GIGI GO raced in mid pack, was hustled
four-wide on the turn, was hustled into the stretch and chased to the end. LEAVE IT WITH ME, in range, checked behind traffic three-wide late turn then
finished with some interest. CEFALO stalked the pace, bid four-wide mid turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way. SILENT MAMBA moved up to force
the pace, led into the turn, had company at the front and yielded upper stretch. I AM I SAID settled in mid pack, was hustled angling in from three-wide to
the rail on the turn, closed into the stretch but ran into traffic and evened out late. ANITA GRIGIO stalked the pace, came four and five-wide through the
turn, jostled with rivals at the top of the stretch and evened out. ENHANCED FINANCE, whose rider carried no whip, led early then forced the pace, battled
late turn but tired at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
DRAGON'S BREW settled in mid pack along the rail inside two rivals, awaited room when closing in on the trio of pacesetters on the turn, angled out to the
three path in upper stretch and split tiring rivals to get the front at the eighth pole, maintaining a safe margin under urging to the wire. FOUR ACES HIGH
was off the pace and between rivals down the backside, followed the winner from midturn into upper stretch, got the same path as that foe by the eighth
pole and continued on willingly to grab the place without threatening the victor. SOUPER HOT sat a nice trip along the inside chasing the dueling front trio,
came off the inside late on the turn to look dangerous but fell back in upper stretch before coming on again to pick up the pace survivor late for the show
spot. SPEEDY BOLT led quickly but was pressed by two rivals down the backside and around the turn, losing the lead to that pair late on the turn, gamely
rallied back to hold onto a minor award. ROCKCREST pressed the front between foes down the backside and around the turn, had a brief lead late turn and
in upper stretch, was headed by the winner at the eighth pole and lost positions in the final sixteenth. RED FICTION was three wide pressing the lead down
the backstretch and through the turn, tiring and dropping back in the final furlong. SUNSPEAR settled in outside the winner and between rivals chasing the
three leaders on the turn, still in contention at the top of the stretch but didn't kick on and dropped back down the lane. ALL CANADIAN began sluggishly
and was four wide off the pace, came four to five wide on the turn and out in the seven path turning for home, lugging in down the stretch and taken hold of
the final sixteenth. RED FROG three wide and in midpack around the turn, moved up when five wide by the quarter pole and was out in the six path turning
for home, tiring and taken hold of late when losing ground.

GIZMO'S B F F settled off the pace, was hustled angling from two to five-wide through the turn, swept to the lead along with SILENT CAUSEWAY in the
final 16th and prevailed over that one for the victory. SILENT CAUSEWAY bumped with ENCHANTED LADY at the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled
two to four-wide on the turn, dueled in the stretch but was out finished. MEET THE SOPRANO set a pressured pace along the rail, quickened on the turn,
came out in the final furlong but was passed in the late stages. JUSTLEAVEITALONE, in range, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was mid
rally when her lost path, angled in to the rail and came on. LIVIN IN THE SIX stalked the pace, chased late turn, was up close but did not tender a bid and
flattened out mid stretch. ENCHANTED LADY, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, chased four-wide late turn but never reached contention. RICHIES
NOBLE GIRL stalked the pace, chased hard three-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. PIPESTONE stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the
turn but lacked a closing response. ARTIE'S FIRST KISS showed early speed then pressed the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn and lacked a
rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER ON JUSTLEAVEITALONE AGAINST MEET THE SOPRANO FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL
FURLONG WAS UPHELD, AND MEET THE SOPRANO WAS DIQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
PEACE OF EKATI stumbled leaving the gate but had speed and led the way, opened up a long advantage on the backstretch, continued to set a reserved
pace on the final turn then held sway under a drive in the stretch. JUAN PABLO raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turns, tipped out at the top of the
stretch and finished under an all out charge. HOLYFIELD hit the gate leaving then stalked the pace, quickened late turn and angled from the rail to
three-wide, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. CERRADO raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch
but failed to menace. SUITEDCONNECTED settled in mid pack, saved ground, was hustled late on the far turn, chased hard in the stretch but evened out
late. CANADIAN PHAROAH settled well off the pace, trailed the field, quickened along the rail on the final turn but never reached contention. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START REGARDING HOLYFIELD RESULTED THAT HOLYFIELD WAS DEEMED TO HAVE HAD AN UNFAIR START.
ALL SINGLE RACE WAGERS ARE TO BE REFUNDED WHILE MULTIPLE RACE BETS WILL RECEIVE THE RACE FAVOURITE IN ITS PLACE.
HOLYFIELD WILL BE PAID FOR HIS THIRD PLACE PURSE MONEY.

Footnotes
SOUPER RIVER broke outward, settled in striking range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, bid at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch, shook
clear then held under a drive. BOXER BRIEF broke inward and bumped DAWSON SILVER, pressed the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn,
was laying on and bumping UNION COLONEL through upper stretch and that rival was paying him back in kind, then BOXER BRIEF rallied gamely and just
missed. HIGH HEAT broke outward and settled well off the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and
rallied willingly, just missing as well. TRUECREST came away slowly and settled off the pace, closed late backstretch, angled from two to four-wide through
the turn then finished all out in the stretch and was gaining steadily. UNION COLONEL forced the pace, raced along the rail then two-wide on the turn,
bumped with BOXER BRIEF upper stretch then rallied gamely. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE showed speed and set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong out
and gave way grudgingly. GREYSHOTT in range early, settled in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely,
maneuvering through traffic. TWIRLING MOON broke inward and settled off the pace, closed to mid pack then hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch and finished evenly. DAWSON SILVER bumped with BOXER BRIEF and TREBUCHET leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled hustled
three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. FIRE KNIGHT pinched back just out of the gate, settled in mid pack, closed five-wide through the turn
then flattened out with a 16th to run. DELIBERATE broke outward, gained position in striking range, came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the
stretch and tired a 16th out. TREBUCHET bumped DAWSON SILVER at the break, raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn but tired
in the stretch. MAD DOG N JOE steadied at the outset, raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn but lacked a rally.
