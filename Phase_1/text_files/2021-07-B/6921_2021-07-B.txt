Footnotes
UNCLE KEN set a pressured pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead with BALLYHOO PRINCE around the far turn, shook free under pressure in the
upper stretch and held clear. BALLYHOO PRINCE pressed the pace through the backstretch, dueled outside the winner around the far turn then failed to
match strides with rival in the upper stretch. MR. J. MCKAY tracked the pace through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the far turn then
sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane. ELUSIVE raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into the lane and just missed show.
HURTGEN FOREST settled inside through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into the lane and needed more to threaten. PAUPING raced off the
pace, coaxed three wide around the far turn and failed to threaten. LUNAR MISSION raced in the back then four to five wide into the lane and never
menaced. VIRGINIA FIB saved ground and lacked a needed rally. CUP MATCH was forwardly placed through early stages then retreated around the far
turn.

edged away under a driving finish. NO KNOCK RAID rated inside off the top flight, angled out two wide and put to a drive at the head of the lane, vied with
the winner deep stretch but could not match in final stages. UHWARRIE SKY vied inside a duo through the backstretch, shook free late on the far turn, got
collared near mid-stretch and gave way. ARGENTIC (FR) rated off the top flight, hustled up along the outside into the lane and needed more for impact.
CIRCLE AWAY trailed through early stages, raced four wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. PARATYCACHACA settled through early stages, saved
ground around the turn and had no response when called upon. MIDNIGHT SWAP vied three deep for the lead around the backstretch, stayed up close
around the far turn then weakened. BIRDSNEST PARTY dueled between rivals through the backstretch, remained forwardly placed around the far turn then
faded.

Footnotes
LADY DOMINANCE stalked inside through the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, angled out a path and launched a bid at the head of the lane,
roused forward to duel outside of NO DOWN DAYS, dug in gamely and just got up. NO DOWN DAYS sped to the lead at the start and set the pace through
the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the far turn, came under attack from LADY DOMINANCE in the stretch run, battled back gamely from the
inside and got nipped for the win. LAZY SUMMER DAY settled through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, launched an inside bid at the head of
the lane then dug in late and held show. INDIAN NICHOLS raced near midpack, hustled up three wide around the far turn, swung out five to six wide into
the lane and needed more for serious impact. SARA MIA rated inside through early stages, was ridden inside around the far turn, angled out in the lane and
finsished evenly. DANCING TIL DUSK stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, was ridden along two wide around the far turn then gave way. WITTY
BANTER raced two wide and failed to move into close contention.
