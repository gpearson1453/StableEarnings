KING NEKIA stalked the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and was well clear late under steady
handling. TAPSASIONAL was forwardly placed early on, raced in tight quarters nearing the five sixteenths pole, moved up three to four wide through the
stretch run but was no match for the winner. THE PREDICAMENT showed good early speed from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile while
racing near the inside. QUAD EIGHTS stalked the early pace, raced in the two path while racing between rivals and weakened through the drive. LORD
EDDARD STARK was hustled early, raced towards the back down the backstretch, was six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. MY
FREEDOM was slow early, raced three wide through the lane and failed to respond.

to just miss. HIT THE TICKET showed good early speed to set the pace, raced off the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. EMPTY NESTR stalked
the pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. POLITICAL was forwardly placed early on, raced three to four wide

raced six wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. SENSE A MILLION bobbled at the break, was forwardly placed early on, raced four
wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. INTREPID DREAM broke in the air, was slow early and never threatened. SONETTA raced far

MAESTRIA was rated off the early front runner, took command through the far turn and was well clear while never being asked to be an easy winner.
CALIFORNIA BELLA was settled off the early pace, raced along the rail in the stretch run and was no match for the winner. HELLUVA LADY stalked the
early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. LIKING IT TWISTED dropped back early, raced three wide in the lane
and had no late rally. MY BOSS showed good early speed and gave way. SHEMADEMELUCKY was slow early on, raced four deep near the three
sixteenths pole and never was a factor. IT IS WHAT IT IS failed to sustain a bid. HIGH FRONTIER lacked early speed, raced towards the inside and never
was a factor.

NINETEEN stalked early on, moved up three to four wide and closed in well late. DOMINATING BUYER raced up close early, raced along the inside around
the far turn and had not enough in the drive. BOUND FOR BROADWAY was unhurried in the early stages, moved up four wide and showed good late
interest. DANESSA BABY settled to the middle of the pack early, raced towards the inside and had no response. UNREQUITED LOVE dropped back early,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT saved ground and never threatened. MY GRACE failed to
respond. CASTILLEJA was pulled up and walked off the track under her own power.

Footnotes
BON FIRE DIVA stalked the top pair early, took command at the three eighths pole, raced off the inside and held gamely under strong handling. ESTILO
DIFERENTE was reluctant to load, stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the stretch run and closed in well late. MAMA G'S WISH pressed the
early leader, raced three deep and kept on to the wire. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced near the rail in the
lane and had not enough in the drive. MISSPOKEN broke slowly, raced seven wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. TINAS
SHINING STAR settled early, raced towards the inside and had no response. ALY DID IT raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. MI
CASIMIRA was hustled from the inside and tired. DEBBIE'S TREASURE failed to respond.
