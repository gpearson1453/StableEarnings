Footnotes
CABOT TRAIL pressed two wide through the turn, was three wide into the lane, was under strong handling inside the eighth pole while floating to the seven
path and inched up late. PASS THE BISCUITS tracked the two rival pace through late turn, got through along the inside into the turn, quickly gained the
lead and cleared to the eighth pole, was under a drive through the final eighth and gave ground grudgingly. HESABULLY saved ground through the turn and
moved up while not a threat to the top two. RUN THIS TOWN never a factor while in the four path through the turn. FEELING IT set the pace while in the
two path into the turn, was under pressure from both sides near the quarter pole then gave way after entering the lane. TOPPING was along the inside
through the turn and into the lane and was empty.

Footnotes
DIRTY DIXIE ROAD set the pace on a clear lead while racing near the inside, continued clear into the lane while entering from the two path, was under a
drive after straightening and held while drifting from the two to the five path through the final furlong. INDIAN BELLA chased the winner throughout while in
the two path through the turns, entered the lane with aim on the top one then slowly gained while ending up in the six path. TRAUMARAMA raced two wide
through the far turn while between rivals, continued near the inside into the lane and finished with good energy. ARIAN RAE was unhurried while in the two
path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and offered a belated gain. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) was four wide through the far turn, came
into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. AIR TURBULENCE was three wide through the far turn and tired after straightening in the
lane. MORE COWBELL saved ground throughout and faded. LADY JENNEVIERE was outrun while in the two path. The half-mile time was omitted due to a
timer malfunction.

Footnotes
WILDCARD PRADO chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved up on the leader in late turn when rated, bid into the lane from the three
path, quickly gained the lead while straightening then widened to the wire while being kept to the task. PEGASUS ON THE GO chased the pacesetter into
the far turn while in the two path, moved to the lead while under minimal urging, tried to go with the winner into the lane but was no match for that one while
keeping on to be clear for the place spot. CLOSE THE CASE trailed for half while off the inside, was asked for more into the turn, advanced through the
three path on the turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was a threat while best of the rest. DOX FOLLY saved ground through the turn and
lacked a response. MUSIC TO MY EARS raced in the two path and was empty turning into the lane. ROOSTER set the pace along the inside and was done
after mid-turn.

the three-eighths pole, lacked room and steadied in early stretch, angled to the rail, rallied late and was outfinished. NOSTALGIA stalked in the three path,
bid at the three-eighths pole, was clear in the stretch, then couldn't hold off the closers. MOMMY BERTA angled three wide at the quarter pole, then had no
late bid. LOVELY TROPHY GIRL improved position late. DON'T MINE ME dueled inside of a foe to the stretch and gave way. WHERETHEMONEYWENT
