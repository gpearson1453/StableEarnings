run down. FORT SKYWALKER good position three wide to turn, flattened out in the drive. MISS CELESTE never far back to the turn, no response and
leveled off late. FAYEGOTEVEN tardy start, passed a couple late while no threat. JUSTINE LYNN broke slow, rushed inside, battled to stretch, gave way
readily. ZACHS GOLDEN OLDIE never factored.
