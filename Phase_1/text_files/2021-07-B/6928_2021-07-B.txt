SPARTY jostled into the first turn, bid to the front inside before the half, rallied clear on the final turn, drifted out through the stretch but remained safe.
EDEN RIDGE dropped well behind then advanced inside to get up for the place. CAPE MAY STYLE prompted the pace three wide and continued willingly
in stretch. GRAY GARY fanned six wide into the first turn, angled in, bid then tired. ESPRESSO CALIENTE dropped back early then passed fading rivals.
SIGHT LINE hustled to the front then was finished after half a mile. BANKER'S ISLAND dropped back between rivals and was never a factor. KLAATU
raced close up outside briefly then stopped abruptly.

START MEEE pressed the leader outside, edged to the front in midstretch and prevailed following a long drive. WICKED STRONG ALEX hustled to a clear
advantage inside, was collared into the stretch and fought back very gamely. CALL FITZROY blocked and steadied along near the three eighths pole and
rallied when clear. MITHRA dropped far behind outside and rallied mildly. SAMBAM made a brief bid outside on the final turn then weakened. DIGGERS
DIAMOND settled off the pace in the two path and was finished after five furlongs. BANANAS ON FIRE saved ground, was asked for run on the final turn
but gave way.

WILD CARAMELO sprinted away to a long lead, drifted out in the stretch and held gamely while holding opponent safe. NAUGHTY PRINCE pursued the
winner in the clear to the stretch then made a gradual late gain. ARRECIFE lagged far behind, advanced inside to the stretch rallying too late. REGAL
QUALITY dropped off pace inside, moved briefly closer on the turn then flattened out. SOUPER FLY OVER lacked speed between rivals and was never in
contention. KID D'ORO chased wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. TOMATER GATOR began retreating on the turn and lost contact with his
field.

HOLLYWOOD JET quickly took control, widened on the turn and was never threatened while kept to his business. CHARLIES SAFARI saved ground early,
angled out midway on the turn and closed well. DIABLO D ORO faded on the turn inside then came again for the show. ONE NATION trailed down the
backstretch, moved wide with a mild rally. VINNY DREAM raced three wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. EXPLAIN pursued the winner in the
clear to the stretch and gave way. INVITATION ONLY raced very wide throughout and faltered.
