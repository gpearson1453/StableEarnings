Footnotes
BIG TIME GIZMO was off slowy and settled in mid pack, closed angling from two to four-wide on the far turn, rallied outside and swept to the lead mid
stretch under a drive. PARTY OF NO settled off the pace, closed along the rail onto the far turn, moved around the fading early pacesetter then finished
gamely in vain. GRAND GIZMO stalked the pace, closed late backstretch, bid mid turn, was outkicked for the lead but finished gamely. SIR
GRAYVENSCROFT broke outward and settled off the pace, closed four-wide, bid mid turn, gained the lead and was hustled into the stretch but was passed
with a 16th to run. ONE WAY TO WIN raced in mid pack, was hustled three then two-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final furlong. ONE THOU led
quickly, set a comfortable pace but was caught midway through the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
MIA'S EXTORTIONIST dueled on the backstretch, gained the lead on the turn, drew away in the stretch and held sway under steady handling. CANADIAN
SECRET was in striking range at the back of the tightly knit pack on the backstretch, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, cut back to the
rail upper stretch and finished gamely. ROBUSTO dueled on the backstretch, pressed the pace on the turn, chased into the stretch and then was game to
the wire. TAHANA stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch then evened out in the late stages. HARDY CANDY settled at the back of the pack,
closed three-wide late turn, rallied outside but never reached contention. CAT'S WHISPER stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then chased
through the stretch.

at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide late turn and rallied gamely. TREBUCHET raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turns and closed
mildly along the rail through the stretch. JUSTALITTLEHYPER settled off the pace, was hustled on the far turn, chased two-wide late turn and finished

Footnotes
FIVE DAYS IN MAY brushed the gate and began awkwardly, trailed until midway on the turn, came four wide at the quarter pole and tipped to the six path
turning for home, closing doggedly while widest down the lane to get up in the final strides while looking comfortable. TWIRLING WIND stalked the leader
three wide early, was in range in upper stretch and swept past the pacesetter at the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold the winner in the final strides. VEIL had
a chance to settle in behind the leaders but tipped out to be stacked up chasing four wide, in range late on the turn on the outside flank of the eventual place
finisher and had the whole stretch to pass that rival but ran in place to the wire, settling for the show. AIRY FAIRY off the pace and along the inside, closing
mildly up the fence down the lane to best the balance for a minor award. LADIES SIGNATURE rushed up inside the early leader to get the front before a
furlong was covered, extended her lead in upper stretch but was headed at the sixteenth pole, dropping back from there to the wire. THE ADRIE FACTOR
was off the pace early, closed two to three wide on the turn into range, dropped back to trail by the eighth pole in the stretch but found her second wind late
and was gaining ground late to just miss fourth. FRESH DREAMS led quickly, allowed a rival the front and stalked that one to upper stretch, tiring in the final
furlong.

SOLIDIFY got away a step slowly and settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied
outside and was up in the late stages under a drive. RECONFIGURE broke outward and bumped SILENT FLASH, set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn,
gained command at the top of the stretch, stayed gamely but was passed in the late stages and held place. SILENT FLASH was pinched back at the start,
settled in mid pack, closed two-wide late turn, chased three-wide into the stretch and finished all out. FIELDER raced in mid pack, was hustled three and
four-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. STRIKING MOON broke alertly and settled in mid pack, closed along the rail on the turn then finished
under a determined drive. SOUPER SUCCESS broke inward and bumped SILENT FLASH, forced the issue then stalked on the turn, rallied along the rail in
the stretch but the rally stalled in the final 16th. BARILKO forced the pace, dueled on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch but evened out in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
A LITTLE VOODOO led quickly, set a reserved pace, was pressured late turn and engaged a furlong out, battled to the wire and prevailed under a drive.
TEXT ME UP stalked the pace, closed two-wide on the turn, pressed the leader into the stretch, lodged her bid a furlong out, dueled to the wire and just
missed. MERINO WOOL broke outward and settled off the pace, closed fast two to four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but could only
muster a mild gain. SARARENDA raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail late turn but lacked a closing response. FOR KICKS settled off the pace,
closed two and three-wide o the far turn then flattened out in the final furlong. PRINCESS MORO raced from off the pace, dropped back two and three-wide
while under a ride on the far turn and never reached contention. CALAIS COVE raced in mid pack early, was roused late turn and upper stretch but showed
no reswponse.

came three and four-wide on the far turn, was blocked in the final furlong, angled out with a 16th to run then closed fast but just missed. MAYITO set a
pressured pace, dueled from the rail on the turn, remained prominent to the end, but missed. SHARP'S RIVER forced the pace, dueled two-wide on the
turn, was determined in the stretch but weakened in the final yards. DRONE SWARM settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, was
all out in the stretch but was unable to gain late. TORAH'S BLESSING lost his path leaving the gate, stalked the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch,
failed with a bid a furlong out and gave way grudgingly. CONQUER HIM settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely
between foes. CASH ADVANCE raced in mid pack, came along the rail then two-wide on the turn, encountered traffic at the top of the stretch then rallied
inside once clear. SPANISH MAJOR stalked the pace, pressed the issue on the backstretch, forced the duel on the turn, challenged a furlong out but
weakened in the final 16th. SUPPLICATION raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, faced heavy traffic in the stretch and evened
out in the late stages. KNIGHT KINGDOM settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide late turn then finished evenly. WHITE WEDDING raced in mid
pack, rode the rail on the turn then tired in the final furlong.
