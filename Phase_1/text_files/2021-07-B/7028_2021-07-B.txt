Footnotes
SURE BABY sprinted to the front, well handled, stayed clear, lasted late. NAUGHTY NELLIE rushed to turn, chased winner home, could not get past late.
TUFFIAN never far back, raced evenly from the turn with no late gain. ELUSIVE EYES bounced around early backstretch, floated wide, missed show.
EQUALLY EVEN failed to menace. PHONE BOOKIN IT in tight from rail backstretch, never threatened thereafter. TREES THUNDER close up to the turn,
gave way readily backed up. BAYERN BABY up close early, between horses to far turn while in tight to the far turn, checked hard out of trouble and
dropped back losing best chance from that point. C V THUNDER squeezed start, rushed to turn, gave way in the stretch run.
