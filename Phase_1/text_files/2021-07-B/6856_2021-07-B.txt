Footnotes
DELIGHTFULLYWICKED hopped at the break, was sent early on to set all the pace, drifted a bit inside the upper stretch to race well off the inside and held
gamely to be well clear late under strong handling. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole,
raced widest through the stretch run and was no match for the winner. ROCKIN RON was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early stages, made a three
to two wide bid nearing the three eighths pole and weakened a bit in the final stages. MANKLIN CREEK was slow early, raced five deep into the upper
stretch and had no rally. CLEVER AND GREAT checked off heels entering the first turn, stalked the leader from the inside down the backstretch, angled out
at the quarter pole and tired in the drive.

drive and finished with good energy to be clear under strong encouragement. MR. D'ANGELO was slow early on, moved up five wide through the stretch
and closed well to make a good late rally. ORDER FOR PORKY was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide past the eighth marker and showed
good late interest. T MINUS TEN stalked the early pace, raced three to four wide through the lane and had no late rally. SO DIALED IN sprinted clear early
on and was empty the final eighth of a mile. ONE TWO KID stalked early early on, raced three wide nearing the quarter pole and had no late response. TOE

STEVETHEVANDRIVER was quick to begin to set all the pace and held gamely in the drive to be clear under steady handling. WESSINGTON SPRINGS
stalked the top pair, moved up three wide at the quarter pole but could not go with the winner in the drive to finish second best. DONTCROSSFUZZY was
coaxed along to press the early leader and weakened while racing off the inside. CASH FLOWING was off a step slow, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and never was a serious factor. I'M NOT SLOW was hustled early, raced two to three wide in the lane and had no response. E. P. MILTON dropped
back early, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
TAPDANCING GIRL tracked the early leader along the inside, angled three wide through the stretch run and finished well to be clear under steady pressure.
SPANIKOPITA showed good early speed from the outside to set the pace, led at the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner in the final stages.
BROADWAY MELODY stalked the early pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. RONA dropped back early, raced along the
inside around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. TOSS A COIN was fractious in the gate, broke slowly, raced near the inside down the
backstretch, angled four wide through the lane and never threatened. HEART OF SECRETS raced in tight quarters in the early stages, swung out four wide
at the three sixteenths pole and never menaced. NICOLAR dropped back early, raced five wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.
ORDINARY GIRL was forced to check in the early stages, raced towards the inside through the lane and never threatened. BESTLA was slow early, raced
six wide into the upper stretch and never was involved. Races five through eight were cancelled due to weather.
