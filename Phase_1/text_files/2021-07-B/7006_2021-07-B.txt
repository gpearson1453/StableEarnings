RANDOM AFFAIR stalked the early pace, took over at the five-eighths pole, responded to pressure in the stretch and held sway thereafter. AKHNAS
bothered at the start, chased while three wide, moved closer on the far turn and kept on in the stretch. MY FORTUNATE SON saved ground and went
evenly. NOMOREMRNICEGUY worked his way to the front on the first turn and weakened in the stretch. MAKE MY YEAR was never involved. COYOTE
DEN came out at the start and showed little.

HIDDEN RULER tried to bear out on the first turn, chased the pacesetter, responded gamely, gained a narrow lead and was all out to tenaciously fend off
TASHKENT. The latter settled nicely, rallied while three wide in the stretch and just missed. STEPHEN'S ANSWER led early, was driven clear on the far
turn and worn down late. BIG BARREL never menaced. UNION STATION was always outrun. PICKFORD was off slowly, had a wide trip, and did not factor.

early pace, moved to the front on the turn and was reeled in late. JAYSKER outpaced early, advanced on the turn and managed a belated rally in the
stretch. SHIP BOSS attended the early pace, lost his position leaving the turn and dropped back in the stretch. LORD OF THE PALACE passed tired ones.
COWBOY CASANOVA raced forwardly while three wide and faded. LAUNCHED led early, was headed on the turn and yielded. SIR ELI was always outrun.

Footnotes
DELUSION chased while four wide, advanced on the turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE sprinted clear, held well into the
stretch and was reeled in late. CENTERFOLD saved ground, was angled off the rail approaching the sixteenth pole and stayed on. SAMIRA was outpaced
while four wide and displayed some mild late interest. BIGMONEYHUNNY off slowly, commenced a bid on the turn and managed a belated five wide bid. I
THINK I KNOW YOU swerved in at the start and never reached contention. TAPIT'S LADY had a wide trip and did not factor. FREEIA TAP showed some
brief speed and weakened. REMITTANCE SENT was bumped at the start and retreated. PRAIRIE FIREBALL was always outrun.
