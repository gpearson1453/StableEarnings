BELLA'S BACK sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the stretch and held off the closing CLOSE
THE SHOW LO to prevail. CLOSE THE SHOW LO lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was gaining on the
winner late. CLASSIC LEAH tracked the leaders from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. ABRAA JABRAA was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. KISSABLE U lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
EMMA'S A BEAST settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was pushed out into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
WILSON TO LOCKETT was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and drew clear. RENO ROY broke sharply to press the pace of DAVID NOSE BEST while racing three-wide, moved up to take a brief lead nearing the
three-eighths marker but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. DAVID NOSE BEST was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the
inside and gave way after going three-quarters. R B EYE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. MY GRANDPA was off slow, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
FINAL ROSE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run, vied with
LUCKENBACH, looked to have that rival put away but held on to a narrowing margin. LUCKENBACH sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while
setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch and came back to just miss in a game effort. MAJESTIC CAFE was bumped at
the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late.
HAVEULOSTYOURMIND lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. MASTER RECOVERY was bumped at
the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. HOLD ME CLOSE broke sharply to chase the leaders
while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. NOUMEA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out
further nearing the three-sixteenths marker and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ORCADIAN STORM was away alertly to duel for the lead with MR. ATLANTICO from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane, drifted in mid-stretch,
was straightened away and drew off as a handy winner. MAMACALLMEBOO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
failed to gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. MR. ATLANTICO broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing
three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. THEY'RE GRRREAT was off a step slow and bumped, rushed to contend, raced four-wide through the
turn and lacked the needed closing response. COMMAND SGT MAJOR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. COUNT ALEXEI settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. WE
MISS GENO lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DECIMATE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and was ridden out to be kept
to task. BIG PAPER DADDY lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, drifted out inside the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. EL MAESTRO
was off a step slow, rushed to contend, chased the winner while racing four-wide and failed to gain in the drive. THUNDER MUSIC settled off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TRICKY LEE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside into the
stretch, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole, steadied and lost best chance for better placing. MIDNIGHT MOJO lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not threaten. RED HURRICANE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after
the opening quarter. NEUMEISTER chased the winner from the inside and weakened after going a half. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF TRICKY LEE INSIDE THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT BIG
PAPER DADDY HAD DRIFTED OUT AND CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH.

BEAR CHUM (AUS) lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and finished with a steady bid. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY lagged early, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good energy. MUNCEY lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and
finished evenly late. ATTA BOY BILLY settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. CATFISH HUNTER raced off the pacesetters early,
moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. ALL AMERICAN HERO broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide,

Footnotes
SOUTHERN VENTURE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. DADDYS LITTLE
GIRL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with a steady bid. FRENCH TUDOR was off
slow, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and lacked the needed late response. GUARDING ELK CAMP was forwardly placed
from the inside early, angled in and out in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. FOUR SCORE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
did not offer a bid. EXCESS COIL lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. CARDS N COFFEE settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.
