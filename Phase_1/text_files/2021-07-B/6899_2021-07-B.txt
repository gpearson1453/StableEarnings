Footnotes
BUY IN prompted the pace along the rail four four and one half furlongs, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and shook clear under right handed
urging. THE DRAKE close up, dropped back a bit before a half, shifted out then came on again in the six path and finished clear for second. SAN RULER
trailed into the far turn then had a mild late rally outside. TAURUS C close up, loomed boldly four wide into the far turn, matched strides into the stretch then
failed to sustain that bid. CAPE MARCO DRIVE moved up three wide before a half then came up empty. REVENGE AGAIN made the lead soon after the
start, set the pace in the two path for four and one half furlongs, had speed to the quarter pole then stopped entering the stretch.

Footnotes
BUCKEYE RUCKUS allowed to settle, closed willingly five wide through upper stretch, made the lead late, shook clear and just lasted under right handed
urging. BOOT LEGGER never far back, surged in deep stretch along the rail and just missed getting up in time. THUNDERIN MAX vied for the early lead
three wide, rallied on the turn and into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker then was outfinished. CHIEF BIG HEAD failed to menace.
OSTEENS MESSAGE pressed the pace two then three wide until mid stretch then weakened. GOOD ENERGY was void of early speed and never close.
FASTEST MAX made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace for a half then stopped.
