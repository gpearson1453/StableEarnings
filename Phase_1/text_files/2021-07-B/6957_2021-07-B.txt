ASK AROUND steadied in the early stages, moved up between rivals to contest the pace on the first turn, vied two wide, dueled with MOON UNIT ZAPPER
on the far turn, dug in gamely between horses in upper stretch, dueled with ROB THE TREASURE through the final sixteenth and prevailed determinedly.
ROB THE TREASURE checked in tight passing the wire the first time, then tracked close up on the inside, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, rallied
outside rivals, put a head in front, then dug in gamely outside to the finish. AGELESS ARTIST raced off the pace between rivals, moved up inside on the far
turn, rallied behind the leaders, forced to check when lacking room at the furlong marker, then angled out and rallied outside. MOON UNIT ZAPPER vied
inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in on the rail in upper stretch and weakened late. TALE LIGHTS broke outward, raced off the
pace, had an inside trip and failed to rally. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX steadied at the start, had a three wide trip racing off the pace and tired. HOT LITTLE
NUMBER vied three wide on the clubhouse turn, then stalked, chased three wide on the far turn and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run,
