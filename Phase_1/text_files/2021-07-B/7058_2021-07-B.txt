Footnotes
BODES WELL (IRE) established the front and showed the way just off the inside jumping well to maintain his advantage with the exception of fence five
when jumping a bit late at that station, came under challenge near the final flight and into the flat, got displaced from command midway on the final turn, dug
in under a drive inheriting the lead when THE MEAN QUEEN lost her rider near the final sixteenth, raced on clear of the rest to get the victory. CITY
DREAMER (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, jumped late at the final fence, remained inside through the last turn and ran on to secure
the place honors in a blanket finish. ARCH MY BOY (GB) forwardly placed just off the inside in range of the leader, jumped well to maintain his position, ran
on through the flat to be along for the show honors in a blanket finish. THE HAPPY GIANT just off the inside at the tail of the field, jumped early on the first
fence, late at the sixth fence and improved position in the flat to miss for the place and show honors in a blanket finish. A SILENT PLAYER (IRE) just off the
inside in pursuit from mid pack, jumped late at fence five and weakened in the flat. FAST CAR three wide in pursuit from near the rear, jumped well to
maintain position among the field but tired in the flat. THE MEAN QUEEN (IRE) just off the inside in aim of the leader, jumped well to maintain her stalking
position, advanced to issue a challenge nearing the final flight, took over midway on the last turn in the flat, edged clear under a drive, came under an off
sided crop just inside the furlong grounds and ducked in, the rider attempting to correct before going out of bounds across the dogs, had his charge correct
herself and lost contact and balance with his mount being thrown near the sixteenth marker. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run prior to the
result standing and the race being declared official.

Footnotes
YODEL E. A. WHO broke a half-step slow then was taken up while shut-off by FOX RED, rushed up under urging to contest the pace on the inside of the
aforementioned foe, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, shook clear under a right-handed crop in
upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under strong urging in a big effort. REJECTED AGAIN
bumped with a rival at the start while off a bit slow, settled off the pace, was asked four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path while chasing into the
stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. FOX RED moved out while going to the front, disputed the pace when confronted by the
winner on the inside, was asked in the two path on the turn, came under the crop nearing the quarter-pole, had the crop knocked out of the hands of the
rider inside the three-sixteenths and weakened but was clear for the show. ROCKING THE BOAT stumbled at the start then bumped with foes on both
sides, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a left-handed crop in upper stretch,
shifted further out under a left-handed crop nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. MADISON'S LUNA was bumped soundly in the
hindquarters at the start, settled off the pace then dropped to the inside, skimmed the rail passing the nine-sixteenths then moved out, started the turn in the
two path, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CLENCH broke in at the start, settled off the pace,
was asked three wide while inside of a foe on the turn, dropped back four wide into upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STEP DANCER broke in at the start brushing OCALA DREAM, settled along the inside through the first turn before tipping to the two path into the
backstretch in mid pack, tucked back inside with seven-sixteenths to go patiently handled until called upon nearing the quarter pole, tipped out to swing four
wide into upper stretch, got set down straightened away for home, offered up a strong kick through the final furlong outside keeping an arrow straight course
through to the finish and was up in the final jumps to the wire. DREAMER'S DISEASE established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand
along the inside through sensible splits uncontested, remained patiently handled as the field got busy behind him through the far turn, took the inside route
into upper stretch roused for the drive, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat to the outside and was nailed in the very
last strides to the finish. IT'S GRAVY bumped at the start by TALES OF SARATOGA, who broke inwards, settled under rating just off the inside just off the
pace, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then improved
position to secure the show honors. GATOR BITE broke out at the start, chased along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped to
the two path three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the
last major share. BARRAGE just off the pace three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and stayed on
one paced to the finish. DEVIOUS MO three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path and settled two to three wide in closest pursuit of the leader,
came under encouragement five-sixteenths from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. OCALA DREAM two to three wide
through the opening bend, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. TALES OF SARATOGA broke in at the start bumping IT'S GRAVY, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun four

Footnotes
QUASAR settled nicely off the pace, ranged up in the four path on the turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the quarter-pole,
remained on her inside lead until inside the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a left-handed crop in the vicinity of the furlong marker then was straightened
by the rider, switched to a right-handed crop before the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. CAZILDA FORTYTALES came away in good
order, set the pace in hand on an easy lead, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked while a bit closer to the rail at the quarter-pole then came
under a left-handed crop into upper stretch, held a narrow advantage until the furlong marker then was headed by the winner, fought with that foe to the wire
and missed while able to get the place. SCOTT ALAIA broke out at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, dropped to
the two path while chasing into upper stretch, moved out under a drive nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. ALPINE QUEEN broke
a step slow, moved up on the inside, saved ground while asked on the turn and came up empty. SWEET LARISSA broke awkwardly but came out with the
body of the field, bumped with MISS ALEX near the five-eighths, was urged along in the two path on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed
to respond. MISS ALEX was rated under a snug hold, bumped with SWEET LARISSA near the five-eighths, dropped to the rear of the field late on the
backstretch, went three wide while let out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
TIMBUKTU just off the inside through the first turn, chased four wide from that point on coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for
home, rallied to take command with three-sixteenths to go, edged away under a drive inside the eighth pole, dug in and held on to prevail over a fast closing
rival. ACHILLES HEEL tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a good
finish and missed at the end. RESILIENT COURAGE tracked the pace just off the inside in closest range of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. KINGDOM ON PAWS got bumped and was forced to
steady at the start when STOP THE SPREAD veered in effecting four opponents, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung
five to six wide for home and improved. REGAL EMPIRE got bumped and steadied at the start in a chain reaction to STOP THE SPREAD veering inwards,
went four wide through the first turn, then chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and
made a bid three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. TOGA DANCER just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tipped four wide three
furlongs from home placed to light coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. STOP THE SPREAD veered in at the start bumping
KINGDOM ON PAWS into REGAL EMPIRE which in turn caused a chain of bumps down through EL VEINTICUATRO, while also forcing a trio of those
rivals to steady as this charge took over their lanes on his way inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened. RAW COURAGE chased along the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HEART OF SAVINO got bumped and was forced to steady at
the start due to pressure from STOP THE SPREAD veering inwards, chased three wide through the first turn before tucking to the two path down the
backstretch and through the far turn, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. EL VEINTICUATRO bumped at the start in a chain of bumping begun by
STOP THE SPREAD, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact.

VINDICTIVE was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, turned into the
stretch under the crop, chased the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained the lead into the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong
urging. PIPELINE went to the front, showed the way in the two path, was joined by CODY'S WISH on the inside before the five-eighths pole, vied in the two
path while outside that foe on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then inched away under the crop in upper stretch, was collared
into the final sixteenth, fought on well to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place. CODY'S WISH was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, quickly angled to the rail at the rear of the field, saved ground under stout restraint on the opening bend then became rank, was taken up behind
horses onto the backstretch, dragged his way forward outside the five-eighths then made an inside bid, was asked along the rail while inside the runner-up
on the final turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but was well clear for the show. BEATBOX was away alertly from the outside post, tucked
into the two path entering the first turn then moved to the three path, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on the final turn and
lacked the needed response. ABSOLUTE COURAGE was rated inside on the first turn then reserved off the rail, went two to three wide under urging on the
far turn and failed to respond. ZUZUDINI traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn and failed to

AM THE LAW raced inside to the two path under restraint on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn,
floated six wide into upper stretch and also failed to respond. UNEXPECTED (JPN) went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back

Footnotes
I'LLHANDALTHECASH established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut
the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding well to the finish getting in a bit nearing the wire to brush the rail. TAMAHERE (FR) bumped
between foes at the start, rated unkindly pulling on the bit and stargazing through the first turn two to three wide, chased two to three wide settling a bit
better nearing the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and ran on to secure the place honors. SWEET MELANIA
broke in at the start bumping TAMAHERE, raced forwardly placed in the two path in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three then two wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home and was just bested for the place honors. WITEZ two to three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. HOGANS HOLIDAY broke out at the
start bumping SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER into TAMAHERE, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER got bumped and pinched between foes at the start, chased just off the inside
until tucked inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. Please note
that due to a teletimer malfunction split times were unavailable.

Footnotes
NOBLE EMOTION came away well then showed good speed, set a joint pace in hand while inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear
when set down in upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under strong urging. BIG PACKAGE settled near the back on the outside, went
around the turn in the two path, remained in hand coming to the quarter-pole then was asked into upper stretch, dropped to the rail outside the furlong
marker, gained into the final sixteenth then moved out and finished with good energy for the place. CHARMED (GB) stumbled badly at the start and had the
rider lose his right iron for a sixteenth before regaining footing, moved out midway down the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch, jostled with a foe at the furlong marker and improved position to get the show. GYPSY KING bumped with a rival at the start, was rated off the pace,
dropped back in the four path while between horses on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch, jostled with a foe in the
vicinity of the furlong marker and just missed the show. BALLYDOOLEY (GB) was hustled from the start then taken back while crowded some between
horses, raced just off the pace under restraint, went four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. COLTON'S
COMMAND dropped back while crowded early, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole, steadied while
blocked behind a wall of horses in upper stretch, was asked briefly at the furlong marker but was quickly stymied again behind horses and lost all chance
while impeded all the way to the wire. KING JAMES was hustled from the start, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, jostled with foes
on both sides in the vicinity of the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE was hustled from the start then taken in hand
while in tight early, raced just off the pace under restraint, was hard held while rank near the seven-sixteenths, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused
at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop and also lacked the needed response. AMSDEN broke out then was corrected by the rider, set a
joint pace on the outside while in hand, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner outside the furlong
marker and weakened. BY GEORGE bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, moved up while tugging at the bit with seven-sixteenths to run,
drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked three wide into the stretch and came up empty.

engaging LAKE AVENUE in head to head combat through the final sixteenth nudging her main rival seventy yards from home when coming in slightly and
gamely got up in the last jumps to score. LAKE AVENUE three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before
angling out let out for the drive six wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with the aforementioned foe to issue a threat inside the eighth pole, collared the
leader a sixteenth from home already confronted outside by BELL'S THE ONE, knocked heads through to the finish getting nudged lightly seventy yards out
while fighting on game but was ultimately bested at the wire. AIN'T NO ELMERS dueled three then two wide down the backstretch with HONEY I'M GOOD
to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, floated three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shaking
off her main pace rival a furlong out when confronted by a pair to the outside, clung to the lead until the sixteenth marker before yielding, then kept on to
safely preserve the show honors at the finish. TRUTH HURTS crossed to the inside soon after the start, chased just off the duel along the rail coming under
light coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent to the furlong grounds before weakening in the
late stages. MISS MOSAIC coaxed from the start, chased just off the duel four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for
home and rallied offering up a mild bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late going. DON'T CALL ME MARY four wide in pursuit under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. REAGAN'S EDGE just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tucked
inside at the seven-sixteenths placed to urging, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HONEY I'M GOOD coaxed from the start,
dueled four then three wide with AIN'T NO ELMERS to her inside, tucked to the two path as her main pace rival took to the inside through the turn, came
under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, got floated four wide into upper stretch as AIN'T NO ELMERS went three wide at that juncture, dug in under a drive
to the eighth pole before tailing off through to the finish. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TELETIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN GOLD was bumped hard at the start, recovered well then went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn, responded
well when put to a crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging. PRAYER BOOK settled off the pace in the two path, moved to the three path around
the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast but was too late while clear for the place. BOLDISH
went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened but earned the show. CENTURION traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back, raced inside early on the far turn
then moved to the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch and improved position. BUNKER HILL went three
wide on the opening bend, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. EMPIRE ATTRACTION was hustled
from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked on the final turn, chased into the stretch and tired. ROMANTIC MAN was taken in
hand early, tugged hard at the bit under restraint into the first turn, saved ground near the back of the field, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
FLIGHT TO PARADISE went three to four wide on the turns, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. DECLAREATRUCE went three wide on the
first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
THEREGOESMYMIRACLE went two to three wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch then was guided further out and failed to threaten. PRIVATE
CODE broke out and bumped hard with a foe, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, went three then four wide on the far turn and was no
factor. READYSEEKGO broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, saved ground while well placed on the inside, was asked at the five-sixteenths,
dropped back into upper stretch and had nothing left.
