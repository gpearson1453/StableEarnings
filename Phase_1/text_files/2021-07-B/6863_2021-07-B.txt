Footnotes
LADY MAGNA broke on top, tracked NEW RULES from the eleven sixteenths, was pushed along while saving ground on the turn to keep NEW RULES in
her sights, went to a drive in upper stretch and began to close up the distance on that pacesetter, took the lead outside that foe at the sixteenth and cleared.
NEW RULES took the lead inside of LADY MAGNA a sixteenth of a mile into the race and soon opened up, continued well clear in the two path on the turn,
began to shorten stride approaching midstretch, was caught at the sixteenth mark, but found just enough to salvage the place. DON'T HOLD QUEENS
settled at the rear, continued well settled near the rear in the three path on the turn, began to take closer order from near the quarter pole, swung into the
lane in the six path, continued her outside rally but narrowly missed the place. ANGEL'S RUN chased the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two
path on the turn, swung out to the five path in upper stretch for the drive, ran on just inside of DON'T HOLD QUEENS but was outfinished by that foe. I
JUANA HERO chased the leading pair early outside of ANGEL'S RUN while racing near the center of the track, faded in the four to five path around the
turn, and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
FIELD LETTERS raced between horses early, chased the leaders on the outside up what remained of the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three
path, began an outside bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, gained ground in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. TEXAS RAIN provided
outside pressure on the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch, was
caught with a furlong to go and finished evenly. STOPSHOPPINGAMY dueled for the lead on the outside in the opening stages, took over to lead outright
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the stretch. SENSIBLE MYTH dueled for the lead on the inside in the opening
stages, settled in to track the leader from the rail through the next quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued
to fade from there. TRIPLE SCOUT stalked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and came
up empty in the stretch. PRIMARY CAUSE hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the three path around the turn, and
was never involved.

Footnotes
O'KEEFFE sent for pace, shook clear past the eleven sixteenths, continued to set the pace in the two path on the turn, went further clear when shaken up in
upper stretch and kept on clearly best under moderate urging. PIECE OF MY HEART stumbled in the opening strides, settled inside at the rear of the main
group, continued patiently in the two path on the turn, swung out three wide under a drive to the stretch, responded with a rally and got up for the place
outside of GRAY OWL in the final forty yards. GRAY OWL broke sharply, tracked O'KEEFFE from past the eleven sixteenths, tracked the leading pair into
the turn as KARAK advanced to closest range of the leader near the half, saved ground around the bend, was driven inside for a bid into the lane, proved no
match for O'KEEFFE, chased on willingly but lost the place late. COMPELLING SMILE soon trailed, took closer order while pushed along in the three to four
path on the turn, swung out to the lane in the seven path and was driven past tiring horses. KARAK stumbled in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair
through the opening furlong, switched outside of GRAY OWL and advanced to track O'KEEFE into the turn, chased that foe in the three path around the
bend, was driven two wide into the lane and weakened. LADY LAWYER chased two wide at the rear of the main group, continued to chase in the three path
around the turn, began to flatten out past the five sixteenths, was driven four wide into the lane but continued to fade.

UPBEAT MELODY broke quickly and lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held off a late closer to save the win. CLYDE'S GREEN GO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn, chased the eventual winner in upper stretch and gained ground steadily to the wire. BETTER THINK TWICE brushed with the horse
to his outside in the opening strides, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path to began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside down the lane. POWER THROUGH lugged in leaving the gate, recovered to race in the middle of the
pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and made a mild improvement of position in late stretch. NOBEL
pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the turn and faded in the stretch. DEBENTURE raced off the
pace on the inside through the opening three furlongs, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. STORM'S REFLECTION hopped up leaving the
gate, brushed with the horse to his inside and was subsequently pinched back, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the two path and weakened on the rail in the stretch. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT trailed the field throughout, raced wide in the three and four
path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
UNCLE EARL disputed the early pace inside of COMISKEY PARK, edged to a short lead past the five eighths, edged clear into the turn, set the pace in the
two path around the bend while still in hand, opened up slightly when pushed along into upper stretch, was driven through midstretch, and held when back
in hand late. MORRISTON was anxious in the gate, tracked well behind the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, bid two wide
into the lane and took closer order on UNCLE EARL, could not reel that one in but kept on willingly to the wire. GRAND HIDEAWAY chased toward the rear
inside early, was pushed along past the three eighths while saving ground, was driven three wide into the lane and rallied between horses, could not get to
the top two but continued to take gradually closer order to the finish. GEMO RAIN chased two wide toward the rear early, settled back to join the rear flight
into the turn, raced in the two path around the bend, improved between horses approaching the quarter, floated five wide into the lane, and offered mild
improvement outside horses in the final furlong. RADIANT CASTLE settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, improved slightly three
wide approaching the quarter, swung out into the lane six wide, and lacked the needed rally in the drive. COMISKEY PARK disputed the early pace two
wide, prompted outside of UNCLE EARL past the five eighths, tracked that leader while racing in the three path on the turn, and emptied out four wide from
upper stretch.

DANCE THE DAY AWAY stumbled and bumped hard with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled in to trail the field from the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch on the inside, saved ground around the far turn, swung wide to began a bid entering the stretch, and gained ground
on the outside down the lane to get up for the win just in time. PRESENT OF HERO saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, made a late surge in the final furlong and just missed the win. STRAIGHT UP SMARTY sprinted
clear to an early lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the rail around the far turn and was
caught late. WATCHIN THE WHEELS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside,
began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and weakened in late stretch. WANNA HAVE FUN saved ground at the back of the pack
around the first turn, began to move up on the inside while racing up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly on
the rail down the lane. SHE'S HOT TODAY saved ground around the first turn, raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far
turn from the two and three path and was outkicked on the outside from there. PAULETTE was bumped by the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in
the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and faded entering the
stretch.

FADE AWAY was shut off and took up in the opening strides, settled in second last year, chased inside of ANTRIM'S GIANT into the backstretch, continued
to chase midpack as that one settled back, kept on midfield in the two to three path on the far turn, shifted out past the five sixteenths, swung out six wide
into upper stretch, rallied under a drive, took the lead past CHRISTIAN C just inside the furlong mark, and drove clear. CHRISTIAN C broke inward, pressed
outside of BAROQUE the first time down the stretch, tracked that foe through the clubhouse turn, reengaged outside him near the three quarters, pressed
the pace two wide down the backstretch, vied outside of BAROQUE through the turn and three wide into upper stretch, fought on into the final furlong but
was outfinished by the winner. ANTRIM'S GIANT chased midpack early, raced two wide into the back straight, settled back into second last past the eleven
sixteenths, made a three wide bid into the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, sustained his rally, but was outkicked into the final furlong. AND WON
settled in last, was pushed along and took closer order in the four to five path on the far turn, was driven six wide in upper stretch and kept on past tiring
horses. HALF OF MANHATTAN tracked the pace while keen inside down the backstretch and through the first turn, continued to track the leading flight
down the backstretch and while saving ground around the far turn, bid between the rail and BAROQUE in upper stretch, but flattened out past the furlong
mark. BAROQUE set the pace inside while pressured by CHRISTIAN C down the stretch for the first time, cleared through the clubhouse turn, was
reengaged by CHRISTIAN C and FLEETWAY into the backstretch, set a pressured pace from there, vied on even terms inside of CHRISTIAN C through the
far turn and into the lane, was swarmed from both sides approaching midstretch, came up empty between horses past the furlong mark and faded.
FLEETWAY floated three wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair outside of HALF OF MANHATTAN, pulled to join the leading flight three
wide from the three quarters, briefly attended the pace, was wrangled back to track the leading pair from the nine sixteenths, raced between horses in the
tracking flight around the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SPEAK ENGLISH saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, bumped mildly with COUGER near
the half mile pole, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch, was passed with a furlong to go and dug in gamely
to reclaim the lead just before the wire. COUGER lugged in and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn,
raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, bumped mildly with SPEAK ENGLISH and LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS near the half mile pole, navigated
the far turn from the three path, and dueled gamely down the lane, just missing the win. MISSEN THE POINT raced at the back of the pack in the three path
through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid between horses nearing the three sixteenths pole and gained ground
late. GIRLS COUNT saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two
path and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, bumped mildly with COUGER approaching the far turn, moved up to challenge while saving ground from there, raced into tight quarters in
upper stretch and was outkicked on the rail in the final furlong. BIRD KEY raced into traffic and steadied slightly headed into the first turn, saved ground for
the next quarter of a mile, switched outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. AKA LIONESS
raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a mild bid from the two path around the far turn,
and flattened out in the stretch. LOCASH brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on
the inside the backstretch, angled out to run in the three path around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch. VALERIE VALESKI led the field from the
two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn, gave way with a furlong to go and
faded between horses from there. IMAGINE GOLD saved ground around the first turn, rated in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR was hustled
out of the gate, pressed the pace from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back headed into the far turn and tired while
saving ground around it and down the lane.
