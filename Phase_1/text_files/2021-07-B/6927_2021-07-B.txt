UNION SONG off slowly lagged through the turn circling out in upper stretch firing a sixteenth out sweeping clear six wide. LADY MARVEL stalked the pace
chasing into upper stretch extending near mid track ceding to outside pressure late. BLACK BUTTE fractious pre start was hustled along pursuing through
the turn saving ground to upper stretch holding well near the rail. LEADING INDICATOR fractious pre start was sent hard chasing through the turn angling
out six wide late finishing evenly. NORWEGIAN broke sharply setting the pace through the turn digging in from the three path upper stretch faltering late. AT
FIRST BLUSH a step slow through the turn played no factor. SCATERRA raced mid pack through the turn giving way in upper stretch.
