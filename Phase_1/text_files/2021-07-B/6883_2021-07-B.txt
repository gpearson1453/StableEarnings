Footnotes
MODUS OPERANDI was off slowly and moved up to stalk the pace, chased angling three-wide late turn, rallied, led a 16th out and held under a drive.
MIZZONA broke alertly then settled in mid pack, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive and was gaining
steadily. FINDING PERFECTION was bumped by FUTURE GAMES at the outset and in turn bumped FINEST JEWEL, raced off the pace, was hustled two
to four-wide on the turn then closed willingly through the stretch. H IS JUST A NUMBER set a pressured pace, shook clear early turn, widened a bit at the
top of the stretch but was passed a 16th out and gave way. BEAU'S BEAUTY raced in mid pack, chased along the rail on the turn and was all out in the
stretch but evened out late. SIMPLY MYSTERIOUS settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide through the turn then finished gamely but never reached
contention. FINEST JEWEL was bumped at the start and settled in mid pack, was steadied mid turn then lacked a late response. FUTURE GAMES broke
outward and bumped FINDING PERFERCTION, forced the pace, chased on the turn but retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
MASON'S GAMBLE was bumped at the start by a rival, pressed and stalked the leader down the backside, bid between on the turn, got the front when
inheriting the rail as the leader fell back turning for home and held on stubbornly down the lane, needing the wire desperately late. PERFECT CRIME taken
back early to off the pace, began a gradual rally while still in hand on the turn in the two path, continued to find room between rivals down the lane and was
inching up on the winner's flank at the wire but ran out of real estate. PRICELESS WILL along the rail in mid pack early, advanced on the fence and angled
out at the quarter pole to loom dangerous in upper stretch, was on his wrong lead to the seventy yard pole when switching leads but hung in the final stages.
MUSKOKA GIANT sat along the rail and off the pace, hustled hard to rally up the fence on the turn, was in behind the leader in mid stretch but stalled in the
final seventy yards. TOMCAT BLACK stalked while three wide on the backstretch, moved up to bid and lead briefly at the quarter pole but lost the front
turning for home and faltered in the final furlong. BOKERMIN in mid pack early, rallied two to four wide on the turn and into range of the leaders, came out
into the five path top of the stretch and closed mildly while widest without threatening. WHERES MY HALTER broke out at the start and bumped a rival,
gathered up to get the lead quickly, was stalked and pressed by the winner, headed by two foes nearing the quarter pole and retreated down the stretch.
JAMES BAY off the pace, was four to three wide on the turn and never entered contention. ANTE UP ALEX four wide and stalking early, floated out five
wide on the turn and dropped back nearing the quarter pole and in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AVIE'S FLATTER was slow to start, moved up inside and had a very nice rail trip behind the leaders, was sitting on tilt and steadying in behind on the turn,
angled out turning for home and got by the pacesetters near the eighth pole and lasted, his lead evaporating quickly late. OLYMPIC RUNNER began
sluggishly and was devoid of early foot, closed up the inside to be in behind the winner on the turn, angled out in midstretch and ran by the tiring pacesetters
to take aim at the leader but ran out of real estate and settled for the place spot. PROVEN STRATEGIES off the pace early, circled up three to four wide on
the turn into range of the leaders, out in the seven path at the top of the stretch and continued to close, inching up late without threatening the top pair.
GRAY'S FABLE sat in mid pack early and dropped back near the rear while in the two path on the turn, closed from midstretch to the wire with good energy
to grab a minor award. SILENT POET sped to the lead and was pressed by a rival throughout, gamely battled that foe into the stretch but was headed near
the eighth pole, tiring from there to the wire. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) stalked a rival and had a short lead on the turn, went head and head with that foe into the
stretch but tired in the final furlong. TAP IT TO WIN trailed the field and was two to three wide on the turn, swung out into six or seven path turning for home
but could not bid. ESKIMINZIN was three wide stalking throughout, loomed dangerously late on the turn but stalled in the final three sixteenths down the
lane.

LAPOCHKA was off slowly and settled in mid pack, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, rallied along the fence in the stretch then led in the
final furlong under a drive. DESOLATOR raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to four-wide on the final turn, was set down at the top of the stretch and
closed determinedly. THRESHOLD raced in mid pack, angled from two to five-wide through the far turn, was steadied behind a rival upper stretch then
rallied gamely. TAOS (FR) stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the far turn, bid near the 1/4 pole, was repelled upper stretch but dig in and chased to the
end. CARMENOOTZ hopped at the start, raced in striking range along the rail, was hustled on the far turn then finished gamely inside. COLEYVILLE broke
outward and settled off the pace, rode the rail then tipped out at the top of the stretch then rallied outside. CORDUROY ROAD set a pressured pace from
the rail, turned back TAOS upper stretch but tired in the final furlong. MONEY RIDE pressed the early pace, closed up and forced the issue on the
backstretch, continued to dog the leader on the far turn then tired upper stretch.

Footnotes
MISS FLOKI forced the pace, dueled on the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under a drive. RIDE THE WIND raced off the pace,
closed late backstretch and continued to gain three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. MUSICAL RIDE broke
outward, stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. RED FUJI bumped SPEEDY LYNN leaving the gate,
was rank and taken to the back of the pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. SPEEDY LYNN was bumped from both
sides leaving the gate, stalked the pace, came four then three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. WICKED MIAH closed
early backstretch, gained a short lead into the turn, was joined in a duel and was headed at the top of the stretch then lacked a closing response. MS. P'S
BELLA settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. AVIE'S SKY bumped with SPEEDY LYNN
leaving the gate and settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide through the turn but never reached contention. LEAVEYOUBREATHLESS forced
the early pace, stalked angling in from three-wide to the rail on the turn then showed some interest in the stretch run. A. A. FAST LIDA showed brief speed,
dueled to late backstretch, dropped back on the turn and lacked a closing response. CLASSY GIZMO showed brief speed pressing the pace, settled in mid
pack and came three and four-wide through the turn then lacked a rally. CRIMSON INVASION settled at the rear of the pack, saved ground on the turn and
finished evenly. RELOAD THE BANK stalked the pace along the rail, dropped back early turn and lacked a closing response.
