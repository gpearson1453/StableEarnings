Footnotes
TOCCATA vied for the early lead before the first call, shook clear into the turn, extended the advantage through the turn, continued to lengthen the lead into
the lane, was under a drive to the sixteenth pole then ridden out to the wire when well clear. LUCKY US raced along the inside down the backstretch, was
guided into the three path entering the turn, chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, had aim on that one when straightening in the lane raced
on her left lead through the lane and was no match while clearly second best. LAURA'S ANGLE raced near the rail into the turn, continued close to the
inside past mid-turn, angled into the three path nearing the quarter pole and moved up through the lane from the five path while not a threat. MOCHA in the
three path through the turn when in second flight, came into the lane from the three or four path and lacked a response. WARIS was never a factor while
along the inside. ADMIRAL'S GARNET vied for the early lead two wide, chased the pace through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

CABERTOSS set the pace on a clear lead while saving ground through the turns, asked for more entering the lane then widened while being kept to the
task. DEALIN' STELEN stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path, could not gain on the winner but kept
on to be clear for the place spot. JACK'S ADVANTAGE stalked the pace from the two path through the turn, weakened into the lane then kept on to be best
of the rest. AMERICAIN JOEY was never a threat while in the three path through the turns and into the lane. DOWN HOME KITTEN trailed for half while off
the inside, was in the three path in mid-turn when asked for more, swung into the lane from the sixth path and moved up while not a threat. FORT RAMSEY
saved ground through the turns and lacked a response. UCANTHANKMELATER chased the pace from the two path into the turn and was done soon after
the three-eighths pole.

stalked the pace in the four path, rallied late five wide and missed. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE broke outward, stalked in the three path, then had no late bid.
ARIAN RAE dueled outside of a foe, bid at the three-eighths pole to be clear but gave way in the stretch. BARTON HALL raced evenly. TIA FLOR led inside
for a half before giving way. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.
