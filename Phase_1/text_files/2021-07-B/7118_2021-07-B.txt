Footnotes
KEVIN'S FOLLY broke in at the start bumping MASTER GAME, raced three paths off the inside briefly and had MASTER GAME come outwards and altered
in to the two path before making his way to the rail near the half mile pole, had MASTER GAME come inwards directly in front into the turn, rode the rail
through the turn and cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied up the rail to take command a furlong out, then edged away to the finish kept to task. MASTER
GAME bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand briefly just off the inside before coming out to the three path forcing KEVIN'S
FOLLY to alter inwards to the rail, took to the rail himself directly in front of that rival half a mile from home and showed the way just off the fence through the
turn, came under challenge near the five-sixteenths from a pair of rivals, took the inside route into upper stretch, drifted off the inside and had KEVIN'S
FOLLY rally up the rail, got headed a furlong out, then ran on to chase that rival home clear of the rest. WOODLINE hustled from the gate, chased three
wide before making a three wide bid through the turn in tandem with HOIST THE GOLD to his outside from the seven-sixteenths into contention
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HOIST THE GOLD struck the near side stall at the
start getting away last and conceding five lengths to the front, chased five then four wide commencing a bid outside of WOODLINE at the seven-sixteenths
and moving in concert with that rival to issue a challenge to the front with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
drive. JURKOVEC four paths off the inside early on, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths and chased just off the inside through the turn coaxed
along from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch. MOVING PICTURES brushed the near side stall, then got
steadied off the heels of WOODLINE at the start conceding four lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung
four wide for home and trailed.

FLAT AWESOME JENNY settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside briefly half a mile from home before tipping back to the two path
three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and was just up in the final jump to prevail. SARATOGA BEAUTY three
then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the eighth pole, dug in
under lone threat and was nailed in the very last jump to the wire. CARTWHEEL chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. ANNIKA GOLD four to five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half mile
from home and advanced to take command at the seven-sixteenths shaking away through the turn to a safe lead, spun three wide for home, dug in under
threat and was caught a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. SEEDS OF TIME six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide
through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide for home and weakened. LADY BY CHOICE led early on seven paths off the inside
before being displaced by CATHY NAZ as the field spread a bit chaotic as the rider less horse threaded her way through foes until ultimately being safely in
front and to the outside, remained wide until tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. CATHY NAZ just off the inside in pursuit very early on, advanced to take command six furlongs out a bit cautiously handled keeping an eye
on the rider less animal to her outside, tucked inside half a mile from home and was overtaken at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and
tired. MISS LIANA stumbled badly at the start and lost the rider as a result. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start before the result was allowed to
stand and the race was declared official. Please note the race was hand timed due to a teletimer operator error recording the rider less horse at all points
through the race.

Footnotes
NOBLE CONQUEST saved ground while reserved towards the rear, was roused coming to the quarter-pole then swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied
outside to make a bid outside of three foes at the three-sixteenths, fought with the runner-up until near the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under steady
handling. BRENNAN'S WAR moved in while taken in hand, was rated towards the front under a snug hold, drafted while saving ground on the far turn, was
roused while cutting the corner through a rail opening into the stretch then made a bid inside of three foes, battled with the winner to near the sixteenth-pole
then proved no match while well clear for the place. HIGH TONE traveled around the first turn in the four path, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the
two to three path on the far turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch, battled under a drive while between horses, dropped back into the final furlong
and weakened while able to get the show. TOUGH WORKOUT was fractious in the gate, went to the front, lugged out into the first turn, dropped from the
two path to the rail on the first turn, set the pace with company to his outside, vied inside for most of the far turn then lugged out into the two path, lost the
advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BAY DEFENSE was fractious in the gate, raced in the two path on the initial turn,
settled towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, gained into upper stretch, moved out into the final furlong then drifted out around the sixteenth-pole
and flattened out. WICKED KARMA bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field, navigated
the far turn in the four path, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. PIVOTAL RUN bumped with a rival at the start, was
reserved in the two to three path, came under urging around the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch
and failed to rally. NIGHTSPOT traveled around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace while in hand, was asked between horses with three furlongs
to run, chased in the two path on the far turn, was carried six wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. TAMBURRO'S SOX brushed the inside of the
gate at the start, was taken in hand early, raced three wide under tight restraint on the opening bend, was rated on the outside, came under urging in the
three path on the far turn then chased the leaders, floated five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. ENROULE was off a couple of lengths slow,

upper stretch, got displaced from the front straightened away and ran on clear of the rest to preserve the place honors. CHASING CARA bobbled at the

under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. CARAMOCHA a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got

THREE TECHNIQUE broke a step slow. paused behind FIRENZE FIRE early after that foe was taken up, moved in midway down the backstretch, saved
ground under urging on the turn, moved to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. MISCHEVIOUS ALEX broke out but was

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL QUALITY four wide into the first turn, raced three wide through that opening bend before briefly settling five paths off the inside into the
backstretch, tucked four wide six furlongs from home and continued four wide into the far turn coming under urging near the three-eighths, got ridden along
through the latter portion of the turn and went five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under challenge to
the inside and gamely fended off the challenge to prevail at the end. KEEPMEINMIND three then two wide through the first turn, raced a bit unsettled and
pulling early on while near the rear of the field, went three then two wide down the backstretch before chasing just off the inside through the far turn getting
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled in, the rider making a smooth adjustment of his left iron just inside the quarter pole before taking the inside
route into upper stretch, rallied to dig in latched on inside of the aforementioned foe from the three-sixteenths to the finish fighting on gamely, but was
ultimately denied. MASQUEPARADE just off the inside through the first turn in closest aim of the leader, remained on hold tracking that rival until nearing
the three-eighths, advanced to take command at that station now engaged by WEYBURN to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
spun three wide for home set down for the drive, got collared at the three-sixteenths and dug in between foes briefly to the eighth pole, then kept on clear for
the show honors. WEYBURN three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide from just off the pace, advanced in tandem with the
aforementioned foe to overthrow the leader at the three-eighths, got let out spinning four wide for home, weakened in the stretch. DR JACK coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand along the inside uncontested until put to pressure nearing the three-eighths pole, got overtaken at that station and was lightly
coaxed through the latter portion of the turn being taken in hand and eased off while backing away to allow KEEPMEINMIND to take over the inside route at
the head of the stretch while tipping to the two path at that juncture for himself, then was not persevered with through to the finish while allowed to cross the
line under his own power.

Footnotes
CROSS BORDER was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging entering the final turn, rallied four wide into the
stretch, closed well to get the lead into the final furlong, shook clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) went three
wide for most of the opening bend then was forced four wide, tucked in behind horses early on the stretch for the first time, raced under reserve while mostly
in the two path, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, came three wide into the stretch then angled seven wide at the three-sixteenths and finished willingly
while still on his inside lead to garner the place. SHAMROCKET was unhurried while saving ground towards the rear, raced under urging on the final bend,
swung out turning for home then angled eight wide in upper stretch and improved position to just get the show. CHANNEL CAT went to the front, showed
the way while inside to the two path, was given his cue with seven-sixteenths to run, spun three wide into the stretch, drifted out outside the eighth-pole then
was headed into the final furlong and gave way grudgingly then lost the show. RED KNIGHT was tardy to begin, raced inside to the two path while reserved
near the back, traveled around the final turn under urging, came out under a drive into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MOON OVER MIAMI went
around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the final bend and was no factor. CHANNEL MAKER was
coaxed to show early speed then taken in hand, stalked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was roused leaving the backstretch, chased two to
three wide on the final turn, was carried five wide into the stretch and capitulated. BREAKPOINT (CHI) was taken in hand early, went two then three wide
while rank under restraint on the initial turn then was rated off the pace, settled more kindly after going a half-mile, was urged along with a half-mile to run,
dropped to the rail leaving the backstretch, was urged along the rail on the far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
THE LAST ZIP established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside, got set down cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under
threat from SHARP PROSPECT and repelled that rival confronted late by CLEAR VISION and held on to prevail. CLEAR VISION tracked the pace along
the inside from mid pack, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the three path at the three-sixteenths and rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong surging late, but ultimately missed at the end. TIZZARUNNER three wide into the first turn, settled just off the inside in
pursuit from mid pack, got let out spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot to just secure the show honors in the very last jump.
SHARP PROSPECT coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed four then three wide into the first turn before tucking to the two path midway, raced just
off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
latched on to the eventual winner through to the sixteenth marker before being ultimately repelled in the late stages. COUNTER OFFER coaxed from the
start, raced three wide into the first turn before tucking to the two path, tracked the front just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. BIRD'S EYE VIEW tracked the pace along the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, ran on to the finish but was outfinished in the late going. MOROCCO three then two wide in
pursuit, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on through the stretch and was outkicked. MANDATE four then three wide through the first
turn, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and offered no kick. ACKER three to four wide in
pursuit between rivals early on until shaking away from them five furlongs from home, went four then three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs
out, spun three wide for home and made no impact.
