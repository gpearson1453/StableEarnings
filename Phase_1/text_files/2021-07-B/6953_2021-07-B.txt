Footnotes
SARACEN broke alertly, showed the way in hand from just off the inside, was roused when challenged from outside into the second bend, moved clear
when put to a drive upper stretch, drifted out inside the last furlong, was straightened and held off CHERNYAHOVSKIY under steady handling.
CHERNYAHOVSKIY broke outward then reared up, was soon under control and kept close just behind SARACEN, angled out some on the second turn,
came four wide into the lane, took over second approaching the final sixteenth, was all out but did not have enough in the waning yards. NOT CHOPPED
LIVER was well placed from inside throughout but failed to have the extra needed deep stretch. MY CURBY pressed SARACEN from just outside, went for
the lead after a half mile, vied on even terms through the second bend, began to yield at the top of the lane and altered in some when the latter came out
inside the last eighth.

DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT hustled early to stay close, was just off the inside taking the turn, roused leaving the bend, took over midstretch and moved clear
inside the final sixteenth. AROSE FOR LYLA settled just off the inside, had the rail on the turn, fanned out behind DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT entering the lane,
altered out for a clear path upper stretch, made up minor ground the last eighth and caught CESSO for second in the waning yards. CESSO broke alertly,
was quickly clear of the rest but slowly wore down from inside for the stretch run. CREAL DREAMER raced in contention from outside, came into the lane
from path four, did not respond to urging and flattened. CREAL ANGEL angled in on the bend and had no late bid.

Footnotes
BEL BIMBO crowded briefly at the break, advanced from outside, angled in some entering the bend, moved clear for second, followed MARCO'S DREAM
into the stretch, altered inside that one soon after, edged ahead inside the last furlong and held on under steady handling. MARCO'S DREAM shared the
early lead from outside, moved clear nearing the turn, was challenged from outside on the bend, drifted out entering the lane, continued to gradually drift out
through the stretch and lacked the extra needed in the late going. PURGING THE STONE prominent just off the inside, moved clear for third upper stretch
then could only hold his position in the waning yards. COOL AMBITION pressed the early leaders while in a narrow path between rivals, was checked
solidly when his path narrowed further approaching the three-furlong marker, stayed between rivals through the bend, came into the stretch from path three
and found best stride too late. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) raced in contention from outside rivals for a half mile then began to flatten. FAIRWAY LANE broke a bit
outward, soon disputed the pace inside MARCO'S DREEAM but began to yield along the rail before finishing three furlongs. The rider and trainer of COOL
AMBITION lodged an objection alleging interference from BEL BIMBO into the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE soon had a clear lead, was relaxed between rivals on the backstretch, had the inside on the second turn, was let out leaving that
bend, widened command upper stretch and maintained full control under a mild drive the final furlong. DIAMOND GUCCI advanced outside to vie for the
lead on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide leaving the second bend, was no match for ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE in the lane but proved easily second
best. RONAN was a contender just off the inside in the early going, in path three through the second turn and had no stretch bid. RANGOON ATTACK was
reluctant to load, well placed from inside once the race began but gave way the last three furlongs and distanced herself from the field through the stretch.
Due to a malfunction, the first quarter mile fraction was unavailable.

DEAUVILLE MIST in the second flight between rivals, advanced four wide on the turn, rallied to gain the advantage midstretch, edged ahead and held off
LIL BIT TIPSEY under steady handling. LIL BIT TIPSEY prominent from outside, lost ground widest through the bend, threatened with a furlong to go, could
not close the gap on the leader but gained second nearing the wire. SACRED STORM stumbled into LONG LEGGED LINDA at the break, recovered to
press the early leaders, took over three wide on the turn then slowly yielded in the lane. WELL MAID was just off the inside on the turn, angled out widest of
all upper stretch and passed some tired ones. LONG LEGGED LINDA displayed early speed between horses, gained the rail on the bend then gave way the
last two furlongs. SEA MY MOVES disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
CHICKS FOR FREE rated on the front end from outside, moved clear from path three when allowed on the turn, responded to mostly hand urging and
proved much the best. W W RUSSIAN GOLD shared the early lead between rivals, did not stay with CHICKS FOR FREE on the turn, angled outside that
one upper stretch, drifted out some with a sixteenth left, was straightened and caught FIXICO for second. FIXICO displayed early speed from inside, moved
clear for second upper stretch, was no match for CHICKS FOR FREE and slowly wore down inside the last furlongs. TURN YOUR EYES left the gate at
nearly a walk, regained a stride after the first sixteenth, stayed well off the inside throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
HE HAS NO FRIENDS broke alertly, soon shared the lead outside HE'S A FINE MAN, moved clear when allowed on the bend, stayed just off the inside,
lengthened command under a drive in the lane, began to drift out inside the last furlong under left-handed pressure, was straightened in the waning yards
and prove much the best. STRATUS STORM without early speed, picked up his pace three wide on the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch,
gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure inside the final eighth and was clearly best of the others. BONNIE DANCES in the second flight on the
backstretch, failed to keep up two wide on the bend, fanned to the outside for the stretch run and passed some tired ones. CELIA'S DANCE helped prompt
the early pace outside BONNIE DANCES, gained second on the turn, took the rail into the stretch and gave way. HE'S A FINE MAN was hustled from the
gate, his rider lost his whip after the first sixteenth of a mile, vied for the lead along the rail to the final three furlongs, began to yield, floated out some
entering the lane and continued to give way. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.
