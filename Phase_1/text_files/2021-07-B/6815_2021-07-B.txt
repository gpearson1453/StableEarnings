Footnotes
MADEMOISELLE NOVA in range, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, took command in the final furlong and widened under a hand ride. FRANKEL AT
ASCOT (FR) pressed the pace, chased three and four-wide on the final turn, rallied gamely but was outkicked by the winner. DANCE WITH DESTINY
showed speed, dueled, led into the far turn, moved clear, opened up at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the drive, was passed in the final furlong
and lost the place position in the late stages. SAUCY CAT settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, rallied gamely but failed to menace.
CON THIEN broke inward, stalked the pace, was taken back a bit and moved off the rail, chased into the stretch, came back to the fence but evened out in
the final furlong. SHES THE NORTH dueled, forced the issue on the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally. QUINTE ROAD pressed the
pace, dropped back while four and five-wide through the far turn then had no response in the stretch.

in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide on the far turn, then evened out in deep stretch. CHALDEA led early, set a reserved pace, was under a ride on
the far turn but was passed at the top of the stretch and chased to no avail. TRICKERATION broke outward, closed on the backstretch to gain striking
range, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then flattened out in the final furlong. AMBITIOUS PRINCESS stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on
the far turn but lacked a closing response. ELFIN FOREST raced from off the pace, was hustled hard along the rail on the far turn but lacked a rally.

BETWIXTING raced in mid pack, closed four then three-wide late turn, took command a furlong out and widened under a hand ride. VEIL pressed the pace,
chased into the stretch, rallied gamely and was clearly second best. REAL COAL broke alertly, was headed approaching the turn, forced the pace, bid mid
turn, had the lead but was passed with a furlong on tap. NISHA raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, lugged in through the stretch
then failed to menace. EVER SO D'WILD, at the rear of the tightly knit pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide late turn then finished under a
determined drive. FRESH DREAMS settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. SWEET YARE N DIRA
moved up to lead into the turn, set a pressured pace, was headed late turn and retreated through the stretch.

CAPABLE raced in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the far turn, rallied, led a furlong out and held, driving. STORMY VISION settled off the pace, rode
the rail on the far turn, angled out with a furlong to run and rallied gamely but missed. WIDE AWAKE broke outward and settled in mid pack,raced two and
three-wide on the far turn, blocked upper stretch, veered out and launched a sharp rally. SWEET SHADES stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to
three-wide on the far turn, got up close in the stretch but weakened late. SAVVY'S SISTER led into the first turn, set a reserved pace, was swallowed up in
the final furlong. CANDY'S DREAM raced in mid pack, was along the rail throughout, launched her bid a furlong out but failed to sustain the drive in the late
stages. VINYASA settled off the pace, came two and three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. SHE'S A TRUE FOX raced in mid pack, came
three-wide through the first turn and chased three to five-wide through the far turn but had no late response. SAMURAI FIGHTER settled in mid pack, was
hustled four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. JOY'S SOLUTION was herded outward leaving the gate, settled off the pace,
was hustled along the rail on the far turn and never reached contention. MUSKOKA LADY, whose jockey did not carry a whip, was off slowly, raced in mid
pack, dropped back late turn and did not menace.

SALTY AS CAN BE set a pressured pace from the rail, dueled into the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under a light drive.
IMAGERY settled at the rear of the tightly knit pack, saved ground, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. PLEDGE forced the issue, dueled into the
turn, chased to the stretch and finished gamely. CHARGINA raced at the rear of the pace but was still in striking range, came two-wide through the turn,
chased into the stretch and finished with a determined drive. DRUNK DIAL pressed the pace, came three-wide through the turn, challenged the leader
approaching the top of the stretch but was quickly headed and chased to the end.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY FAN settled in midpack along the inside, moved up looking for a seam on the fence late backstretch but had to steady when the hole
disappeared, bided her time in back of the leaders into the stretch and came off the rail looking for room in upper stretch, shooting back to the inside when
the pacesetters drifted out, getting the lead at the eighth pole and widening in the final sixteenth. SILENT AND SMART chased the pacesetter along the
fence inside two rivals, dropped back to be in behind the two leaders turning for home, came off the rail in upper stretch and had room but the needed spurt
to take advantage of it never came and the hole closed, dipping back to the inside in the late stages to garner the place spot. BLU SKY SUNRISE was hard
held between rivals in mid pack down the backside, moved up while hard held into range two to three wide on the turn, floated out to the five path turning for
home and was game to hold the show while running on her wrong lead down the lane. BABY DRIVER stalked and pressed the leader into and around the
turn, was head and head for the front in upper stretch with that foe, and exchanging bumps down the lane, lasting for a minor award. RULE THE SEA was
left when hitting the gate and stumbling after the break, commenced a long, gradual rally to get in behind the lead pack late on the turn, dropped off a bit in
upper stretch but was rallying again in the final seventy yards in a solid effort. CLASSY MISTRESS off the pace and along the rail throughout until upper
stretch when rallying mildly in the final furlong without threatening. SHISHKA went straight to an open length lead, was hounded and pressed around the
turn, stayed in the battle for the front while exchanging bumps with a rival in midstretch and tired in the final sixteenth. IN PURSUIT chased in midpack while
four to five wide down the backstretch, moved up mildly while three to four wide on the turn and was out in the seven to eight path turning for home, laying in
down the lane while still widest. SAN NICOLA STAR broke in and was steadied at the break, moved up to chase three to five wide on the turn before drifting
out into the eight or nine path turning for home, dropping back down the stretch. YOU THRILL ME had no early speed and was always far behind.

STERLING SPEED, in range, angled from the rail to three-wide mid turn, chased into the stretch, bid in the final furlong and shook free then finished under a
hand ride. SOUPER PECAN settled off the pace, moved to the rail entering the turn, closed steadily, took the lead upper stretch but failed to hold the winner
safe. MISS BOBBIT, rated at the back of the pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied
outside. LINDA LOVES LACE forced the early pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. HIGH SOCIETY
GIRL dueled, came in from three to two-wide late turn, was headed at the top of the stretch then chased to the end. NERO DAVOLA dueled from the rail,
scooted to the lead at the top of the stretch but was quickly passed and gave chase. SILENT GUROO dueled two-wide, dropped back a bit late turn, chased
into the stretch and evened out. LADY KRATOS forced the pace, bid into the turn, battled four-wide, lost ground at the top of the stretch then evened out.

off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn then rallied widest. GIGI'S GIFT was bumped by CANADIAN ESSENCE at the outset, set a pressured
pace, dueled into the stretch, was headed 3/16th from the wire and chased to the end. CLIFF'S HEAD broke a step slowly but got up to press the early
pace, was taken back to stalk the pace late backstretch then again early turn, closed four-wide late turn then posted a mild rally through the stretch. SIMPLY
A ZOOMER was off a step slowly, forced the pace, dueled along the rail into the stretch was passed upper stretch and finished all out to no avail.
CANADIAN ESSENCE bumped by EVERYMINITEVRYHOUR leaving the gate, was up close early, chased three then two-wide on the turn, lost her path
mid stretch and evened out. EVERYMINITEVRYHOUR broke inward and bumped CANADIAN ESSENCE at the start, causing a domino reaction including
the two horses to her inside, was rated off the pace, came running late turn but evene dout in the final 16th. DONT WAKE THE BEAR got away a bit slowly,
pressed the pace, stalked from the rail on the turn, chased to the final furlong and evened out.
