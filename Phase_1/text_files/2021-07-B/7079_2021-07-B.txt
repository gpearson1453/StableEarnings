Footnotes
BAD BOY tracked along the inside, saved ground around the turns before tipping outside of the clear leader approaching the furlong pole, bid for the lead
inside the final furlong along with an outer STOCK DEAL, and edged away from that foe late. STOCK DEAL pressed the pace setter from the outside, but
failed to keep pace with that foe around the far turn, sustained the chase from between horses in upper stretch to rebid in the final furlong as the leader
tired, but was outfinished by an inner foe. FULCO set the pace along the inside, shook clear around the far turn, but tired in midstretch, and was bested by a
pair of outer rivals in the late stages. URBANITE trailed, attempted to circle the field four wide around the far turn, but only produced a mild gain, then failed
to sustain that bid through the lane. WILSHIRE DIAMOND lied off of the pace two wide, inched close three wide around the far turn, but flattened out in
midstretch.

then held place on his left lead. DIVA DIXIE stalked three wide, bid briefly at the quarter pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. GREEDY ALGORITHM
failed to factor. VIMONT was off slowly, then showed little.

Footnotes
MAMA RINA stalked the clear leader two wide around the first turn, inched closer to prompt the pace at the five furlong pole, vied between horses around
the far turn before failing to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, but kept on under a long drive to rebid simultaneously with a foe-splitting BALI KULA
a sixteenth out, then reached that foe on the wire. BALI KUTA stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader approaching the furlong grounds
while inside of MAMA RINA, surged between horses to forge an advantage inside the final sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire by her outer bidding
counterpart. ALREADY CHARMING set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes around the far turn, shook clear in upper
stretch, held sway through midstretch while under steady hand urging, but was roused at the sixteenth pole as outer foes menaced, then was bested by
them in the late stages. GIDDY UP ZOEY tracked from midpack two to three wide, gained into and around the far turn to press the pace turning for home,
but flattened out in upper stretch. SURPRISING tracked along the inside before shifting two wide into the backstretch, but faded around the far turn.
JEWELOFAKID settled at the rear of the field around the first turn, trailed around the far turn before shifting three wide entering the lane, and improved
without factoring. BECKYNKARI failed to make an impact. YELLOW CREEK ROAD lied at the rear of the field in the three path around the first turn, tucked
into the backstretch, but was outrun thereafter.

GIANNA'S GIFT stalked outside of the clear leader while in the four path around the turn, ranged up in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, then
battled under a long drive before forging an advantage passing the sixteenth pole. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY cleared off early on, maintained a clear margin
while in the three path around the turn, but hung on her left lead through midstretch as GIANNA'S GIFT menaced, and was headed by that foe passing the
sixteenth pole. HINDSIGHT tracked two wide and from between horses around the turn, claimed show from those rivals entering the lane, and chased the
leading pair home well while aiming for a rail bid. POCA MUCHA bobbled a bit soon after the start, lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, and failed
to factor. DOWNSIDEPROTECTION saved ground from midpack around the turn, but faded.

Footnotes
MOMOA cleared off early on, maintained that loose advantage around the turn, kicked on at the furlong grounds with JURA giving chase, and held firmly to
the wire under driving pressure. JURA was off a step slowly, lied off of the pace three wide into the turn, rallied four wide turning for home to claim place at
the furlong grounds, and chased the clear leader home well to prove second best. PRAIRIE tracked the pace two wide, shifted three wide entering the lane
while getting outkicked by JURA, then stayed on through the final furlong to reach show late. MAKAI stalked three wide, then two wide around the turn, but
faded in upper stretch. URBAN HOPE saved ground at the rear of the field, shifted two, then five, wide turning for home, and improved without threatening.
STEELY DANZA stalked two wide, then from the inside into the turn, but tired in upper stretch. THIRTYEIGHT tracked along the inside early on, but steadily
faded. OP ED broke outwardly and was off slowly, lied at the rear of the field two to three wide, got floated six wide turning for home, and was outrun.

Footnotes
DERBY DATE stalked three wide before vying outside of JACK VAN BERG into the turn, took over from that foe approaching the quarter pole, and drew off
through the lane under driving pressure. BREW CREW pressed two wide early on, took back to stalk into the turn, then stayed on inside of JACK VAN
BERG through the final furlong to bid for place, and reached that foe on the wire. JACK VAN BERG set the pace along the inside of a pressing DERBY
DATE into the turn, but proved no match for that foe approaching the quarter pole, shifted outside of that foe in upper stretch and managed place well into
the late stages, but was nailed on the wire by an inner foe for that position. BIG NICK trailed along the inside, shifted four wide entering the lane, and
improved for a minor reward. TKOTCHKE settled far off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide turning for home, stayed on outside of BIG NICK through the
lane, but failed to best that foe for a minor share. EDGE TO EDGE stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane. OXXON lied off of the pace three
wide, but faded at the five sixteenths pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
ICE QUEEN settled at the rear two wide, shifted four wide while commencing a rally turning for home, surged outside of the leader in the late stages, and
got up on the wire. TEMPER TIME stalked three wide, bid around the far turn, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, but was nailed on the wire.
PENTAGON tracked from midpack, stalked two wide around the far turn, shifted inside of the leader in midstretch, then stayed on, but did not have enough
to produce a bid. CASHABLE set the pace, showed the way from a pair of outer pressing foes around the far turn, but weakened at the furlong grounds. LA
BELLA ROSA saved ground at the rear around the first turn, attempted a four wide rally around the far turn, but failed to threaten. MISS AMERICANA
pressed two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. JIM'S BRONZE STAR stalked along the inside,
but faded. MS TEMPTATION lied off of the pace two to three wide, and was done early.
