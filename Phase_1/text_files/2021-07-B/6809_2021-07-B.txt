Footnotes
AREYOUINABAND closet to the dueling leaders toward the inside early, shifted out when advancing on that pair exiting the turn, challenged on the outside
past the furlong marker, late duel, proved best in determined fashion. SWEET PRAYERS last away, began a steady advance toward the inside through the
turn, got through along the rail while continuing to improve into the lane, steered out, challenged inside the winner and between horses with a furlong
remaining, outkicked in the late going, clear for the place. FANCY MALLORY void of speed just off the inside, angled out when advancing midstretch,
finished willingly to be well clear of the others. STELLA'S SURPRISE went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. RED RED WINE broke
alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to help show the way past the furlong marker, faltered soon after. LUCKY EVERY DAY settled off the
pace and the inside, came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally while remaining well wide. NINEONEONEPRAYER dueled up front while off the
inside, stopped from between foes the final furlong. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO ISLAND broke back after being bothered, trailed early off the inside, improved from between horses midway on the turn, dropped inside for
the drive, moved back out when rallying, ran right on by the leader with a sixteenth remaining, well clear late. SANDRA'S JUEL closest to the early leader,
advanced inside and dueled turn, shook well clear into the lane, continued to show the way daylight midstretch, proved no match for the winner, remained
clear for the second spotl. LIBERTY DIAMOND void of speed inside, continued to save some ground turn, steered out widest for the drive, along for the
show while not a threat to the top two. PAC FOR HAWAII under went a shoe repair in the paddock, broke out to bother the winner, was straightened to race
forwardly into the turn, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, hung in the drive. MISS LINDA LOU showed the way up the backstretch in the
two path, allowed the runner the inside for the turn, dueled through the bend with that foe, gave way in the drive. RAY RAE'S RUNNER finished early, trailed
home.

Footnotes
PUZZLING PRIORITY broke back, was outrun early while saving some ground, tipped out three wide when advancing exiting the turn, engaged the leader
approaching the furlong grounds, wore that rival down under firm handling. BUILDING HOME away in good order, narrowly showed the way up the
backstretch and through the turn off the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage when straightened for home, responded when confronted by the
winner soon after, proved stubborn to the end while edging clear for the second spot. MY LITTLE FIRE broke on top, dueled up front inside the runner up
until a furlong remained, gave ground grudgingly to that foe and the winner in the final run to the wire. ENDURING PEACE in mid pack while racing outside,
four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late punch. SOPHIE'S PRAYER in mid pack, came five wide out of the
turn, also found lacking for the stretch run. MAVE RUNNER broke back, moved up to race within striking distance for three furlongs, had little left for the
drive. SOMTHINGSCANDALOUS trialed throughout in showing little.

LOUISIANA HERO void of speed, began go move closer through the turn off the inside, encountered some traffic nearing midstretch, brushed, dug in and
closed with good determination to prove best late. HUFFS TAZ A BOO last away, also devoid of early foot, swung out five wide turning for home, finished
willingly down the middle of the strip to be in time for the place. NATEALYZE in the second flight while racing outside, came three wide into the lane, bid
past the furlong marker, brushed with the winner then flattened to be outkicked at the wire. SOUL SONG pressed the issue early off the inside, challenged in
the turn, took over into the lane and showed the way past midstretch then faltered when confronted soon after. MAY HOUR in mid pack for a half off the
inside, behind traffic to lack clear room inside the furlong marker, dropped to the rail then came up empty when clear clear late. FLASHYBOY BOBB away in
good order, set the pace inside, began to weaken when straightened for home, was continuing to weaken with less than a furlong remaining when put in
tight. OUTLAW X. within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. THUNK finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
GLANCE pressed the early leader off the inside through the first turn, dueled the middle half in the two path, put the other speed away turning for home,
pulled away steadily through the lane while being kept to pressure. CALIFORNIA KATIE took control along the inside soon after the start, dueled with the
winner up the backstretch and into the far turn, could not keep up with that one in the drive, clearly second best. MISS NEKO fell back to trail before a
quarter, continued to lag while in the two path into and through the final turn, dropped to the inside for the stretch run,drew well clear of the rest, no threat to
the top pair. HANDSOME GIRL within striking distance of the top two, continued to chase that pair into and past upper stretch, weakened late to lose the
show spot. PRETTI SAVI also raced within striking distance of the top two, three wide into the lane, faltered as well in the run to the wire. KODIAK SKY one
paced in mid pack had nothing for the drive. QUEEN OF CARNIVAL was never involved.

Footnotes
BAR TAP outrun early, asked along far turn, began a steady advance soon after, three wide into the lane when under a right handed crop, collared the
leader nearing the furlong marker, quickly clear, held the runner up safe late. FOUR PRINCESSES also lacked any early foot, continued well back out of the
turn, angled out for room when straightened for home, finished well down the middle of the strip while too late for the winner. ORB'S SOUL last away, back
early as well, improved late in the turn, three wide into the lane, continued with moderate interest to the wire to finish best of the rest. SUCKERFORAGREY
broke alertly, cleared soon after, showed the way through the turn by daylight, faltered when headed by the winner nearing midstretch. GALAXY THIRTYSIX
forwardly placed for a half, had little left for the drive. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA within striking distance for four furlongs outside, weakened. BLONDIE LOX
BABE prompted the issue early and began a steady retreat before a half. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS void of speed, steered out five wide late in the turn,
came up empty for the stretch run. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

STRONG RULES broke out, was straightened to work his way clear before a quarter off the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, drew out strongly
through the lane while being kept to task. DRILLING REPORT chased the winner from along the inside, continued pursue that one the middle half, had little
for that same foe through the lane, clearly second best. WISE ANCHOR in the second flight off the rail, turned in an even effort to finish up best of the
others. MUFFIN NUTS remained back in failing to threaten. DUSTY BOY last away, was never a factor while racing outside.

Footnotes
C C CROWN'S CHOICE broke sharp, soon sprinted clear, rated through turn, shrugged off a mild bid from a couple of rivals turning for home, well clear
again and was not threatened in the run to the wire while kept to pressure. CUSTOM FOR ALY broke back, dropped inside while outrun up the backstretch,
saved ground turn, slipped through along the rail turning into the stretch, not a serious threat to the winner while clear of the others. BEAR TOOTH PASS
fell back to trail after the start, continued well back through the turn, steered out six wide turning for home, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to
be up in time for the show. SHANGHAI HETTY settled in mid pack, continued evenly through the lane in lacking a serious closing response. BELINDA
carried out at the break, raced back for three furlongs, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals. ACHANCETOWIN within striking distance in the
early going, came up empty for the drive. ZUMBERTA broke out, raced in the second flight in a forward position outside, five wide into the lane, tired in the
run to the wire. TENSAS SUNDAY failed to menace in remaining always back. ROARING QUINN forwardly placed while off the inside, four wide through
the turn, gave way in the drive. VALID BREAK broke with the winner, chased that one early and stopped.
