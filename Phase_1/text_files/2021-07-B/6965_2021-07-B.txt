Footnotes
SUPRISE CAT dueled for the lead on the inside early, dropped back slightly to chase the leader from the two path around the turn, split horses in tight
quarters nearing the quarter pole, bumping lightly with TWO COOKIE RULE in the process, kicked clear entering the stretch and held his margin while
drifting out mildly late. RIP IT RYAN bumped with the horses to either side and was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung out entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. Z U AT THE RACES bumped
with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to race in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path
and gained ground mildly in the final furlong. DICK THE BRUISER bumped with the horses to either side of him and was pinched back leaving the gate,
raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly on the rail. TWO COOKIE RULE
pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, was bumped mildly by SUPRISE CAT near the quarter pole,
raced evenly in upper stretch and weakened late. YALIKEANYTHING dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while
saving ground around the turn and tired on the rail in the stretch.

Footnotes
BRIDGEKEEPER chased the leading pair inside of CONI'S COUP, began to gradually advance in the two path on the far turn, bid into the lane two wide,
began to drift out but nonetheless took the lead near the furlong mark, kept drifting out despite the right-handed crop, and held. DYNABLUE settled at the
rear, began to inch closer down the backstretch, improved in the two to three path on the far turn, was driven into the lane in the three path in range, rallied
inside of horses, but missed. CONI'S COUP came in and bumped LOOT THE MOON in the opening strides, chased the leading pair outside of
BRIDGEKEEPER, took closer order in the four path on the far turn, raced into the lane five wide, and chased on mildly under a drive while proving no match
for the top two. BASEBALL POLITICS bumped with BEHAVIN MYSELF early, cleared into the clubhouse turn, continued to set the pace while taking brief
pressure from LOOT THE MOON down the backstretch, continued on the pace in the two path through the far turn, led to midstretch, was headed by
BRIDGEKEEPER at the furlong mark and weakened. BEHAVIN MYSELF was bumped soundly between horses early and took back to second last as a
result, settled toward the rear, continued toward the rear in the five path on the far turn and four wide into the lane, and offered no rally. LOOT THE MOON
was bumped by CONI'S COUP in the opening strides and then came in to bump BEHAVIN MYSELF, tracked the leader into the clubhouse turn, was keen
to put a little more pressure on him down the backstretch, tracked in the three path around the far turn, floated four wide into the lane while proving no match
for the leaders, and emptied out.

EDISON FIRE pressed the pace on the outside in the early going, moved up to duel from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held his margin to the wire while drifting mildly late. GIANT'S FORREST settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve
position while racing in the three path around the turn, and chased the winner home down the lane, the best of the rest. BEAST MODE trailed the field on
the inside up the backstretch, began to move up from the two path around the turn, and was outkicked from there. CLOUD TO GROUND led the field on the
inside through the opening half mile, dueled while saving ground around the turn, and tired on the rail in the stretch.

ENGLISH CHALLENGE broke a step slowly, settled at the rear to track the leading pair, continued while settled behind that pair down the backstretch and
into the far turn in the three path, went to hand urging approaching the three eighths, swung out toward the center of the track into the lane, rallied under a
continued hand ride in upper stretch, was briefly shown the crop midstretch, caught HARDLY A SECRET past the furlong mark and held sway ridden out.
HARDLY A SECRET led inside into the clubhouse turn, took light prompting from DOLLAR BLUE to his outside down the backstretch, was engaged by that
foe in earnest past the half, vied inside of him while racing in the two path on the far turn, shook off DOLLAR BLUE from the quarter, cleared to midstretch,
was caught by ENGLISH CHALLENGE shortly after the furlong mark, was held at bay from there but chased on with interest to the wire for place. DOLLAR
BLUE stalked the pace behind and outside of HARDLY A SECRET through the clubhouse turn, prompted him lightly down the backstretch, engaged outside
him in earnest past the half, vied in the three path from the seven sixteenths to the quarter, was turned back by HARDLY A SECRET into the lane, chased
on between horses but ultimately did not have enough. DUE TO A THUNDERSTORM DELAY THE RACE WAS CONTESTED 45 MINUTES PAST ITS

Footnotes
BALLYBRACK LASS settled on the outside in the middle of the pack for the long run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid
between horses nearing the three sixteenths pole and gained ground quickly from there to get up in time. LION LOVE tracked the leaders between horses
early, raced outside headed into the turn, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch
to pull clear and was caught in the final strides. MISS COMMISH pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to
chase the leaders up what remained of the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. HER GOLD
MINE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, and weakened on
the rail late. WILDWOOD MAGGIE trailed the field well off the pace through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn, improved position slightly
in upper stretch and was no match. SEVEN SEVENTEEN dueled for the lead between horses in the opening stages, raced inside for the next quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch. CATNIP KITTEN stumbled and lost her rider leaving the gate, raced with the field around
the oval, was caught after the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CHINOBE was placed on the lead, settled well while setting the pace down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, was pushed along in
hand near the three sixteenths and driven near the eighth pole, and held safe under a hand ride through the final sixteenth. ONE PUTT RICHIE was
bumped by HUEY ATTACK in the opening strides, tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper
stretch, could not reel in the pacesetter but chased on evenly to prove second best. ETCHED IN STONE settled at the rear, was driven two wide from the
three eighths, swung into the lane in the three path, drifted inward slightly though never made contact with HUEY ATTACK, at which point his rider switched
to his left handed stick and struck him once after swinging his arm up and out, then appeared unperturbed as the rider of HUEY ATTACK crossed his left
arm over to swing his crop at them, angled out slightly away from HUEY ATTACK after one more left-handed strike from his own rider, and lacked the
needed rally in the lane. HUEY ATTACK broke inward and bumped ONE PUTT RICHIE in the opening strides, chased the leading pair down the
backstretch, was pushed along near the three eighths while saving ground around the turn, went to a left handed drive inside into the lane, appeared
unperturbed as ETCHED IN STONE came in slightly from just outside of him, kept on as his rider lifted his left handed stick over his body to land his crop
near ETCHED IN STONE and his rider, went back to a drive from his rider after that, and weakened.

Footnotes
LOCAMOTOR was away from the gate quickly, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch,
shifted over a lane near the eighth pole but quickly straightened out and drew off to the wire. LOST IN MANHATTAN stalked the leaders on the outside up
the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. MERLIN'S SONG raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. JEFF THE LION raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, raced into traffic entering the stretch, found room outside and
gained some ground late. CAJUN MOON tracked the leaders on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the turn and weakened on
the rail in the stretch. SCHMOOZIN trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn at the back of the pack in the two path, and
was never involved.

Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY raced midpack into the clubhouse turn, dropped to the inside past the fifteen sixteenths, chased inside of CHANGI around the rest of the first
bend, tracked the leading trio down the backstretch and while situated two wide behind that leading line through much of the far turn, dropped toward the rail
and bid inside of FRONTANA approaching the quarter, vied inside that foe to midstretch while under a drive, and edged clear in the final furlong.
FRONTANA tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, encroached outside of WAR CHEST into the far turn, led at the
three eighths between horses, was confronted by FLY NIGHTLY to his inside approaching the quarter, vied outside that foe in upper stretch, and was
outfinished in the final furlong. CAMMACK settled in the rear flight outside of MEMORY BANK, was pushed along into the far turn, improved position while
driven in the six path around that bend, sustained his rally five wide in the lane and proved best of the rest. MEMORY BANK came in and bumped
BULLDOG OF BERGEN in the opening strides, was put in tight when CHANGI came in, settled at the rear inside of CAMMACK into the clubhouse turn,
continued in the rear flight inside that foe around the first bend and down the backstretch, took closer order in the two path on the far turn, angled out five
wide into upper stretch, and kept on mildly past tiring horses. BULLDOG OF BERGEN was bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled toward
the rear through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took closer order in the four to five path around the far turn, chased on in the three path into
the lane and gradually flattened out. BENELUX came out in the opening strides and bumped BULLDOG OF BERGEN, tracked the leading pair into the
clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, loomed three wide to the quarter, but emptied out under a drive into the lane and
weakened between horses. WAR CHEST cleared into the clubhouse turn, set the pace inside, was confronted by FRONTANA into the far turn and headed
by that foe near the three eighths, began to weaken inside when headed and continued to fade down the lane. CHANGI came inward in the opening strides,
chased outside of FLY NIGHTLY through the clubhouse turn, chased midpack down the backstretch, was outpaced while racing in the four to five path on
the far turn, and had no further response under a drive in the lane.
