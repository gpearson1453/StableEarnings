Footnotes
PITAMAN attended the pace two wide down the backstretch, engaged outside of IRISH LIGHTED ROAD and took the lead near the half, carried a narrow
lead two wide around the turn and into upper stretch, cleared when driven from the eighth to the sixteenth, and held clear while taken in hand late. IRISH
LIGHTED ROAD led inside of PITAMAN early, attended the pace inside of that foe from the half mile mark, went to a drive in upper stretch, proved no
match for PITAMAN once that foe was asked near the furlong pole, but kept on well enough inside to hold the place. WILL YA WIN SUM settled at the rear,
improved in the two to three path when driven near the three eighths, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, found his best in the final furlong, gained
well late but missed the place. PACHI was bumped by WELLFIELD in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three to
four path on the turn, was driven from near the five sixteenths, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane and ran evenly under continued urging.
WELLFIELD settled in second last, saved ground through the turn while well behind the leading trio, took closer order when offering an inside bid past the
five sixteenths into upper stretch, but was unable to sustain that rally while driven inside in the lane.

Footnotes
LASTEN IMPRESSION was slightly rank out of the gate, settled down to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the
turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive. HATCHET CREEK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to duel from the three path around the turn, could not go with the winner entering
the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. KING ZION bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dropped back to trail the field
early, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses from the rail in the stretch. KING'S STORY dueled between horses through the opening
quarter of a mile, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
PASSION'S IMAGE stalked outside of NOTHINS FREE down the backstretch, turned up the pressure two wide into the turn, led approaching the five
sixteenths, drove clear from the head of the stretch and held safe while kept to the task. HOPPESTRY was taken toward the rear, saved ground through the
turn, began to improve from the five sixteenths, made sharp improvement while driven inside into the lane, went two wide approaching the three sixteenths
to get around a tiring horse, got back to the inside and continued to gain inside to the wire. FLYING BUSINESS tracked the leading trio down the
backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, kept on with interest but was outkicked by HOPPESTRY for the place. HEY
HEY chased inside of DRAMA RUN down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the lane, chased on but ultimately
lacked the needed kick to threaten the top three. DRAMA RUN chased outside of HEY HEY down the back straight and in the five path on the turn, raced
into the lane six wide under a drive but did not muster a rally. CONSTANCIA was bumped by NOTHINS FREE in the opening strides, settled at the rear,
trailed in the six path on the turn and offered no bid. NOTHINS FREE came in and bumped CONSTANCIA in the opening strides, was sent to the lead, took
increased pressure from PASSION'S IMAGE to her outside while saving ground on the turn, was headed by that foe approaching the five sixteenths, prove
no match into the lane and weakened inside.

Footnotes
RAYO DE LUZ cleared into the clubhouse turn, led under a hold while always clear of ANGELINO, cleared further in the two path on the far turn, turned
back CAN'T HIDE FROM ME when driven into the lane, held safe from that foe past midstretch as that pair separated from the rest of the field, began to
increase his advantage over CAN'T HIDE FROM ME past the furlong mark and was only hand urged in the final sixteenth. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME settled in
second last, advanced into the backstretch to track well behind the leading pair outside of DIAMOND DAVE, rallied around the far turn in the three path,
loomed near the quarter, continued to chase RAYO DE LUZ, was unable to catch that foe while drawing well clear of the rest of the field in upper stretch,
and kept on a clear second best. DIAMOND DAVE tracked well behind the leading pair through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, chased in the
three path on the far turn, raced between horses in upper stretch and chased on best of the rest while never threatening the leading pair. KEARNY
COUNTY settled at the rear of a strung out field, continued to trail in the three path on the far turn, was driven in the five to six path in upper stretch, and
lacked the needed rally. ANGELINO was urged for early speed, tracked outside of and behind RAYO DE LUZ through the clubhouse turn and down the
backstretch, began to flatten from the half mile mark, lost position in the two path on the far turn and proved empty inside in the lane.

Footnotes
CAT ATTACK was urged to the lead right out of the gate, saved ground around the first turn, continued to show the way under a hold up the backstretch and
around the far turn, and held her lead to the wire while drifting out in the final furlong. LAUNCH AWAY dropped back to trail the field while saving ground
around the first turn, began to move up towards the end of the backstretch and around the far turn, entered the stretch in the three path and gained ground
on the outside in late stretch. ROMANTIC ATTACK raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch on the outside, began a
bid nearing the half mile pole, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position mildly in the lane. SUMMER DAY raced into traffic and was
forced to steady headed into the first turn, saved ground from there, raced up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, continued to save
ground around the far turn and finished evenly. RISKY RISKY RISKY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace,
angled in to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked from there. MANHATTAN LEGACY raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
IRISH HALO chased inside of UNBURNT through the clubhouse turn, continued patiently toward the rear into the backstretch, raced into the far turn inside
of EMILY BUG in the rear flight, took closer order in the two path, swung out to the four path for the drive, rallied, led four wide at the sixteenth and cleared.
STACK SHACK set a measured pace inside, was engaged by MAGIC SOLUTION to her outside approaching the quarter, kicked briefly clear again in upper
stretch, was swamped from both sides approaching midstretch, dug in, could not hold off IRISH HALO in the final sixteenth but kept on gamely for place.
MAGIC SOLUTION tracked the leader outside of TABLE ONE through the clubhouse turn, tracked the pace between horses down the backstretch and
through the far turn, bid outside of STACK SHACK past the five sixteenths, was outkicked by that one into the lane but continued her pursuit three wide, was
in tight midstretch as IRISH HALO rallied past, continued earnestly late but missed the place. TABLE ONE tracked the leader inside of MAGIC SOLUTION
around the clubhouse turn, raced on at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch and through the turn, was driven inside into the lane, bid inside
of STACK SHACK approaching midstretch, but flattened out late. EMILY BUG settled at the rear, improved slightly down the backstretch to join outside of
IRISH HALO, raced with the rear flight in the three path on the far turn, swung six wide into the lane for the drive but lacked the needed rally. UNBURNT
raced two wide toward the rear into the first turn, pulled to join the tracking flight three wide approaching the backstretch, tracked three wide down the
backstretch and through the second turn, was driven four wide in range into the stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
TORNADO BOY bumped several times with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, dropped back to trail the field from the two path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, swung out entering the stretch, began a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and
gained ground on the outside to pull clear late. CURLINGTON saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path, angled out to find racing room in upper stretch and gained ground from there. THE GREEN MO'STER saved
ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path headed into the far turn, took over the lead in
upper stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. POLICY OPTION bumped soundly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, angled in to
save ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn, and gained ground
quickly between horses late. TAP THE MOJO raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack between horses,
navigated the far turn from the three and four path, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. SMILING SILAS raced in the
three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, remained in the three path for the run around the far turn and
passed tiring horses on the outside down the lane. CAMPIONI trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, began to move up while still
saving ground around the far turn, and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. COSMIC TREASURE was urged to the lead from the two path around the
first turn, opened up on the field while racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and gave way with three sixteenths of a mile to go.
BULLION tracked the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the far turn and faded in
the stretch. DEWY'S HIT bumped multiple times with the horses to either side of him leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack in the three path
around the first turn, raced outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled into the stretch and tired
between horses from there.
