Footnotes
BELLA DONA exchanged a bump at the start, vied inside REAL ME up the backstretch, drifted off the fence to the three path late on the turn, exchanged
contact past the furlong marker having retaken the lead, held well under restrained effort. REAL ME bumped with a rival just after the break, dueled outside
the eventual winner, was floated four wide late on the turn, lugged in past the furlong marker and exchanged contact, could make no headway thereafter.
CURBS ICE LADY stumbled at the start, was set down for the drive leaving the turn having gone in the two path on that bend but proved no match for the
top pair. I'VE GOT IT bumped with the inside foe at the start, went five wide on the turn and failed to rally. ANNIE GET UR GUNS was bumped just after the
break then came out and bumped hard with a different rival, recovered to chase the dueling top pair from off the inside going four wide on the turn, came up
empty. WAY RITE bumped with a foe at the start and slightly bobbled, saved ground but failed to rally. CHARLIES HURRICANE was bumped from both
sides after the break, went four wide on the turn and was not a threat. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF REAL ME AGAINST BELLA
DONA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
INDIAN EXCELLENCE contended between runners then just inside one foe but off the fence on the turn while overtaken slightly by that one, dug in to
regain command in upper stretch, edged clear and was kept to the task late. CRAFTY WARRIOR vied outside going three wide on the turn, had a narrow
lead turning for home but was outkicked. BERNICE WHO vied inside rivals early, steadied early on the turn losing ground, failed to rally thereafter. MISS
ABILITY was bumped into a rival clearing the gap then in a bit tight near the half-mile marker, went two to three wide on the turn and improved position. LE
GRAND JOHANN was bumped clearing the gap, saved ground on then just off the fence, failed to threaten. RUN LIKE THE WIND veered in bumping a rival
early, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. RELEASE THE GENIE hit the gate, was lacking early speed, raced just off the inside on the
turn, lugged in near the sixteenth and steadied.

Footnotes
LEAD MONTEREY shifted in heading up the backstretch tracking the leading duo, went two wide on the turn advancing on that bend to take a narrow lead
at the head of the lane, edged clear in mid-stretch and held safe. FABSTRACTION was hard to load, tracked the pacesetter in the clear from off the fence,
began to enter the turn in the three path but quickly moved in to the rail about the five-sixteenths, bid turning for home but was no match for the winner.
INFINITE HEAT came out a bit after the break, set the early tempo in the clear just off the rail, began bearing out on the turn moving from the three path to
about the seven path despite persuasions from the rider, thereby lost the lead late on that turn but kept on well in the lane. MARK'S WARRIOR broke
inwardly, lacked early speed, began to advance past rivals four wide on the turn coming out eight to nine deep for the drive and ran on mildly. JET SET
WARRIOR steadied after the break when in tight, was mid-pack four then three wide on the turn and went evenly. CHIPPSTER saved ground inside and
went evenly. HIGHER DOME went two wide on the turn and came out in the stretch but was empty. TRUELY RIGHT broke inwardly and steadied, saved
ground early on the turn but steadied in tight quarters at the five-sixteenths then altered out four wide for the remainder of the turn before shifting eight deep
into upper stretch. B R KIDD ROCK steadied at the start, was forwardly-placed outside rivals, dropped back six wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
LONZO WHO pressed from outside, lost some ground going three wide into the turn, moved in a path and regained a narrow lead at the head of the lane,
was headed for most of mid-stretch but prevailed under mild urging. BYE BYE MATTY P settled off the leaders, moved in from three to two wide on the turn
before moving back out a path late on that bend, took a narrow lead past the furlong marker to past the sixteenth pole but was not persevered with and
settled for second best. LIFE JACKET contended inside, had no extra for the drive. CHARLIE DYNASTY was bumped at the break, moved out three to five
wide on the turn, altered in to be two wide past the five-sixteenths and ran on. THE LIDS OFF pressed the early pace from between rivals, dropped back on
the turn, swung out five wide leaving the bend and failed to rally. RIG RIDER bumped a rival at the start, was caught five to six wide on the turn, dropped
back and faded. RIGGED RIGHT failed to threaten racing inside. CALICHE was off the leaders saving ground on or just off the rail on the turn, failed to rally.
BIGG LIMO was not a factor while kept off the inside.

Footnotes
LAURA BELLE vied inside a runner but just off the fence, edged clear into upper stretch and was kept to the task. IM COMING OVER pressed the pace of
the winner from outside, increasingly so about the five-sixteenths, drifted out from three to five wide on the turn and consequently lost ground into upper
stretch, was no match but held the place. BLUE XCHANGE was urged along chasing inside, saved ground on then just off the rail through the turn, came
out several paths in mid-stretch and ran on evenly. HENSLEYS RUN was bumped at the break, went four then six wide on the turn, failed to rally. INDIAN
SECRET bumped the aforementioned at the start, forced five then seven wide on the turn, came up empty in the drive. TWENTYFOUR K CAT shifted in
early, raced in the three path on the turn and was never a threat. URGE lacked early speed, went three to four wide on the turn, was never near enough to
threaten. IRON TUFF was not a factor racing five wide through the turn.

PUNCTUAL ALARM vied between runners up the backstretch and into the turn, moved in three to two wide on that bend, edged clear turning for home then
drew off under a drive. CAUGHT STEALING vied between runners early, moved in four then three wide on the turn pressing the winner, was no match for
that one but held the place. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL settled well back having switched off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn and
gained show honors in the lane. SEVENTH HENNESSY bumped the inner rival at the start, tracked in behind the leading quartet in the four then three path
on the turn, failed to rally and ran on evenly. MY CRAZY SISTER was bumped at the start, contended outside pressing five then four wide, steadily
weakened. OUR ISLAND GIRL was lightly bumped at the break, saved ground on the turn then came out in the stretch. PLATINUM GREEK was
encouraged along early but lacking speed, moved in from the five to the three path on the turn and was never a threat. MAX A MILLION RSS was fractious
in the gate, lightly bumped a rival at the start, vied inside just off the fence, dropped back on the turn and came up empty.
