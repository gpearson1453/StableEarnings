closed the gap on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MOON ROVER forced the early pace but chased on the far turn
and had nothing left. PASTEL EMILY set a pressured pace but gave way on the far turn and was empty.

the pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch flattened out. RED ROLLIN settled off the pace and saved ground on
the turn but failed to fire.

pace, had the lead on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. WILEY O'RIELLY was in touch and forced the pace on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but from the five path through
the stretch was no real threat. ONE POUND STERLING was off slow and showed little in a dull effort. RAPID BEAT was hustled early but lacked room on

the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. STRIKING RED was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the

TEAM WIN was in touch, a factor on the far turn and with the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch prevailed. FLECK was unhurried early, gained
ground on the far turn and from the six path through the stretch just missed. POWER HOUSE checked on the first turn and was roused on the far turn but
from the five path through the stretch had no kick. CAPOEIRA showed speed from the outside and had the lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of
the stretch and was empty.

Footnotes
EIGHT SPEED tracked outside, had a slim lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. FLAT OUT FABULOUS showed speed
from the inside but lacked room on the turn and was up for place. MISS MATILDA was up close and forced the pace on the turn but was all out through the
stretch. NANA SAV was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. BOSCOBEL was off slow and
closed the gap on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. MOLLYTARA was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn
but was not a factor. INTRICATELY was hustled early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

THY KINGDOM was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but evened out through the stretch. JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH was off the pace and saved
ground on the turn but failed to fire. DEN OF THIEVES showed speed from the inside but chased on the turn and weakened through the stretch. BREAD

Footnotes
CAUSE FOR ALARM tracked from the inside, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid at the top of the stretch drew clear. ZOOMER MUSIC was unhurried
early, roused on the turn and was up for place. DYNA'S GAMBLE was off slow and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch
needed more. RAVEN'S CRY stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. SEAL TEAM
TWO set the pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. GIANT MINE was well back and raced
evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. WORLD OF PROSPECTS was off the pace, showed little and from the
seven path at the top of the stretch was never in contention.
