PRETTY STORMY broke inward in at the start bumping a rival, stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch
then finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch
then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. MUST BE A MONSTER battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, weakened and returned
bleeding from the nostrils. FRITTONS GOLD bobbled then was shut off at the start and never close. STARSHIP FONZY was no factor. HE'S NO ANGEL
was bumped and forced inward at the start then failed to menace.

lead in deep stretch and drew off under mild urging. CAT'S CURIOSITY pressed the pace two wide to the top of the stretch, inherited the lead then was no
match for the winner. BOSS BEAR never far back, loomed boldly four wide into the far turn, dueled until deep stretch then was outfinished. PORT HUNTER
failed to menace. TICO THUNDER made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail to the top of the stretch then weakened. WILL
RUNAWAY pressed the pace three wide into the far turn then gave way.

SALLY STRONG set the pace into the clubhouse turn, dropped back along the inside a bit, came on again to regain the lead on the far turn, drifted to the
four path and proved best in a stretch long drive under left handed urging. MOONLIT MISSION never far back, loomed boldly five wide nearing the quarter
pole, dug in three wide through deep stretch and just missed. EDGE OF NIGHT chased the pace three wide, drew on even terms for the lead on the far turn
and finished with good courage two wide. MARKET SUCCESS never far back, drew closer four then three wide into the stretch, shifted out four wide near
the furlong marker giving up ground and was gaining late. HIGH FIRE found her best stride late. TOTALLY OBSESSED pressed the pace under a firm hold
two wide through the first turn, pulled to the lead, set the pace into the far turn then folded in the stretch.

EXONERATED PREZ made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under right handed
urging. BUBBA never far back along the rail, shifted out at the top of the stretch, rallied three wide through deep stretch and got up for second.
CHOCOLATE SOLDIER chased the pace and was outfinished two wide. VALEROSO had speed two wide, lacked racing room past the half mile marker,
inched closer on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. FED XMAN well placed, failed to respond. THREE HOMBRES had speed for three furlongs then
faded. KRAZY HAWK was outrun. WAR DOCTOR showed little.
