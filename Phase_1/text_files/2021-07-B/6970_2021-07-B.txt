while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on his stable-mate in the drive. REELFOOT raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn
and finished with some late run. THE PRESS raced just off the leaders from between foes, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved inside
through the turn and did not reach contention. ZATTER hopped at the start, chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
WEGOTTODRINKING was off a step slow and bumped, lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore
nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew off. MOSCOW LADY pressed the pace of LADY M while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that rival into the
stretch, vied, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. LADY M was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, drifted
out into the stretch, responded when challenged by MOSCOW LADY nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied with that rival and gave way through the final
furlong. ONE OCEAN was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. COME CORRECT settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not menace. PRETTY EASY raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
RAPHAEL stalked the leader while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and drew clear. FREESTONE was
away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, responded when challenged by the winner into the
stretch, vied with that rival and gave way through the final furlong. CLUB CHAMP settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and
failed to gain on the top pair in the drive. LOOSE BALL was off slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late.
SPARKLING LUTE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY lacked early foot, saved
ground through the second turn and failed to threaten. PREMIER LEAGUE was off slow, lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not
menace. TIGER ON THE PROWL pressed the pace while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was eased through the lane.

IN THE WIND was off a step slow then raced unhurried early, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards.
ALWAYS FOR MONEY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and rallied late. ZEYNEP broke sharply to duel for the lead
from the inside with FINISHED MY P H D, stayed on well in the drive and gave way late. TIPPYTAP ON SAND settled off the leaders from the inside,
remained inside for the drive and finished with some late run. FINISHED MY P H D was away in good order to dispute the pace with ZEYNEP while racing
three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. TOTHEMOONANDBACK settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed rally. FULL
SPEED AHEAD raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. UNSTOPPABLE GAL showed no early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

DAFFODIL SWEET tracked the pace of PYSCHO SISTER while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a
clear lead approaching the stretch and drew off through the lane. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and finished with good energy. SQUAN'S KINGDOM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
failed to gain in the drive. MISS IMPORTANT showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. DONTKISSNTELL
settled off the leaders early, moved up five-wide through the second turn to reach a striking position but failed to sustain that bid in the drive. PYSCHO
SISTER sprinted clear soon after the start and weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
AQUINAS tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to gain command with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority.
UNCOMMONBLESSING sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged in mid-stretch, could not match strides
with the winner but finished well to hold the place. DISCREET DEMONS chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong
to run but lacked the needed closing response. SPECIAL LESSON settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. PULPIT LINE lacked
early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. COASTAL AFFAIR chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and
weakened. HALO OF LIFE lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and was eased through the lane.
