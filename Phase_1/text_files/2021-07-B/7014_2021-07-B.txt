DAY broke outward, raced three wide early, stalked two wide, bid on the far turn, rallied outside of FORT ROYAL into the stretch, dueled through the lane
and wore down that rival late to prevail. FORT ROYAL set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with DAY
passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch run and yielded grudgingly late. MONKEY'S MEDAL raced off the pace inside,
angled out entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside. RUNNER RUNNER INDY raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and
lacked a rally. KION tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and gave way.

FORT FORTITUDE dueled between rivals for the early lead, dropped over to the inside on the turn, battled it out with LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA in a
prolonged stretch duel and prevailed determinedly at the wire. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA dueled three wide early, dueled two wide on the turn, fought it out
with FORT FORTITUDE in a spirited stretch drive and was narrowly defeated at the end. YEI YEI chased the leaders throughout, lacked a winning bid and
rallied mildly outside in the stretch run. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) dueled inside for the early lead, chased on the turn and weakened. SARASOTA BOY
raced off the pace, between rivals at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. SEVEN GEMS bobbled at the break and was checked, raced off the pace, three
wide on the turn and had no rally. GALLOPING MISCHIEF did not factor.
