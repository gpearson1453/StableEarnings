Footnotes
GROOVY SURPRISE set the pace opened up a clear early lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with BRAMBLE BAY into the stretch, dug in
gamely inside of that rival passing the furlong marker, battled heads apart in a spirited stretch duel and prevailed determinedly. BRAMBLE BAY raced three
wide on the first turn, settled off the pace three wide, advanced on the far turn, commenced her bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of GROOVY
SURPISE in upper stretch, dug in gamely through the final furlong and battled to the end. DIAMOND PLAY tracked close up on the inside, chased inside on
the far turn, continued on the rail in the stretch and got third. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE tracked two wide between rivals, raced inside on the far turn and was
outkicked for the show spot. MAGIC ELECTION raced four wide on the first turn, chased four wide on the backside and tired. HEADING HOME raced off the
pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
RAELYN'S STAR stalked close up three wide, chased the leader on the turn, was floated wide while rallying outside of DAZZLING SPEED at the top of the
lane, gained command passing the furlong marker and drew clear. DAZZLING SPEED showed good speed inside to set the pace, drifted out at the top of
the lane, dug in gamely inside of the winner and held well to save the place spot. RAGTIME SUZY chased two wide, came four wide into the lane, angled
inward, rallied mildly late and was outkicked for second. EVAN'S NICE NOW raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn, rallied mildly inside and got the
nod for fourth. CLEM GEM raced two wide off the pace, angled out four wide entering the stretch and closed mildly outside. FIORE raced off the rail, off the
pace and failed to threaten. PAYNTER FEST raced off the pace inside and did not factor. ALEXACRAT steadied at the start and was outrun.
