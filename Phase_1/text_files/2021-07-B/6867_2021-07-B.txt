Footnotes
BARSABAS broke out but quickly took the lead, set the pace outside YOU'RE MY BOY KAT, cleared into the turn, showed the way two wide into the
stretch, then drew off under right-handed urging and steady handling late. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT pressed the pace from inside early, chased two into the
turn, four wide exiting the bend and proved second best. SIP SIP HOORAY broke out, raced outside a rival in range, angled to the rail around the turn and
finished willingly to earn the show. FALCON EX was off a bit slow to begin chased along the rail then moved out on the turn, came three wide into the lane
and lost the show. TAKEITTOTHEBANK dropped back early, drifted six wide around the turn and never made an impact. EDDIESPAGHETTI was forwardly
placed in the early going, navigated the turn three then four wide and weakened. STATE OF THE UNION tossed his head at the start, raced on the inside
then moved into the two path around the bend and failed to menace. TEE SHOT coaxed early from the gate, lost ground nearing the turn, trailed three wide
into the lane and tired.

RED VALOR was up close early outside the top pair, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, struck the front entering the stretch, cleared with a furlong
remaining and held well. CAJUN TREASURE chased off the inside, exited the turn five wide, rallied from outside and kept gaining to the wire. HOLD ME
BLACK raced outside a rival off the pace, took the turn two then three wide, angled out in upper stretch and held the show. SELF TAUGHT lacked early
speed and dropped well back, went two wide around the turn, angled out in the lane, rallied late and missed the show. DARK HEDGES had speed along the
inside, set the pace under pressured, vied with pair or rivals late on the turn, lost the lead entering the stretch and weakened. CAMBY pressed the pace
from outside, vied between past the quarter, could not go on with the winner inside the furlong grounds and flattened late. STAY HAPPY was a bit rank at
the start, saved ground into the lane, drifted out in the drive and failed to threaten.

BEAUTIFUL BALLAD bumped outside rival at the start, went up to duel from inside, cleared leaving the turn and held safely under urging. ANONYMOUSLY
stalked between foes early, went two wide around the turn, rallied between rivals in the lane and gained the place. LOUD LOUD MUSIC settled off the pace,
angled in nearing the turn, saved ground around the bend and gained the show. GYPSY BLU chased the top pair up the backstretch, traveled three wide
into the lane and finished evenly late. I'M THE HERO stalked from inside then shifted to the two path leaving the turn and lacked a necessary bid. SUMMER
LOVE sat far off the pace, went two wide around the turn and could not rally. ON DECK got bumped from inside at the start, took the turn two then three
wide, steered out in the lane and improved position. INVINCIBELLA (GB) tracked three then four wide around the bend and could not rally.
SHOWMETHEMAGIC sped to the front, dueled for the lead from outside, drifted five wide exiting the turn and weakened. LAVENDER (IRE) traveled along

Footnotes
NEPTUNE'S STORM set the pace from inside, was given his cue at the top of the stretch, put to right-handed urging mid-stretch and inched away.
MAJESTIC EAGLE raced three wide early then moved into the two path, put in a mild bid three wide at the quarter pole, proved no match for the winner but
bested the rest. TIZ PLUS stalked the pacesetter from inside, saved ground into the lane, finished willingly along the rail and was edged for the place
honors. BORDER TOWN raced off the pace early on, traveled two wide then angled four wide and finished evenly in deep stretch. BOB AND JACKIE was
closest early in the two path, put in a mild bid with a quarter mile remaining, could not keep pace with the winner and faltered in the late stages. HOMER
SCREEN (BRZ) settled on the inside, angled three wide on the far turn and needed to find more in deep stretch. NEXT SHARES lagged behind early,
moved closer near the inside on the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, moved off the inside in the stretch and lacked room behind rivals late.
COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) sat off the pace early, swung five wide into the stretch but failed to rally.

Footnotes
KO OLINA sped clear and set the pace early on, was ridden along late on the turn, led two wide into the stretch, urged right-handed in the drive and held
safely. PRESKITT stalked the lone leader to the turn, crept closer around the bend, took aim three wide into the stretch but could not summon the needed
late kick while clearly second best. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE chased in the two path into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend and finished
evenly. SUE ETTAS GHOST tracked off the inside, coaxed around the turn, angled six wide into the lane and improved position. BUSKER ALLIE traveled
off the pace on the inside into the turn, angled three wide leaving the turn and failed to rally. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL coaxed early, navigated the turn three
to four wide and faded. BIG SHAMROCK was crowded on the inside at the seven-sixteenths, came two wide into the stretch, then weakened along the rail.
BONITA LEONA came out leaving the gate, traveled four to five wide around the turn and had little left for the drive.

ANGELCENTS sped to the front, drew away on the turn, lugged out through the final furlong and held off the runner-up. THRILLING stalked the pace on the
inside then two wide into the stretch, angled out and continued to move out steadily outside the winner who was lugging out and kept gaining to the wire. NU
PI LAMBDA settled off the pace, lacked room around the turn then angled four wide into the lane and got up for the show. ANNA FANTASTIC chased
outside rivals, exited the turn four wide and lost the show. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) was a bit crowded early, traveled along the inside then two wide into the
stretch and lacked a serious bid. STORMING LADY angled to the inside and saved ground racing near the back and failed to rally in the drive. FOUNDER'S
DAY dropped back early, swung four wide into the stretch, angled in then back out in the drive and was outrun. LIV AND LET LIV raced up close outside the
leader, chased four wide into the lane and weakened. SARSAPARILLA (GB) tracked outside a rival, asked two to three wide around the turn and faded.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH CONTAGION LUGGED OUT THROUGH THE STRETCH, HE WAS CLEAR
AND DID NOT COST THRILLING A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
TIZAMAGICIAN up close early outside pacesetter, applied pressure on the backstretch, took over past the three-eighths pole, dueled with CUPID'S CLAWS
on final turn and into the stretch, cleared rival with a furlong remaining and drew away late. CUPID'S CLAWS stalked off the inside, bid three deep on the
final bend, battled with TIZAMAGICIAN around that turn and into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner inside the furlong grounds but was
clearly second best. HEYWOODS BEACH set the pace inside, pressured on the backstretch, lost command pat the three-eighths, weakened in the lane but
lasted for the show. CAMPAIGN trailed the field into the stretch, summoned a mild response and missed third between rivals at the wire. RED KING settled
off the pace off the inside, came four wide into stretch and finished three deep at the wire. CONTAGION stalked the top pair, sustained an injured at the
seven-sixteenths pole and was vanned off.

Footnotes
JAVANICA established the front early, held a short lead into the lane, shook free upper stretch and held on in the closing moments. BURGOO ALLEY (IRE)
stalked the pace from inside, entered the lane two wide, tipped out three wide in upper stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth but was too late. CARPE
FORTUNA traveled between rivals then tucked inside entering the clubhouse turn, shifted to the two path late on the far turn and finished well to earn the
show honors. BLEU BALLON forwardly placed to the outside of the pacesetter, kept pressure on to the top of the stretch but could not find the needed late
kick. GO GRETA (GB) tracked the pace on the inside, moved up along the rail past the quarter pole and weakened. CIDER APPLE (GB) raced off the pace,
swung seven wide leaving the far turn and into the lane, drifted inward through the stretch and kept on to advance. GET ON THE BUS was fractious in the
gate, angled six wide into the lane, lacked room behind a pair of rivals in upper stretch, angled out and could not rally. MIDNIGHT DIVA stalked the leader
outside a rival then between foes, exited the far turn four wide and faded. LADY EMILY raced off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turns
and was never a factor. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) dwelt the start, raced outside a rival into the stretch and was always outrun. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE)
stalked the pace outside a pair of rivals, moved out on the far turn and entered the lane five wide, then weakened in the stretch.
