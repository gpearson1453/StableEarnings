Footnotes
TANCAHUA well rationed to turn, rallied four wide to the front and drove clear. EL CHEAPO broke sharp, backed off to turn, rallied into the stretch ran on
outside for place late. OLE WATASHI pressed pace to the stretch, weakened in the final furlong. PRECIOUS JULES never menaced. KINETIC ART raced
evenly with no response when needed. FEISTY RUBIANO inside speed to quarter pole, stopped readily.
