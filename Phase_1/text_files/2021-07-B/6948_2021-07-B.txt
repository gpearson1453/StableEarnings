HARD TO COME HOME brushed RAINY BAY in the backstretch, prompted from the two path then dueled outside of IRISH GOLD through the turn and
drew away through the stretch. WEEKEND WIZARD tracked outside, chased through the stretch and finished second best. PROOF IT chased four wide
leaving the backstretch, came under urging into the stretch and improved late. IRISH GOLD set the early pace while two to three wide, was joined in the turn
by HARD TO COME HOME but was unable to moved on with the eventual winner and faded in stretch. RAINY BAY hustled inside, was in tight then was
bumped repeatedly, steadied and yielded. EZEKIEL tracked inside and was done early. NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE chased four wide early and tired.

BIG AND FLASHY contended the pace while four wide, overtook RAININ ON BOARD approaching the quarter pole, drew clear into the stretch and was
ridden out under a confident hand ride. APRIL'S IMPERIAL tracked outside leaving the backstretch, lost ground then shifted outside approaching the stretch
and closed to earn place. RAININ ON BOARD hustled to the front, was overtaken then raced evenly through the stretch and held show. DISTINCT LADY
chased in second flight and failed to threaten. FOOL IN THE RAIN broke in leaving the gate, chased four to five wide and came up empty for the drive.
STORM CANYON bumped and offered little. THREETIMESTHELADY reluctant to load, hurried between foes and was outrun.

TANGERINE TAXI quickest to the turn then secured a rail position, contended the pace inside of SILVER PRAIRIE, gained a slim lead through the stretch
and was kept under light handling. SILVER PRAIRIE vied three wide into the opening turn, pressed the pace through the backstretch, was unable to stall the
winner in the stretch and held on for place. NODIGGITYNODOUBT tracked four to five wide in the second flight, went in pursuit of the leaders in the final
turn, moved up menacingly early stretch but was unable to get by. HUNTERS PRIDE saved ground from three wide and failed to threaten. PREDESTINED
trailed outside and faded. ARCTIC REIGN never far back inside and gave way. KOKA WEST sat just off the lead while four wide and was unable to keep
pace with the field. SETTING THE TONE tracked five wide then was done early and was eased.

Footnotes
THIS TIME LUCKY emerged the leader leaving the chute, saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, drew clear and was kept to task.
ADRIEN'S AURORA saved ground inside, swung out into the lane, was gaining ground on the leader late and held well. BARE BACK JACK raced near the
back of the pack, was roused at the head of the lane, closed well and missed. VISION QUEST prompted the early pace, was unable to move on with the
eventual winner and flattened out. YORKTOWN settled four wide in range, lodged a bid nearing the quarter pole and yielded. DEVILS COMMAND lacked a
serious bid. GUNN WITH THE WIND was outrun throughout. BRIOSO sat in range from the three path, chased inside entering the lane and stopped.

SAVEITFORARAINYDAY raced in the three path early, shifted out quickly, rallied outside into the stretch and prevailed under a drive. DAZZLING CHIC
reserved off the pacesetters outside, raced four wide into the far turn, rallied steadily and was out kicked. SAMURAI GIRL contested the early pace from the
three path, gained the lead into the final turn, was showing signs of tiring and run down. PIPER ROSE bid belatedly and improved late. ASTARTOBE broke
outward, tracked the pacesetters inside, angled out to the three path and lacked the rally needed. CAN'T TOUCH THIS vied inside, responded to challenge
from SAMURAI GIRL, was kept under steady handling through stretch and gave way in the late stages. SASK LADY took out from along the rail out of close
quarters, angled outside and passed tiring. FAIRY BARB stalked four wide, rallied into the stretch and wilted abruptly. LA MER squeezed out and saved to
no avail.

WHISKARITA saved ground from just off the rail, took closer in the far turn, swung four to five wide at the head of the lane, drifted in under steady
encouragement, gained the lead and drew clear. CALEDON SUMMER took command early then saved ground while showing the way through the
backstretch, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and finished clearly second best. SPANISH DIVA tracked inside, checked nearing the quarter pole
along the rail and rallied late for show. CAGEY raced three wide leaving the opening turn then settled mid pack and showed a mild interest late. DAISY
FIELD pressured the pace from the two path and gave way in the stretch. HEREVERYWISH allowed to settle early and flattened out in stretch. BREACH
OF CONTRACT never in contention. SALSA TANGO raced wide through the backstretch and tired.

EVER TRUE quickly took command, was unchallenged and widened through stretch. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR stalked four wide through the backstretch,
chased but was no match for the winner and finished second best. FROBISHER BAY raced at the back of the field inside, shifted out into the lane and
closed late earning show. BOLSANO chased outside through the backstretch, advanced quickly in the final turn and was denied late for show. PRESS
GANG taken back leaving the chute, rallied through stretch and was edged out. MIDNIGHT SHAKE saved ground inside and was unable to improve
position through the stretch. WILSON sat in striking range from the three to four path and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. REDNECK REMARK
tracked outside and faded steadily into the stretch. SANTA FE TRAIL outrun throughout.

the pace under a snug hold, was overtaken at the quarter pole and gave way late. SECRET MEETING raced four wide in second flight and lacked a closing
response. AMIGO QUERIDO chased outside through the far turn and faded. REMAIN CALM offered little. SWANKY FRANKIE chased the pacesetters and
was done early. TIME- Race was HAND TIMED due to a timer malfunction.

ITS ALL ON SLEW bumped away from the gate, circled the field into the lane, rallied steadily outside, and won driving. BONANZA CREEK trailed the field,
shifted to the rail approaching the stretch and rallied steadily for place. DR A TO D showed the way through the backstretch, was under pressure into the
lane and was run down. OUR MONEY CAT advanced through the final turn and improved position late stretch. DARE TO GO last away, lodged a bid
nearing the three sixteenth pole and flattened out. AWESOME KNIGHT sat in striking distance and came up empty in the drive. THE TRUTH PROJECT
tracked five to six wide, moved up menacingly on DR A TO D nearing the quarter pole and was unable to sustain the bid that was needed. SMALL TOWN
DUDE offered little. RUDIE CAN'T FAIL pressed the pace from the rail and had nothing left in reserve late.
