ITSGOODTOBEKING settled last but one well off the inside, went in the five path into the turn moving in a path on that bend, took aim and drove past in late
stretch. TIZ MY HOUR vied inside a rival but removed from the rail, went in the two path on the turn, edged clear into upper stretch but weakened thereafter.
PARTYATTHECAPITAL switched out past the gap, went in the four to five path on the turn well off the leaders, secured show honors. EYEJUST
TOOKCHARGE had the early lead then dueled outside a foe, asked for more at the three-eighths, went three wide on the turn and came up empty.
PEEWEE'S LADY was not a factor racing in the four to five path.

Footnotes
VROYSKY shifted out in the early going dictating terms on a clear advantage well off the inside, went in the four path on the turn, was challenged leaving
that bend while fanning out further to be eight wide into upper stretch and challenged by an outside rival, was then challenged also by an inside rival in mid-
to late-stretch but held those at bay. MORO APPEAL bumped the outer rival at the start, stalked the aforementioned from outside going five wide on the
turn, was carried out nine deep making a bid turning for home but was turned back on that effort. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE was bumped at the break, raced
mid-pack while wide, moved in from the six path to the two path early on the turn, made a mild bid in mid- to late-stretch but was held at bay. BLUE BOY
WHO hopped at the start, raced last but one in the two to three path on the turn and failed to menace. MR. FEARLESS was in tight after the break and
switched out, raced mostly in the five path and tired.

SILENT ZENON dueled inside a rival but off the fence going in the four then three path on the turn, faced that outside dueling challenger as well as an
inside foe in the stretch and held them both at bay under steady handling. FULL OF DRIVE dueled outside the eventual winner, went five wide on the turn,
kept on in the lane to secure the place. AUSSIE YOU LATER shifted in a bit up the backstretch into the turn, went in the two path on that bend just off the
leading pair, was a threat in mid-stretch but could make no headway late. STELLARSBLUERIBBON switched well off the inside in the early going, trailed in
the six to seven path on the turn, was gaining late. CASABLANCA HOT saved ground inside just off the rail through the turn before angling out in upper
stretch, failed to rally. SOUTHERN FIRE was close up early, dropped back six wide moving in to the four path on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED DIVA tracked in behind off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, took aim and got up late under steady
handling. ATTACKING GIRL set the early tempo, was prompted by an inside rival into the turn going four wide on that bend, edged clear in upper stretch but
was caught late. SASSY QUEENIE bumped the inside rival soon after the break, was kept wide going about six to seven deep through the turn, ran on for
show. FLAMING BESITOS moved forward inside a rival to force the issue leaving the backstretch but still well removed from the rail racing in the three path,
came up empty. JEANNE INA BOTTLE attended the early pace from outside, shifted in from six to four wide on the turn while dropping back, faltered and
faded. SHADE OF ACK ACK was bumped just after the break, showed little, was distanced, pulled up by the top of the stretch and walked off.
