rail, guided to the five path outside the five-sixteenths pole and finished with good energy to be going away late. OVERJOY vied for the lead three wide
through the turn, was moving past the dueling rivals after straightening in the lane, was joined by the winner near the eighth pole, was no match for the
winner but kept on well to be well clear for the place spot. ROCKIN JUSTICE tracked the three rival duel through the turn while moving from the three to the
four path then passed tired ones for the show spot. SHIPSHAPE vied for the lead from between rivals through the turn and into the lane then gave way.
SUCCESSFULLY DONE vied along the inside of two others through the turn then faded through the final eighth.

Footnotes
VALSHEBA was unhurried while near the rail through mid-turn, was guided into the two or three path into the lane, continued into the seven path when
straightening in the lane then finished with good energy to run down the winner near the wire. CECILIA'S HOPE was bumped two times soon after the start,
ran off to a long lead through the turn, had her largest advantage with an eighth to go but could not hold the winner safe late. EXPRESS LADY saved
ground through the turn and into the lane, was closest to the pacesetter with an eighth to go but settled for the minor share while well clear. PORKETTA
chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing response. BROOKVILLE STORM broke in at the start and
bumped rival multiple times, hustled up to chase the pace through the turn and and never was a menace.

with good energy while drifting into the eight path late and just got up. CHANDANA chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came three wide
into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole while in the three path, continued with the advantage while drifting to the six path and was just caught
at the wire. EVERYOTHERWON chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, was well placed after straightening in the lane then
just needed more. BIG IF TRUE was never a threat while in the two or three path through the turn. BACKSTREET LADY set the pace while near the rail and
on a clear lead into the lane then gave way. BRIBE was in the back and in the three path approaching the half-mile pole when appearing to take a bad step,

share while not a threat to the top one. LEMONADE STAND chased the pace alone the inside through the turn, was in the two path with aim on the top ones
into the lane then weakened late. DECEIVER was near the rail throughout and moved up through the lane while never a serious threat. BOONE'S SPIRIT

Footnotes
HARD LUCK JUSTICE stalked the pace two wide into the far turn, was asked for more nearing the quarter pole while in the three path then drew off down
the lane and finished much the best. FEVER TEMPLE raced in the two or three path through the far turn when never far back, got closest to the winner
entering the lane and could only chase that one home while finishing clear for the place spot. PURPLE SHIRT saved ground through the turn, came off the
rail into the lane and was clear for the show spot. MAJOR SPARKS was near the rail through and never was a serious factor. CLEARING WAIVERS set the
pace from the two path through mid-turn then gave way. BAKER'S MAN chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, began losing position in late
turn, entered the lane from the seven path and tired through the final eighth.

MILLER'S MAIDEN led inside and drew off in the stretch while kept to task. BLESSING THE FLAG stalked the pace inside and gained the place late while
no match. FASTEST SPIN raced five wide and bid belatedly outside. LIL KINGS PRINCESS pressed the pace in the three path, then couldn't match strides
in the stretch. THE GIRLS stalked the pace in the two path, then gave way in the stretch. MAPLELINE stalked the pace between foes to the stretch and
gave way. QUEEN'S TABLE was bumped thrice at the start, then showed mild late interest. LIZ C raced in the two path, angled four wide in the stretch and
then had no late bid. MOMMA RIO bumped a rival at the start, stalked in the four path, then had no late bid.

Footnotes
JUST HUMMING was unrushed inside, bid in the the three path at the three-eighths pole and wore down the leader in an all out drive. STORMY WAGER
was clear early inside, then couldn't hold off the winner. PRIZED CUPCAKE stalked in the two path and had a mild late bid three wide. REVS RUN stalked
in the two path before giving way in the stretch. HARLANS PRINCESS stalked the pace in the two and three paths before giving way no the far turn.
JACK'S FINALE improved position late outside. PIEDI AMOY raced in the two path before fading late. MISS DONNASUE saved ground to no avail.
BEYONDSPOTLIGHT was not a factor. NOT A ROLE MODEL was off a step slow. ARLADINI raced inside and faded in the stretch. THE STONE EVENT
was not a factor. Due to a timer malfunction the seven furlong time was omitted.

was bumped hard at the start, stalked in the two path, then had no late bid. GIFT WRAPPED raced in the four path and offered a mild late bid. MISS
PINKERTON saved ground to no avail. TEXAS MUSIC stalked in the three path before fading in the stretch.
