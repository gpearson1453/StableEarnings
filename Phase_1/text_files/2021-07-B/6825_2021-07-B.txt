W W HOTSHOT broke on top, showed the way along or just off the inside, was roused leaving the quarter pole, drew away in the lane and was kept to
urging until the final seventy yards. LASTFORTINOFAMILY chased from outside, closed the gap while widest on the bend, came into the lane from path
four, was crowded briefly midstretch but edged ahead to gain second in the waning yards. LONESOME DREAM pressed W W HOTSHOT from just outside,
did not keep up into the lane, drifted out briefly midstretch, was corrected, fought for second late but was outfinished. A MERRY HEART raced in contention
from inside, took over second along the rail leaving the turn, came off the inside some upper stretch, moved clear for second but slowly yielded inside the
last furlong.

Footnotes
GRAMMAR reluctant to load, moved outside BULU once the race began to share the lead on the backstretch, battled through the lane and edged ahead of
the latter nearing the wire. BULU broke a bit outward, bumped solidly with MI SANDIA, soon moved clear of the others, was engaged on the backstretch,
under a steady drive through the stretch, was outfinished in a game effort but proved easily second best. FULL OF HEART raced in contention between
horses for five furlongs then began to fade. MI SANDIA being bumped solidly from both sides at the break caused her rider to lose his irons briefly, moved
up from outside to be a factor on the backstretch but also steadily yielded with three furlongs to go. ANOTHER BRICKHOUSE broke inward, also bumping
solidly with MI SANDIA, steadily faded from off the inside, was eased in the lane and walked off.

WILDWOOD SICILIAN broke inward, bumping with CYCLONE ATTACK, was hustled to the inside, put to a drive leaving the bend, widened command and
was allowed to coast the final sixteenth. FRIEND was outrun going to the turn, angled out into the bend, came into the stretch from path three, responded to
urging and caught LUCKYVILLE for second in the waning yards. LUCKYVILLE was hustled up to press WILDWOOD SICILIAN from just outside on the turn,
proved no match for that one in the lane and began to wear down deep stretch. CYCLONE ATTACK broke somewhat outward, bumping with WILDWOOD
SICILIAN, angled out widest into the bend, began to fade leaving the turn, moved back toward the inside upper stretch and was unresponsive to urging.

Footnotes
WILD FOX was encouraged to a clear lead at the break, took the inside, rated through the backstretch and second bend then responded to hand urging in
the stretch and was easily best of rest. CLEVER BOY raced closest to WILD FOX from just off or along the rail, closed the gap on the second turn, was no
match for the latter when set down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for the place. JOHNNY LONGBOAT progressed from inside on
the backstretch, moved clear for third while just off the inside on the second bend and was closing the gap on CLEVER BOY in the late going. LEE LA DEW
soon trailed from just off the inside, angled out to be widest on the second turn and failed to have a significant response the final two furlongs. MESSED UP
was a factor from outside on the backstretch but began to tire three wide on the second bend. The seven furlong fraction is unavailable.

CITY POSITION shared the early lead from inside, began to float out leaving the bend, drifted out to path six entering the stretch, responded to steady
handling and kept TRUE TEN at bay. TRUE TEN prominent from inside, rallied in the lane, took over second upper stretch, came to near even terms with
CITY POSITION inside the last eighth but leveled off some nearing the wire. YABA DABA DOO vied for the lead outside CITY POSITION, lost considerable
ground staying outside the latter into the lane and slowly yielded. BARNYARD FIDDLER stayed off the inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TOCCETIVE JAC settled at the back, picked up his pace after a half mile, came into contention along the rail on the second bend, waited for room into the
lane, got through in tight quarters upper stretch, responded to mostly hand urging, took the lead inside the last furlong, was clear with a sixteenth left and
held sway. VENKMAN progressed between rivals on the backstretch, was four wide on the second turn, lost considerable ground being carried out to the
middle of the track into the stretch but closed well and gained second near the wire. LEFT COAST DREAMS advanced just off the inside on the backstretch,
was three wide on the second bend, also lost considerable ground staying outside LEE'S LUCK entering the stretch, rallied just inside VENKMAN the final
eighth and narrowly missed for the place. SEBA'S DANCER moved ahead from inside on the backstretch, was overtaken on the second turn, regained the
advantage upper stretch but gradually wore down inside the last furlong. LEE'S LUCK vied for the lead outside SEBA'S DANCER, began to drift out leaving
the second turn, came into the stretch from path six and gradually yielded between rivals.

Footnotes
A BOLD RYDE in midpack early between horses, commenced his bid just off the inside on the bend, drifted out to path five entering the lane, gradually
drifted out but took over with a sixteenth left and drew off under a drive. INSIDE THE CIRCLE soon had a clear lead, lengthened command along the rail
when allowed on the turn, was put to urging into the stretch, began to wear down with a furlong to go but proved easily second best. BABA'S BOY chased
from outside, lost considerable ground widest through the bend, took over third inside the last eighth and held his position. THACKER FROMM progressed
just off the rail on the turn, floated out some into the stretch and improved position without threatening. ABOVE NIKE hustled vigorously early, prompted the
pace outside INSIDE THE CIRCLE, stayed in path three on the turn, lost ground staying outside A BOLD RYDE leaving the bend and entering the lane and
steadily gave way. MENA'S FIREBALL in contention early toward the outside, gave way three wide on the bend. FADE FROM BLACK broke slowly and was
never a factor. MAC PANDOWDY chased from midpack between rivals on the backstretch and faded on the turn. GALLI ATTACK showed little in a
ground-saving trip.
