Footnotes
RISK AND REWARD was off alertly and established the front quickly, crossed over to the inside, showed the way a bit off the rail into the stretch and
remained clear under right-handed urging. BOBBY BO closest in pursuit to the outside of the pacesetter, chased two to three wide into the drive, could not
threaten RISK AND REWARD in deep stretch but secured the place. AFFABLE chased near the inside, two to three wide into the stretch and kept on for a
clear third. WHO'S THE STAR settled out of range, entered the turn along the inside, exited two wide and lacked a rally. MARINERS WAY was rank early,
tracked off the rail to the stretch and weakened. PRINCE ZIGGY broke a step slow then came out early, went four wide through the turn and failed to
threaten.

MURRAY broke well then stalked DRINK THE WIND in the two path to the turn, drew alongside then took over past the quarter pole, cleared leaving the
turn, roused entering the stretch, powered away under hand urging in the final furlong and was geared down near the wire. CLAMPETT stumbled at the
start, tracked off the rail, came three wide into the drive and bested the rest. CARBONITE off a bit slow to begin, raced well off the rail then angled in
entering the turn, traveled three then four wide around the bend and was along for the show. BAROSSA chased off the rail, two wide into the stretch and
weakened. SUMTER saved ground chasing the pace and faded in the drive. DRINK THE WIND sped clear to set the pace, got headed by the winner at the
quarter pole and folded.

Footnotes
HOT BOX dueled for the lead from outside then cleared past the seven-sixteenths, showed the way unchallenged into the stretch and inched away.
CROSSWORD coaxed from the gate, was floated in then checked early, chased two wide into the stretch and held the place. GATES OF HEAVEN settled
off the pace, swung out into the drive and finished well. LOVESICK BLUES chased along the inside, steadied briefly behind troubled rival early on the turn,
remained inside to the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. GATOR SHINING tracked three deep early, came four wide into the lane and lacked
a rally. EXHALTING stalked outside a rival, exited the turn three wide and flattened out. AWESOME BEACH came in and bumped rival early, lacked room
from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths, angled three wide on the turn and lacked further response. CIBERTRUCK got bumped and crowded
between rivals early, saved ground to the stretch, steered out and made no impact. ASHLEY'S VALENTINE tracked between rivals up the backstretch,
angled five wide into the lane, angled back in at the top of the stretch and failed to menace. MINEHUNTER dueled for the lead from inside early, checked at
the seven-sixteenths, checked again early on the turn, went two wide into the lane and faded. THE RIDER ABOARD MINEHUNTER PLACED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST CROSSWORD FOR INTERFERENCE EARLY ON THE TURN AND AFTER A REVIEW THE STEWARD RULED THAT THE
INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION. THERE WAS A SECOND RIDER'S OBJECTION MADE BY THE RIDER ABOARD
CROSSWORD AGAINST HOT BOX, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE EARLY IN THE RACE AND AFTER A REVIEW THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
INCIDENT ALSO DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

between rivals on the turn and weakened. ALEXANDROS chased between early, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. LIAM'S PRIDE hustled
early, chased on the inside, dropped back on the turn and had little left for the drive. BIBLEMAN dueled for the lead from inside, vied with a pair still along

VIAZAR bumped leaving the gate, reserved in the early going, swung out leaving the turn, angled widest in the stretch, closed gamely but was too late.
DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) broke out and bumped rival, sped to the front and angled to the rail, vied with rivals leaving the far turn, held a short lead into deep
stretch and yielded late. BASILIA stalked off the rail, bid three deep at the quarter pole but lacked the needed late kick. SUKI stalked between foes to the
stretch and put in a mild late bid. LOOKIN SO LUCKY closest in pursuit early, bid between at the quarter pole, failed to find the necessary late punch and
bumped with DEISE DELIGHT late. UNBREAKABLE reserved in the early going, angled three wide leaving the far turn, kept on through the lane but needed
to find more. LITTLE MISS ELLIE steadied briefly off heels on the first turn, saved ground into the stretch and lacked room late. CHEERFUL CHARM was
rank early on the inside, continued to chase under restraint, cut the corner into the drive, asked right-handed mid-stretch and weakened. SWEET DEVIL
tracked three wide outside rivals, put in a mild bid with a quarter mile to go and weakened. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH went four wide through both turns and

CITY OF CHAMPIONS set the pace up the backstretch, pressured into the turn, kicked clear nearing the five-sixteenths and held safely. THIRSTY CHAPO
hopped slightly at the start, chased three deep into the turn, could not keep pace around the bend, exited the turn three wide and kept on willingly to prove
second best. TOASTED AT DAWN broke well then chased the pacesetter four deep, went four wide through the turn and held the show. GEMINI BAY
chased five wide around the turn and lacked a bid. LAST RENEGADE raced well off the inside, angled down to the two path around the turn and failed to
rally. I'M WINNING chased between early, put in a mild bid outside the leader at the seven-sixteenths, could not match strides around the bend and
weakened in the lane. AWESOME CURLIN sat off the pace, took the turn three to four wide and failed to offer the needed response. SOCAL RED was off
slow from inside, saved ground to the stretch, steered out in the drive and failed to threaten. MEDINA MAN stalked on the inside and faded out of
contention. BIG SWEDE shifted out and steadied at the start, went four wide into the turn, five to six wide into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
SUPERSTITION stalked the top trio early on, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch, tipped out further, reeled in BULLETPROOF ONE and
drove clear. QUERELLE settled near the back of the pack, swung five wide into the stretch, moved out further at the top of the lane, closed well and got up
for the place. BULLETPROOF ONE vied with outside pair up the backstretch, inched ahead into the turn, cleared at the three-sixteenths but weakened late.
GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) settled off the pace, traveled two wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and finished willingly between to miss both the place and
show. CONSTANTIA trailed early, angled in and saved ground around the turn and finished with a mild rally inside. BRUJA ESCARLATA tracked off the
inside, outside rivals on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. NEVER FOR MONEY traveled two wide into the turn, angled four wide
leaving the bend, angled inside rival in upper stretch and could not rally. FIVE PICS PLEASE vied three deep to the turn, raced outside the leader around
the bend and weakened in the lane. RAKASSAH (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, angled four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LENZI'S LUCKY
LADY vied between rivals to the turn, weakened around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
BRANDOTHEBARTENDER exited the chute five deep, angled to the inside first time through the stretch, moved off the rail on the backstretch, advanced
four wide on the far turn, rallied outside the top pair in the lane and bested the runner-up. INDIAN PEAK got bumped from inside soon after the start, raced
off the pace early, launched a bid at the three-eighths, cleared and angled in around the turn, showed the way a bit off the rail into the stretch, was collared
with a sixteenth to go and could not fend off the winner. NORTH COUNTY GUY traveled in mid-pack outside rivals, lacked room at the five-sixteenths,
angled around rival on the turn, urged left-handed in the drive and got up for the show honors. WOUND TIGHT pressed the pace early from outside, chased
the leader on the backstretch, put in a mild bid between runners into the far turn, could not keep pace with INDIAN PEAK, chased two to three wide into the
stretch and lost the show. MARGOT'S BOY stalked the pace outside a rival, went three deep and was put in tight past the three-eighths, entered the stretch
two wide and finished evenly. GALILEAN stalked the pace on the inside, shifted two wide on the far turn, lacked room past the quarter pole, tipped out at the
top of the stretch and failed to rally. SECRET CLUB got bumped between rivals early, fell back into the far turn, exited that bend three wide, lacked room at
the eighth pole and was ridden out once gaining a clear path. WARD 'N JERRY traveled near the back, moved outside a trio of rivals at the three-eighths,
came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. DESMOND DOSS sped to the front, set the pace inside, lost command past the three-eighths and gave
way. UNBRIDLED ETHOS settled inside and never made an impact.

Footnotes
ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD set the pace under pressure, moved clear at the seven-sixteenths, showed the way in the two path into the stretch and held
gamely. KIND BUT SHE LIES stalked the pace four deep early, went three wide into the lane, came with a late bid but was not enough to get by.
BACKTOFLASH dropped back early, took the turn five then four wide and kept on to earn the show honors. GRIGORO broke out and bumped rival then got
bothered shortly after, settled off the pace, went three then four wide around the turn and gained a minor share. CAMEO SHORES sat off the pace early on,
took the turn three then four wide and failed to threaten. B'ESAME ME MUCHO bumped with CAN FLY early, climbed along up the backstretch and at the
three-eighths, angled three wide around the turn and was never a factor. SIENA SILK broke out and bumped rival at the start, entered the turn four wide,
exited three wide and weakened. CAN FLY bumped leaving the gate then got bumped again soon after, traveled along the rail into the turn, two wide into
the stretch and weakened. SEE YOU AT THE TOP bumped from inside at the start, sat off the pace, traveled four then five wide around the turn and
weakened. SLEWPYS LAST SONG came away a bit slow and threw his head at the start, went four wide around the bend and was outrun. PHOENIX
TEARS forwardly placed in the beginning, checked at the three-eighths, got blocked behind TWIRLY GIRL on the turn and could not rally in the drive.
TWIRLY GIRL knocked into rival at the start, pressed the pace from outside, failed to keep up past the seven-sixteenths, angled from three wide to the rail
around the bend and tired.
