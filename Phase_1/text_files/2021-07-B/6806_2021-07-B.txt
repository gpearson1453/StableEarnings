Footnotes
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA stalked three wide, was fanned extremely wide into the stretch then made a gradual gain to get up in time after a long drive.
MAMBO DANCER dropped far behind then split foes with good energy too late. JEANIE'S ANGEL well placed behind the dueling leaders, drifted out
entering the stretch and continued gamely to the wire. KEEPER IN SPITE prompted the pace outside, edged to the front midway on the turn, led to the final
sixteenth but tired late. ALWAYS TALKING tossed her head at the start, quickly angled inside setting the pace and continued willingly after losing the
advantage. WEST HORIZEN dropped back early and raced far behind throughout.

Footnotes
CHARLIE THE GREEK unhurried between rivals, bid outside on the final turn, angled inside a large opening into the stretch and drew away. YOU ARE
AWESOME settled outside, rallied on near the far turn, moved wide in the stretch and proved no match for the winner. DAVID'S PROSPEC prompted the
leader outside, led briefly on the final turn then yielded through the stretch. MUHLENBERG lagged well behind then passed fading rivals while no threat.
JUST ENOUGH saved ground off the pace and flattened out through the stretch. KORCZAK broke alertly and hustled to the front inside then was finished
after five furlongs. Fractional time one was unavailable due to a timer beam malfunction.

THE BIG K quickly took control inside, remained clear to the late stages then just lasted. ESTILO VARONIL broke alertly and eased back, advanced on the
turn, remained inside rallying and just missed. FOMO pursued the winner near the inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. FAKE I D stalked
pacesetters three wide and continued willingly to the finish. DON CICCIO inside in clear early, advanced nicely outside on the turn. TRIP TO CAIRO broke
slowly then advanced well inside while no threat. LEWANDOWSKI ducked out at the break, raced wide and was no factor. GOLDEN GALLANT dropped
back early, trailed and was no factor. GRAYSIDE dropped back racing very wide and retreated racing rank.

Footnotes
LAST INVESTMENT stalked the pace, edged to the front near the far turn then held rival safe entire stretch in a game score. SOUPER EMPEROR chased
wide, advanced on the turn, rallied but could not get by the winner. ANOTHER LULU lacked speed in the opening eighth, rallied very wide and closed well
too late. GREGORIA'S BAY saved ground close up, moved very wide on the turn and the stretch. IMAGINE HONGKONG lagged far behind, moved outside
then back in through the stretch. BIG DADDY BUZZ lacked speed in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. WICKED DUDE raced close up between
rivals then gave way readily. TAPIFLY slow early, rushed to contention inside then faltered. TOMORROWS HEAVEN hustled to the front inside to the three
eighths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
DAMIR controlled the pace inside, repelled challenges, drifted out in the stretch but remained safe driving. GANDOLFO settled off the leaders in the two
path, advanced into the far turn, bid inside but could not catch the winner. OLYMPIC GOLD chased wide throughout then picked off rivals after half a mile
but flattened out in the stretch. ESTILO ELEGANTE saved ground within range to the stretch then came up empty. DARN THAT HARRY prompted the
winner for three quarters and gave way. NAKED IN CABO broke a bit awkwardly, chased inside, was taken up near the quarter pole. ROY G. BIV lagged far
behind and was never in contention. JACK LUVS NOVA dropped back early inside and was never a factor. ADMIRAL'S BOY trailed a long way then passed
a fading opponent. CURRY'S MOUNTAIN raced just off the leaders inside then stopped abruptly.

KEEPING THE PEACE moved quickly wide on the turn then wore down the leader in the final furlong and edged off driving. COWBOY MZ rated outside the
dueling leaders, bid to the front midway on the turn, moved clear but tired in the final furlong. TOGA CHALLENGER saved ground off the pace, angled out
on the turn, moved very wide in the lane. FORT ROYAL broke sluggishly and lacked speed then advanced wide in the stretch. CHIEF EXCHANGER vied
for the advantage inside then was finished midway on the turn. APPRAISED dropped back outside and was never a factor. KION lacked speed in the three
path and weakened steadily. IWISHIWASPECIAL hustled to a narrow advantage in the two path then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BIG POLO broke alertly and moved clear inside then staved off late challenge holding on with determination. MAGIC WIZARD settled inside, advanced after
half a mile, angled out and bid in the stretch but could not get by the winner. BULLDOG CONNECTION trailed far behind then closed with good energy too
late. ANGEL'S ENTRY lacked speed, picked off rivals inside then flattened out late. JAQUAVIOUS pressed the winner for three quarters then drifted out
tiring through the stretch. HEROIC DEED urged wide just off the leaders, made a brief bid then weakened. PASCAL dropped back early and was never a
factor. BIG SNITCH lacked speed in the two path and was always outrun. VLAJKO in tight early, raced greenly and was always far back. CHARLIE
POTATOES rallied very wide on the final turn then proved empty in the stretch. MARCONIS was urged close up up early angling inside then stopped
abruptly. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions were unavailable.
