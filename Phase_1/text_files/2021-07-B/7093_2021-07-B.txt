Footnotes
LAOBAN'S LEGACY coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three then two wide, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted to the inside just inside the three-sixteenths while going clear under a drive
and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably on the wire. SWEET SUGAR BABY coaxed from the start, got bumped just after the
start by CURLY GIRL coming inwards, chased along the inside coaxed along from the get go, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out to the three path a
furlong from home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. SUGAR AND SPEIGHTS coaxed from the
break, chased four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
CURLY GIRL broke in at the start under hustling forcing FREE NINETY NINE to be taken in hand briefly when taking over that rival's lane and then bumped
SWEET SUGAR BABY soon after, chased just off the inside under coaxing throughout, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. FREE
NINETY NINE broke a beat slow and was taken in hand briefly as CURLY GIRL took over her land, grew detached at the tail of the field when outrun early
on three to four paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FINGAL had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, came away in good order, prompted the pace on the outside while in the two to three path, took the lead
midway through the final turn, responded well when roused near the quarter-pole then was put to a drive in upper stretch, drew away under a right-handed
crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. CITY MAGIC went to the front, showed the way while inside
to the two path, was asked while headed at the three-eighths, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for
the winner. HYPERFOCUS broke out and was last of the quartet to commence, tracked the pace on the outside while three to four wide, chased under
strong urging on the far turn, was put to the crop just inside the three-eighths, pursued the winner into upper stretch and tired. CENTAVO dropped from the
two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, came under coaxing near the five-eighths then was put to stronger encouragement shortly
thereafter, dropped back under vigorous urging while moving from the inside to the two path on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch and faltered
then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

BOURBON MISSION coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside uncontested, took the inside route into upper stretch and edged clear
under a drive to prevail. ADVANCE NOTICE chased four then three wide down the backstretch early on before tucking to the two path at the half mile pole,
raced in behind the leader through the turn and spun just off the inside for home in tight between foes straightened into upper stretch, gained clearance
nearing the eighth pole and tipped out a lane, proved no match for the top one while staying on one paced to the finish. MUCHMORETHANTHIS stumbled

stretch then drifted further out before being straightened by the rider, extended the advantage under a moderate hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was
geared down in the final seventy yards while much the best. TOO EARLY was well placed just off the pace on the inside, chased on the far turn, shifted
three wide late on that bend, turned four wide into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner to the wire and was no match while clear for the place.
FORT WORTH tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, chased on the far turn, drifted six wide into upper stretch and tired but was clear for the
show. SIX PERCENT rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, moved out outside the half-mile pole, was urged four then five wide on the far
turn and failed to respond. CONTROL GROUP was sent from the gate, settled just off the pace while two to three wide, was coaxed along passing the
half-pole, came under stronger encouragement in the three path on the far turn and capitulated. EVALUATOR went three to four wide on the first turn, was
urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the final turn, came seven wide into the stretch, moved further out around the furlong marker and failed to
threaten. TWISTED TOM moved from the rail to the three path on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back in the four path under urging on the far
turn and faltered.

to the two path through the turn and remained patiently handled whittling away at the leader as that foe got busy inside, swung four wide into upper stretch
seizing command when straightening away for home, drifted out three paths under a light drive going clear to the finish and was geared down inside the final
sixteenth. THIS ILL DEFEND brushed the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn

stretch and tired. LITTERBOX chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. NUTSIE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under encouragement from midway on the turn, continued
three wide into upper stretch and tired. AJHAR reluctant to load prior to the start, chased four to five wide under a ride from three furlongs out and faltered.

for home and made no impact. MATTY'S MARAUDER coaxed from the gate, showed speed four wide for the opening half mile coaxed along from the

early then chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, tipped to the two path under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but secured the show. LIFE IS
GREAT broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied between horses while three then two wide on the turn, dropped back while still on his

RUNNIN' RAY hustled from the gate, raced three wide forwardly placed into the first turn before tucking to the two path settling just outside the leader,
remained patiently handled until past the three-eighths and began to advance on the front through the latter portion of the turn, swung three wide at the
head of the stretch and had HOMBRAZO bump and nudged him three to four times from the quarter pole until straightened away attempting to make a lane
for himself, denied the move keeping that rival in behind TOP GUN TOMMY, dug in between foes heads apart for command a furlong from home before
taking over inside that station, dug in battling WINTER POOL to the finish and gamely repelled that rival to the wire. WINTER POOL bumped at the start by
OBSESSED due to pressure from TOP GUN TOMMY breaking outwards, raced three wide through the first turn before settling three wide just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and was bumped straightening away by the aforementioned foe due to
HOMBRAZO'S antics, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong out, then battled on with RUNNIN' RAY to the finish but was ultimately
rebuffed to the end. TOP GUN TOMMY broke out at the start bumping OBSESSED into WINTER POOL, established the front in hand along the inside,
came under challenge five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and relented just inside the eight
pole, then ran on to preserve the show honors. TIZ RYE TIME four then three wide through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. HOMBRAZO just off the pace tracking inside, took to the two path through the far
turn coming under coaxing just inside the three-eighths, attempted to make a lane for himself spinning two to three wide into upper stretch repeatedly
bumping RUNNIN' RAY while in behind TOP GUN TOMMY, which in turn caused RUNNIN' RAY to make contact with WINTER POOL, got denied the
move, dug in under urging through the stretch and was outgamed. SOUTHERN PASSAGE hustled from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and offered no response. BEACHWALKER chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. PARADE FIELD hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway
on the turn and tired. OBSESSED got bumped at the start by TOP GUN TOMMY and in turn bumped WINTER POOL, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. SCOTTY three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
continued three wide for home and made no impact.

CLAYTNTHELIONHEART pulled under restraint at the rear of the quartet early, went three wide on the opening bend, settled on the outside, inched closer
outside the five-eighths, made a bid outside the half-mile pole, took the advantage in the three path under his own power on the far turn, was asked coming
to the quarter-pole then had the rider lose his whip while attempting to un-cock it, kicked clear into upper stretch and drew off under a strong hand ride to
prove much the best. JARREAU was eased back off the pace nearing the first turn, settled in the two path, was asked to pick it up with a half-mile to run,
moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner.
RHYTHM SECTION showed good speed on the opening straightaway, dropped from the two path to the rail midway through the first turn, showed the way
through quick fractions, came under urging inside the five-eighths, vied along the rail while ridden along on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened. EYES ON TARGET broke in at the start, showed speed on the initial straightaway, was eased back off the pace along the rail early on the first
turn then moved to the two path, stalked outside on the backstretch, vied between foes in the two path under urging on the far turn and faded.

to the two path into the far turn and came under motivation by the rider three furlongs form home, advanced swinging three wide into upper stretch, tipped to
the four path straightened away, rallied to take command a furlong out, tussled briefly with the runner up before edging clear to the finish kept to task.
MILES D got bumped lightly at the start twice by SNOW HOUSE who recovered from a bobble, settled along the inside near the rear of the field, came
under light coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, advanced and swung three wide into upper stretch under a drive taking over the front straightened away for
home, dug in under lone threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on latched on to the sixteenth marker before being shaken off by the top one, ran on
willingly clear of the rest for the place honors. FIRST CAPTAIN traded a bump at the start with BEREN, settled just off the inside through the first turn
latched on to the outside of MILES D, tipped four then five wide down the backstretch in the clear to the outside before tucking three wide into the far turn,
came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, angled out to swing widest into upper stretch and was floated out six then seven wide as
COLLABORATE drifted out at that juncture to his inside, offered up a bid to the furlong grounds then flattened out inside that station drifting in while safe for
the show honors. HARVARD bobbled at the break under coaxing, tracked the pace along the inside coming under urging at the three-eighths, took the
inside route into upper stretch in behind SNOW HOUSE, tipped out near the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. SNOW HOUSE bobbled at the break
under hustling and bumped lightly with MILES D twice, raced forwardly placed taking over command into the first turn to show the way from the two path
through that bend and down the backstretch under the watchful eyes of BEREN to the outside, tucked to the rail at the seven-sixteenths and came under
increasing pressure from a pair through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch under assault as the field stacked outside, yielded the front straightened
away and tired. COLLABORATE three wide through the first turn, chased four then three paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced on the front to
stack outside the top pair inside three furlongs to go, had the rider apply a firm left handed grip near the quarter pole as his charge began to drift out, got out
five then six wide into upper stretch floating FIRST CAPTAIN six then seven wide with him to his outside straightened away for home and tired in the stretch.
BEREN traded a bump at the start with FIRST CAPTAIN, led briefly past the stands before settling just outside SNOW HOUSE three then two wide
prompting that foe from the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths between foes, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
HIGHWAY QUEEN broke alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked while extending the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, drew off under a hand ride into the final furlong, switched back to her inside lead when put to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole
then was eased up in the final sixteenth while much the best. TO THE TUNE prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, chased the winner on the far
turn, dropped back late on that bend and proved no match while well clear for the place. REELEY PSYCHED was taken in hand while moving in early,
rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the inside of a foe, traveled around the far turn in the two path under urging and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. THE PROMISED ROAD settled on the inside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, saved ground through the far turn and
faltered. LEMON TAFFY lost her footing at the start but broke with the field, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came up
empty while three then four wide on the far turn and retreated. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged
along while two to three wide on the far turn and also faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. SHE'S ON POINT broke in at the start,
moved out over heels early, dropped well behind and was eased but walked off.
