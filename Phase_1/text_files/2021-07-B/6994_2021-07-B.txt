clear in the stretch under a steady drive. PEQUENO GRANDE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but had
no final gain on the winner. BOTSWANA TAPS had a slow beginning and raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch
run. CELTIC MISCHIEF chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch drive. HUGH B. was
bumped at the start, dueled early on from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch. WAVE LAND OUTLAW was never a
factor. REJUVENATE dueled early on two wide, was off the rail into the lane and faded down the lane, bled. SKYVALUE was bumped at the start and done

near the eighth pole and drew clear in the final stages. JUJU'S MAP chased the pace early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, took over and led in
the upper stretch, was overtaken near the eighth pole and yielded late. LOVELY LISA raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up
in the stretch run. LAVENDAR LANE set the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch. DELIGHTFUL
MOMENT pressed the pace early two wide, was off the rail into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. CASCIA was never a threat. OUR LADY

Footnotes
GINSBURNED saved ground off of the pace, patiently awaited racing room around the far turn before tipping four wide turning for home, the produced a
good kick outside of foes in midstretch, and rallied to drive past the leader inside the final sixteenth. RARE STRIPE stalked two wide, bid for the lead three
wide into the far turn, took over in upper stretch, drew clear at the furlong grounds, but was worn down by an outer rallying rival inside the final sixteenth.
TOLKIEN tracked from the two path, shifted three wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, then stayed on to claim show
late. OUR INTEGRITY cleared a pair of inner foes into the first turn, met those foes' rebids into the far turn, but was headed by his outermost rival entering
the lane, and gave way thereafter. MCLOVIN took the first turn in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. OF THE MOMENT stalked inside,
bid two wide and between horses into the far turn, vied passing the quarter pole, but weakened in upper stretch. STRATEGIC DIALOGUE saved ground
from midpack, but faded turning for home. BIKO was slow into stride, then never got involved. EMPIRE OF THE SUN was rank to place while forward early
on, remained unsettled while shifting out to the four path around the first turn, then faded in to the far turn. TRANSITIVEPROPERTY broke multiple lengths
slowly, trailed before being eased around the far turn, distanced through the lane, then walked off.
