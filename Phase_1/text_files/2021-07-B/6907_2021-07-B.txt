win. TOBRUK was away alertly, hustled along from the inside on the turn and finished well. AMNESTY was in range and a factor on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch was all out. SUMMER RETREAT was in touch and roused on the turn but from the five path through the stretch had no
response. YALLHAVEANICEDAY was up close but chased from between foes on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

KOZY KAT set the pace, took command on the turn and was much the best. FAIRY tracked the leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at
the top of the stretch held place. MS SUEDOO was hustled early and roused from the inside on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
needed more. I'M A GINGER was up close and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick. LEFOOTWOSTOMPS
stalked the early leaders but was in tight on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON
