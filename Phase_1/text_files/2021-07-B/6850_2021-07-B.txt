Footnotes
UP HER SLEEVE settled off the pace inside, made progress at the rail around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, drifted out a bit under left-handed
urging in upper stretch, kicked in outside, swept to the front near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. CASTLE BORN raced two wide in midpack, saved
ground around the far turn and rallied inside to gain the place in the later yards. ROYAL ROCKER hit the starting gate, sped to the front, set a rated pace
inside, yielded near the sixteenth pole, drifted a bit and weakened late. DOLCE APRILE veered out at the start, stalked the pace two wide and lacked a rally.
BARBARA saved ground off the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. SOLAR GIRL failed to menace while racing two and three
wide around the turns and swinging seven wide in upper stretch. KNOW BY HEART (IRE) lacked early speed while racing three wide around the first turn,
advanced outside down the backstretch, was up close three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. ANGELIC STORM was forced out at
the start and trailed throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GREEN MANSIONS sat perched behind the threesome vying for the lead on the turn, was guided out four wide at the top of the stretch, reached the front
from outside with a furlong remaining and edged away under pressure. MAN OF VISION pressed the early pace outside rivals, challenged for command
around the turn, could not kick on with the winner past the eighth-pole but ran on with good courage clearly second best. RICKI TICKI TAFFI poked a head
in front of RAMAZZOTTI approaching the half-mile pole, vied between the latter and MAN OF VISION around the turn, stayed on his left lead through the
stretch and gave way while able to hang on for third. MUSTANG CAT raced three to four wide around the turn, and flattened out on his left lead. ADEEB
was outsprinted early, moved to the far outside for the drive and made no headway. MOON PISTOL faded steadily inside after a quarter-mile.
RAMAZZOTTI (CHI) led through most of the opening quarter before getting headed by RICKI TICKI TAFFI, vied inside that one and MAN OF VISION
around the turn, and was empty approaching the lane.

Footnotes
PERSONAL MEADOW sped clear soon after the start, showed the way in the two-path around the turn, moved inside for the drive and stayed in command
under pressure. VISION OF THANOS was outrun early near the inside, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and was along late for the place.
JUPITER BLUES brushed with EMIT through the first few strides, saved ground forwardly placed to the stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and was
overhauled for second. BACH was never far back, advanced around the turn four wide, then faded through the stretch. LOYAL LOUIE bumped with SOUL
DANCER at the start, raced close up two wide for a half-mile, and tired. EMIT brushed with JUPITER BLUES through the opening strides, and was outrun
near the inside. LUCKY MIKE tossed his head at the break and was two lengths slow coming out, and was always far back. SOUL DANCER stumbled and
bumped with LOYAL LOUIE at the start, was hustled along early three wide, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
THORN settled off the pace along the inside, went two wide around the far turn, closed between foes, seized command near the sixteenth marker and
powered away. BIG CITY RED raced off the pace two wide early and three wide around the far turn then rallied outside. GUNMAN broke sharply, set the
pace along the rail and weakened in the final sixteenth. STRAIGHT UP GUY trailed inside for a half, went three wide around the far turn, shifted further out
in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. POLITICAL RIOT was in range four wide early and three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. KICKS ON
SIXTY SIX pressed the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and tired in the drive. MONY had early speed while steadying
along, steadied again midway around the far turn, quickly dropped back and lacked any further response.

Footnotes
HEY PORTER tracked the pace three wide, wrested command outside FROSTED ARMOUR after straightening away for the drive and moved away under
pressure. THE SKIPPER TOO stayed in range on the turn while ridden along between foes, finished with good energy and was clearly second best.
MORGAN POINT was forced in at the start and slowest away, lagged well back to the stretch, and had some late interest in the two-path. FROSTED
ARMOUR set a pressured pace slightly off the inside, could not hold off HEY PORTER turning for home, and faded through the final furlong. SWIFTWISH
raced four wide, and lacked the needed response. SUN VIKING veered in at the break, was hemmed in midway on the turn inside, raced a bit greenly
through the furlong grounds and faded. BRADY showed early speed outside FROSTED ARMOUR, and retreated around the turn. SUMMANUS was slow
into stride, and retired early.

Footnotes
RENAISANCE FROLIC came in and bumped GLORY OF FLORIDA at the start, saved ground off the pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole, closed
outside, reached near even terms near the eighth pole, dueled outside through the final furlong and prevailed. MAX K. O. tracked the pace two and three
wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, took the lead in midstretch, battled on inside of the winner and just missed in a game try. NOBLE INDY set the pace
along the rail to midstretch and was outfinished. CARIBOU CLUB pressed the pace two wide, led near the quarter pole to midstretch and weakened a bit in
the final sixteenth. VOW ME NOW was hard held inside, was boxed in around the far turn and through upper stretch, steadied near the eighth pole, angled
out and finished evenly from there. GLORY OF FLORIDA was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. OVER THE CHANNEL had his
head turned at the start and was outrun outside.

Footnotes
OCTANE became fractious and unseated the rider shortly before the loading process began, came away without further incident and was hustled hard
early, checked inside CAJUN LOVER leaving the half-mile pole, moved out chasing after that rival under a drive around the turn, took over past the
three-sixteenths pole and drove clear. FISHING FOR FUN stayed in range around the turn two to three wide, had aim outside OCTANE into the lane, did
not have enough to threaten but held for the place. ONE MORE SCORE moved in from the three-path midway on the turn, got steered back out in upper
stretch, finished greenly on his left lead outside FISHING FOR FUN and could not get past that one. THE GREEN CRUSADER broke two lengths slow,
lagged far back for a half-mile, moved to the far outside for the drive and found his best stride belatedly. BEASTFROMTHEEAST raced two to three wide
around the turn, and lacked a bid. GEMINI MOON broke two lengths slow, and was outrun four wide. HIDDEN WARRIOR broke two lengths slow, and was
always outrun inside. CAJUN LOVER set the pace, got clear from OCTANE when that one checked to his inside entering the turn, got overtaken at the top
of the lane and folded up. SOULFUL SONG was never in the hunt.

CHEZ PAREE broke slowly and was outrun for a half-mile, swung five wide coming off the turn, rallied steadily and ran past a spent KOZY DREAMS in
deep stretch to win going away. GRACE'S DRAMA was slow into stride, edged a bit closer after a half, rallied leaving the furlong grounds and was up
outside KOZY DREAMS to snag second. KOZY DREAMS pressed TEE UP early, took over outside that rival after a half-mile and pulled clear, remained
well in front with a furlong remaining, shortened stride staying on her left lead and gave way. SHE TAKES HEART pursued the leaders two wide, rallied into
second turning for home, but weakened through midstretch. LEDECKY trailed early after a slow start, raced three wide around the turn, and passed only
tired horses. TEE UP set the early pace in the two-path, got headed by KOZY DREAMS after a half and faded steadily. SPECIAL COUNSEL chased four
then three wide into the turn, and was empty under pressure approaching the stretch. SHEZA HANDFULL was through early inside.

Footnotes
BREAKTHROUGH set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, shied out under left-handed urging in midstretch, continued to drift under hand
urging through the final furlong, forcing ROMARIO to alter out constantly and stayed on well to cross the wire first. ROMARIO prompted the pace three wide,
had aim outside of the top two in upper stretch, was gaining outside then was steadily forced out into about the nine path by a drifting BREAKTHROUGH
and never allowed a clear path through the final sixteenth. LEGENDARY PRINCE was up close inside, steadied entering the turn, chased inside around the
bend, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on for the show. SURPRISE FACTOR raced two wide in midpack and had a mild stretch gain. KANTHAROS'
IMAGE pressed the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. KAUFY BEAN failed to menace while racing three wide. SI COMO
NO bobbled at the break and was outrun inside. STAR WEAVER was off slow and was outrun while racing three wide. MR TINGLES broke in a tangle,
raced four wide and was through early. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF ROMARIO, BREAKTHROUGH WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
HIERRO argued the early pace outside rivals, put a head in front of MENELIK after a half-mile, edged away past the quarter-pole and into the stretch, and
stayed clear on his left lead. DR. ROGER tracked outside the leaders four wide, had aim turning for home, could not menace the winner and ran on clearly
second best. MENELIK broke in brushing NONA RAC, lacked room tugging in and among horses early, split NONA RAC and HIERRO to vie up front after a
quarter-mile, held a short lead inside the latter entering the turn, could not match strides approaching the stretch, weakened staying on his left lead and
salvaged the show. WILD TEXAS TOM raced four wide around the turn, and could not gain late on his left lead. LAST MINUTE DEAL was no factor three
wide. COMPASS CAY improved position in the two-path after a half, but lacked a final response. NONA RAC brushed with MENELIK at the start, vied early
inside, and was through before going a half. OVERSTATED was outrun inside. KATHERN'S JOY saved ground and was through early. UNDER FIRE
retired early. SLEEPER RYAN S was outrun three to four wide. SUPER DRIVER broke slowly and trailed throughout.
