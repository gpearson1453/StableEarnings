KICK UP THE DUST broke sharply and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, swept to the lead while commencing her
rally two wide entering the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and proved much the best. DEVIL OF A DEAL tracked the leaders from along the
inside entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive, and while no threat to the winner proved easily
second best. SATURNA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to
get up for a share. FIRST AND TEN away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside
in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken soon after entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages.

U DID IT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, got the better of her pace rival midway through the turn, and drew off as much the best late. SHANGHAI DAWN broke
sharply and pressed the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, continued to force the issue in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, was unable to keep pace with that rival midway through the turn, but battled gamely one out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. DRILL
BABY DRILL settled off the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final
turn, and finished three wide in deep stretch to just miss the place. TOMMY TOO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the stretch drive while unable to make a late impact. REMARKABLE GIRL settled off the early leaders while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid.

LAUGH WITH ME away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, took control midway through the turn, and quickly drew clear. PARKER POINT bobbled slightly in the opening strides, but recovered
quickly and tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, tipped three wide to commence his bid entering the final turn, was no threat
late to the winner, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. AIRAFFAIR tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. CAUSIN' HAVOC settled off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the
drive. MACHINE trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a
serious late bid. REPRIMAND broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was both a rider's and trainer's
claim of foul. The rider and trainer of REPRIMAND lodged a claim of foul against the rider of LAUGH WITH ME for alleged interference in the run past the
wire the first time. After review both claims of foul were disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish

Footnotes
DON'T TESS ME broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly two wide in the drive to get up in time. BE COOL was off a step slow, but recovered quickly and drove up along the rail in the run to the first
turn to take a narrow advantage, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, maintained her lead into the lane, and just failed
to last. SUNGOLD BEAUTY trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn,
altered four wide in deep stretch and closed for a share. TOBESUNNY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
smartly three out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon late. DAPHNE away alertly and pressed the pace two wide through
the first turn, continued to chase the pacesetter in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. KOALA stalked the leaders through the first
turn while racing two out from the rail, dropped back in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
DAKATI stalked the leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his rally four wide entering the final turn, assumed command
entering the lane, and was all out in the final strides to prevail. SWORD FIGHTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and closed best of all four wide in the drive to just miss. SANAWAR settled off the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail,
rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed three wide from between rivals late to just miss. BOUNDARY BAY broke sharply and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, but was
outfinished in the lane. THE CHANCES R away well and tracked the leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but faded in the drive. METAL MAGIC away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but weakened in the stretch drive.

FREE FOR SURE broke sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, set sail after the leader two wide
entering the final turn, quickly assumed command leaving the turn and drew off under confident handling. ACE DEUCE away well and was allowed to settle
off the early pace while racing two wide through the lane the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, was no match for the winner
over the final furlong, but finished well to be clearly second best. WISE MARKET dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
assumed command midway down the backstretch, was overtaken midway through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a
share. WICKED FORTITUDE had a bit of an awkward beginning, and trailed the field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, raced into
contention approaching the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. MUSTACHIO settled off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail through the lane the first time, rallied three wide through the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four wide in the drive.
CRACKDOWN away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, began to drop back midway down the backside, and
had nothing to offer late, while being eased in the drive.
