Footnotes
PARTY FOR ONE pressed the pace of EDDIE AND THE KIING while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter, bumped with
that foe nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied through a prolonged drive and proved best in the closing yards. EDDIE AND THE KING was away in good
order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, bumped with that foe nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, vied into deep stretch and just missed. KID ARCADE was off a step slow then was reserved just off the leaders from between foes,
moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. BRAHMS FOREST lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and failed
to threaten. ONE TUFF MINISTER raced four-wide through both turns, showed no early foot, angled in with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid.
HIGHIWANTTOBEON was off a step slow, lagged, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE BUMPING BETWEEN PARTY FOR ONE AND EDDIE AND THE KING AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THEY CONCLUDED BOTH HORSES WERE AT FAULT AND MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
TIZ MANNY broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with I'M NOT GABBY, disposed of that rival before going a half, opened a clear margin
approaching the stretch and drew off with complete authority. WESTERN RULE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the
drive and finished with a steady rally. I'M NOT GABBY was away in good order to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened
after going a half. MIDNIGHT LUCK was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JOHN'S ON
POINT was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. SYNSKY was bumped at the break, showed brief
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SUDDENLY AWESOME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the
stretch and drew off with little need of urging. MAYBEE A DIVA was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the
drive, could not gain on the winner late but finished well to gain the place. CLUB ROYALE broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside and gave way in
the drive. WHATA FLIRT was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to
gain late. BEE EINSTEIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor.
SHELBY R. was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after the opening quarter. GEMMA ROYAL was bumped at
the break, pressed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and weakened.

pole, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off with authority. RATE FOR ME lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn,
angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up for the place. CODY'S CHOICE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, yielded to the
winner with a furlong to run and was caught late for the place. DEEPINGREEN hit the gate at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out
with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. CHRISTINE'S JACK was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the

Footnotes
IKNOWYOURFACE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. SASSY
EDIE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to gain on the winner late. TODOS SANTOS stalked
the winner while racing three-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter and lacked the needed closing response. SMASHING SUCCESS settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. BOONESBORO BEAUTY was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the
second turn and did not reach contention. BISHOPS OF COMPTON showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor.
