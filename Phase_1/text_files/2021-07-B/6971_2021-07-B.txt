Footnotes
WAR SONG broke alertly, prompted the early pace off the inside, advanced on the leader and took over midway on the turn, drew out steadily through the
lane under a hand ride to win ridden out. ICE PEAK last to leave, raced back early, roused three wide into the lane, rallied for the place to be clearly second
best, not a threat to the winner. I'M ALWAYS LATE took command after the start inside, set the pace for almost three furlongs, offered little resistance to the
winner when confronted by that one on the turn, proved no match for the runner up the final furlong, comfortably saved the show to prove best of the rest.
ROUND QUARTER void of speed in trailing most of the way, came four wide out of the turn, picked off a single tiring rival late while never a threat. D'ROCK
within striking distance early, began a steady retreat after three furlongs.

Footnotes
THE BIG IRISHMAN allowed the pace to go early, began to advance midway on the turn, challenged three wide entering the stretch, put a head in front
soon after, showed the way past the furlong marker and was edging away late under pressure. CPRIORITY closest to the leader exiting the chute, went
after that one midway on the turn, vied into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, well clear of the others. I'M A FLASHY
KID broke out, bothered rival, raced back much of the way, staged a mild rally off the inside to be clear of the rest. OUT MAKING TREBLE settled off the
pace, challenged late in the turn outside the runner up, between rivals upper stretch, flattened out. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY bothered at the start while last
away, was used to move up through the chute to show the way onto the main track, clear before a quarter, continued to show the way into the turn, stopped
when headed midway on the bend, jogged in.

Footnotes
SHACKLELACKALACKA broke with the field, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, garnered a larger advantage in the two path
turning for home, shook clear in upper stretch, found more late under firm handling to hold the runner up safe in the late going. COUNTRY DREAM behind
the first flight while saving ground, slipped through while continuing along the rail turning for home to move into contention, shifted out in upper stretch, not
enough late to overtake the winner. BREW CASA fell far back soon after the start, continued to lag early in the turn, began to improve toward the inside
turning for home, steered out widest upper stretch, finished with good energy while too late down the middle of the strip. TEN COUNT OUT with the first
flight for just over three furlongs three wide and between horses, little left for the stretch run. MONEY INTHE STARRS raced back off the early pace, lacked
a closing response. COOL SPRING away in good order, forced the issue for three furlongs while racing four wide, weakened in the drive. MISS
UNDERRATED with the pace outside the winner and between horses for over three furlongs, also backed up in the drive.

grounds then lost that advantage to the runner up, battled back in game fashion to put that same rival away and edge clear late in a solid effort. LATE NITE
MISCHIEF settled off the pace in the second fight just off the inside, steered out and advanced on the dueling leaders three wide into the lane, briefly put a
head in front past the furlong marker, outkicked to the wire by the winner, narrowly saved the place. BINDING four wide and off the pace through the first
turn, continued outside onto the backstretch, tucked in to save some ground in the two path second bend, steered back out for room in midstretch, finished
willingly late to be getting to the runner up. DEBONNAIRE DUDE dueled up front outside the winner, gained the advantage into the final turn, continued to
vie past the furlong marker, weakened from between the top two the final sixteenth. COOL INDIVIDUAL broke back, trailed early in lacking any early foot,
continued to late through the second bend, steered out widest approaching midstretch, late burst to be going best of all at the end. SOCIAL MISFIT within
striking distance while closest to the dueling leaders, three wide second turn, had little left for the drive. APPLEWOOD broke slowly, raced back early, closer
four wide turning for home, faded the final furlong. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MUSCADINE back off the early pace while saving ground, continued inside backstretch, steered out, four wide bid turning for home, dueled past the furlong
marker, dug in late to prove narrowly best in determined fashion. OH MY ACHING ARCH settled in the second flight early inside, began to move a bit closer
while between horses into the far turn, challenged three while remaining between rivals into the straight, dueled to the wire closest to the inside, proved
game to the wire to narrowly miss. SECRET BLARNEY last away, remained devoid of speed for five furlongs, began to advance in the two path final turn,
steered out a bit for the drive, rallied out in the course to be up for the show, not a threat to the top pair. SAVING ARGUMENT broke back, moved up out of
the chute to duel off the inside, gained a larger advantage briefly in the second turn, vied between horses into the lane, weakened through the stretch.
POPPI IS SMILING void of speed, improved inside of rivals into and through upper stretch, flattened out final furlong. MISS JENNY'S HALO alternated up
front closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. MY TY FU PEG forwardly placed for six furlongs, also had little left for the stretch run. G CISIVE finished
after four furlongs, trailed home.

Footnotes
HOORAY AUSTIN in striking position early inside, moved a bit closer turn, tipped out a bit for the drive, ran past the pacesetter inside the furlong marker to
win going away. REECE'S PRIORITY broke alertly, was clear after a furlong, continued to show the way through the turn, remained clear a furlong out,
proved no match for the winner late, maintained daylight for the second spot. SONOMA CRUSH in mid pack up the backstretch inside, continued to hold
position along the rail through the turn and into the lane, finished up best of the rest while unable to make headway the final furlong on the top two.
BUCKETS in the second flight off the inside, came in the two path for the drive, finished up evenly through the lane. LENAPE DRIVE broke back, lacked
speed, improved a bit late without posing a serious threat. ADIOS YANKEE remained back in lacking a serious closing kick. LION HEART LEGEND
prompted the early leader off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, tired through the stretch. MUCHO MARVIN fell back after the start and was never a
threat.

SCHNELL broke in, slight bump, with the early pace while between rivals in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the turn, disposed of the other speed
into the long, drove strongly clear. FAITH'S RACEDAY broke out to bump with YANK CRIME at the break, lagged well back in trailing, swung out to be six
wide turning for home, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to earn part of the place. UNFATHOMED raced back off the pace inside, encountered
some traffic late in the turn, continued to wait upper stretch, got through, proved no match for the winner late, game to finish in a dead heat for the second
spot. GRAND PRADO vied up front in the run up the backstretch three wide and between horses, dueled outside the winner turn, could not keep up in the
drive, lasted for the fourth spot. CORY'S LUXURY settled behind the first flight, three wide through the turn, came up empty for the run through the stretch.
YANK CRIME bumped both sides at the break, recovered quickly vied early along the inside, fell back off the dueling leaders turn, continued to weaken and
fade through the lane. COHERE back off the early pace, tired while five wide exiting the turn. CRUSADER EXPRESS flashed brief early speed on the
outside and stopped before four furlongs.

Footnotes
WILD BERT prompted the early pace off the inside, ranged up to challenge and vie three wide through the turn, showed the way through upper stretch and
held sway the final furlong while being kept to task. MONTE MAN last away, continued to be outrun up the backstretch, came three out to four wide when
under encouragement exiting the turn, finished willingly to be up late for the place. X CLOWN flashed early speed along the inside, fell back off the issue
turning into the stretch, proved stubborn in the drive, nipped late for the place. HAIL STATE back off the early pace outside, came four then five wide into
the lane, lacked the necessary closing response. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG set or forced the pace in the two path, caved in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MADELYN'S MOMENT broke alertly to set the early pace, dueled into the turn, relinquished the advantage, continued to press the issue from the outside
into the stretch, extended duel, kicked clear late. CUSTOM FOR ALY also away well, pressed early inside, dueled into the turn, took over, second duel with
the winner upper stretch, proved no match late. BEAR TOOTH PASS in mid pack while off the inside, between horses into the lane, rallied, slowly gaining
for the place. OUR LITTLE GIRL broke in to bother CHARLIE SKY, was straightened while racing well back, in some traffic through the turn, three to four
wide into the lane, improved position upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. CRAPAUD lacked speed while well wide, five wide through the turn
and into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. HAIRTRIGGER HEART settled behind the early pace, fell back steadily through the turn
inside, reimproved position through the lane while also not a serious threat. ANNIE'S LUCK floated out a bit at the start to help pinch back CHARLIE SKY,
recovered to race within striking distance for three furlongs, had little left for the drive. BEAR THE MOMENT off a step slow, raced back and failed to
menace. GRACE'S GAL broke out, trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LA LOLA back off the pace well off the
inside, four wide turn, bothered and put in tight entering the stretch, faded. CHARLIE SKY cut off and then steadied at the break, was used to move up into
contention, was giving way when getting out late in the turn to put LA LOLA in tight exiting the bend, continued to back up.
