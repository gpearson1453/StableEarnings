Footnotes
OWL RUN settled off the early pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the five
path then dug in from the head of the lane to get up the final strides. JACOB T stalked the earlier pace two deep then dueled at mostly even terms from the
half mile pole, contested the advantage through the far turn, raced clear into the lane but was caught flattening stride late yards. HAPPY CHAMP stalked
from the four path the first turn then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and flattened stride
the final eighth. FEISTY AND SASSY rated close off the rail then moved to even terms while between horses approaching the half mile pole, contested at a
close disadvantage near the rail on the far turn but weakened the final furlong. WHAT A STORY was not a factor. FIBERTOWN took the early lead inside,
gave chase toward the half mile pole but faded on the backstretch. DOMINATOR raced well off the pace in the two and three paths and was not a factor.

RIDING CLOUD NINE saved ground off the pace then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, steadily improved three wide on the far turn, dug in for the
lead in later yards and widened with mostly a strong hand ride. BOP MARLEY saved ground off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and steadily progressed to take a slim brief lead mid-stretch, but was outfinished later yards. NAUTICAL WARRIOR rated close off the rail
the opening turn then took the lead into the backstretch, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn but was caught
mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. NAZCA MYSTERY took a slim early lead to show the way but was caught into the backstretch, gave chase
from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. CHAMPAGNE JAM raced well off the pace while saving early ground, showed little
response through the backstretch then raced in the six path of the far turn. MR. SNAP stalked two deep the first turn, gave chase through the backstretch
then faded into the far turn.

BEYOND PRETTY saved ground on the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily closed at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the
head of the lane to take the lead mid-stretch and inched clear later yards. CAROLINA BAMBINA rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the
quarter pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly yielded
later yards. WIN THEN GRIN settled off the pace in the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path then dug in through the lane to hold third. MABEL settled off the pace two deep while between horses on the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. VIOLANE rated off the pace inside, bid nearing the five
sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then weakened. JEAN GREY raced in the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, started a bid
nearing the three eighths pole, ran wide on the far turn and showed little more. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK came through the first turn in the four path and
settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. WATERLOO ROSE rounded
the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace from the half, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole then weakened in the four
path of the far turn.

LIKE ME OR NOT stalked two deep then picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady
handling from the head of the lane and took over later yards. VINTAGE GIN rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, was steadily encouraged from the top of the stretch but reluctantly yielded later yards. LADY MADISON raced boxed
at the rail the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, angled three wide into the stretch and
finished well while gaining on the top two. MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the pace in the two and three paths, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
continued in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly through the lane. RUN ON ENERGY rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled outside
into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and finished evenly. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW
rounded the opening turn in the four path, settled close into the backstretch and started a bid toward the three eighths pole, but flattened stride in the four
path of the far turn. WHIZ PASS was not a factor. HELL OF AFIRE came through the first turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and
showed little response. LADY'S CORK was pulled up shortly after the break and walked off post race.

quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn then drew off the final furlong. MALETTA rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled mostly at even terms from that point, gave up the nod past the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and was
steadily encouraged to hold second. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR saved ground well off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn about the six path, finished well to take third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. LOOKIN' SMART raced in the five path the first turn, started
a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened in the stretch. STROLLANOTHERTIME settled off the pace about the four
path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. EXPLOITATION
saved ground on the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened in the five path of the far
turn. FUDGE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded approaching the far turn. STEPHANOPOULOS rated
close to the early pace inside, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. BULLY DANCER rounded the first turn in
