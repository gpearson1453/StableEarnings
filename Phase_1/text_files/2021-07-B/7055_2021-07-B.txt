then weakened. SEPICATO lagged inside early, swung wide into the stretch but couldn't gain. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA dueled outside to the turn then

between horses to the turn then fell back. FALSE ALARM raced three wide with the pace to the stretch then tired. LOVINISEASY was no factor.

SWAN POINT broke slowly, was steadied soon after the break, trailed early, circled into the stretch, closed outside and was up in time. PEGASUS IN
FLIGHT settled inside then finished fast between rivals to miss. LOOK WHAT I FOUND pressed outside, moved to the front entering the stretch, held a clear
lead into late stretch but couldn't last. ALDINA was slow early, rallied three wide around the final turn, gained slowly between rivals through the lane then
steadied in tight through the final yards. An objection by Flores against the second finisher was not allowed. BLUEBERRY PIE raced three wide within
striking distance to the stretch and weakened. HELEN MARIE raced two wide between rivals around the final turn and lacked a closing. BOHEMIA BABE
made the pace along the rail to the stretch then tired. DUNEAGLE had position three wide for over a half then faded.

Footnotes
FISHMAN moved clear into the first turn, stayed inside while widening around the final turn, remained clear into late stretch and lasted. MARC WELLS
lagged early, rallied two wide around the final turn and closed a gap from the outside in the final yards. BOSSY CAT chased three wide and lacked the
needed rally. NIGHTENFORD KAZ had position to the far turn then tired. BAREFOOTIN' BAY stopped. FAUSTO GOLD was outrun.
