FLAT OUT DONNA broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the turn, drifted off the rail through the turn, and drew clear in the drive
while finishing three wide. SOARINGFORTHESUN chased the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, and finished willingly two wide in the
drive to prove second best. CAROLINA GENT lacked the early speed to contend in the run to the turn, saved ground through the turn, but finished with late
interest from along the rail in deep stretch. HE'S A SAINT away alertly and chased the leader into the turn while racing two out from the rail, was unable to
keep pace with the leader through the turn, and was outfinished late. Following the running of this race, there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of
SOARINGFORTHESUN lodged a claim of foul against the rider of FLAT OUT DONNA, for alleged interference entering the turn. After review, the claim of
foul was disallowed and no change was made to the original order of finish

BOLD ARCH away well and vied for the lead from the outside of FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that
rival into the backstretch, took control midway to the final turn, opened a clear advantage through the turn, and continued to widen that margin late under
confident handling. BAKTURA settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the
final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides.
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, was unable to match strides with BOLD ARCH in
the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and just failed to hold the place while racing one out from the rail in the drive. BABY GRAND away
alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, angled towards the rail
midway through the turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. RACING RIVER settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied five wide through the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing three wide in the drive. BAKLANE
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

FORT LANGLEY settled towards the back of a compact field while racing four out from the rail entering the second turn, began to advance three wide
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and inched clear through the lane. JUST MAKE
BELIEVE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, eased into a tracking tri from along the rail entering the
second turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. PADDY D'ORO away
well and eased off the leaders entering the first turn to grab a tracking position, continued to track the pacesetter two wide in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to get up for a share. THE ALL BUTTON away well and dueled for the lead one out from the rail
entering the stretch the first time, assumed command entering the second turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was
overtaken entering the lane, and faded in the late stages. CHEF settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the
first time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. EUROPEAN tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backside, opened a clear lead entering the final turn, and was geared down late to prove best. MASTER EWEN settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for the
place. COURTSHIP away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. TEXAS KID broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground
along the inside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon in the lane. MOUSSAKA CHEF unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the drive. SIR BARCLAY settled off
the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid.
ANOTHER GUINNESS stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but faded in the
late stages. IT'S IN COMMAND pressed the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, continued to force the issue to the final turn, before
weakening.

that lead in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was all out in the final strides to fend off MY COLLEGE FUND to prevail. MY
COLLEGE FUND settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and
finished with a rush three wide in deep stretch to just miss. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the
stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to get up for a share. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN broke sharply
and stalked the leader through the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was outfinished in
the stretch drive. SIDESHOW unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. STAY ALL
