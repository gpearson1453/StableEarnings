Footnotes
DEFENSE WINS bumped both sides at the start, stalked up close between foes, vied for the lead around the turn, gained control exiting the bend, kicked
clear in upper stretch and held well. KA'NAH got bumped on both sides at the start, raced in range off the rail, shifted out entering the stretch and finished
well. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA bumped in the beginning, traveled three deep outside the top pair, challenged for command and the five-sixteenths, vied
three deep to the lane, but was no match for the top pair in the stretch run. CATBERNAY broke out and bumped rival, went up to take control then cleared,
headed at the five-sixteenths, vied from inside around the turn, lost command entering the stretch and weakened. PALALEO broke out, tracked outside a
rival into the turn, went five wide around the bend and lacked a bid. PRINCE MAGICIAN broke well then dropped back to chase between foes, took the turn
four wide and weakened. RAYRAY stumbled badly at the start, went four to five wide around the turn and was not a factor. MAYBE SOMETIME saved
ground from off the pace and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GRACE ADLER had early speed outside the top pair then chased up the backstretch, ranged up outside the top pair at the quarter pole, entered the lane
four to five wide, dug in late and overhauled the runner-up. VALENTINA GHADA came away alertly, pressed the pace from outside, bid between runners
with a quarter mile remaining, struck the front past the eighth pole but got outkicked by the winner. SUGAR SUGAR got bumped leaving the gate, went up to
take control early, challenged at the quarter pole, maintained a short lead to the eighth pole but yielded in deep stretch. HAUTE LADY bobbled at the start,
chased along the inside then two wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TRAVEL SMART sat off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, five wide
into the stretch and never threatened. ICE MAIDEN broke out and bumped rival at the start, tracked off the rail, angled from the two path to the four path
around the turn and proved no menace.

Footnotes
MACKINNON went up to press the pace from outside, asked at the five-sixteenths, dueled into the stretch, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and edged
clear. IL CAPITANO took control early, set the pace inside of MACKINNON into the backstretch, battled around the far turn and into the stretch, resisted to
mid-stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth while clearly second best. LOOKOUT POINT bumped with inside rival at the start, got bumped into the first
turn, went three deep into the backstretch, switch inside rival then went between at the half-mile pole, chased three wide into the stretch and got up for the
show. QUINCEY got bumped into the first turn, trailed early, moved to the inside to save ground on the far turn, bothered by ASTRONOMER shifting in at
the furlong marker, continued along the inside and missed the show. ASTRONOMER stalked the pace on the inside, two wide into the stretch, shifted in at
the eighth pole and flattened between runners. FOWLER BLUE bumped with outside rival at the start, was rank early and steadied off heels then pulled
around the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep at the half-mile, started to weaken around the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA KOOK was off a bit slow from outside, went four wide through the first turn, drew alongside the top pair at the half-mile marker, vied leaving
the backstretch, dueled with APPRECIATED around the far turn, shook free at the eighth pole and drew away. APPRECIATED dueled for the lead near the
inside, vied with outside rivals leaving the backstretch, dueled with CALIFORNIA KOOK past the five-sixteenths pole and into the stretch, could not keep
pace entering the furlong grounds but stayed on to hold the place. HAPI HAPI bumped with outside rival at the start, stalked in the two path to the stretch
and finished evenly. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH raced off the pace early on, traveled three deep at the half-mile pole, angled out past the five-sixteenths
pole and lacked the needed rally. ANITANEWMERCEDES lost footing and came away to a slow beginning, settled inside then moved into the two path,
angled five wide around the far turn and was never a factor. WITHOUT MALICE bumped with inside rival at the start, went four wide around the first turn
while dueling for command, vied between nearing the far turn, dropped back around that bend, tired in the lane, eased across the wire and walked off.
ASARO went three wide around the first turn, traveled between on the backstretch, traveled three then two wide on the second bend, tired and eased to the
wire and walked off.

DOUBLE WHOPPER sped clear and crossed over quickly, remained unchallenged into the lane, roused in upper stretch and drew off under right-handed
urging. MALIBU MISTRESS bumped with inside rival at the start, chased along the inside then steered out at the top of the stretch and bested the rest.
MIND MELD bumped at the start, raced at the back up the backstretch, advanced inside through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and gained the show.
TIL I FOUND YOU up close early outside the pacesetter, chased two wide through the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. DEL MAR FLASH tracked
between foes early, angled to the rail on the turn and failed to threaten. EMMA'S DANCE sat off the pace outside a pair of rivals, angled in near the
three-sixteenths and could not rally. SPEEDING traveled near the back of the pack outside a rival, navigated the turn three then four wide and proved no
menace. GAYLES EVENING chased off the inside, three wide around the bend and retreated.

DARK PRINCE dueled from outside on the first turn, cleared near the nine-sixteenths, opened up on the far turn and remained well clear to the wire under
strong handling. FULL DRAW false broke at the start, traveled between runners then outside a rival on the first turn, entered the lane four wide and rallied
for the place. RAILSPLITTER dueled for the lead from inside on the first turn and into the backstretch, chased the winner past the nine-sixteenths, lost
ground around the second bend and got edged for the place. SUPER CLASSIC bobbled leaving the gate, tracked along the inside to the stretch and never
launched a bid. UNILATERAL settled off the pace, exited the far turn five wide and failed to threaten. ACHILLEUS dropped back shortly after the start,
trailed through the early stages, came three wide into the lane and improved position. SILENT MUSKETIER traveled five then four wide on the first turn,
went four wide into the second bend, angled six wide and lacked a rally. VERY IRISH raced three deep then four wide on the first turn, came five wide into
the stretch and had little left. DR. HOFFMAN sat well off the pace, traveled in the two path into the drive, tired and eased to the wire and walked off.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED FULL DRAW CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A
STARTER.

Footnotes
MISS CAROUSEL bumped with rival at the start, angled to the inside while settling off the pace, angled off the fence at the eight pole, surged late and got
up in time. AFTER MIDNIGHT away quickly from outside, angled down to the two path, inched away around the turn and got nailed at the wire. ALICE
MARBLE chased between then got crowded early, angled to the inside, saved ground into the stretch and finished willingly inside the top pair. TRINA was
up close early on the inside, chased the winner two wide into the drive, moved out a bit further but lacked the needed late kick. LAVA LANE chased four
deep early then outside a rival, between foes into the turn, checked past the five-sixteenths pole, lacked room near the quarter pole, steered out at the top of
the lane and could not summon the needed rally. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA broke out and bumped rival, dropped back early, angled out in the stretch and
passed tired rivals. ENSLEYS DREAM was forwardly placed outside a rival, took the turn two wide and weakened. SMILING ANNIE bumped leaving the
gate, traveled wide up the backstretch, four to three wide around the turn and came up empty. CAPITAL HEAT chased between early, three deep into the
turn, four wide into the stretch and weakened. GOING TO SHABOOMS stumbled and bumped with rival at the start, checked between at the
seven-sixteenths pole, fell back on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MEDIA BLITZ settled early on the inside, entered the stretch a bit off the rail, moved back to the fence, rallied to the front at the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. SASH (GB) sped clear and steered to the inside early, lost command at the nine-sixteenths pole, switch outside and went up to challenge leaving the
backstretch, dueled around the far turn, regained command with a furlong remaining but yielded the final sixteenth. RIP CITY got bumped from inside early,
tracked three deep, chased three to four wide on the far turn and finished willingly for the show. READY SOUL was bumped between and put in tight
quarters early, raced off the pace off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. FOREVER POE
unhurried in the beginning, angled down to the two path, exited the far turn four wide and kept on to advance. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE angled to the inside
early, advanced along the rail into the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and needed more late. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO came away last and got bothered
at the start, trailed early then rushed up to gain the lead at the nine-sixteenths, dueled around the far turn, was overtaken at the eighth pole and weakened.
GET HER NUMBER was closest in pursuit early then chased the top pair outside a rival on the backstretch, then failed to find the needed response when
called upon. PROVERB drifted out and bumped rival early, chased between rivals then two wide, dropped back on the last turn and tired.

Footnotes
DR. SCHIVEL settled outside a rival early, went three wide into the turn then angled out and came five wide into the stretch, rallied four deep, gained
command with a sixteenth remaining and gamely prevailed. EIGHT RINGS stalked outside rivals, navigated the turn three then four wide, bid three deep
and finished gamely to the wire. C Z ROCKET chased from off the pace up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the turn,
closed widest through the lane and missed the place. LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN stumbled leaving the gate, raced up close inside the pacesetter, angled out to
the three path around the bend, bid between in upper stretch, struck the front past the eighth pole but got outkicked in the final sixteenth. BRICKYARD RIDE
bobbled at the start but recovered quickly to take control, set the pace, outside rivals then cleared into the turn, showed the way a bit off the rail into the
stretch, challenged in the lane and clung to a narrow advantage at the eighth, relinquished the lead shortly after passing the marker and weakened late.
SHOOTERS SHOOT trailed early on the inside, angled four wide leaving the turn and passed tired rivals. QUICK TEMPO forwardly placed outside a rival,
dropped back on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. VERTICAL THREAT chased along the inside, lost ground around the bend and
faded.
