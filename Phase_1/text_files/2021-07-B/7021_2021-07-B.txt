POPPY'S GIRL stalked the pace saving ground surging clear into upper stretch angling a bit off the rail holding firm to wire. MISS HEART slow early lagged
to upper stretch responding late at mid track closing to save place. ESTRELA CADENTE raced evenly coming four wide down the lane giving a mild late
bid. GRADY'S LADY came away alertly setting the pace to the far turn being passed from the inside near the quarter pole weakening the final eighth.
PLAYFUL UNION slow early lost ground to upper stretch posing no menace in the six path. CRITICAL HUMOR played no factor. SWEET LEAF was never
in contention. HUNTER'S HELLCAT gave way on the far turn.
