UNSTOPPABLE GAL lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off
with complete authority. BETHEL RIDGE bobbled at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished
willingly. WHYNOTGEORGIA dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. SNOOZY SUZY disputed the pace while racing
four-wide and gave way after going five furlongs. SHEZJUSTINTHYME was away in good order to vie for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide
through the turn and weakened in the drive. A GOOD SNICKER showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TURNAROUND sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held off the closing
PARTY FOR ONE in deep stretch to prevail. PARTY FOR ONE tracked the winner from the inside, angled out into the stretch, could not reach that rival in
the drive but was gaining late. BRAHMS FOREST lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with
a belated bid. FAR WEST settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly in the drive. REGAZZE CAT hopped at the start, lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. EMPEROR'S CHOICE broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened
after going three-quarters.

PLEASE ME was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong
to run and drew off. SHARMEL was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing three-wide from between foes, could not match strides with the
winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. QUEEN BREEZY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, checked while lacked racing room
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. STAND IN YOUR LOVE pressed the pace while racing
four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained a brief lead and gave way in the drive. SLEEPY SUE lacked early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and failed to menace. BESOS FOR LILY was bumped at the break, set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
CHOTEAU settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear
margin and held off the closing LOOKOUT TAYLOR to prevail. LOOKOUT TAYLOR was off a step slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the
second turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied late in a good effort. LINDA'S BALLET was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when
challenged nearing the three-eighths marker, vied and gave way through the final furlong. IKNOWYOURFACE broke sharply to press the pace of LINDA'S
BALLET while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the three-eighths pole, vied and gave way to the winner through the final furlong.
BOONESBORO BEAUTY lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. CELEE'S TE was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the second turn, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CURIOUS SENSATION sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. IT'S
CURLIN TIME chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to re-gain the place. SHADY RETREAT
was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished willingly in the drive. JACANA lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. TIMELESS BELLE was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to menace.
SWEET KATIE O broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. LIRIO TIGRADO was off slow, raced
four-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane.

OMACHE KID stalked the pace of ALL ABOUT TIME while racing four-wide, responded when steady urging and wore that rival down in the closing yards to
be going away late. MELCHIOR chased the pace of ALL ABOUT TIME while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. ALL ABOUT TIME sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and
gave way late. ROCKET POWER was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. COOL EDGE settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. MR BINGLEY was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
turn and did not menace. GOBOLDLY raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
NATIONAL HEROINE was off a step slow, tracked the leaders from the inside, moved to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. SHE'S MY
RIDE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. FRENCH
TUDOR was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. DRAGON LADY chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. AMBERS STORM was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and did not offer a bid. DAME OF THE WEST was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way
through the final furlong. FOUR SCORE was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the
quarter and weakened.
