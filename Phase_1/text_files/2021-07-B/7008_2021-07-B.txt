Footnotes
SHANGHAI ESSENCE broke out at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside of TRADE SECRET, vied in the two path while between
foes on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, battled with two opponents past the eighth-pole, dueled inside the runner-up while drifting in some in
the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. TAP N GLO came out at the start and bumped with a rival then was hustled, chased the
leading duo on the outside, engaged those foes in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch on even terms for the lead, battled outside of two
opponents past the eighth-pole, dueled outside of the winner while drifting in some in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. TRADE
SECRET was away alertly, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, fought on
under a drive into the final furlong then weakened but was well clear for the show. TOUT ENSEMBLE broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was roused
two to three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to rally. LADY MILAGRO was bumped at the start and forced out while off a
bit slow, settled on the outside, moved in some around the half-mile pole, was asked while three then four wide on the turn, drifted in after turning into the
stretch and came up empty. OPENTHEGATE broke a step slow as four foes broke behind the top three, dropped well behind, came three wide into the
stretch, moved out more near the furlong marker and was no factor. S OH S broke in and a step slow, was coaxed along on the inside, dropped back while
saving ground on the turn and retreated.

prevailed under strong urging. LA VICTORIA was caught four wide on the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far
turn, made a bid outside of two foes into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner while rubbing saddles with that foe in the final furlong and just missed
while clear for the place. POP THE BUBBLY was jostled in the hindquarters early, went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed
the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back
into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. TAPPLE CIDER jostled the hindquarters of POP THE BUBBLY early then was in tight off
heels, raced between horses under stout restraint in the two path on the first turn, dropped back in tight quarters early on the backstretch, leveled out near
the five-eighths, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped back while two then three wide on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and

Footnotes
AMUNDSON brushed at the start by EXCELLENT TIMING, who broke inwards, dueled with that rival to his outside three then two wide before easing off
into the turn, chased along the inside through the turn patiently handled, cut the corner into upper stretch and was paused and steadied as EXCELLENT
TIMING took to the rail in front at the three-sixteenths, tipped out to the two path inside that station, rallied to loosely split rivals a furlong out issuing a
challenge to take command near the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish. BRONX BOMBER broke out at the start and was corrected, crossed to
the inside after the start and was along the rail down the backstretch and into the turn before tipping out two then three wide near the three-eighths pole,
came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home and angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, then kicked on belatedly through to the finish to secure the
place honors. BINKSTER four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to
procure the show honors. EXCELLENT TIMING broke in at the start brushing AMUNDSON, dueled from the three path early on with that rival to his inside,
gained sole command into the turn as his main pace rival backed off, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under pressure to the outside through
the latter portion of the turn from MOONACHIE, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and took to the inside near the three-sixteenths forcing
AMUNDSON in behind to steady and alter out, dug in clinging to the front and was collared near the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages.
POWER UP PAYNTER broke out at the start and was corrected, chased two to three wide from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MOONACHIE coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide, advanced on the
front through the latter portion of the turn bidding into contention to issue a challenge spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in all out to the eighth pole,
got shaken off inside that station and weakened to the finish.

Footnotes
LIME was away alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dueled inside of the
runner-up in the stretch, drifted out some under a left-handed crop late and narrowly prevailed. AIR CAVALRY was hustled from the start, pressed the pace
on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and was denied while clear for the place. LUCKY LATKES was
hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, shifted three wide into the stretch,
pursued the top two in the drive and finished with good courage for the show. CARLY HUSTLE was hustled from the start, chased the pace, went around
the turn in the two path, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH settled off the
pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and gained but failed to menace. BELLA DOMENICA broke a step
slow, moved up on the outside, tracked four wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. SUMMER AT THE
SPA settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. STRETCHTHESTORY dropped
towards the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. ENTWINE (IRE) broke a step slow, was urged along at the back, went five wide
on the turn, dropped to the four path into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS MAMBA was away awkwardly, raced in the back half of the field under
urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MISS INTERPRET hustled from the gate, chased four wide throughout under coaxing from the three-eighths, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge
through the final furlong and just got on the wire when getting brushed by LEMIEUX at the end. LEMIEUX hustled from the start, showed the way coaxed
along from the two path under some pressure from ROUNDABOUT to the outside, tucked inside through the turn, shook off that rival near the quarter pole
and spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive drifting out with seventy yards to go forcing KNOWING GLANCE to be taken hold of and brushing
the aforementioned foe as she nailed her on the wire. KNOWING GLANCE just off the pace four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish, got forced to be taken in hand as LEMIEUX drifted out
nearing the finish and was along for the show honors. SHARED FUTURE hustled from the start, chased along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch,
tipped out to be two to three wide at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive and was outfinished. DEMANDSRESPECT coaxed from the gate, chased
three wide, pulled a bit keen and was taken under a hard hold off the heels of a rival half a mile from home, continued three wide through the turn, went five
wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the wire. GAL IN A RUSH four then three wide in pursuit, tucked briefly to the two path midway on the
turn, angled out six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FOUR DAWN hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. ROUNDABOUT coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside three then two
wide, began to fade near the quarter pole and went three to four wide into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

KAELY'S SISTER was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked under threat outside the
five-sixteenths, easily disposed of THIEF OF HEARTS at the quarter-pole, drew off under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand-ride
to the wire while much the best. CADEAU DE PAIX broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three then
four wide at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. APRIL ANTICS was hustled from the start but showed no
speed, dropped well behind under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was along for the show. LOT OF
HONEY was well placed just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and came up empty. THIEF OF HEARTS was bumped at the start while last away, moved out then advanced to track the pace on the outside, inched
forward in the three path to make a bid on the turn, dropped back quickly into the stretch and faltered badly. POLISHED GEM broke a half-step slow, was
hustled up between horses to get the lead, contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back outside the

Footnotes
YOU'RE TO BLAME three then two wide into the first turn, took to the inside down the backstretch tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out under use of a left handed crop and nudged LOCALLY OWNED to the four path at the quarter pole making a lane to engage the
leader, took over command straightened away and went clear under a drive to prevail. LOCALLY OWNED bumped at the start by CHRIS AND DAVE due to
pressure from WINSTON'S CHANCE breaking in a step, raced three then two wide through the first turn settled in mid pack, chased just off the inside down
the backstretch and through the far turn, tipped out a path nearing the quarter pole and allowed himself to be readily nudged by the aforementioned foe to
the four path into upper stretch, not willing to hold his lane, paused briefly straightened away before being re-roused, proved no match for the top one while
offering up late foot to secure the place honors. CHRIS AND DAVE three then two wide into the first turn, attended the leader to the outside from the two
path, took over narrow command at the three-eighths and knocked heads through the latter portion of the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside for home, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. YANKEE DIVISION broke outwards at the start bumping
FALKIRK into DACK JANIEL'S while under the whip and hustled intent on the lead, established the front and settled under rating showing the way along the
inside, came under pressure near the midway point on the far turn and was headed for command, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DACK
JANIEL'S brushed at the start by FALKIRK due to pressure from YANKEE DIVISION breaking outwards, raced four then three wide through the first turn,
chased four wide from that point on under prolonged coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and made no impact. WINSTON'S
CHANCE four then three wide through the first turn, settled perched three wide in range of the top pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home and tired. FALKIRK got bumped at the start by YANKEE DIVISION and in turn brushed DACK JANIEL'S, chased just off the inside, swung
two to three wide for home and trailed throughout. There was a Trainer's Objection by the trainer of LOCALLY OWNED alleging interference against
YOU'RE TO BLAME at the quarter pole which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the result standing and the race being declared official.

Footnotes
ROYAL FLAG tucked into the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, moved closer while two then three wide on the far turn, was roused
outside the quarter-pole, swung seven wide into the stretch then drifted out before being straightened by the rider, rallied outside under a left-handed crop
into the final furlong and closed strongly near the center of the track to get up late and prevail. HOROLOGIST went to the front, set the pace on the inside
through solid fractions, was asked at the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path while put to the crop, led gamely while holding off multiple
challengers into the final sixteenth but was caught while just able to hold the place. CRYSTAL BALL went three wide on the opening bend, settled on the
outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch, made a bid outside of two foes at
the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just missed the place but was clear for the show. GOLD SPIRIT
(CHI) rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was given her cue in the three path on
the final turn, made a bid into upper stretch, battled between foes into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. DUNBAR ROAD traveled around the first turn
in the two path, settled while last but one, moved closer in the three then four path on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came six wide into
the stretch, held a good striking position under a drive into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed response. LIBERTY M D bobbled at the
start, was rank under restraint through the first turn then taken up onto the backstretch, moved up outside the five-eighths to prompt the pace, came up
empty on the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MUBARMAJ coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the early leader before advancing to duel with that rival five
and a half furlongs from home, knocked heads into the turn taking over command three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
under challenge now from EASY SHOT to the outside, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, held sway to the
finish kept to task. SOMEDAY JONES chased just off the inside just off the pace coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. VILLAINOUS two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths and commenced a three wide bid through the turn culminating in swinging six to seven wide into upper stretch, then kicked on belatedly
outside to the finish to get up for the show honors. EASY SHOT two to three wide in pursuit, began to advance on the top pair three furlongs from home and
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths bidding into contention to issue a challenge swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
repelled a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. LEGIT struck the off side stall at the start getting away near the rear of
the field, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CREA'S BKLYN
LAW just off the inside through the first turn, went four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far turn coming
under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, swung four to five wide for home and offered no rally. RESPECT FOR ALL hustled from the gate, raced
forwardly placed three wide through the first turn establishing the front and settling under rating showing the way three then two wide down the backstretch,
had MUBARMAJ advance inside and dueled with that rival with five and a half furlongs to go, came under coaxing nearing the midway point on the turn, got
headed at the three-eighths, faded nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the
off side straightened away, then tired to the finish. O SHEA CAN U SEE chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, continued in the
inside route into upper stretch and tired. AMERICAN LINCOLN three then two wide through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch and
through the far turn under coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, faded, cornered three wide for home, faltered and was eased through to the finish.
