Footnotes
EPIC LUCK set the early pace while clear and on the inside, dawdled along down the backstretch and drew off in the stretch under left handed urging.
MENELAO tracked the winner three wide and made a mild bid on the far turn but could not sustain that bid while being clearly second best. MAJESTIC
FRONTIER was four wide into the first turn, then was settled five wide down the backstretch and entering the far turn, then moved to the inside in the lane
but offered no rally while besting the rest. PAINTED LOVE was allowed to settle while four wide down the backstretch, then was three wide by the quarter
pole and was empty. SPEED DIALER was bumped at the start, then made a inside middle move leaving the three eighths pole and tired. RUBEN'S BIG
LEGACY showed little and was vanned off.

SCARLET TANAGER stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front by the furlong marker and then was going away
late to prove much the best under a mild drive. KEEPER IN SPITE set a pressured pace three wide, then was headed by the winner approaching the furlong
marker and could not go with that rival late while being second best. PROBABLY GRACE pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened, held show
award late. DAT DARES GOLD was between horses early, then was rated off the pace two wide and had no rally while just missing the show award.

GOODBYE CAROLINA stalked the early pace four wide, then made a four wide bid on the backstretch to vie for command, then drifted out in the upper
stretch and drew clear in the furlong grounds, then held on late to prove best under a drive. ESTILO ELEGANTE was well rated throughout, came three
wide into the drive and closed well. SAILOR'S SALUTE chased the early pace in between horses, came four wide into the drive but lacked the needed
winning kick. EPHEMERAL set the early pace and then vied for command with the winner on the turn and faded in the drive. WINNINGFORPLEASURE was
reserved early on the inside, came five wide into the drive to have a belated rally. REMARKABLE LASS passed the tiring rivals. TRULY A DREAM pressed
the early pace in between rivals and weakened. DRINK THE TAP was allowed to settle while four wide down the backstretch, came 5 wide into the drive
and had no rally. COCKTAILS AT EIGHT chased the pace four wide and weakened. DANCE SO FRE was bumped at the start, not a factor. BLACK COAST
was five wide into the first turn and was not a threat.

CHARGE ACCOUNT was three wide on the first turn while stalking the place, then moved out five wide on the backstretch and made a five wide bid on the
far turn and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. ALL GOOD TIMES was inside on the first turn while well placed, moved out four
wide entering the backstretch, made a four wide bid leaving the half mile marker to lead for a few strides, but could not go with the winner leaving the turn,
then came up empty in the drive while holding on to the place award. SUIKO was four wide into the first turn, then was shuffled back on the backstretch,
then came into the drive four wide and offered a mild late rally. PERSISTO was allowed to settle early and made a five wide middle move and weakened.
MOMA TIGER was five wide on the first turn, then moved towards the inside and lacked a rally. MISS TAP DANCE set the pace while off the rail and gave
way. CRAZY BEA was bumped at the start, then chased the early pace and saved ground to the quarter pole and swung out four wide but was empty.

Footnotes
QUIET PLEASE set the early pace while clear and racing off the rail, was well handled down the backstretch, then was headed leaving the turn but
responded well when roused and drew out in the final furlong to prove best. SHAKE D MOON broke inwardly at the start, then stalked the early pace four
wide, then made a five wide bid to go on even terms with the winner but flattened out the final furlong while clearly second best. BOURN WILD AGAIN was
allowed to settle while four wide and offered no rally.
