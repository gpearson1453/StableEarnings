then rallied mildly on the rail. AFFLUENTIAL was outrun early and closed belatedly in the lane. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) dueled inside for the lead,
dueled on the turn and weakened in the stretch. JOHNNY OBVIOUS dueled between rivals in the three way scrimmage, dueled on the turn and faded.

came wide into the stretch, finished evenly outside and just missed for the show spot. HEY HEY HALEY dueled between rivals for the lead, dueled on the

SAND DUNE tracked on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside of SAN ANTONE and wore down that rival in
deep stretch to prevail. SAN ANTONE dueled outside for the lead, shook free at the top of the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and yielded
grudgingly late. HANGAR ONE dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, weakened in the lane and was clear for the show spot. DREAMING
THOUSAND broke a step slow, raced off the pace, saved ground turning for home and lacked a rally. CHOCLATE BODIE away alertly, chased the pace,
came three wide into the lane and weakened. PRICING EXERCISE raced five wide early, chased three wide on the turn and tired. TWISTED SUNSET
raced four wide leaving the chute and gave way on the turn.

for the place spot. LITTLE RED BUTTON tracked early on, bid two wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in and lost second at the wire. THATS
JUST HEARSAY showed good early speed, dueled inside on the turn, dug in at the top of the lane and then weakened. PASS THE SALSA raced off the

faded. PROMINENT HENNY steadied at the start, raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and did not factor. MS. GUCCI GIRL broke awkwardly and

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BAY stalked two wide, tracked on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, moved up alongside of PUGILIST and wore down that rival late
for the win. PUGILIST set the pace on the inside, opened up a longer lead passing the half mile marker, showed the way into the stretch, responded when
asked and dug in gamely to the finish. INCONVENIENT FACTS raced off the pace two wide, saved ground on the far turn, angled out for the drive and
rallied mildly. CLASSIC LADY pulled in the early stages, settled off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. B B'S BUSTED raced
off the pace inside and failed to threaten. I'M LISTENING raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and had no rally.

Footnotes
TUESDAY'S ROSE stalked close up three wide, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dueled, dropped back a bit, then came again outside and wore down her
rival in deep stretch to prevail. MISSPOTOFGOLD vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, drew clear nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely and
yielded grudgingly late. TUFF BIRD vied two wide for the lead, dueled between rivals passing the quarter pole, weakened and bested the others. MY
BLONDE MARY raced off the pace, came wide and had no rally. GIRL POWDER chased inside and tired. RISEN CHANGE was outrun.
