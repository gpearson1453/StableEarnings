Footnotes
MYSTICAL MAN was asked leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the four path, was coaxed along just off the pace, made a three wide bid under urging
on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, kicked clear under a drive in upper stretch, drew away under urging into the final sixteenth then swapped
back to his inside lead while eased up in the final seventy yards. BOLD VICTORY broke in and bumped with a foe then was pulled off that rival, went three
wide on the opening bend, settled outside on the backstretch, was roused four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely
secured the place while no match for the winner. GROUP HUG was hustled from the start, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was well
placed just off the pace, chased inside on the far turn and weakened while clearly best of the rest. TALLIS was sent hard from the start, raced in the three
path on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path under urging on the far turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and
tired. ABDAN went to the front, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked under heavy threat on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner at the
quarter-pole and gave way. THE ANGRY MAN was bumped in the hindquarters at the start then had WELSHMAN clip his heels, was urged some while four
wide on the first turn, settled down the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the far turn, floated five wide while dropping back into the stretch and
faltered. WELSHMAN broke out then bobbled after clipping the heels of THE ANGRY MAN, was keen early then reserved while two to three wide, raced
under urging on the final turn and failed to respond. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, went four then
three wide on the first turn and never reached contention. ISLANDMAN broke near the back of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turns, came out
five wide into the stretch and showed little.

got set down spinning just off the inside for home, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under challenge from flanking rivals and finished between them just
lasting on the wire. SNICKET chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route at the quarter pole and tipped to the
two path straightened away for home before tipping out to the three path three-sixteenths from home, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and
just missed at the finish. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY got steadied after the start and conceded four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide from near
the rear, advanced through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the inside through the final
eighth and missed at the end. BEAUTIFUL KAREN prompted the leader from the outside three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. LEFT LEANING LUCY four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the
two path through the turn coming under urging at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and passed tired foes. HONEY MONEY chased four

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL went straight to the front, opened up a clear advantage in the two path, dropped to the rail late on the backstretch, dictated terms while inside
on the far turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch then was put to a left-handed crop, widened into the final furlong, remained under a drive until
outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. HIGH FASHION broke out and bumped with a foe, settled on the inside, was urged
along on the far turn, came clearly off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured the place. FAMILY TIME was hustled from the start, rounded
the first turn in the two path under some restraint, settled down the backstretch, was asked while shifting from two to three wide on the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch under a drive, drifted out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and weakened while best of the rest. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN bumped
with foes on both sides at the start then was squeezed back, settled on the inside, was put to strong urging with five furlongs to run, saved ground on the
final turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. PUYE TIMING raced in the three path on the first turn, followed the winner from
second, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. HONOR HOP was
bumped in the hindquarters just after the start, went three wide on the first turn, was coaxed along on the outside, passed the five-eighths under stronger
encouragement, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and never reached contention.
PONCHO SONG traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn, moved out near the furlong
marker and was no factor.

Footnotes
SENBEI hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand from the two path until tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, drew off
under a drive to prevail. GIMMEDAMONEY hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. JUGGLER hustled from the start, chased four then three wide
under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. COZZY'S ATTITUDE four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. DISENGAGE coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four to five wide for home
and weakened. LIL STEVIE three to four paths off the inside early on, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the half mile
pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. HOT ROD RUMBLE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from three
furlongs out, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
FREE ENTERPRISE settled on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid while floating five wide into the stretch then took the lead, fought
with two foes past the eighth-pole and held off a cavalcade of challengers to prevail under vigorous handling. LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE bumped with a rival at
the start, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, gained into
the final sixteenth and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. HANDY stalked the pace on the outside,. was asked in the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch under the crop, fought on gamely to the wire and just missed while narrowly able to get the show. MALTHAEL was reserved
off the pace, came under urging while three wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside
lead inside the sixteenth-pole and just missed the trifecta. GLORY ROAD settled towards the rear, saved ground early on the turn, angled four wide outside
the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper stretch, gained into the final furlong, moved in near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly but missed the
superfecta. FORTUITY was coaxed along off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under stronger encouragement, raced inside early on the turn then moved
to the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved in outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. FAST BREAK showed good speed,
set the pace with some company to his outside, vied along the rail while asked on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. RESPECT
FOR ALL broke in and bumped with a foe, settled at the rear of the field, went four then five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and showed
little.

MORE MOONSHINE coaxed two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the turn advancing through the latter portion
of the bend, swung five wide into upper stretch quickly moving into contention, struck the front with three-sixteenths to run, drew clear under a drive and was
geared down from outside the sixteenth marker to the finish. PERFECT GRACE just off the pace four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the front
through the turn taking command spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat drifting out straightened away and was collared at the
three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. BIG CITY MOMMA coaxed along chasing two to three wide,
went four wide through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. RHOMBIQUE chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, angled five wide for home and passed tired rivals showing belated interest to the finish.
SUPER QUICK prompted the pace of EQUAL PAY from the outside three then two wide coming under urging at the three-eighths, took over command with
five-sixteenths to go, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch before tipping to the two path straightened away and
tired. VENUS OYZO coaxed from the start, chased just off the pace two to three wide, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. MEZCAL hustled from
the gate, chased just off the inside coaxed along from the get go, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. EQUAL PAY ranged up shortly
after the start to show the way coaxed along in the two path under pressure from SUPER QUICK to the outside, tucked inside through the turn, succumbed
to the pressure with five-sixteenths to go yielding command readily, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

AWESOME DEBATE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, took over outside the
quarter-pole, shook clear outside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. BETSY BLUE settled off the pace, was asked while two then three wide
on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished willingly for the place. MY ROXY GIRL showed speed on the inside
of two foes then dropped just off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while
able to get the show. AWILLAWAY settled at the rear of the field, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide at the three-eighths, chased six
wide into the stretch and came up empty. TIMELY TRADITION set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the
lead outside the quarter-pole and gave way. WAILIN JOSIE moved out while urged along off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, turned five wide into
the stretch under a drive and tired. PLEASURE LUCK settled on the inside, took a bad step and injured her right foreleg just inside the three-eighths then
was eased back out of the race before finally being brought to a stop in upper stretch and subsequently vanned off.

home, dug in gamely to rebuff a challenge to the finish. FARSIGHTED chased three to four wide down coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, dug in rallying up the inside latching on the leader inside the eighth pole but was ultimately repelled to the finish.

when put to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. SHINING COLORS chased the pace on the outside
then in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. SHIRLEY GREENE was urged
along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. WILDWOOD FLASH was ridden along off the pace,.
dropped back with a half-mile to run, went two then three wide on the turn and came up empty. DEAREST KITTEN broke a step slow, was ridden along off
the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. MIA CALIA was ridden along well back in the field, moved from the two path to the four path on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and was no factor. DAM THE DEFICIT was ridden along at the rear, went three to four wide on the
turn and showed little. EMPLOYEES ONLY chased the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn and retreated.
