LOVEDISC was unhurried early, rallied four wide around the final turn, closed outside through the lane and was along in time. PRATT had position inside,
was caught in tight into the far turn, came out between horses for the drive, opened a short lead from between horses just after a mile but couldn't last.
SACHMO dueled inside, moved clear into the far turn then faltered in the drive. TIDDLY WINK was never far back, rallied three wide into the far turn,
opened a short lead nearing the final furlong then gave way. MISTER ARANGUIZ was no factor. ARTISTA ran out while making the pace two wide into the
first turn, remained prominent into the far turn then stopped. ZILLION broke slowly and faded steadily.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S PEEBLES settled, rallied the rail into the stretch, quickly opened a clear lead leaving the furlong grounds, remained clear into deep stretch and
lasted. LIFE ON THE EDGE was slow to settle, rallied between rivals into the final furlong then closed a gap through the final yards. JUSTIN TIME showed
speed two wide, moved to a clear lead early on the backstretch, angled to the inside, remained in control into the final furlong then gave way. GIZMO'S
PRINCESS raced inside the early leader onto the backstretch, came out two wide entering the far turn then weakened in the lane. NEARLY MISSED settled
early, made a strong four wide run into the far turn, flattened out and finished in a dead heat for fifth. TIZ PROMISING RVF advanced outside on the
backstretch, raced two wide around the final turn, continued evenly through the lane and finished even for fifth. HAYEZHEE stayed close to the front for
about five furlongs, stopped and was eased up.

second best. COTTON CANDY CUTIE raced four wide between rivals with the pace into the stretch then weakened. MARIE FROM PARIE showed speed
between rivals, moved three wide to a short lead midway on the turn then tired in the lane. GRACE AND PEACE showed speed from the outset, was caught
five wide around the turn and drifted while tiring. FAIRY DUST dueled two wide between rivals to the stretch then stopped. AGORA broke in the air then was
outrun three wide. VAUNT made the early pace along the rail then stopped.

MOON MEISTER made the early pace two wide, was displaced early on the backstretch, regained command midway on the final turn, widened into the final
furlong and held under urging. WELL BORN was unhurried inside, swung out entering the stretch and closed willingly. BIFF settled in the two path and
lacked a rally. KINZEA STONE broke slowly, was sent up the rail to duel inside the winner then stopped in the lane. WELL IN TUNE was no factor.
YONDERING was bumped soundly leaving the gate then was outrun. YADI ducked into YONDERING leaving the gate, was caught wide around the first
turn then stopped.

Footnotes
GLOWING STAR was slow early, rallied three wide around the final turn and ran clear late. MOVIE SCORE saved ground while chasing, moved to a short
lead from between rivals in midstretch but was little match late. LADY COMMISSIONER lagged inside the winner early, swung wide into the stretch and
passed tired ones. INSPIRED GEM opened a clear lead into the first turn, stayed close to the inside while making the way into midstretch then weakened.
ELITE SPEED made a two wide run around the final turn then flattened out. ADHWAA tired inside. PARANOIA was close up on the outside to the far turn
then stopped.
