SMART PLAY sat just off the pace from the four path, asked to quicken leaving the final turn, moved up alongside DANCING WILLIE to contest the lead and
narrowly prevailed after a long drive. DANCING WILLIE set the pace early while pressured by SMART PLAY, was under encouragement at the quarter pole
in response to a looming threat, kept on under steady urging and was denied after a game effort. LANNY MAC settled inside, shifted out in stretch and
kicked last for show. WYE CROSS sat off the early pacesetters, rallied through the stretch and was edged out. MAKE GOOD CHOICES sat at the back of
the pack early, rallied four wide into the stretch and was outkicked.

by late for place. JAZZY GIRL pressured the pace from the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual winner into the stretch and flattened. PAYDAY
PAYNTER slow to start, chased into the lane and passed tiring rival. SAYGE'S SPIRIT broke alertly, raced wide leaving the chute, stalked the pacesetters
from the four path, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole but lacked a closing response. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL reserved off the early leaders and
tired. TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand timed due to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
MR. KALYPSO tracked two to three wide, drove five wide into the lane, bid outside while drifting in the stretch and got up. EZEKIEL was under a snug hold
leaving the chute, attended the pace from the rail, gained a narrow lead at the quarter pole, edged away from DENSE FOG but was run down late. DENSE
FOG contested the early pace from the three path, rallied into the lane then evened out late and just held show. WHERE'S THE GOLD allowed to settle
early, shifted out in the drive lodging a late bid and missed. RUCK contended the pace from between rivals, was unable to move on with rivals after the
three sixteenth marker and weakened along the rail. BOOKIE lagged early and offered a late mild bid. WEEKEND WIZARD stalked the pacesetters outside
and yielded into the lane.

Footnotes
DREADNAUGHT roused near the quarter pole then swung out into the lane, rallied determinedly outside and got up. WALKTHELINE pressed the pace from
the two path, overtook the lead at the five sixteenth pole, was under steady pressure through the stretch and was rundown. EDDYSHAK rated off the pace,
raced four wide, lodged a bid with a furlong and a half remaining, angled in and was outkicked for place. ERLICH trailed outside, rallied belatedly and
improved late. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE saved ground early, launched a rail bid and weakened in the late stages. COMMON KNOWLEDGE tracked
outside, fanned three wide through the turn, drove four wide at the quarter pole and lacked the kick needed. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER raced wide
through the backstretch and lacked a response when called upon. TRIPLE POWER sat in range of the early pacesetters while three wide and faded.
STRIDERS RING vied for the early lead, was unable to move on with rival with two furlongs remaining and stopped.

CHATTY GAL saved ground while setting the pace under snug, disposed of outside threat into the final turn, drew clear into the stretch and held under a
late drive by GLINDA GOOD WITCH. GLINDA GOOD WITCH saved along rail, waited in traffic into the final turn, was gaining on the leader through the
stretch and missed out after a gamely effort. LADY BENGEL raced five wide, bid evenly through the stretch and was along late for show. TALA tracked
inside, lodged a rail bid and flattened out. DAME DEVIL sat just off the pacesetter outside, was unable to move on nearing the quarter pole and weakened
between rivals. BAINE THE BULL raced five to six wide leaving the backstretch, carried wide into the final turn and was unable to improve through the drive.
LIL OL FLATTER broke awkwardly and lacked a serious bid. SALTY O'DAY broke outward, sat in striking distance of the pacesetters, raced three wide into
the far turn and wilted. STEAL A KISS lacked clear path leaving and trailed.
