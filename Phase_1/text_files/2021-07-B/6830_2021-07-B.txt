Footnotes
FILLMORE EAST well placed near the inner rail on the turn, eased out for the drive, angled out inside the eighth pole and took the lead late. SQUARE
PENNY drifted in mid way down the backstretch, set the pace near the rail on the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and drifted out near the sixteenth pole.
LOOKS DON'T LIE lacked speed, raced three wide leaving the turn and offered a slight rally. MISSAWLET , three deep chasing the pace around the turn,
gave way. VERYAN , steadied on the heels of SQUARE PENNY mid way down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail on the turn and failed to rally.
INDEHERE , four deep on the turn, was not a factor. PEACHY BETWEEN US , steadied on the heels of FILLMORE EAST leaving the backstretch,
weakened. KYOSHA broke slowly and was outrun. ASK NICELY was outrun.

Footnotes
BUFF MY BOOTS , quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, was shaken up soon into the lane, eagerly widened under solid hand urging past
mid stretch then cruised home the final yards. STILL DOING TIME bobbled inward at the break, corrected and stalked the winner two wide, was under
pressure chasing into the lane, shifted in towards the rail, faded but was clearly best of the rest. TANKA TOUGH , bore out the break, lost ground four wide
advancing into the lane, chased off the rail and came up empty through the drive. HIT A HOMER HONEY hopped at the break, dropped well off the early
pace while saving ground, angled out for the drive and had belated action. INSANE SISTER failed to menace. NO MORE MASK broke slowly, was hustled
up three wide soon after and gave chase, angled in around the turn, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and faltered through the drive.

Footnotes
ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) broke a step slow, recovered and rushed up inside rivals to take command, handled outside pressure nearing the turn, moved
away under coaxing past the five sixteenths, was guided two to three wide into the lane, widened under strong handling past the eighth pole then held sway.
SMART STEP steadied when in close at the break, raced well back into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, advanced inside rivals past the furlong
grounds and closed steadily. TALENTED DR. B prompted pace between foes, dropped back off the winner leaving the three eighths, was under a hearty
ride pursuing into the stretch, failed to gain in the final furlong but continued to give effort to the wire. MYSTIC TIMES settled off the rail, circled four wide
advancing into the stretch, chased past mid stretch then flattened out. PROUD ENOUGH saved some ground early on, eased out three wide into the lane
but lacked a rally. BIG HAMBONE tracked the winner while three wide, failed to kick on under pressure in mid stretch then gave way. VICTORY GIVEN ,
four to five wide, failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
FOREVER DREAMING set a leisurely pace along the inner rail, held a clear advantage in mid stretch and held sway under pressure. POUNDING MUSIC ,
steadied and rank behind the winner on the first turn, saved ground around both turns, angled out in upper stretch and rallied nicely. AMPLIO ESQUEMA ,
steadied in traffic approaching the first turn, saved ground on the turns, remained near the rail in the stretch and had a mild rally. EXCEPT TEMPTATION
lacked speed, worked between horses on the far turn, angled outside in upper stretch and had a mild rally. GHOST MAIDEN , four wide both turns, failed to
be a factor. MAP THE MOMENT , outrun, raced four to five wide on the far turn and was not a factor. POLISH COOKIE chased the winner to the stretch and
gave way. JUNGLE FLOWER , checked between horses on the first turn, was not a factor. EXPECT THE SUNRISE , four wide the first turn, raced
forwardly down the backstretch, was in the three path between rivals on the far turn and tired in the stretch. BELLA COOLA was outrun.

Footnotes
MS HEADLEY pulled her way forward and attended the pace, tracked patiently mid turn, eased out for the drive, bid between foes past the three sixteenths,
took over with a furlong remaining and steadily pulled away while kept to task. MAVILUS eased out early and stalked the pace about two wide, shifted out
four to five wide past the three sixteenths and finished up willingly to gain the place. SHACKABOOM went clear without much asking, dropped in and set the
pace, was taken on past the three sixteenths, held willingly past the sixteenth pole then faded. CLAIRE'S DARLING , ridden along three wide chasing the
pace, ranged up leaving the three sixteenths but failed to follow through. SOLEA drifted out at the break and then bobbled after brushing a rival, recovered
to be well back, angled out in the drive and had belated action. UTTERLY ENCHANTING , brushed at the start, saved ground off the early pace, made a
mild rail run past the furlong grounds then flattened out. SUZZETTE STAR , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and lacked a bid. SUBLIMITY lost
ground four to five wide and retreated through the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
BECKON assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously. MOSALAH , a forward factor
outside the winner, chased that one through the stretch and flattened out. PERFUME RIVER , rated in the two path down the backstretch and on the far
turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch and had a mild rally. OIL ON CANVAS , never far back while slightly off the inner rail, failed to rally.
MAGICAL MESA hopped at the break, remained along the inner rail most of the trip and was outrun. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL , three wide the first turn,
chased the pace to the far turn and tired. PRINECESS DOIR , three wide both turns, was not a factor.
