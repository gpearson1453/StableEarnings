MARK MY WORD was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch, could not gain on the winner in the drive
but finished well to gain the place. STANLEY RYDER showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. HAYNESFIELD HIT
sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going a half. KING CHARLIE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and lacked the needed rally. SHANGHAI CURLY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

EMERALD SEA was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the half and was ridden out to be kept to
task. SHES GOT THE POWER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to
be clearly second best. SHE'S MY RIDE chased the leaders from the inside and gave way in the drive. AMBERS STORM was forwardly placed early,
moved five-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. DANCE FIGHTER broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and
weakened after going five furlongs. TALKING EYES lagged throughout.

three-sixteenths pole but could not resist the winner from over the top. STARZAN was away in good order to press the pace of NEW EVERY MORNING
from the inside, stayed on well in the dive and finished willingly. NEW EVERY MORNING broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide,
opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way after going a half. KING OF WISHES lagged, raced five-wide through the turn and did
not reach contention.

Footnotes
MELCHIOR was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead with ALL ABOUT TIME while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and held
DREAMER'S REALITY safely to the wire. DREAMER'S REALITY was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and finished with a steady bid. ROCKET POWER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. MR BINGLEY
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. AZADI was void of early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ALL ABOUT TIME disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half.
SOVEREIGN NATION pressed the pace from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs. FAR WEST lagged early, moved four-wide through the
turn and did not offer a bid.

nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off. LINDA'S BALLET sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through

gain late. SECRETS OF MY SOUL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. LAKER JET settled off the leaders
from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. BEAU ROCKS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
weakened in the drive. CHOTEAU was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane.

not reach that rival in the drive but finished willingly. FORTUNE'S FREUDE lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with good energy.
LUCKY LONG LEGS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. RED NOON RISING was forwardly placed from the

Footnotes
SHADY RETREAT stalked the pace of WHYNOTGEORGIA while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards.
WHYNOTGEORGIA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and yielded to the winner late.
RATIONAL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. BETHEL RIDGE broke in, lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and did not threaten. CHEDOODLE MERY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. HELEN FIRE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually
weakened.
