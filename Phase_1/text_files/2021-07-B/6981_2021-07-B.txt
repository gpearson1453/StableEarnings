SUMMER LIGHTNING set the early pace while clear, then drew out leaving the turn and drew off to prove much the best while being ridden out. LOTS OF
GOLD broke inward at the start bumping a rival, then stalked the winner three wide and proved to be no match for that rival, second best. FURKA PASS
chased the early pace on the inside, swung off the rail and faded while besting the rest. DEAL ME A PENNY chased the pace four wide and had no rally.
LINDOLA'S GAL was bumped hard at the start, then advanced wide past the quarter pole, then passed the tiring rivals. MOREWICKEDTHANLESS chased
the pace on the inside and weakened. BETT THE LIMIT failed to menace. OVERSHARED was bumped at the start, then was not a threat. J M SKY
CLASSIC dropped back. ANNA CLAUSE was slammed hard at the start, not a factor. DELUSIONAL DREAM was sandwiched at the start, then had no
response. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

gamely to draw clear again, then held on gamely lead while drifting out. HOG WILD chased the winner and made a three wide bid past the quarter pole,
then was turned back leaving the turn, then angled in the furlong grounds and was gaining late on the inside. MY SUGAR TOWN was reserved early, came
five wide into the drive and rallied. ONE HITTER was settled back early, then was still saving ground past the quarter pole, awaited room while blocked by
the three sixteenths pole, belatedly inside once found room. FLY GUY RAK was allowed to settle while four wide on the backstretch but lacked a rally.
RANGE OF MOTION was allowed to settle between horses and had no rally. GROVER CAPOTE was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally.
