Footnotes
CHALLENGE PRINCESS settled in the middle of the field early, steadied slightly midway on the far turn, moved off the inside three then four approaching
the stretch, rallied to overtake MOLLIES HOPE from outside past the eighth-pole and drew clear. BLAME THE VETS saved ground close up from the start,
lacked room trying to get through inside MOLLIES HOPE turning for home, altered course off the rail in deep stretch, split horses pushing out TEA'S
DREAM and was up for the place. MOLLIES HOPE set the pace slightly off the rail, and weakened leaving the furlong grounds. TEA'S DREAM prompted
the pace outside to the stretch, lacked a solid closing response and was pushed out by BLAME THE VETS in the closing yards. CAPETOWN CANDY broke
slowly, was caught five wide into the first turn before angling inward at the back, came back out four wide approaching the stretch, and made no headway.
SHE'SANANIMAL raced three wide, and faded steadily after a half-mile. OVERTHEBLUESKY steadied in tight between horses approaching the first turn,
stayed in range for a half, then drifted very wide tiring past the quarter-pole. SHES A GIFT was slow into stride and four wide early, moved inside and
dropped far back after a half.

Footnotes
GIGANTIC stalked the pace two wide, could not gain in upper stretch, kept plugging away outside and was up and clear in deep stretch. BIG RED STYLE
set the pace along the rail, held clear past the sixteenth pole and yielded in the later yards. FUN LOADED raced off the pace four and five and was along for
the show in the final strides. MULSANNE RUN saved ground off the pace, moved into a clear third in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally and just missed
third. KHOCU chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the lane. SANDY DUDE played no factor while racing two wide. TEXAS PLAYBOY was off
a step slow and outrun outside. SUPER Q tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CALL BROS broke sharply and vied early inside WOLFHAND, drew clear midway on the far turn, shifted off the inside in upper stretch, and responded well
to keep EXPRESS PHAROAH at bay late. EXPRESS PHAROAH raced close up four wide on the turns, had aim outside CALL BROS through the lane but
could not get past. OUR STUIE was never far back, saved ground around the far turn, bid along the rail through the furlong grounds, but was outfinished. EL
SOLITARIO hugged the rail around the turns within range, and lacked the needed final response. SMALL REASON was outrun to the stretch inside, stayed
on the rail and improved position without threatening. MAJORITY RULES broke a step slow, raced four to five wide throughout and was no menace.
WOLFHAND held a short lead outside CALL BROS through the opening half-mile, gave way on the far turn, and was vanned off after the finish. SHINING
THROUGH was no threat two wide. SULEMAN brushed the right side of the gate coming out slowly, and was always outrun three to four wide.
COLTONSTHEADMIRAL broke poorly, and raced far back inside. FUTURE BOOK was forwardly placed three wide to the far turn, and came up empty.

Footnotes
MIZZEN settled off the three-ply duel, advanced four wide around the turn, took over in upper stretch, quickly cleared, angled in and widened under mild
urging. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED was rank at the start, disputed the pace three wide to upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner, continued to
duel outside of COMMISSIO for the place through the lane and narrowly prevailed. COMMISSIO dueled two wide between foes to upper stretch, could not
keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, battled on inside for the place and just missed that placing. SENA THE DUCHESS dueled inside to upper
stretch, gave way, angled out four wide and faded. CHECK TWICE stumbled at the start and trailed well off the rail.

COMPLEX SYSTEM grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, got clear up the backstretch, responded when set down into the lane and widened to the
finish. CALABASH pressed COMPLEX SYSTEM from outside early, dropped back through the middle stages despite being coaxed along, came three wide
into the stretch, and rallied between horses late for the place. DECKOLOGY bumped with EASY STRIDE at the start, raced in midpack to the stretch, and
was outfinished for the runner-up spot. HONORABLE raced close up inside to the stretch, and weakened under pressure. GUACO prompted the pace
outside, and faded through the drive. EASY STRIDE was bumped between horses at the start, and played no part three wide. FREEDOM'S FLIGHT saved
ground to no avail. POCO CHARLIE was never involved. KING OTTOKAR bumped with EASY STRIDE at the start, and was outrun. WISE TO LISTEN was
outrun inside.

INCLUDE THE BEAST vied early inside WORLD GONE WILD, deferred up the backstretch, went around with a rebid from outside midway on the turn, took
a narrow advantage into the stretch, got roused mildly past the furlong marker and gradually edged clear under confident handling. WORLD GONE WILD
briefly went head to head with INCLUDE THE BEAST after the start, cleared off and moved inside, responded when challenged from outside by the same
rival with five-sixteenths remaining, battled gamely on the rail through the lane and was clearly second best. LEYENDA was outsprinted early, shifted four
wide coming off the turn, drifted out through the stretch and went clear of the remainder. MANGROVE MAMMA had the three-path around the turn, and
could not reach contention. TAP TAP BIRDIE was no factor inside.

Footnotes
KURT'S A KEEPER settled off the fast pace along the inside, tipped out near the five-sixteenths pole, rallied three wide, seized command near the sixteenth
pole, quickly cleared and held safe. AL HILAL raced well back near the inside, angled four wide in upper stretch and finished well widest. HONESTO set a
fast pace inside, led to the sixteenth pole and held well to preserve the show. UNCLE JAMO stalked the pace two wide in the clear and weakened in the
lane. ASYMPTOMATIC (IRE) was wrangled back inside early, made progress inside around the far turn but tired in the final furlong. ON THE ENGINE failed
to menace while racing two and three wide. CLAUDE RAY was bumped after the start, raced three wide around the first turn, saved ground rounding the far
turn and made little impact. LAZARETTO was bumped soon after the start and was never in contention while racing four and three wide.

AMERICAN OF COURSE grabbed the early lead in the two-path, shook off some mild outside pressure from SHES ALL WOMAN and COREY turning for
home, and widened while drifting out under pressure. COREY pursued outside four then three wide to the stretch, could not menace the winner and went
clear for the place. SHES ALL WOMAN chased between horses for a half-mile, and weakened in the stretch while able to salvage the show. MISS ITALY
broke slowly and was outrun early inside, moved out approaching the stretch and passed only tired horses. BABY LION bumped with MISS MIKAELA a
stride from the gate, and was outrun. PLAYERA was never a factor. MISS MIKAELA bumped with BABY LION just after the start, saved ground and was
finished after a half.

Footnotes
DILIGENT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide early, rallied inside around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole, bid
between foes, took the lead in midstretch and drove clear. THENORTHREMEMBERS stalked the pace inside, advanced three wide around the far turn, took
over leaving the quarter pole, led to midstretch but could not match strides with the winner from there. MR. AXEL saved ground in midpack early, advanced
four wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but flattened out. NAVAJO CREED chased the pace two wide and lacked a
rally. VENERATE set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. MONY prompted the pace two wide and faltered nearing the lane. NOT SO EASY was
outrun inside. BAD BOY E. J. bumped with the winner at the start, saved ground and played no further factor. MACHO REAL slammed into the starting gate
and was away about three lengths behind the field, saved ground and was never in contention. VALID EXCHANGE played no factor while racing three wide.
