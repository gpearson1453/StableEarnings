Footnotes
QUIEN ES tracked the early pace, advanced three then two wide on the turn taking command at the quarter pole and quickly drawing clear heading into
upper stretch, held safe while shortening stride late. DOM STRAIT raced outside mid-division early, was encouraged along about the five-sixteenths, forced
to go five to six wide on the turn, lacked room in behind a foe at the furlong marker but tipped out a path after that to move between rivals and close the gap
while gaining fast and galloping out best. JIM EDD WHO chased the pacesetter early, moved up inside in the two path then on the rail on the turn, shifted
five deep in upper stretch and failed to rally. DIABOLICAL KING was well-positioned in behind the leading group, went two wide on the turn and kept on
evenly. NATIVE EVENT switched off the inside soon after the break, was kept six wide around the turn, gained in the stretch. BACK SEAT HERO was
encouraged forward to dictate terms setting the pace from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, drifted out in late stretch, came back to the paddock for
unsaddling post-race and was thereupon vanned off. TRUMP RIDE was encouraged along in the early going racing inside a rival but well of the fence, went
four wide on the turn and failed to rally. MEGA SOURCE saved ground on then just off the rail on the turn before moving out three to four deep turning for
home, ran evenly. DAJUDGE saved ground to no avail. GOLLY GEE broke awkwardly, went two wide into the turn moving out five deep on that bend then
further still to be eight deep at the eighth pole, was not a factor. REBACK HOME failed to threaten racing three to four wide on the turn. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
LUCKY MATT settled mid-pack off the leaders, saved ground just off the fence on the turn, bid inside the rivals past the furlong marker and powered clear in
the late stages. HE'S A HIT dueled inside a rival while racing off the fence, went in the three path on the turn, defeated that foe while drifting out a bit in the
lane but was no match for the winner and was geared down late having secured the place. YUUUGE PARTY dueled outside the aforementioned going four
wide on the turn, was on even terms at the furlong marker but had no extra while drifting out in the lane. SUN TREADER raced inside a rival well back in the
two path into the turn, soon moved out four wide on that bend, came out further to be eight deep in upper stretch and gained mildly. ALL STEAMED UP
bumped the inside rival at the start then was encouraged along, ran evenly and made no bid while going in the three path through the turn. SPURS N
LATIGO was outside SUN TREADER through most of the going having to travel four then five wide on the turn and floating out nine deep turning into upper
stretch, failed to rally. RED RHUMBA was bumped at the break, chased the leading group five then four wide on the turn and came up empty. J J'S CHAMP
chased inside, dropped back and faded. I AM A SOUL MAN trailed and was not a factor racing in about the four path on the turn.
