Footnotes
CARMON'S DANCE moved forward inside runners but off the fence to set the pace, was challenged by an inside foe leaving the backstretch, dueled till late
on the turn then regained command and edged clear into upper stretch, held under steady handling. INDIAN SECRET shifted in early, moved forward along
the inside to prompt the pace into the turn, had no extra but held the place. FEISTY HALO stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, gained slowly
but steadily in the stretch however missed the place. CONNIE'S LINDA broke out and steadied slightly at the start, went widest of all going six deep through
the turn, was gaining in the stretch. COOL AND QUICK raced off the leaders inside early, shifted three wide coming to the quarter pole, failed to rally.
TWENTYFOUR K CAT chased in the two path and failed to make a bid. ZONNA pressed the eventual winner from outside, went four wide on the turn,
dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
COWBOY TOBY broke a half-step slowly, was allowed to settle, advanced five wide on the turn, drew off under a drive. MEMORY TAKER was
forwardly-placed inside rivals but off the fence, went in the two path on the turn taking a brief lead leaving the turn, was no match but second best. E BAR
GOLD set the pace from outside, dueled on the turn four then three wide, lacked the needed late kick. EL CHUMELITO settled off the leaders, saved ground
on the turn, came out turning for home, improved position. WISKEY CROWN exchanged repeated light bumps past the half-mile marker, shifted in at the
three-eighths, saved ground on the turn but failed to rally. SKEETER WHO was mid-pack early racing outside, went six wide on the turn and failed to rally.
SAMURAI JACK lacked early speed, shifted in on the turn from five to three wide, was never a threat. THIRSTY JUNIOR exchanged repeated light bumps
while in tight between runners up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, tired. A CEE DOO CEE was urged but lacked speed, raced on or just off the
rail on the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BAND OF GLORY pressed the pace, took over a narrow lead on the turn going three wide on that bend, edged clear into upper stretch, held sway under
steady handling. SARA'S MEMORIES settled in behind the leaders off the fence, went four to five wide on the turn angling out seven deep into upper
stretch, got up for second under strong urging. HAPPYGOBUCKY came in just a hair at the break, raced just outside the leaders, was four wide between
runners leaving the turn, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch while in second but lost that placing at the wire. SHAME ON BEA steadied at the start, switched out
to be widest of all, was nearing striking distance five wide on the turn but flattened out. IM COMING OVER was urged along early, raced in behind the
leaders off the inside going three wide on the turn, failed to rally for the drive. FRIENDLY MISCHIEF set the early pace then was pressured while racing off
the fence, moved in from the two path to the rail on the turn, was overtaken late on that bend then gave way in the stretch. URGE was kept wide trailing
outside rivals, went six deep on the turn coming out eight wide for the drive and failed to rally. HENSLEYS RUN was encouraged forward inside heading up
the backstretch tracking the pace, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
SUNSCREEN attended the pace three wide and between runners, drifted out a path on the far turn, took a narrow lead in upper- to mid-stretch then
engaged the inside bid of WILMAS IRISH ROVER, dueled with that one in the late stages under urging and got the nod. WILMAS IRISH ROVER tracked in
behind the leaders under restraint racing off the fence in the two to three path, found room three deep between runners leaving the far turn, reached even
terms in late stretch but missed. BLUE BOY WHO attended from outside four wide in the early going, went four then five wide on the far turn on even terms
turning for home but proved no match for the top pair. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT broke out just a bit, vied inside, saved ground till late on the far turn drifting
out to about the three path coming out of that bend and weakened thereafter. FLAT FAST bobbled at the break then promptly shifted in and moved up
between runners to contend two wide, dropped back heading into the far turn continuing two deep and came up empty. TROOPER broke awkwardly, raced
last off the inside in the two to three path early, moved out from two wide to four wide on the far turn and wider still turning for home, failed to rally.
SEBASTIAN CAPE steadied slightly at the start, saved ground on both turns to no avail. BALLINOUTTACONTROL raced outside a rival well back entering
the first turn four wide and moving in three deep on that bend, continued among the trails into the far turn going two wide on that bend and was never a
threat.
