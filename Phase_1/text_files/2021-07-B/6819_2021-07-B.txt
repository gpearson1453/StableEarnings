Footnotes
DANCE SHOES attended the pace in the three path, hustled through the final turn, closed in the leader with every stride and was up just in time. NO
COLLUSION broke alertly then tracked just outside the leader, inherited the lead at the five sixteenth pole, raced gamely down the lane and was caught in
the final strides. LIL OL FLATTER reserved off the pacesetters and rallied through stretch to earn show honors. CROSS LADY sat in striking distance
outside, lodged an all out bid into the stretch but was unable to improve position. FINDERS KEEPERS led inside through the backstretch, was unable to
sustain the pace leaving the final turn and tired.

MOROCCAN WARRIOR away well then settled off the pacesetters from the three path, raced four wide leaving the backstretch, bid steadily through stretch
and was up late. TRANG stalked the pacesetters, chased the leader into the stretch and was outfinished. STAPLETON set a pressured pace inside, moved
clear of STOCKWATCHER entering the stretch, then was soon under attack with a furlong remaining and was edged out. STOCKWATCHER prompted the
leader while four to five wide, moved up alongside STAPLETON in the final turn to challenge the lead and came up empty for the drive. STEELFORCE
lodged a late mild bid. WILL TO GOLD outrun throughout. AWESOME ANTHONY was never involved.

Footnotes
TORIADOR emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, held command through the backstretch, was roused into the lane, turned back challenge from
DEPARTURE and held rival safe. DEPARTURE allowed to settle off the leader, moved up closer at the five eighths marker, went in pursuit of TORIADOR
with two furlongs remaining then moved up menacingly but was no match for the eventual winner in stretch. BODEMONSTER trailed the field in the early
stages, closed the gap nearing the final turn and rallied belatedly for show. JUMEIRAH COAST raced four wide through the opening turn, saved ground
through the backstretch, picked off rivals through the far turn and flattened out. HE'S CRIMSON CODE secured a rail position into the backstretch then
moved up quickly inside to apply pressure to the pace early, hustled into the lane then shifted out in close quarters and yielded. KING KLOVER lacked
running room into the opening turn, lodged a rail bid but was unable to threaten in drive. LIGHTENING ANNA shifted outside in the first turn, took closer
order just off the pacesetters and faded steadily with two furlongs remaining.

MR. KALYPSO saved ground while setting the pace, gained a short advantage in the far turn, responded to challenge from RUCK early stretch and held
well. RUCK sat just off the pace in the three path, moved up menacingly into the stretch but could not get by late. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed early,
advanced quickly leaving the final turn, circled rivals then closed gamely outside for show. WHERE'S THE GOLD tracked inside then bid evenly through
stretch and was edged out late. INTENT TO STRIKE settled in range outside and failed to threaten in drive. REY COLIMAN was gapped early, chased
leaving the backstretch and passed tiring rivals. MIDNIGHT SHAKE tracked the pacesetters and faded. BACKSTREET BOBBY fanned four wide into the
opening turn, chased outside and was done early.

Footnotes
SMARTY RIVER PANTS tracked along the rail, took advantage along the rail into the lane, rallied inside then moved clear and held safely under a late
drive. DREADNAUGHT saved ground early, waited briefly approaching the quarter pole, swung out into the lane, rallied outside into the stretch and was
gaining late the winner. EDDYSHAK sat just off the pace in the four path under a snug hold, fanned two wide leaving the backstretch and lacked the rally
needed in the stretch. IRISH TRICK raced mid pack while two to three wide, urged outside and finished evenly. BIG AL'S VISION lagged early and lodged a
late rail bid. HARD TO COME HOME raced five wide leaving the chute, fanned three wide into the far turn and had nothing left in reserve late.
STORMCHASER quickly went to the front, was overtaken at the five sixteenth pole then yielded and was eased. DUNE D'ORO raced wide through the
backstretch and tired. TANNIN tracked outside early and gave way.

Footnotes
RAIDER sat in striking position while three wide, drove four wide into the lane then pushed to the front and drew off to the wire under a drive. HIDDEN
GRACE prompted four to five wide through the backstretch, dueled outside of SHE'S DIVINE through the final turn but was no match for the winner through
the stretch. SANGRIA never far back in the backstretch, rallied four wide into the stretch then split foes and missed out for place. SARAHS ELEGANCE
reserved off the pacesetters outside, raced three to four wide leaving the backstretch, was driven three wide and then flattened out late. SHE'S DIVINE
contested the early pace, dueled inside of HIDDEN GRACE, was unable to move on with rival and gave way grudgingly along the rail. INTERESTING
TIMES allowed to settle outside, angled four wide into the far turn then gave chase and wilted. EXACTLY had a tack adjustment at the gate, was last away
and never reached contention. SMART FIX trailed the field and was outrun. FLORAL fractious in gate, flashed early speed and was finished with three
furlongs remaining.
