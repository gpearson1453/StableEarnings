THE WANT OF A NAIL was unhurried early, rallied four wide around the turn, took over from the outside before a half, drew out in midstretch and held
under urging. KICK KICK HUSTLE was content to lag early, swung wide into the stretch and gained to the end. WHERE YOU WAS made the early pace
along the inside into the stretch then weakened. FLASHINTHENIGHT had to be reloaded after being fractious in the gate, was steadied in tight near the half
mile pole and again entering the turn, angled to the rail on the bend, moved closer in early stretch then flattened out. ANY SUGAR HONEY dueled three
wide to the stretch, stopped and was eased up late. UNCLE ROAMIE was removed from the gate and reloaded, raced two wide between horses on the front
to the stretch, stopped and was eased up late. Off time was delayed 5 minutes.

PRINCESS BRIE stalked between rivals, moved two wide to a short lead early on the far turn and held after a long drive. PARANOIA moved to the front
entering the first turn, angled close to the inside, responded when challenged into the far turn and continued with good courage. DOC MEEKS was fractious
in the gate, advanced the four path around the final turn then tired in the lane. PERFECT HIDEAWAY had early position outside the winner, gave her best
three wide around the final turn then tired. TEACHER DRAMA was never close. LOOP THE LOOP pressed the early leader from along the rail and was

SIMPLE STORY tracked the leaders from along the rail, edged out on the turn, took over from the outside nearing the final furlong and held stubbornly.
RUSSIAN MELODY made the early pace inside and continued with good courage once displaced. WILL TAKE ROSES was slow early, raced wide around
the turn and finished willingly outside. WAVERLY SUNSET raced the two path and lacked a closing. LOOKIN FOR CANDY swung wide into the stretch
while trailing and failed to menace. ALEDA LUTZ had early position outside then tired in the lane. EMPRESS IRENE bobbled while breaking slowly, was
sent between rivals early, dueled two wide around the turn then stopped in the drive.
