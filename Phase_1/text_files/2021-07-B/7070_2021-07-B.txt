thought the better of it angling inside instead inside the final furlong, closed in to collar the front seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish
kept to task. MO FAITH coaxed from the gate. showed the way in hand along the inside under the watchful eye of SCUTTLEBUZZ but facing only light
pressure through that rival's presence to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive getting collared seventy yards from home while safe for the place honors. SCUTTLEBUZZ attended the leader from the outside in the two path coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. QUIET OUT EAST chased along the
inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and kept on for the last major share. STRAW INTO GOLD chased just off the
inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. HONOR UP broke in at the start, chased along the inside early on and then just off the inside getting
put to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SCOCCIATORE three wide through the first turn,
settled just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. CALL ME
HARRY three wide through the opening bend, chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the far turn under encouragement
from the five-sixteenths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. KAZ'S BEACH three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the

four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and was second best. PIER FORTY was hustled from the start, raced in the three path on the first
turn, prompted the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, floated six wide into upper stretch and tired but was clear for the show.
CORAGESCONTENDER bumped with a foe just after the start then was urged along early, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace
under some encouragement, was ridden along while two to three wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. NO SALT
was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn then spun seven wide into the stretch
and had nothing left. KID CHOCOLATE bumped with a rival just after the start, was urged along at the rear in the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
THE QUEENS JULES broke in a step at the start brushing KOWBOY KARMA, showed the way in hand three then two wide vying with a a trio early on
before shaking safely away to a safe lead albeit under close attendance from a pair through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside at the quarter
pole and floated three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. HIGH HEATER coaxed from the gate, vied from the four path with a pair
early on before tucking three wide through the turn prompting the leader from the outside in tandem with THE GREAT DANSKY who applied pressure from
the rail, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. THE GREAT DANSKY got bumped between foes at the start
when MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE came outwards under hustling and in turn bumped SKYLER'S SCRAMJET into KOWBOY KARMA, vied inside a trio before
prompting the pace along the inside through the turn, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and was along best of the rest for the show honors. KOWBOY
KARMA got brushed at the start by THE QUEENS JULES when that rival broke in a step, then got bumped by SKYLER'S SCRAMJET due to pressure
initiated by MR.SHORTANDSIMPLE, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, then tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET got bumped between foes at the start by THE
GREAT DANSKY due to pressure from MR.SHORTANDSIMPLE and in turn bumped KOWBOY KARMA all while under hustling, got coaxed along
advancing in the two path to range up tightly between foes to vie for command near the nine-sixteenths, floated three wide into the turn and faded from the
top trio drifting four wide through the that bend midway, swung five wide into upper stretch continuing under a prolonged drive and folded. MR.
SHORTANDSIMPLE came out at the start under hustling bumping THE GREAT DANSKY into SKYLER'S SCRAMJET and in turn KOWBOY KARMA,
chased three then two wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact.

to the two then three path late on that bend, rallied to make a bid in upper stretch, took over coming to the furlong marker and edged clear under steady
urging. MARC'S HUMOR moved out while chasing the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, made an outside
bid outside the furlong marker but was outfinished while clear for the place. CROCK OF GOLD stumbled at the start then was bumped soundly by the
winner, settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then was put to the crop
while moving a bit further out and improved position to just get the show. SECOND FORTUNE showed good speed on the outside of two foes, vied in the
two path while outside of a rival on the turn, shook clear under urging outside the quarter-pole, was collared coming to the furlong marker and weakened
then just lost the show. SHINJUKU brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn then was driven five wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. CROSSING VERAZANNO was void of speed, dropped well behind, went two then three wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. PRINCE OF JOY was bumped in the hindquarters after the start, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes then one rival from the
nine-sixteenths, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back approaching the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into upper stretch and tired.
BROTHER JEREMIAH bumped with DUTCHMEN FOREVER nearing the three-quarter pole then checked, settled well off the pace, dropped from the two
path to the inside on the turn and was no factor. DUTCHMEN FOREVER bumped with BROTHER JEREMIAH approaching the three-quarter-pole, raced
well back on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. SUGAR PLUM KING broke a step slow, dropped
well back in the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and never reached contention. RAVIZZOL brushed with a rival

BENBANG hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive holding well to the finish. THE CLUB lightly coaxed from the gate at the start, chased along the inside, tipped to the two path at
the three-eighths as the aforementioned foe went inside, spun three wide for home, kept on to the finish well clear of the rest to be along second best.
DAISY BEE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three to four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path through the turn, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch, improved position to be along for the show honors. BLEST LIFE hustled from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened. SOLID TUNE hustled from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and

Footnotes
MO GOTCHA went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked along the rail on the turn, responded well when put to a left-handed crop
in upper stretch, turned back the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and held under a hand ride late. CREATE AGAIN was rated just off the
pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, dropped to the rail briefly approaching the quarter-pole then was asked in the two path into the stretch, made a bid
outside the winner under a right-handed crop at the three-sixteenths but was turned away and outfinished while far clear for the place. NICK PAPAGIORGIO
settled at the rear of the field then came under urging, went two then three wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch then drifted further out and
lacked the needed response. ZEALOUS tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging around the nine-sixteenths, chased three wide on the turn and
tired.

REGAL RETORT hustled from the gate, chased four then three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn
coaxed along from the get go, angled out near the quarter pole and swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the leader inside the final furlong
taking command a sixteenth out when brushed by MOTIVATED SELLER, then dug in and held off the late closing FINDING FAME. FINDING FAME lunged
at the start getting away last and conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide from the tail of the field coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a threat in the final sixteenth showing good courage to miss
at the end. MOTIVATED SELLER established the front just after the start and showed the way through swift splits in hand just off the inside under pressure
from a pair to the outside, shook away to a safe advantage through the turn, floated five wide into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, dug in
under a drive coming outwards to brush with REGAL RETORT as that rival took over command a sixteenth out, then gout outfinished in the late stages
while clear of the rest in a good effort. ROYAL MEGHAN hustled from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five to
six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. KANSAS KIS broke a half a beat slow and was steadied off the heels of ANNA'S
FAST as that rival took over her lane conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five then four paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals to the finish. SECONDARY MARKET broke out at the start trading a bump with EMILIA'S MOON, who broke inwards, chased four then three wide
from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. EMILIA'S MOON broke in at the start
trading a bump with the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch and
weakened. STAND FOR THE FLAG raced three wide in pursuit coaxed along from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no impact.

Footnotes
FOOLISH GHOST pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead while floating five wide into the stretch then drifted
further out before being straightened by the rider, kicked clear inside the three-sixteenths then was roused at the furlong marker and proved much the best
under a moderate hand-ride to win ridden out. MY BOY TATE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into
the stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. OUR LAST BUCK was restless in the gate, raced off the pace under urging,
moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. MORNING
BREEZ was urged along on the outside, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC bumped with a
foe at the start, was urged along the rail early, moved out when crowded a touch outside the five-eighths, went three then four wide under urging on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. WOW BROWN bumped with a rival at the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two
path while inside of the winner on the turn, was headed under the crop into the stretch and gave way. JEMOGRAPHY drifted out some early, settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. WUDDA U THINK NOW was fractious in the gate then
backed out before being reluctant to load back in the gate, settled just off the pace, dropped back two to three wide on the turn and faltered then was eased
but walked off.

Footnotes
SUM KINDA PRETTY just off the inside through the first turn, raced three to four wide in pursuit, got let out spinning seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command near the eighth pole, inched away geared down to the finish to a jog. MALIBU ANTHEM marooned five wide through the first turn stacked
outside rivals, raced seven then six paths off the inside down the backstretch before going four then three wide through the far turn, angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WICKED HAPPY along the inside through the first turn, raced three then two wide in aim advancing to take over
command five furlongs from home, showed the way through the far turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, got collared nearing the eighth pole, weakened
in the late stages. BONKERS hustled from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing four then three wide down the backstretch, went
three then two wide through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. STRONG POINT three wide
through the first turn, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun six wide for home and tired. VISIBLY bobbled at the start, raced
four wide through the opening bend before chasing six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the far turn, went eight wide into
upper stretch and faltered. MISCHIEF REIGNS coaxed from the gate, showed the way three then two wide in hand, had WICKED HAPPY advance and was
overhauled five furlongs from home, retreated to the tail of the field and rode the rail through the far turn, swung five to six wide for home, got eased through
the stretch before being pulled up just short of the finish, never crossing the wire for the final check, then walked off under her own power.
