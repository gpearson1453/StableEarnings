OLDFASHIONED CLUB angled out on the first turn, took over when ready into the far turn, drew away, drifted out through the stretch but remained safe.
MY FRIEND LINUS settled well back inside, made a menacing bid on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. KIERLAND broke a step slowly,
raced wide, drifted wider in the stretch and was no threat. ITGOT GRANDMA prompted the leaders three wide and faded. BLUE DANUBE set a clear pace
along the inside, stopped abruptly on the final turn and lost contact with his field..

on the turn then came again inside in a game try. FROSTED ANGEL raced close up in the two path, steadied near the top of the stretch and closed well.

through the stretch while outrun. MINER'S GEM saved ground off the leaders and faltered. FRED'S SHEILA lacked speed and was never in contention. A

BEAUTIFUL TIZ settled in the two path, bid wide on the final turn then outdueled inside rival to the wire. MAHKATO tracked inside, steadied near the
quarter pole, split foes into the stretch but was outfinished. TALKS IN HER SLEEP lacked speed then closed a late gap with good energy. ROONEY well
placed behind the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn then faded. MALICEINTHEPALACE ducked out at the start, chased off the pace and was no threat.
OCEAN DELIGHT set the pace to the final turn and came up empty in the stretch. BETTER WITH AGE broke a bit slowly, raced well behind and lacked a
rally. KELCIE'S MANDATE dropped back early and was never a factor. PERSONAL SERVER saved ground within range early and gave way.
MARYLAND'S MIRACLE lacked speed outside and failed to respond. JOANIE'S SUNSET was fractious in the gate prior to the start then always outrun.
BROOKSLEY prompted the pace for half a mile then bore out retreating.

VEGAS LIFE reserved at the back of the pack, moved strongly wide on the turn, collared the leader into the stretch and edged away. THURMAN MERMAN
prompted the pace four wide, took over at the three eighths pole, led clearly then yielded late. FROST'S SONG hustled to the front inside, lost the
advantage into the turn but finished willingly and held on for the show.. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN forced the pace between rivals briefly then faded. LA LLUVIA
flashed speed three wide then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
GRANDMARY stalked the leader outside, led on the final turn, drifted out in the stretch, was straightened and drew clear. MYSTICAL CHARGE dropped far
behind then closed well through the stretch for place. MY LUCKY HEART broke slowly, moved up three wide then then weakened in the stretch. MCLUCY
prompted the pace, took over inside before the half, vied briefly on final turn then proved empty. CATIRUSIA dropped back early inside and was never a
factor. DESERT TONE drifted wide into the first turn, led briefly then stopped abruptly.
