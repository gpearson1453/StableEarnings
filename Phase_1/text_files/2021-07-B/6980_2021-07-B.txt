in the stretch and rallied up for second on the wire. GOLDEN VICTORY vied with winner two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn,
entered stretch dueling with winner and faltered inside the final sixteenth to lose second late. LUCA'S RIDE pressed pace three wide on the backstretch,
continued to press three wide early on the turn, started drifting out approaching the middle of the turn, entered stretch in the five path and kept on willingly.
DOHENY BEACH dropped back and settled off the pace along the rail, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to launch a bid. ANGEL OF THE
CITY came away with the field, rider lost stirrup early in the chute and just tried to hold on through the rest of the race along the rail. PLEASE NOT THE

DORITA'S LEMON away well, cleared rivals quickly along the inside, continued clear on the turn, entered stretch clear and held safely. BALLET ROYALTY
tracked leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in range of clear leader and kept on gaining in a non
threatening second best effort. DAIRY KID tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, stayed on well enough to best
rest of rivals. GO VAIDAGIRL tracked leader five deep early, four deep entering the turn, continued wide trip through the turn and into the stretch and lacked
needed bid to improve. SOPRESCIOUS tracked leader inside of four rivals on the backstretch, continued along the rail through the turn and into the stretch,
started to weaken in upper stretch and edged out of fourth at the wire. BADGER GAL tracked leader four deep of five on the backstretch, approaching the
quarter pole had to steady out of position and lost all chance.
