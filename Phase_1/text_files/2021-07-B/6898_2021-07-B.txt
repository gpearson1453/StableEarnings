Footnotes
JEAN V'S LEGACY rated back in the early going, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide through the second turn, bid on that path, shook clear,
then lasted under steady pressure. ZURI allowed to settle, gained position on the two path through the second turn, angled out to bid four wide into the lane,
made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. SEEKING VIOLET rated outside the pace setter, held position to the stretch, bid between rivals,
weakened and held the show. TURNING POINT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then
weakened late and held a share. SOK FURY was no factor.

JUST PLUNGE broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then
drew off under mild urging. STARE DECISIS rated back, tracked the early pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three wide outside the
leader, then could not threaten and closed well for the place. BOARDWALK BOB allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and closed well for the show. TRAIN IN VAIN well placed and outside, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned
widest into the lane, then could not gain and held a share. MIO D' EVEN passed tiring rivals. BO RHAPSODY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start,
stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final furlong. WHEELBARRELBROTHRS stalked the pace on the outside and
faded through the second turn. BETTER TAPIT was never involved.

Footnotes
ORAZIO mid pack, looped to position four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain, lugged in and drove clear.
PREQUALIFIED set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, came again in the lane to edged ahead, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. SCIENCE TO WIN well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into
the lane, evened out while edging up for the show. CHAOS KID vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead into the second turn,
shook clear through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. GRAN EDITION allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the
second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and had a mild gain. CAPTAIN D allowed to settle, moved up five wide through the turn, bid on that
path into the stretch and ran evenly. ERIC THE SALESMAN well placed and off the rail, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three
wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. JANGADA allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and
could not gain. ART OF THE DREAM was no factor. CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals and had no stretch rally.
