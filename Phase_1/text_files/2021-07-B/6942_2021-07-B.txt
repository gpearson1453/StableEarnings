Footnotes
BALTIMORE BUCKO (GB) established the front and showed the way in hand spurting away along the inside, jumped well to maintain his advantage while
jumping outwards at fence three, four and five, had the field take closer order at flight seven and remained patiently handled, jumped well at the final flight
and showed the way through the last turn coming under urging when spinning two to three paths off the dogs into upper stretch, dug in under a drive edged
away once more in the flat and held well to the finish. FRENCH LIGHT (FR) saved ground at the tail of the field early on, jumped well to maintain position,
tipped out two then three paths off the dogs through the third turn and remained so for fence seven and the final flight advancing outside rivals into
prominence into the final turn now in the flat, took to the inside through that bend before tipping three wide into upper stretch, ran on willingly to chase the
winner home clear for the place honors. GIBRALFARO (IRE) tracked the front just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, jumped well to maintain position
and came under urging after clearing the final hurdle, angled out five paths off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show
honors. REDICEAN (GB) saved ground near the rear of the field, jumped well to keep pace, came under urging after the final fence, spun two to three wide
into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from home in the flat, then flattened out in the late stages. GALWAY KID (IRE) forwardly placed along the
inside in closest aim of the spurting leader in tandem with CITE, jumped early at fence six, then jumped late at fence seven bobbling briefly on his hind legs
before settling back into stride, came under urging after the final fence once in the flat, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. CITE a bit
washy, tracked the pace along the inside in closest aim of the leader, jumped late at fence two, tailed off and began to retreat through the third turn, jumped
late at the final fence, grew detached from the main body of the field cornering just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
WICKED MAD came away in good order, dropped back off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the two path, swung four wide into the stretch,
rallied outside to take the lead under a left-handed crop into the final furlong then shook clear and widened while placed under a hand-ride in the final
sixteenth to prove much the best. RECIDIVIST bumped lightly with a foe while off a half-step slow, moved up under urging on the outside then chased the
pace, went three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop, battled under a drive
into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while narrowly able to get the place. RUDY ROD bumped lightly with an opponent at the start while
off a half-step slow, moved to the outside under urging, advanced closer with a half-mile to run, chased four wide on the turn, gained to make an outside bid
at the five-sixteenths, fought under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place but was well clear for the
show. POINT OF HUMOR bobbled at the start but recovered quickly then was hustled to the lead, showed the way in the two path, was asked for more
under heavy threat from two foes at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and tired. RICKYS REVENGE broke a step slow,
was ridden along at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
MOONSHININGBRIGHT was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while inside to the two path on the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
DANCING KIKI settled on the inside of a foe, went two then three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead while asked
for her best in upper stretch, was given a couple light pops of a right-handed crop while disposing of foes in the vicinity of the furlong marker and drew away
while placed under a hand ride from outside the sixteenth-pole to the wire. PENDOLINO disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner but clearly secured the place.
TENDERNESS was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of the runner-up, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was
asked for more outside the five-sixteenths, came under the crop into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired but held the show.
COURAGEOUS GIRL settled at the rear of the field, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and
failed to threaten. HAPPY SOPHIA was coaxed along on the outside in the second flight, went three to four wide under urging on the turn and capitulated.
STUNNING MUNNINGS settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and came up empty. RED VENUS was hustled from the start, settled under
some urging, raced four wide between foes into the turn, dropped to the three then two path shortly thereafter then fell back and faltered.

Footnotes
PIZZA BIANCA saved ground at the tail of the field, tipped two then three wide three furlongs from home given some rein to work with and commenced a bid
following EXPAND THE MAP three to four wide through the latter portion of the turn, got roused spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive to
issue a challenge through the final furlong the outermost of a quartet coming to the sixteenth marker together displaying a good kick, took over inside that
station and prevailed edging away at the end. EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, tipped out four wide at the
three-eighths and advanced outside rivals tucking three wide just inside the five-sixteenths forcing OFFICE ETIQUETTE to pause when off the heels of
HAIL TO, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home, got caught inside
that station while clear for the place honors. BALI BELLE broke in at the start under coaxing, tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening inside the final furlong, paused very briefly when in tight between
foes a sixteenth out, ran on willingly for the show honors. HOPE OVER FEAR established the front shortly after the start and showed the way along the
inside under a rating hold, slipped away three furlongs from home given some rein to work with, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, remained safely clear to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat from a trio getting collared a
sixteenth out, then backed away to the finish in the late stages. HAIL TO coaxed from the gate, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came
under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the inside straightened away and weakened. OFFICE ETIQUETTE
three wide through the first turn, chased three wide from just off the pace, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths, got paused and steadied off the
heels of HAIL TO as EXPAND THE MAP went by to her outside, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. FISHERS just off the inside in pursuit, tucked
inside put to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SOCIAL WHIRL broke very alertly and went straight to the front, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back along the rail with three furlongs to
run then moved to the two path, re-bid at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, battled outside of NEW YORK SUPREME into the final furlong then
drew clear under steady handling. STELLA MARS settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch and finished with good energy for the place but was no threat to the winner. NEW YORK SUPREME was hustled from the start, contested the pace
on the outside, moved to a solo lead while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner under
a drive in upper stretch, fought with that foe into the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. EXACT CHANGE bumped with a rival at the start
while off a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted three wide and improved position. LOVE'S MISERY settled
on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SASSY BELLE was last to commence,
angled in at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, swung eight wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and was no
factor. UNDETECTABLE was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up
empty. FASTELLE was asked leaving the gate then rated just off the pace, went three wide while let out on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
capitulated. ORMA bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed in the pocket just off the pace, raced off heels briefly early on the turn then was asked
while along the rail, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and tired. OB LA DI settled near the middle of the field, was
urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. PATH LESS TAKEN was hustled from the start then taken in hand and reserved off the pace,
navigated the turn in the two path while roused and also failed to respond.
