MONGOLIAN HERO tracked on the inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside, closed steadily outside of HARD
COUNT in the final sixteenth and wore down that rival for the win. HARD COUNT vied inside for the lead, shook free on the backside, showed the way into
the stretch, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. BIG PERM raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid
and was outkicked. FATIMA'S BLESSING raced three wide early, settled off the pace, tracked on the far turn, went three wide, then steadied to avoid the
spill at the quarter pole and lacked a bid after. ONE MORE NIGHTCAP raced two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired. AWESOME LAUNCH
raced off the pace inside, lacked a response when asked on the far turn, then steadied at the quarter pole to avoid fallen rivals. ROSE FOR A SAINT raced
two wide off the pace, hit a fallen rival and fell losing the rider, then walked off. SERVICE WITH HONOR vied two wide, then stalked, chased between rivals
in tight on the far turn, then stumbled badly and fell. After a Stewards' Inquiry the race was declared official.
