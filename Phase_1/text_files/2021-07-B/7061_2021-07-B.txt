the final stages. QUEEN OF CORONA tracked the pace early, took over command, was off the rail into the lane, clung to the lead while between horses
near the eighth pole but yielded soon after. BOOHOO SUE set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered down the lane from the rail.
CHECK SIX chased the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. HONOR BAR broke slowly from the gate and was
