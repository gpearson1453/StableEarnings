LAST PUNCH set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held well in a driving finish. FABULOUS FORUM lagged early, advanced
around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and was gaining late. SUNRISER broke slowly, was void of early speed, saved ground, bid
inside and closed well. J T'S LA NENA vied inside while racing in hand, fell back on the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. SMOOTH RITHMS
got away alertly, showed speed to the turn and gave way. Hand timed.

the start, raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well to get up for place. OFF THE BOOKS bumped at the start and had the rider lose his
iron briefly, offered an inside bid to get within range, hung late and settled for show. EXPRESS PERMISSION raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn,
offered a mild bid only and failed to menace. DEPUTY KNIGHT bumped and was squeezed at the start, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals.
MINDSHARE bumped at the start, sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead and faltered near the sixteenth pole. PAST LIFE raced inside, was through
early and steadily dropped back. Hand timed.

STONE CREEK vied two across to the turn, drew away for a clear lead, was tiring late and just lasted. THE KOHEN was never far off the pace, closed
steadily mid track, was wearing down STONE CREEK and was gaining late. SUNLAND STAR saved ground, bid inside to loom a threat, didn't have enough
late and earned show. MARQUE IT UP raced mid pack outside, put in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. CLEVER EMMA stalked the pace, angled
out on the turn, bid and came up empty late. ROCKY STALLIONE was fractious in the gate and failed to menace in an even effort. SUITE ALONSO was
hustled along to vie inside to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. FLAWLESS CLYDE broke in the air to be off slowly and trailed the field.

SUPAH SISTA stalked the pace, shifted out on the turn, bid willingly to duel and drew clear late. PARAWAN was steadied at the start, set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel for the lead, yielded late and held for second. MADISON'S QUARTERS was never far off the pace, lacked the needed
late response and was clearly best of the rest. NOT THAT I RECALL saved ground, lacked a rally and did not threaten. ARIES was never far back, bid and
came up empty. MISS SHAWHAN trailed the field. Hand timed.

Footnotes
FLOWER BEACH stalked the pace, closed steadily and wore down his rival to get up late. BOB'S ALL IN was never far off the pace, put in a steady effort
and got up at the wire for place. KING LEBRON set the pace past the sixteenth pole, was unable to sustain his bid, lost position late and finished best of the
rest. MO GEE showed speed to the turn, leveled off and faded through the stretch. I BUY GOLD saved ground, lacked a bid and was outrun. OUTLAW BY
NATURE was not a factor. COLONEL GOTHAM had brief speed only. BLOWIN SMOKE showed little. Hand timed.
