Footnotes
ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN settled back off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, circled rivals in
the seven path of the far turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to take the nod under the wire. MISTER DEEKS raced off the pace in the
three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then angled to the five path approaching the head of the
lane, dueled to a slim lead mid-stretch but was nipped just under the wire. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS saved early ground then picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, lacked room in the four path of the far turn, angled to the rail at the head of the lane then dueled for third the final sixteenth.
HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND stalked three wide into the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, was carried outward and bumped at the
top of the stretch, then flattened stride in the duel for third. ROCK FILE raced in the four path the first turn, bid toward the three eighths pole and ran in the
three path of the far turn, eased to the six path approaching the top of the stretch then flattened the final eighth. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE moved to the
inside and rated a short lead into the first turn, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, drifted approaching the top of the stretch then
weakened inside the eighth pole. BRAYDEN'SWARRIOR stalked two deep into the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and
contested the turn at a close disadvantage while between horses, was carried out and into Huckleberry Friend into the lane and weakened.

AWESOME BUZZ angled in to stalk off the rail, challenged at the three eighths pole and took the lead at the five sixteenths, raced clear into the far turn and
was steadily encouraged to hold on. HOBE SOUND rated off the early pace inside, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but raced hemmed in
near the rail on the far turn, recovered stride entering the stretch and was gaining steadily on the winner. SOUND OFF raced well back from early contention
and saved ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn and finished strong while gaining on the top two. AUTS
REVOLUTION was hustled clear and set the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod leaving the five
sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn then weakened. MARYLANDER raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch,
bid past the three eighths pole, ran near the rail most of the far turn then angled to the five path toward the head of the stretch and showed little more. TO
THE FRONT rounded the first turn off the rail and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, had range on the

Footnotes
CREEKMORE took the lead soon after the start then angled in to rate the pace two deep, drew clear of News Flash and moved to the rail at the seven
sixteenths pole, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. TITAN'S
WILL settled back in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in to take second later
yards. NEWS FLASH stalked inside, dropped back at the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, raced at the rail on the far turn then
flattened stride inside the eighth pole. TRUE CROSSING settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. GOLDEN ANSWER raced inside the first turn then settled close in the three path entering
the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO
hesitated then hit the gate on exit, rounded the first turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase toward the three eighths pole
but showed little response from that point. FUGITIVE saved early ground and never factored. AUBURN MILL rated close in the three path the first turn then
faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
RIGHTEOUS MAN settled close inside and raced in tandem with GREY INVASION through the second turn, came inside that one at the seven sixteenths
pole and took the lead toward the three eighths, kept the edge while reined in from that point, drew clear toward the head of the lane and increased his
margin to the wire, while the latter, rated a slim lead inside, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, dueled at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn, but drifted into the stretch and had to settle for second best. HAPPY CHAMP settled off the pace and off the rail
early, eased four wide on the second turn and raced close into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, though, faded past the five sixteenths.
RAVIN' MAVEN settled back in the three path early then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the
three path of the far turn. ORIENTATED stalked the earlier pace two deep, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but gave way leaving the three
eighths. WISH IN THE CASTLE settled back in the four path the first turn, raced outside into the backstrech and showed little response.
STROLLANOTHERTIME rated close in the four path the first turn, continued in the four path on the second turn but was through after a half mile.
