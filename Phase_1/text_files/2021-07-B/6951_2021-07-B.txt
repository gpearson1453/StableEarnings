Footnotes
HARLANS WARRIOR broke on top, set the pace inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, shrugged off a rival midway on the final turn, drew out steadily
through the lane under a right handed crop. CRIMSON FELINE bobbled slightly then brushed with KAYDEES IN TOWN, recovered to be forwardly placed
while saving ground, moved off the rail into the far turn, advanced on the winner and lodged a brief bid late in the final turn, proved no match in the drive,
clearly second best. AMELIA MADELYN off a step slow, raced back off the inside, staged a mild rally three wide, edged clear for the show while widest in
the stretch, no threat to the top two. HERO OF GOLD went evenly paced throughout in lacking a serious kick. FIANNA HILLS settled off the pace, also
failed to respond when called on for the drive. HANDSOME GIRL pressed the winner for five furlongs, gave way in the far turn. KAYDEES IN TOWN was
always outrun. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ECLECTIC SOUL broke alertly, dueled up front while in the two path, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, edged away under pressure. MY
GIRL SWEET also away in good order, dueled inside the winner, fell back off that rival entering the stretch, shifted out when that one cleared, proved no
match in the run to the wire, far clear of the others. I GOT WINGS settled well off the early pace, came three wide into the lane, along for the show, no threat
to the top pair. STORMY COLLISION chased the dueling top two for six furlongs and then had little left for the drive. FIRST LADY OF SONG last away,
lacked speed and was never a factor. WITCHY DEVIL pulled early when with the second flight, was finished after a half. OPENING QUARTER MILE

Footnotes
MISS KENNEDY settled in the second flight off the inside, ranged up to challenge exiting the final turn, took over when straightened for home, lugged in a
bit past the furlong marker, was straightened with a left handed crop and steadily drew out. FUHR MEO showed the way into and through the first turn,
dueled the middle half while remaining closest to the inside, narrowly showed the way late second turn, offered brief resistance to the winner into the lane
then could not keep up, well clear for the place. AKIANE'S SOLDIER chased the runner up early off the inside, dueled in the two path up the backstretch
and into the far turn, weakened, comfortably saved the show. BAD GAL RIRI void of speed in trailing for five furlongs, never a factor. TRAPPE THE CAT
forwardly placed in the early going, stopped, jogged in far back. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
JAYS RIVERWRANGLER broke on top, cleared to the inside in showing the way up the backstretch, remained clear early in the turn, turned back a bid
exiting the bend, lugged in past the furlong marker when clear, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. IDE LIKE HAWAII settled
off the pace and the inside, steered out widest for the drive, late bid for the second spot, wore down that rival in the final strides. LOOKIN FOR LARRY
chased the winner early, tried the winner from the outside turning for home, could not keep up in the drive, weakened, caught late for the second spot.
GENES FEATHER trailed for three furlongs in lacking speed, displayed a mild, belated amount of interest to improve position. IMPRESSIVE GREELY last
away, moved up to race in the second flight, tired in the drive. RENE'S PRINCE was never involved.

Footnotes
GUITARZAN pressed the leader off the inside, came three wide when contesting the issue into the lane, put a head in front upper stretch, long, headed
drive to the wire, held multiple rivals safe late in a game performance. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN settled off the pace and the inside, came widest for the drive
when advancing, late bid, outkicked in the final strides. LOUISIANA MOON void of speed, slipped through inside of a pair of rivals turning for home to
contend, equal terms with the winner a sixteenth out, also was outfinished by that one in the waning strides. CAJUN CASH narrowly showed the way after
breaking on top through the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch and through the final turn, two path turning for home allowing LOUISIANA
MOON the inside, vied between that rival and the winner to the wire, in some traffic late in lacking a closing punch. FRANK THE MAYOR within striking
distance while racing outside, came up empty for the stretch run. INCA WARRIOR broke out and slowly, trailed throughout. OPENING QUARTER MILE
FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
EZEE ENOUGH broke back, moved closer in the two path through the turn, challenged between rivals nearing the furlong grounds, edged clear under
steady handling. RAISING THE ROOF in the second flight while off the inside, asked along into the stretch, challenged briefly outside the winner, could not
match strides with that one to the wire, edged clear for the place. LIL' SISTER LOU in mid pack early outside, came four wide when moving closer exiting
the turn, lacked a winning closing kick, finished up clear of the others. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER broke alertly, soon cleared, set the pace along the inside,
faltered the final furlong when headed by the winner. CLOCKED IN TYME failed to menace. QUEEN GIGI last away, trailed most of the way to be always
outrun. LAGNIAPPE within striking distance early off the inside, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
TOURRISTA broke with the leaders, settled behind the first flight just off the inside, stalked into the far turn, closer in the two path turning for home,
challenged outside the leader past midstretch, drew clear under pressure. RACY JAYCEE prompted the pace while three wide, took over from the outside
midway on the final turn, showed the way into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner with a furlong to run then proved no match. KAPPA HILL
lacked early foot, improved through some traffic into the lane, up late for the show while not a threat to the top two. SUM NATION lacked early foot off the
inside, improved three wide into the contention far turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive to flatten out. MISS MIRACLE GIRL ducked out at the start
to bother KENYA STRIKE, settled in mid pack and went one paced throughout to make no further impact. KENYA STRIKE off slow, bothered, lagged far
back, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position slightly. DEBS PRAYER pressed the issue for five furlongs and began to give way.
CHARLIE ROADS broke on top, set a moderate early back, stopped far turn. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WILLY MC with the pace three wide, continued to vie through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, headed with a furlong remaining, battled
back in the run to the wire to prevail in game fashion. COOL POWER in mid pack early, moved closer while four wide through the turn, challenged and put a
head in front with a furlong to run, outfinished in the late going to miss. ADIEU LE CHAT behind the pace toward the inside, in traffic when creeping closer
late in the bend in the two path, steered out to be wide for the drive, mild close late while not enough to seriously contend at the wire. F J'S GEM void of
speed, moved to the inside for the run through the turn, improved position while not a threat to the top three at the wire. PARALISSFRMANALYSS back off
the pace well wide, five path through most of the turn, picked off some tiring rivals while also not posing a serious threat. MR. SNOWFLAKE bobbled and
broke inward, quickly recovered, vied up front while between rivals, weakened in the drive. VANORO off slowly, remained always back. HERMS CROWN
has speed along the inside for a half, stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
WILD FIREMAKER closest to the early leader along the inside, advanced and took over just before a half while continuing inside, clear into the lane, held
the runner up comfortably safe to the wire under a steady left handed crop. SOBEK off a step slow, lacked speed, advanced through some traffic into
contention entering the stretch, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that rival to the wire, clearly second best. DAVES FRIEND
DEWEY forwardly placed while racing outside throughout, lacked a closing kick. LES PAUL void of speed in the back, improved position without posing a
serious threat. DATSWHATILIKE in mid pack while saving ground, failed to menace. SIR ETNEY JOHN broke alertly, clear in the first turn while appearing
to try and get out while slow to settle, relinquished the lead and the inside to the winner before four furlongs, gave way and then stopped in the drive. D W
STRONG underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke in the air to be off slowly, trailed throughout to be always outrun. OPENING QUARTER MILE
FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
