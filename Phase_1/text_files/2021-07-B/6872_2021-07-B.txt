Footnotes
C MY MEISTER was a step slow at the start but recovered to a forward position, went along three wide around the turns, reached the front outside foes in
upper stretch, shied out greenly from right-hand pressure to near the outside fence while clear past the furlong marker, then wandered back in crossing the
finish line with his head cocked to the infield. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH bumped with BAD GUS at the start and was slow into stride, raced three wide to the
stretch, and rallied mildly to go clear for the place. GLOBES saved ground in the second flight to the stretch, was stymied on the fence coming to the
eighth-pole as CLASSIC FILM came over in front of him, split horses late and finished with interest. PALIMONIUM bumped with BAD GUS and steadied at
the start, lagged near the back for a half-mile, raced two wide around the far turn, moved out in the stretch and improved without threatening. BACKATYA
tugged his way forward to press CANAAN up the backstretch, challenged for command leaving the far turn, then weakened between horses after
straightening away for the drive. CANAAN vied up front to upper stretch, and gave way under pressure. CLASSIC FILM led early inside, readily gave up
position under a snug hold leaving the first turn, remained in reserve behind the first flight around the far turn, tipped to the two-path at the top of the stretch,
shifted back in cutting off GLOBES while in traffic through the furlong grounds, and was never set down. BAD GUS was bumped between horses and
steadied at the start, and trailed near the inside.

Footnotes
COZY CAFE settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, drifted
further out turning for home, raced in the six path through the lane and held clear under a drive. TOOLEGITTOQUIT was bumped at the start, advanced four
wide around the turn to move into a clear second nearing the lane, angled seven wide in upper stretch and was unable to further gain on the winner while
getting well clear of the rest. ASPROPODIA lacked early speed while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. J D'S VISTA
hesitated at the start, raced well back two wide, swung five wide nearing the quarter pole, bid outside in upper stretch then flattened out through the final
furlong. FASTLIFE chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS bumped with TOOLEGITTOQUIT at the start,
advanced two wide to the lead down the backstretch, cleared and angled in entering the turn, led to the five-sixteenths marker and retreated. ILLUSIONS
OF LOVE stalked the pace two wide and was through after a half. BORDEAUX LEGACY had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
BRASSTOWN pressed ROYAL SQUEEZE from outside, challenged for command after six furlongs, battled between rivals through a long drive and
prevailed. BLESSED JOURNEY advanced under a drive four wide on the turn, loomed outside BRASSTOWN through the lane, and could not get by under
stern pressure. ROYAL SQUEEZE vied with BRASSTOWN early, edged away through the middle stages, got hooked past the quarter-pole, and yielded
grudgingly inside the top two. CAUSALISTIC veered in at the break shutting off TONY SMALL and bumping IL FARAONE, raced two to three wide around
the turn, gained mildly through upper stretch, but could not sustain the rally. DEVOTED KITTEN broke slowly, moved off the inside to the four-path around
the turn, and made no headway. IL FARAONE got bumped by CAUSALISTIC at the start, and was outrun inside. TONY SMALL got bumped and shut off by
CAUSALISTIC at the start, and was outrun. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
THE GREAT OZ angled in soon after the start, had some speed inside, inherited the lead as TWICE TOO MANY got out early on the turn, edged ahead in
upper stretch, drifted out under continued left-handed urging through the lane and held firm. ALADO saved ground off the early pace, tipped out near the
quarter pole, bid outside of the winner in midstretch, reached the throatlatch but could not get past the winner. WHIRL CANDY saved ground off the pace,
angled three wide near the quarter pole, lacked a clear path in midstretch, dove to the rail near the eighth pole and rallied inside. TWICE TOO MANY led
early, got out into about the five path early on the turn, angled back down to the three path nearing the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane.
JUMP BACK JACK checked soon after the start, raced two and three wide and went evenly. DALIO steadied soon after the start, dropped back and trailed
inside.

Footnotes
RANGER UP tracked from close range outside the pacesetters, bid in the three-path turning for home, got past NIMBLE BEAST entering the final furlong
and edged clear. UNCAPTURED KING advanced under a drive four wide after six furlongs, and rallied to go clear for the place while not a serious threat to
the winner. NIMBLE BEAST broke outward, set the pace inside, expanded the lead around the turn, then weakened through the stretch on the rail. PLEASE
SIT DOWN raced far back three to four wide to the quarter-pole, and improved through the stretch without factoring. STRONG ENDING was bothered by
NIMBLE BEAST at the start, moved up inside after a half-mile, but had nothing further. ALASTOR pressed NIMBLE BEAST from outside to the turn, and
gave way under pressure before reaching the stretch. TONS OF GOLD was never prominent. INGREIDO was always far back. PROSPECT PROJECT
bumped with UNCLE KEVIN at the start, and tired around the turn while moving out four wide. POWER (BRZ) raced widest and was never close. UNCLE
KEVIN bumped with PROSPECT PROJECT at the start, and was through early. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER tired inside.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY was unhurried early, swung to the far outside coming off the turn, rallied steadily and was along in time. CRUMB BUN set the pace
hounded from both flanks most of the way, drifted out late and saved the place. TONALIST'S SHAPE was put to a drive midway on the turn four then five
wide, had aim through the stretch but was outfinished. STARSHIP NALA sat behind the leading trio on the turn, moved out four wide near the quarter-pole,
bid through the stretch but weakened in the closing stages. STARSHIP BONITA pressed the pace inside rivals for six furlongs, and gave way through the
lane on the rail. OUR FANTASY argued the pace outside rivals for six furlongs, and tired. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN WARRIOR set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and held firm. CUY saved ground off the pace, rallied along the
rail in the lane, hit the rail near the sixteenth pole and was unable to get by the winner. POCO CHARLIE was bumped soon after the start, saved ground off
the pace and had a mild rally for the show. SPEND BENJAMINS tracked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and weakened.
COMPLEX SYSTEM bumped with POCO CHARLIE soon after the start, was pulling early, made some progress between foes down the backstretch, faded
two wide around the far turn and lacked a stretch rally. BROADWAY PETE prompted the winner three wide and tired in the drive. KRAMDEN had some
speed four wide and steadily faded. NEW YORK STYLE was off slow, raced three to four wide and made little impact. TEMPLET chased the pace three
wide and had no response. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CUY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH
WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
PUDDING stayed close outside the early duelers, took over in the four-path after a half-mile, pulled clear into the stretch and held sway while drifting out.
FRONT LOADED waited behind the front flight around the turn two to three wide, lodged a mild bid inside the winner through upper stretch, drifted out and
held the place. MALIBU MAX advanced around the turn four then five wide, had aim outside PUDDING into the lane, and was outfinished while drifting out.
REBELDE broke two lengths slow, improved position three wide after a half, but made no headway through the late stages staying on his left lead.
SEPTEMBERTEN was outsprinted early, got carried out six wide by WANDERING WEST around the turn, and posed no threat. WANDERING WEST broke
two lengths slow, moved out five wide taking SEPTEMBERTEN with him around the turn, and could not reach contention staying on his left lead.
DIAMONDS ENJOY vied outside rivals for a half, and folded up. SPEARGUN hustled through inside to argue the early pace, and was finished soon after
going a half.

Footnotes
UPTOWN QUEEN led early, settled back inside as KICK OUT THE JAMS was intent on the lead around the first turn, angled three wide early on the
backstretch, re-bid three wide into the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. TWICEFOURTEEN settled off the pace
while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. KICK OUT THE JAMS moved two wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared
midway around the bend, led inside to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the winner from there, drifted out in midstretch and was outfinished
for the place. QUIET STRENGTH threw her head at the start, trailed two wide for a half and rallied belatedly. TIZOFADEAL saved ground in range and
faded in the lane. HUSTLE QUEEN prompted the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn then came up empty in the lane.
OUR GIRL played no factor while racing three and four wide. RUBYINTHESTARS steadied incessantly through the opening three furlongs, saved ground
throughout and lacked a bid. LYLA'S MARK was outrun while racing two and three wide.
