FOOT SOLDIER away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the backstretch, controlled pace in the run down the backside and through
the final turn, and held the closers safely at bay late. ONE FIFTY ONE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from
the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive in a solid effort. PAY MY WAY away well and tracked the leader
into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive, and
steadied slightly approaching the wire. SHANGHAI POSSE stalked the leaders at the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry and well as a
rider's claim of foul. The rider of PAY MY WAY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of FOOT SOLDIER for alleged interference approaching the finish
line. After review the claim of foul was upheld, and FOOT SOLDIER was disquallifed from first and placed third

REA MEA away alertly and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn,
drifted in under right handed urging in mid stretch, shifted four wide late and was up in the final strides. FLY AWAY broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and just failed to last
following a stretch long battle. QUEEN OF ATTITUDE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide from towards
the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS away well and tracked the
leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive.
GIMMIEWHATCHAGOT stalked the leaders while racing three wide entering the backstretch, pulled herself into a tracking trip three wide in the run to the
final turn, but was outfinished late. WANDALITA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside from the back of the field entering the
final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. FULLY LENT tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, was in tight
quarters under a strong hold racing down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and was all out to hold off MAKE'N TRACKS to prevail. MAKE'N TRACKS
stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush two wide in
deep stretch to just miss. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
with a rush two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. VOLO VELOCE away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. WE GOT IT COVERED settled off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. GOLDEN TIGER broke sharply and tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide
in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival through the turn, and faded in the late going.
