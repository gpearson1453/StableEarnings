Footnotes
FARM BOY sprinted clear early, saved ground nursed along on a short lead after a half-mile, repelled a bid from JUSTICE WARRIOR turning for home,
then dug in and held off SWEENEY'S CAT to the finish. SWEENEY'S CAT pursued outside the early leaders in the clear, loomed a threat three wide coming
off the far turn, had aim outside FARM BOY through the drive but could not get past. SETTE STELLE saved ground early in midpack, got a bit closer to the
front flight two wide around the far turn, moved out a bit further through the lane and gained mildly. JOYFUL SURPRISE leapt at the break and was off
slowest, went four wide to the first turn, and offered a mild response in the stretch to go clear for the last major share. JUSTICE WARRIOR pressed FARM
BOY from outside up the backstretch and into the far turn, bid between horses at the top of the stretch, then gave way through the furlong grounds.
CARSON AND I tired inside after a half-mile. POLIN D'ORO was slow to begin, and never factored toward the inside. HALFWAY RIGHT got slammed
sideways bumping hard with BLUE TEQUILA at the start, became rank being wrangled back to last first time through the stretch, ducked out in front of
BLUE TEQUILA leaving the backstretch, and dropped far back. BLUE TEQUILA smashed into HALFWAY RIGHT at the start and checked back, was at the
back when forced to check behind HALFWAY RIGHT approaching the far turn, and was eased up in the stretch. JOHNNIE GOT JETS was four wide early,
stopped coming off the far turn and jogged in.

the three path, took a brief lead near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. FUNDY'S TIDE failed to menace while racing four wide. UNPUBLISHED

Footnotes
VENEZUELA FIRST vied for command outside REGAL HOLIDAY and RUN LEA RUN through the opening half-mile, took over at the top of the stretch, and
widened the advantage under pressure. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH broke out bumping THE DUNGEON, then came back inward bumping ETERNAL REST,
lagged well back three then four wide for a half, and rallied on the far outside to go clear of the remainder. ETERNAL REST got bumped by VENEZUELAN
TRIUMPH at the start and was slow to begin, moved up through the backstretch run, came four wide for the drive, had the rider drop the crop outside the
eighth-pole and was outfinished for the place. RIO HATO brushed with REGAL HOLIDAY at the start, raced very greenly along the inside past the half-mile
pole, lost considerable ground around the turn, then came back on well enough to snag a small share. RUN LEA RUN hit the right side of the gate at the
start but was away alertly, vied up front between horses for a half, and tired in the stretch. THE DUNGEON was bumped off stride by VENEZUELAN
TRIUMPH at the break, and never got close. REGAL HOLIDAY contested the pace inside rivals for a half, and gave way through the stretch on his left lead.
MIDNIGHT ALIBI was through early.

ENSIGN PARKER set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. PICKING UP PENNIES chased the winner four wide, could not gain on that
foe but outdueled multiple foes for the place. ABSOLUTE GRIT chased the pace two wide, was no threat to the winner, battled inside of foes for the minor
awards and just missed second. JOSHY JAK was in range three wide between foes and was one-paced in the lane. PALADIO failed to menace while racing
three wide. FAMOUS GENT saved ground to no avail. COWBOY AT HEART head his head turned at the start, broke in a tangle and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HERE COMES BULLET advanced five wide around the turn, rallied steadily through the lane, overpowered SIXTY ONE from outside with a furlong
remaining and drove clear. SAMARONTI raced four to five wide in the second flight entering the turn, rallied on the far outside through the stretch and went
clear for the place. KLEON stumbled at the start and was outrun early, hugged the rail improving through upper stretch, then flattened out. SIXTY ONE vied
inside BLAKENSTEIN to the turn, edged away while shifting three or four paths off the rail after six furlongs, then gave way leaving the eighth-pole. LOAD
UP MOE was slow into stride, raced three wide and failed to menace. MACHO REAL was outrun early, and never factored two wide. BRETT'S WORLD
tracked the dueling leaders well clear of the others to the turn, but came up empty after six furlongs. BLAKENSTEIN dueled outside SIXTY ONE early, and
was finished soon after going six furlongs. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

CATTIN was pinched back near the five-eighths pole, advanced inside around the turn, bid inside of the pacesetter nearing the eighth pole, took over
leaving that marker and drew off under a drive. PORK CHOP stalked the pace three wide between foes and stayed on to gain the place. SKIPPERINI set
the pace in the two path to midstretch and weakened. WHISKEYONHISLIPS was reluctant to load, chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the
lane. CHROMED IMPULSE pressed the pace two wide between rivals and retreated nearing the quarter pole. DANLEY failed to menace while racing five
wide. CHEF MENTEUR trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
CHANGE PLANS saved ground in easy striking range to the far turn, shifted out to take a run at KELSEY'S SHOT from outside approaching the stretch,
wrested command with a furlong to go, drifted out under left-hand pressure through the late stages and just held on. ROUGHLY A DIAMOND was outrun for
a half-mile, cut the corner beginning to find her best stride turning for home, surged late along the rail and just missed. OCEAN SAFARI steadied in tight
toward the inside leaving the first turn, moved out rallying through the furlong grounds, was forced out by CHANGE PLANS late and narrowly missed
outside. KELSEY'S SHOT set the pace inside, lost the advantage to CHANGE PLANS near the eighth-pole, stayed on with good courage but was overtaken
from both flanks for larger shares. ANYQUIST moved inward to the two-path entering the first turn, pressed KELSEY'S SHOT from outside to the top of the
stretch, and faded. PRESENCIA was outrun to the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed closing response. DOLCE APRILE
steadied entering the first turn and was forced out four wide, tracked outside for a half, and tired. BABY BLUE was no factor three to four wide. DOMINANT
JOY was strung out very wide into the first turn, and never reached contention. HIGH HEAVEN raced wide throughout, and tired through the stretch. MAGIC
SURPRISE checked off heels behind ANYQUIST into the first turn while rank, and was finished before reaching the stretch. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION
BY THE RIDER OF OCEAN SAFARI AGAINST CHANGE PLANS, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION AND PLACED THIRD
FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

RANGER UP stalked the pace four wide, reached near even terms leaving the quarter pole, vied outside of foes through the lane and prevailed. MYSTICAL
MOON advanced between foes down the backstretch, dueled between foes around the turn, dueled inside of the winner through the lane and just missed in
a game try. CANDY CRUSHEM angled six wide entering the turn, stayed out there around the bend and rallied outside. DOCTOR D J lagged well back two
and three wide and rallied between foes. GREEN MANSIONS set a pressured pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, fought on inside
of the top two to the sixteenth pole and caved in the later yards. AYCAPOTE had early speed between foes, rated back nearing the turn, raced four and five
wide around the bend and finished evenly. KEEPSAKEKITTEN had early speed between foes, dropped back while racing four wide around the turn and
lacked a rally. DARK AGES played no factor while racing two wide. SO LONG CHUCK chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. TAAMER
advanced inside down the backstretch then retreated inside around the turn. UHTRED had brief speed outside.

time through the stretch, moved to the two-path into the first turn, came three wide getting set down at the top of the stretch, reached the front outside
MISTA DONZELLA and NO GETTING OVER ME a sixteenth out, but could not withstand the top one. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE raced close up inside for six
furlongs, lacked room in the two-path behind the leaders through upper stretch, altered course outside and was up for the show. EXPONENTIAL hugged the
rail throughout, loomed a threat through the furlong grounds but was outfinished. NO GETTING OVER ME pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, and
gave way through the late stages. MISTA DONZELLA established a moderate early pace inside, stayed on to midstretch, then was overrun. BIG CITY RED
raced wide throughout, and faded into the lane in the six-path. IN HONOR OF ARTIE tracked outside the leaders, came under a ride on the far turn three
then four wide, and came up empty. KHOZANDO raced wide, got out through the far turn and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY SASSENACH bumped UKIYO at the start, stalked the pace three wide, cruised up nearing the quarter pole, took over turning for home, drifted out under
left-handed urging in midstretch, straightened out under right-handed urging leaving the eighth pole and drew off readily. DEMURELY broke sharply but was
devoid of speed, advanced four and five wide around the turn and stayed on outside to gain the place in the final strides. RUFA RED KNOT hit the starting
gate to get away last, soon sped to the front, set a clear pace inside, was collared turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, was no match for
the winner and lost second late. NOBLE DREAMER was in range inside, steadied off heels near the seven-sixteenths pole, angled three wide near the
three-eighths marker and lacked a closing bid. SILVER SMILE was slammed soon after the start, advanced four wide around the turn to reach contention
nearing the quarter pole but wilted soon after. SOUL FLIGHT was outrun inside. UKIYO was bumped at the start, raced four wide and was never involved.
STONE BEAUTY came out and slammed into SILVER SMILE soon after the start, had speed two wide but was through early.

Footnotes
LAHINCH bumped with PLENUM at the start, went along unhurried to the far turn in the two-path, shifted further out into the stretch, rallied steadily and was
along outside rivals in time. PLENUM bumped with LAHINCH at the break, then bumped with PALEMMA right after that, stalked the dueling leaders under a
firm hold early, tipped three wide with aim coming off the far turn, had the rider drop the drop near the eighth-pole, bid gamely late and was edged between
foes. OFFICIATING raced well off the pace two wide around the turns, rallied along the rail through the stretch and was outfinished. TIMMY M. trailed near
the three-path to the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, and was gaining on the far outside too late. SASSY BUT SMART set the pace inside to the
stretch, edged away entering the furlong grounds, then was overhauled from both flanks in a frantic finish. KHOZY MY BOY dueled outside SASSY BUT
SMART to the stretch, and weakened. PALEMMA bumped with PLENUM soon after the start, saved ground in range for a half-mile, and tired. CATCHING
FISH tracked four then three wide for a half, and gave way. TELLINGTON raced four wide early, and was empty three wide into the lane.

Footnotes
CAJUN'S MAGIC settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, put a head in front turning for home, edged ahead under
left-handed urging in upper stretch, dueled outside of DEAN DELIVERS through the lane and held firm. DEAN DELIVERS stalked the pace two wide, took
the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, was collared by the winner turning for home, battled on gamely inside and just missed. GOLD SPECIAL lacked
speed, saved ground around the turn, swung out in upper stretch and was along for the show. MERLIN steadied early, saved ground off the pace, angled
three wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. BIG AND CLASSY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. HOPE IN HIM had brief
speed inside. LAKI LIO set the pace along the rail and stopped nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
CHOOSE JOY stalked the pace three wide, bid outside CAT'S ASTRAY through the stretch, and edged away in the closing yards. CAT'S ASTRAY set the
pace inside, drifted off the fence into the lane, came back in slightly through deep stretch and was outfinished. LAGERTHA (CHI) saved ground covered up
behind the leaders around the turn, was boxed in along the rail and bumped twice with I AM THE BOSS through the furlong grounds, then checked late
inside CAT'S ASTRAY and saved the show. I AM THE BOSS pressed the pace outside CAT'S ASTRAY, bumped twice with LAGERTHA keeping that rival
pinned on the rail through midstretch, and weakened between horses. BERNIE'S MISTRESS bumped with SAMMY'S TOWN at the start, was outsprinted
early inside, moved out in the stretch and gained some ground without threatening. REINAGOL was a step slow at the break, and failed to threaten two to
three wide. SAMMY'S TOWN bumped with BERNIE'S MISTRESS at the start, and saved ground to no avail. NIKEE KAN raced four wide around the turn,
and faded steadily after three-eighths of a mile. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF LAGERTHA AGAINST
CAT'S ASTRAY, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND POSITION AND PLACED THIRD FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH.
