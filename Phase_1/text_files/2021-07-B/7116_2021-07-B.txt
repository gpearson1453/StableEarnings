Footnotes
FLAXY LADY stalked the pacesetter three to four wide, edged closer and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, edged away turning for home, held sway
while being kept busy. SEEKARAP stalked from widest, went four to five wide on both turns, could make no headway in the lane but secured the place.
WAGES set the pace from off the rail, went in the two to three path throughout, was overtaken late on the far turn and was outkicked but kept on to be well
clear of the rest. ABBIE'S WAY raced inside into the first turn off the leaders moving out a path early on that bend, continued to chase two wide on the far
turn but failed to rally. BALLINOUTTACONTROL shifted in from two wide to the rail early on the first turn, saved ground thereafter but had no rally. ISLE BE
GABBY dwelt at the start, saved ground unhurriedly along the inside, came out in upper stretch. APPLE COUNTY was outside foes early in the three to four
path, dropped back through the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TAINO HOUSE moved clear after the opening furlong, widened the margin into the turn going in the two to three path, was eased up late once clearly safe.
BLUE LUNA WHO raced inside a rival but well off the fence chasing the leader, moved in from the four to three path on the turn, kept on for the place. DIXIE
JEN was mid-pack outside, moved in a path from four to three wide on the turn, came out in mid-stretch, ran on mildly. KEATON tracked off the leader
outside a foe, went five then four wide on the turn, was carried out nearing the sixteenth pole and had no extra. PALICE REVENGE failed to rally racing in
the two path on the turn. ZUNI was last but one heading to the turn, saved ground briefly on that bend and gradually shifted out to the three path by the
three-sixteenths, came out more having reached upper stretch and was never near enough to threaten. TAB ME OUT raced three to four wide on the turn,
tired. WHISKEY THERAPY was not a factor racing off the inside in about the three to four path.

Footnotes
ONE MARK shifted in heading up the backstretch tracking the leaders, edged closer two wide into the turn, took over and was clear into the stretch, came
out near the furlong marker, held safe under steady handling. TROUBLEONTHETRACK was close up early, put in tight quarters just off rivals past the
three-eighths nearing the five-sixteenths, moved out from two to three wide at that juncture, gained mildly near the inside in the lane to secure the place.
DESERT REWARD was in close four wide and between runners into the turn, lacked the needed late kick. HOT CHARLIE was forwardly-positioned outside
rivals, went five wide on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and had no late bid. ROAD TO HEAT came in abruptly near the half-mile marker then moved
out a sixteenth later, travelled in the four path through the turn and improved position. CHUCKIES CHANCE bumped with a rival at the start then was
bumped into a different foe and exchanged four more bumps with the prior one at the start, settled into stride thereafter racing off the inside, went in the
three to four path on the turn moving out six to seven deep for the drive and passed rivals. PARK LANE LAD was forwardly-positioned three wide between
runners, came up empty for the stretch. NEAR GENIUS exchanged five bumps at the start, raced in the three path on the turn was never a threat. OAKES
CROSSING steadied at the half when in tight quarters as a rival came in, saved ground on the turn coming out a path leaving that bend to pass a tiring rival
but was never a threat. MISSISSIPPI MUSIC set a contested pace inside, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF TROUBLEONTHETRACK AGAINST ONE MARK ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

SLAMMED set the early pace from between rivals with mild pressure, edged clear into the turn racing in the three path, drew away under moderate urging.
PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN stumbled outwardly at the break, settled outside going six wide into the turn and advancing past rivals on that bend having moved
in a path, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch, was no match but second best. COMIC HOT TODDY was bumped at the break, settled mid-pack, angled in to be
three wide by the three-eighths pole tracking in behind the leading group, split foes at the top of the stretch, ran on and held show honors. SPEEDY
WILDCAT bobbled just slightly at the break, steadied slightly in behind runners early on the turn, altered out at that juncture to continue three wide, moved
out six wide turning into upper stretch and improved. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was unhurried in the early stages, began to pick it up in the four path on the
turn coming six wide into upper stretch, moved out for room near the sixteenth and ran on. LINE CALL was fractious and fell in the paddock, bumped into a
rival at the start, raced close-up early going six wide into the turn moving in a bit on that bend, came up empty. QUATRO was urged at the break, raced
close up early inside, came up empty. DESTINY WHO was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and passed tired

HOLLYWOOD HENRY set the early tempo from outside, shifted in two deep about the seven-sixteenths, drew away on the turn and heading into upper
stretch, kept to the task. COURAGE N ORDER settled in behind in the back half of the field, went two wide on the turn, advanced between rivals in
mid-stretch and secured the place. GOLDEN BAND was just a tiny bit fractious in the gate, raced mid-pack three wide on the turn then came out five deep
into upper stretch, kept on to get up for show honors. FRANCHISE TAGGED exchanged a bump at the start, was just off the leaders three then four wide on
the turn, came out six deep for the drive, lost third late. CERVEZA was bumped and slightly steadied at the break, raced toward the rear in behind rivals
three to four wide on the turn, moved out seven wide turning into upper stretch while making a move, levelled off in late stretch. DEL MAR SUMMER
exchanged contact with both inside and outside runners at the break, shifted in heading to the turn, went two wide on that bend, was outkicked for the minor
awards. WHEREDOESTHECASHGO was just a tiny bit fractious in the gate, stalked from inside a rival up the backstretch then altered outside that one at
the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, came up empty in the drive. HOLD ME ONLY was just a tiny bit fractious, exchanged bumps on both
sides at the break, raced at the back early while wide, went four to six deep on the turn, moved out eight wide for the drive and passed tired rivals. BIG
HITTER had bumps on both sides at the start, urged forward and chased inside, turned up empty. ATTILIANNO bumped a rival at the start then came in
and steadied just thereafter, raced well back three to five wide on the turn and was not a threat. NO PASA NADA was a bit restless in the parade and went
on alone with pony, was in the back half of the field throughout going four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. E J'S GOLD exchanged a bump at the
start, was mid-pack early racing inside, dropped back, was pulled up in late stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
ANCIENT LAND set the pace in the clear just off the rail, widened on the far turn and in the lane under steady handling. THUNDER DOME was content to
track in behind mid-pack, moved out past the half-mile marker, advanced five then four wide on the far turn, was no match but secured the place. STORM
BAYOU exchanged very light contact into the first turn, eased back off the leaders content to track in behind three wide, encouraged along two wide and
between foes on the far turn but lacked the needed kick to get second. JET N G tracked the leaders along the inside, saved ground on the far turn as well
but weakened in the drive. EFFORT N RESULTS threw his head and was erratic at the break causing the rider to lose the irons, raced in the two then three
path on the first turn, advanced three wide between foes on the far turn and gained position. CHARLIE COMANCH settled at the rear in the three path early,
went two then three wide on the far turn and improved some. SPINNING BLACK was washy in the post parade, steadied slightly heading into the first turn
racing on or just off the rail for the remainder. EVACUEE moved in four then three wide on the first turn in the back half of the field, put to a drive two wide
on the far turn but failed to rally. WEST DAWN exchanged a very light brush into the first turn while forwardly-placed four wide, began to drop back three to
four wide on the far turn and faded. NEXT AFFAIR pursued the pace from outside five wide early then four to five wide on the far turn, tired.
