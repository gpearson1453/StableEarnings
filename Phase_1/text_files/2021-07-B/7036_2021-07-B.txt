KYLE'S BRO JIMMY was rated behind the front runners two to three wide on the turn, swung out six wide for racing room leaving the turn, made a bid when
straightened and drew off to prove much the best under a drive. MOONSHINERBOY stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid past the quarter pole
to gain command, but proved to be no match for the winner in the final furlong while clearly second best. CAPE TOWN WILLY pressed the early pace and
made a three wide bid past the three eighths pole to duel for command but weakened in the drive, held show award. BROOK IS GOLDEN dueled for the
early lead two wide, then vied for command between horses entering the far turn and weakened. DA GOLD ROOM was off a step slow, then rushed up the
inside to duel for the lead then weakened. MORO WARRIOR was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and offered no rally. RACE WAS

Footnotes
KING FORD was rated along while four wide, made a four wide move leaving the five sixteenths pole, and drew off in the final furlong to prove much the
best under right handed urging. IADANZA vied for the early lead two wide, then went on to set the pace while clear on the backstretch, remained clear past
the quarter pole, but was headed past the furlong marker and prove no match for that rival while staying on for the place award. PERFECTURE broke
outwardly at the start, then vied for command on the first turn three wide, then tracked the pace three wide down the backstretch and weakened in the drive,
bested rest. BRAVURA CREEK was inside on the first turn and close up to the pace, then chased the pace two wide down the backstretch and weakened.
G DON'T KNOW was settled back early, came wide into the drive and had no rally. DYESS was rated along three wide on the backstretch, then switched to
the inside on the far turn and came up empty. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
