Footnotes
BAYTOWN WARRIOR was bumped leaving the gate ant hustled to the front at the half mile pole, raced clear inside and was steadily encouraged to
mid-stretch, then taken in hand later yards. GOLDEN HUGHES broke in to make contact with Agent Stone then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn
and proved no match in the stretch. SUPER JORDAN chased toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn and dueled for third through the upper
stretch, though, flattened later yards. AGENT STONE wsa bumped inward and into Baytown Warrior leaving the gate, picked up the chase and raced two
deep on the turn, then passed a rival the final sixteenth. BAYTOWN JAKESTER gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened
in the lane. THATZA ALPHA raced well back and was not a factor. FOREVER YOURS gave chase and saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
MIKI settled back in the three path the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the four
path of the far turn and dueled to the lead mid-stretch, then drew away the final sixteenth. LIL TOUGHMAN broke awkwardly and settled well back from
early contention, started a bid leaving the half mile pole, angled outward on the far turn and entered the stretch about the seven path, then dug in to take
second later yards. CASTLE'S TUFFY stalked two deep then moved to even terms past the half mile pole, continued at even terms through the backstretch
and put a head in front toward the quarter pole, contested the edge on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch, flattened stride late and just held on for third.
BLUE COLLAR BOY raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dug in
through the lane and just missed third. NOBLE EL SID set the early pace inside, was met past the half mile pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that
point, gave up the nod approaching the quarter pole, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn then weakened from mid-stretch.
ITSAHATTATACK settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far
turn. COBAN rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though,
weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
JAXBRADENRISHI was hustled along to contest the pace and dueled with the advantage at the rail on the turn, briefly gave up the nod toward the head of
the lane but dug in determinedly to recover the edge and held on under all out encouragement. BEARCAT KITTEN was hustled along to contest the pace
and dueled at a slim disadvantage two deep on the turn, took the nod nearing the head of the lane, dug in gamely to the finish, but was outfinished and just
held on for second. GRAND FIBER was hustled along between horses to contest the early pace, got shuffled back past the five sixteenths pole but regained
momentum off the rail on the turn, eased to the three path entering the stretch and finished well while gaining on the top two. GATTOSING chased outside,
rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. ZEP was hustled along to contest the early pace between horses, dropped back leaving the five
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the turn then flattened stride. FAPPIANO ROCKET engaged in close early chase off the rail then faded through
the turn. CHESTNUT LIME chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and had little left. SOUL MACHEN got off to a slow start
then picked up the chase and saved ground on the turn.

under steady stretch encouragement to just last. BELLA GIANNA chased inside, angled four wide nearing the the eighth pole, dug in through the lane to
take second the final yards, was gaining on the winner and just missed. GOOD KARMA was hustled along to contest the pace inside, steadied near the rail
approaching the quarter pole, raced close through the turn but dropped back midway through the turn and gave up second the final yards.
LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT engaged in close early chase and appeared a factor in the three path of the turn, then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
SHE GIVES ME FITS gave chase from well off the pace, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well to pass rivals. FIGHTRESS broke a bit awkwardly,
though, engaged in close early chase, raced in the four path of the turn, drifted to the eight path nearing the head of the lane then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. LUNAR PRAYER gave chase from well off the pace, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly. LETTS GO TO DIXIES

Footnotes
CEDAR RUN'S FIRE contested a slim lead inside through the backstretch, drew clear toward the quarter pole and dug in under steady stretch
encouragement to hold on well. WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased through the backstretch and improved in the six path of the turn, dug in for second
mid-stretch and finished well. REAL APPEAL pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back from between horses nearing the quarter pole,
raced off the rail on the turn and recovered just enough to get third. DAUGHTEROFTHESTARS contested the pace through the backstretch, dropped back
toward the quarter pole but remained close through the turn, dropped further back into the stretch then flattened the final furlong. COKERS COWGIRL came
in to make contact with Cowtown Energy and was bumped off stride as a result, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and
showed little further. SWISS HORIZON was bumped then jostled on the chute and kept reined in most of the backstretch, bid from the five sixteenths pole,
came through the turn in the six and seven paths, steadied off the heels of Marleesbeebee entering the stretch, then recoverd to pass rivals. STONES
ROAD pressured the pace four wide down the backstretch, but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and faded on the turn. MARLEESBEEBEE broke
out to make contact with Swiss Horizon then picked up the chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, angled to the eight path
approaching the top of the stretch then flattened stride. COWTOWN ENERGY exchanged contact with Swiss Horizon leaving the gate and was jostled on
the chute, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn near the rail. MOBIL MARSEILLE was not a factor.
