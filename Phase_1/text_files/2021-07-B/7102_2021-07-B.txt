Footnotes
BABY MAYBE allowed the pace to go early while saving ground, continued inside far turn, steered out to be three wide turning for home, kicked down the
leader late while fully extended. VELLEITY took command soon after the start, rated through some soft fractions inside, continued to hold a daylight
advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner lat5e, remained clear for the second spot. CIRCLEOFCOLOR chased the runner up
through those soft fractions, remained forwardly place into the lane, lacked a winning punch late, well clear of the others. MSCHITCHATTOUR fell back to
trail after the start, was never a threat. STORM CAT'S CRY veered out break, was righted and raced closest to the runner up off the inside for a half and
then began a steady fade, well beaten. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BALOOK settled in the second flight three wide, moved closer then challenged in the three path far turn, put a head in front soon after, shook clear when
straightened for home, held the next two safe late under steady handling. COLD HEARTED WENCH last away, void of speed, moved off the inside a bit,
swung widest when beginning to advance exiting the final turn, finished willingly down the middle of the course to be getting to the winner late and prevailing
for the place. MISS DAWN back off the early pace, moved closer in some traffic late final turn, came three wide and between horses into the straight, angled
in, closest to the winner late, caught for the second spot in the final strides. RUNNING ROSADO back off the early pace outside, advanced into contention
while four wide through the final turn, closest to the winner a furlong out, flattened out late to lose a couple of positions. TOP TEN DUCHESS broke in, was
straightened to head up the second flight along the inside, came up empty for the drive. HEATHER DIVINE pressed the issue early, dueled the middle part
in the two path and then began to give way second turn. CARONDELET fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke on top, set or forced the pace for five
furlongs closest to the inside and also faltered when the real running began.

Footnotes
MARIPOSA D'ORO away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, shook free of the other speed in the turn, well clear into the lane and maintained a
comfortable advantage through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. LUCKY LINZ allowed the pace to go along racing inside, slipped
through a relatively narrow opening midway on the turn, shifted out when straightened for home, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little
with that rival while fully extended for the place. KEHRON'S CREED moved outside, raced three out to four wide when roused exiting the turn, finished
willingly to be gaining for the place. CRY LIKE A BABY settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the turn, moved closest to the winner in the three
path late in the bend, flattened out through the stretch. PRINCESS ARWEN off slowly, raced well back early, steered wide around a stopping foe late in the
turn, remained wide in the drive in failing to rally. SILENT TRICK void of speed, was also racing back when forced to steer around a stopping FRENZY late
in the turn, also was not a factor in the drive. FRENZY dueled early inside, stopped in the turn, eased through the stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
CHASIN GRACIE shook clear after an alert break, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn in the two path, repelled an inside bid from a rival
past the furlong marker to be clear again late. HOMEBRED in the second flight up the backstretch along the inside, fell back in the run through the turn,
moved out to be three wide for the drive, finished up with good determination to be up for the place. MIDNIGHT BAYOU in the second group between
horses and outside the runner, dropped inside and advanced closest to the winner turning for home, briefly reached that one from along the rail with a
furlong remaining, flattened out in the late going to be caught for the second spot. SAPONI last away, raced back early, moved closer late in the turn then
lacked a further bid. SANDBAGGER AL fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

OPPS MY BAD vied up front early while between foes, shook clear into the turn, maintained a daylight advantage into the lane, dug in late when confronted
to prove best under firm handling. ZYDECO MUSIC void of early foot, ranged up into contention while four wide, chased the winner past the furlong marker,
late bid, not enough. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE in the second group while racing off the inside, moved a bit closer three wide through the turn, drifted out a
bit past the furlong marker, continued with mild interest to be closing the gap on the top pair. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH one paced off the inside,, drifted in past
the furlong marker, finished up evenly to finish on even terms for the fourth spot. RHETT'S RACER last away, devoid of early speed in trailing early, four
wide out of the turn, displayed some mild, belated interest to improve position. IBEGTODIFFER remained back in failing to menace. BACK INTHAT ACTION
broke out, was straightened to press then chase the winner up the backstretch and through the turn, gave way in the drive. MS LOUISA forwardly placed
early, began a steady fade before a half. OPENING QUARTER AND HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLITS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

RUBY SIOUX broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace, headed midway on the final turn, regained the advantage to show the way past the furlong marker,
confronted by a second foe at that time, rebuffed that one as well to prevail in a determined effort. FASHION MOON within striking distance early while
saving ground, continued inside then moved outside for the second turn, ranged up into contention four wide into the lane, challenged outside the winner
late, denied. HAVINFUNYET in the second flight while between foes, fell back toward the inside second turn, asked along into the lane, coming again late
up the inside to close the gap on the top two. SAND DRIFT last to leave, raced close enough to remain in contact with the leaders outside, came up empty
for the stretch run. GREAT IN RED pressed the winner early off the inside, dueled and put a head in front second turn, faltered in the drive. OPENING

UNBELIEVABLE CATCH broke back, outrun early inside, asked along turn, steered out then dropped back in just inside the furlong marker, late surge to
win going away. PERMANENTDETENTION in the second flight while racing outside, moved closer three wide turning for home, drifted out when
straightened for home, no match for the winner, up for the second spot late. TOOL BOX broke on top, sprinted clear soon after, maintained daylight into and
through upper stretch, faltered in the late going to lose the top two positions. YOAKAM soundly bumped at the start, recovered to race closest to the early
leader, fell back a bit in the turn, went evenly through the stretch. UNBRIDLED HOPE forwardly placed along the in side, continued to save ground turn, had
little left for the drive. PA PI broke in to soundly bump YOAKAM, fell back to trail soon after and made little impact. PRINCE CARLOS shuffled back at the
break, failed to menace. BRAD EYE was finished early while racing outside, well beaten.

Footnotes
EXPLOSIVELY HOT lacked early foot while racing in the two path, began a steady advance after a half, dropped inside late final turn, continued to make up
ground upper stretch, bid along the rail with a furlong to run, drew clear under pressure. VERRAZANO ISLAND within striking distance early put a head in
front before a half, narrowly showed the the way through the final turn and into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, narrowly saved the place.
GRAND ISLE GIRL settled off the pace and the inside, two to three wide into the lane, split foes inside the furlong grounds, finished willingly to be in time for
the show and just miss the runner up position. NON BINDING broke back, raced five wide into the first turn, continued outside while moving closer late
backstretch, came four wide into the lane, came out when straightened for home, also made some close late. BEYOND D'ORO settled off the pace, two
path through the final turn, came up empty for the stretch run. GATOR PROUD last away, void of early speed in trailing, moved up to mid pack by a half,
came four wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. SHE'S MY PRIORITY four wide into the first turn, vied in the run up the backstretch outside, gave way
in the final turn. AUDACIOUS GIRL flashed brief early speed and gave way. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BIND ON EARTH with the pace after breaking in good order, dueled into the turn off the inside, disposed of the other speed late in the turn while remaining
off the inside, well clear past the furlong marker, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. EMERY'S DREAM last to leave, continued to be devoid
of speed early, dropped inside for the turn, improved steadily while saving ground into the lane, shifted out nearing the furlong ground to challenge for the
runner up spot, up late, no threat to the winner. ARANCIA within striking distance, raced inside into the lane when improving, proved no match for the winner
late, caught for the place. GABY'S PROMISE lacked speed, in some traffic into the lane, steered out widest for the drive, finished up with some interest to
improve position a bit. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL settled in mid pack while off the inside, continued one paced throughout. ENVOYS LEGACY forwardly placed
while off the inside, gradually weakened through the lane. SOCIAL GALAXY remained back in failing to menace. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL dueled up front
while inside the winner along the rail, stopped turning for home, jogged in. CRYPTO BRAVE was never involved while racing wide. DOENY SPARKS in the
second flight while racing three wide.
