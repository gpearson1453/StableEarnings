PRESS SNOOZE sped to the lead at the start, got collared by BLACK VK and chased inside around the turn, was put to a drive at the head of the lane,
raced two wide in tight quarters near the sixteenth pole then drew clear. STREET PRAYER raced off the top two early leaders, hustled up three wide around
the turn, took the lead near mid-stretch then got outkicked by the winner. HACKER MAN saved ground around the turn, tipped out a path at the head of the
lane, sustained a steady bid and prevailed for a share. BLACK V. K. advanced in the opening quarter and took over the early lead, got collared by STREET
PLAYER near mid-stretch, steadied near the sixteenth pole and flattened out. PALIMPSEST chased two to three wide and lacked a needed rally. RIOJA
PALACE raced in the last flight then four wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PEBBLE ROAD settled near the inside through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, angled out turning for home, was set down five wide for the
drive and edged away. SOMETHING MAGICAL stalked through the backstretch, angled out turning for home, raced three to four wide near the lead then
got outkicked by the winner. CLASSICAL MAGIC stalked the pacesetter, launched a bid near the quarter pole, edged by to a slim lead in the stretch run
then had no closing kick. SHIFRA MAGICIAN raced inside in range, saved ground around the far turn, lodged a two wide bid top of the lane, raced up close
but needed more. FOXY LADY set the pace through the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, got collared near mid-stretch and gave way. OVER TO
YOU rated two wide, was ridden along four wide into the lane and never threatened. OBLIO'S WISH tracked the pace, urged three to four wide and failed to
respond. ABSORB saved ground to no avail.

GOLD MONEY set the pace through the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, saved ground into the lane, dueled deep stretch inside of HUGE BIGLY,
dug in gamely and prevailed. HUGE BIGLY was forwardly placed through early stages, launched a two wide bid into the lane, roused forward to challenge
GOLD MONEY for the late lead, dug in gamely and just missed. ENGLISH TAVERN settled two wide through early stages, launched a three wide bid at the
head of the lane, sustained a steady effort and secured a share. SEE THE PYRAMIDS rated inside through the backstretch, angled out at the head of the
lane and failed to kick on. ONAROCK tracked the pace through the backstretch, hustled up three wide near the quarter pole, continued in range near the
furlong marker then flattened out. TOE CURLIN' KISS was unhurried, saved ground around the far turn, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane and
lacked a needed rally. BALLINONABUDJET tracked the pace through the backstretch, saved ground and steadily weakened.

Footnotes
EL ZOPILOTE tracked the embattled trio around the turn, launched a four wide bid heading into the lane, responded willingly and drew off. MIRACLE
BOBBIE sped to the lead out of the gate, quickly came under pressure, vied two wide between rivals around the turn, was no match when the winner took
control in the upper stretch but stayed on with response for second best. NEW SOUTH advanced in the opening quarter and vied three deep for the lead
around the turn, was no match when the winner took over then sustained a steady bid and secured show. AGENT MULGANNON moved up the inside in
early stages, vied inside of a dup around the turn then flattened out in the lane. FREE STEVE raced three wide and never menaced. COUNCIL MOJO
saved ground then raced three wide and had no response. CHESTNUT HILL lacked speed and never reached contention.
