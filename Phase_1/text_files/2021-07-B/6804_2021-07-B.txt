Footnotes
CITRUS BAY was urged four deep through the opening furlong pursuing the pacesetter outside rivals, shifted inwards entering the turn to bid for command
three deep midway through the bend, pressed the issue past midstretch while shifting inwards under pressure, gained a clear advantage between calls late
and continued with a grudging effort to narrowly prevail under right handed pressure. FEROCITY, urged three wide between rivals pursuing the pacesetter
to the turn, was held up avoiding close quarters entering the bend, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to close
the gap on the winner. TURNSANDCONDITIONS was rated just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening furlong, advanced along the rail to
challenge for command inside foes on the turn, continued to dispute the issue inside the eventual winner past midstretch but weakened late. CAUSE I'M
LEAVIN stumbled at the start, was righted to track the leaders from just out of striking distance along the inside, gained position into the lane, then altered
course midstretch to race four wide in the closing stages and just missed for a share while finishing on his own courage in the final strides.
WILLWORKFORFOOD sped to the lead a bit off the rail racing to the turn, dueled for command between foes through the bend and gave way in the drive.
THIRSTY KISS ducked out at the start losing position to the field and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE TRAINER OF FEROCITY
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BEACH FLOWER sped to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, was prompted to repel a rival's
challenge leaving midstretch and kicked away late despite the loss of his rider's whip in the final strides. APPLE DAPPLE, off slowly, was prompted between
foes to gain terms stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards while moving to challenge for command nearing midstretch but
proved no match for the winner late. JEN TAKE CHARGE settled last dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes to
advance four wide racing through the far turn gaining a position just off the leaders in upper stretch but finished evenly late. BARONESS VONTRAPPE
tracked just off the leaders inside rivals while being brushed racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid.
PRETTI XTREME angled inwards racing to the first turn brushing BARONESS VONTRAPPE, tracked the leaders between foes racing to the far turn and
faded into the lane. BEACH GETAWAY tracked the leaders three wide as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into the lane.

VIVA EL CAPITAN angled to the inside pursuing the pacesetter racing to the turn, came through inside that foe to wrest the advantage midway through the
turn, kicked away under some prompting racing into the lane and widened the advantage on her own courage through the final furlong.
MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER sped to the lead along the inside in the opening furlong, bore out while being steadied slightly when her rider attempted to correct
her course entering the turn, continued to dispute the issue outside the winner racing to upper stretch but couldn't match terms with that foe through the
lane. LIPSTICK LADY, urged pursuing the pacesetter off the inside racing to the turn, was fanned three wide continuing under pressure and faded into the
lane. ROLLIN BLACKOUT was taken in hand soon after the start when getting out in the opening stages despite her rider's attempt to correct her course
and failed to menace thereafter. LATIN NIKKITA was outpaced early.

PRINCE RAMA broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin while angling to the inside, widened the advantage in upper stretch and was kept to
steady left handed pressure. SILVER DASH settled between foes in the opening stages, shifted out three deep while being prompted to advance racing into
the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but prevailed narrowly for the place honors late. FIRE EXTINGUISHER, urged to a position tracking just outside
the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted to the inside racing into the lane but faded late while just missing for second. WORN A BIT tracked off the second
flight along the inside racing to the turn, angled outside foes in upper stretch but had no closing bid. CAPTAIN DRAKE settled between foes in early stages
and proved no threat. TWILITE LIASON proved no factor. SAN VALENTINO dropped out early.

Footnotes
EL TIZAR was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then was roused through the stretch to forge clear
late. DEVIL VISION settled three deep between foes racing off the second flight to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, then found his best
stride in late stages to edge rivals for the place honors. KINETIC SWAGGER tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted outside foes nearing upper
stretch to advance three wide, then was carried out late while just missing for second. SKIPPY'S STRIKE, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace,
shifted in on the far turn to press the pacesetter nearing the lane, drifted out under pressure racing through the stretch impeding a rival and steadily faded
late. BOURBON WISDOM, caught four wide racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight, angled to the inside on the far turn but had no rally
racing between rivals through the stretch. ITS A BOY, off a bit slowly, settled last racing to the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch but had no rally.
TAPAGE tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, then shifted out while steadily fading into upper stretch. DANCERONTHEBEACH,
urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
IRISH CHARLIE, brushed at the start, switched out to race in the five path tracking well off the second flight on the backstretch, steadily gained contention
racing four wide into upper stretch, moved to wrest the advantage near the sixteenth marker and went clear late under firm encouragement. HOLY
MUCHACHO settled in the last flight in the six path early, steadily advanced to contention five wide entering the lane and edged a rival for the place honors
late. POVERTY FLATS settled inside foes racing through the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch, altered slightly avoiding close quarters
midstretch but continued with interest four deep between foes to gain position to the end. SHOW BUSINESS tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing
to the turn, made brief progress three deep midway through the turn but came up empty late. CINCO CATALINA tracked off the second flight between foes
to the turn but offered no closing bid. FRONT OFFICE angled to the rail tracking off the first flight. gathered momentum on the turn, switched outside the
pacesetter to gain a brief advantage midstretch but quickly lost momentum. UNBRIDLED SHOES broke inwards brushing the eventual winner, was settled
last to the turn and failed to menace. RASMUS, urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dispatched a rival
on the turn to set the pace to upper stretch but gave out abruptly entering the lane. DEMIGOD was hustled along forcing the pace outside a rival to the turn
and gave way abruptly nearing the midway point of the bend.

Footnotes
MARK IN GREELEY, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into the far turn, made steady progress in that path to upper
stretch, shifted inwards racing through the lane but rallied to the front to go clear late under strong handling. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY tracked just off the
pacesetter along the rail to the backstretch, came through inside that foe after a half to press the issue on the far turn, gained the advantage racing into
upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner late. OXWOOD knocked back after being bumped from both sides at the start, settled last to the backstretch,
swung out six wide racing into the lane and was going well late to gain a share. TWIRLING ROSES tracked off the first flight three wide between foes, was
prompted to advance four wide into the far turn to gain striking distance racing into the lane but had no final kick. BREXTON tracked the pace between foes
in second flight, angled to the inside on the far turn, saved ground to the lane and finished evenly inside rivals late. DIDJADOIT settled off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch and made some late progress to gain position inside foes. SQUARED STRAIGHT,
urged disputing the pace inside a rival racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, dueled for command outside a rival on the far turn to upper stretch and gave
way. CHARITY FOR ALL broke outwards bumping OXWOOD, was settled between foes to the backstretch, then angled six wide in the stretch while proving
no threat. MY VOW IS COURAGE broke inwards bumping OXWOOD, was collected to track off the second flight between foes to the far turn and faded in
the drive. INCRIMINATION caught four, then five wide racing to the backstretch, steadily faded into the far turn. GIANT'S GATEWAY, urged forcing the
pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gave out abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES, reserved outside foes racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting four wide racing into upper stretch, was
fanned to the five path late but continued with a steady late response to just prevail in time under firm handling. TEMUJIN LADY was rated stalking just off
the first flight racing to the turn, bid for command three deep in upper stretch, was floated out, then drifted out in late stages, resisted the winner's bid to late
stages but just missed. VISUAL MAGIC was rated along the inside in early stages, shifted outside a tiring rival racing into the lane, then split foes just off the
inside in the closing stages to prevail for a share. BLUE BLAZES WHO joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival
into upper stretch, drifted nearing the furlong marker and yielded late. Y NOT SIZZLE settled between foes racing to the turn, angled out four wide entering
the lane and continued to improve position between foes. SOME SAY SO hopped at the start, settled last to the turn and was fanned six wide in the closing
stages while failing to make an impression. FORTY NINE MODEL, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way midstretch.
PURPLE SCOOTER, urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch.

PEAK OF CHIC was urged to the lead along the inside racing through the backstretch, forged clear entering the turn, was kept to pressure racing past
midstretch, then was taken in hand once the issue was decided in late stages. LAURA N LUKAS tracked just off the leaders along the inside, saved ground
to upper stretch and proved best of the others. UPTOWN JERSEY GIRL, off a bit slowly, settled along the rail, then improved position inside foes racing into
the stretch. WILLSHERWONTSHE ducked out at the start while breaking slowly, angled three wide nearing the lane but had no rally. HOT HABANERO was
urged prompting the pacesetter to the turn and gave way abruptly on the bend.
