Footnotes
CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL came away in good order, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three then two
path on the far turn then moved clear with three furlongs to run, was put to a drive into upper stretch then came under a left-handed crop, drifted out into the
final furlong, was switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped leads back and forth while shortening stride and held desperately
while exhausted in the end. EKHTIBAAR was hustled from the start, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, settled in a good position off
the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased two then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the
runner-up while moving out behind that foe, gained quickly late and just missed while well clear for the place. WAGON BOSS went around the first turn in
the two path, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead with a half-mile to run then lost the advantage to the winner early on the far turn, dropped from
the two path to the rail while falling behind that foe on the turn and tired but was clear for the show. FLOWERS FOR LISA went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, raced under urging late on the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn and came up empty. PLAYWRIGHT stumbled at the start
then bumped with a foe, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn, moved to three then four
wide later on that bend and failed to respond. HAMMERIN AAMER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the far
turn and also failed to respond. NO LIME bumped with a rival at the start then bobbled and was taken up, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near
the back, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. REVENIO was sent hard to the lead, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, lost
the advantage with a half-mile to run and stopped.

SMILE BRYAN was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging late on the far turn, shifted to the two path into the stretch, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and got his nose down on the wire to narrowly prevail. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY broke
sharply then angled in while going to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the clear pace, vied inside on the far turn, responded well put to a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, led to the final stride but was out-nodded and denied on the
wire but earned the place. SKYRO saved ground while reserved off the pace, was roused on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased
the top two to the wire and finished willingly to get the show. POINT ME BY rounded the first turn in the two path, was unhurried in the back half of the field,
saved ground while roused on the far turn, gained under a drive in the final furlong and finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. SO
SUAVE (IRE) went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused four wide on the far turn then came five wide into the stretch and
improved position. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) brushed with a foe while keen into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was reserved off the pace, tucked
into the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GUSSY MAC (IRE) brushed the outside of the gate at
the start, was keen under restraint into the first turn, checked inside the three-quarter pole, settled towards the back, was urged three wide on the far turn,
moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. TREASON brushed with a foe into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, was rated on the outside,
came under encouragement in the three path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. LOMU was hustled from the start, traveled around
the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
BIG BAD DIVA just off the pace three wide throughout, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command just outside the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. KERIK chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. KEMBA brushed at the start by
GEM KEY, who broke out a step, raced forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide for home taking brief command straightened away before being displaced from the front by the eventual winner near the eighth pole, weakened
in the late stages while clear for the show honors. ROSE E HOLIDAY three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide for home and offered no response. GEM KEY broke out at the start brushing KEMBA, showed the way rated along the inside, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired. EVIDENCE BASED saved ground towards the rear
of the field rating unkindly and eager pulling on the bit through the opening half mile pole, went two to three wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU was hustled from the start after breaking in the middle of the field, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the
lead in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. LADY SCARLET was away alertly, set the pace
under pressure from the winner to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under a strong
hand ride, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for the place. OUTFOXED broke a half-step slow, was urged along in
the back of the field, came out leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn and improved position to get the show. LI LI BEAR chased the
pace on the outside then three wide on the turn and tired. REPEALING broke a half-step slow, dropped well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned
into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. TEXIAN was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and came up empty.
ROLIN N CONTROLIN broke a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out behind a faltering foe nearing the furlong marker
and was no factor. SOLASTA broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and faltered. MARTINI TWIST
broke in a tad, chased the early pace, dropped back near the half-mile pole and also faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

FIVE ALARM ROBIN coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket patiently handled and on hold through to near the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside for home after briefly jostling for position, got roused straightened away, split rivals at the three-sixteenths and rallied to engage
the leader through the final furlong seizing command inside the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the finish. KITTEN BY THE SEA attended the leader
from the outside in the two path, advanced on that foe through the far turn taking over the front with five-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under lone threat to her inside, got caught inside the sixteenth marker and ran on clear of the rest for the place
honors. CHOOSE HAPPINESS just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and kept on to secure the show honors. JAZZY LADY crossed immediately to the inside after the start and saved ground at the tail of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. COREY SCORES saved ground near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late
stages. STEFANIE ON FLEEK two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. POSITIVE SKEW saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing tipped three wide at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. TWO CENT TOOTSIE three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SKY KITTEN three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired. ALBA'S STAR showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go and took the inside route into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

stretch, was put to a right-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead around the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole, continued on her inside lead to the wire and held under strong urging. MAINSTAY bobbled at the start then was hustled, moved up then
chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, swapped back to her inside lead when given a
crack of a right-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly while unable to reach that foe but was clear for the place. SAUCY LADY T settled
behind horses early, moved in to save ground early on the turn, shifted three wide before the five-sixteenths, was driven into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while best of the rest. VELVET SISTER was urged along in third position, dropped back while two to three wide on the turn and tired.
CARTEL QUEEN was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement while five wide on the turn and capitulated. EAGLE EXPRESS
was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and had nothing left. QUEEN CAMILLA moved in while dropping well
behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

DANZIGWITHTHESTARS tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, remained patiently handled until put to urging taking the inside route into upper
stretch, got paused behind foes straightened away into upper stretch, attempted to tip out and couldn't do so safely, had the rail open up inside of
ATHENRY a furlong out and was roused through the seam into daylight rallying up the rail and collaring the leader in the final jumps to score. CLEVER
FELLOW got bumped out a path seven furlongs from home as STRAIGHT SKINNY was rank off heels of a rival and in turn bumped A COLT NAMED
SUSIE, settled just off the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun three wide for home, rallied to take command a
furlong out, dug in under threat and was caught in the late stages. RUSE just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home and kept on to secure the show honors. VIKING ZIM saved ground near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DREAMPOINT broke in a step at the start
bumping NOBLE JOURNEY, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field until tucked inside seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and kicked on belatedly through the stretch. ATHENRY showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled
until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. SANDRO THE
GREAT tracked just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. NOBLE JOURNEY bumped at the start by DREAMPOINT who broke in a step, was in tight along the rail seven furlongs from home, tracked the
pace along the inside under a hard hold, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, and weakened. STRAIGHT SKINNY grew rank under a hard
hold off heels seven furlongs out and bumped CLEVER FELLOW into A COLT NAMED SUSIE, tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. SHINJUKU three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. A COLT NAMED SUSIE bumped at the seven-eighths by CLEVER FELLOW due to pressure from
STRAIGHT SKINNY, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired.
