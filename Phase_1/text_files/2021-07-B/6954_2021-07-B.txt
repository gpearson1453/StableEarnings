BIG CHICK was allowed to settle in the early going, came five wide on the turn and into the stretch while gaining ground, made a push inside of the furlong
marker to confront and pass BIG AWARD and won in a drive in the end. BIG AWARD broke on top and set the pace through the turn while three wide,
opened the lead off of the turn but was confronted and passed by the winner inside of the eighth pole but was a clear second over the rest. HEAT SEEKING
LETA settled toward the rear of the field while saving ground in the two path and finished willingly in the stretch but was not challenging the top two. ALMA
SPIRIT stalked the pace through the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch drive. GREY ABBEY sat just off of the early pace, traveled along the
rail on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ZAKKIYYAH was allowed to settle in the midflight early while four wide on the turn, rallied and made a bid inside of the furlong marker and while on the left
lead in the end drew clear to prevail. FLASHIN PASSION stalked the pace of ALLIE'S PAL while saving ground on the turn, made a late gain inside of the
eighth pole but could not hold off the winner while winning the nod for the place. ALLIE'S PAL was hustled to set the pace through the turn while traveling
along the rail, had a clear lead into the lane but was tiring in the late going, was collared by the winner and was erratic when struck with the whip inside of
the last sixteenth and just missed for second. MICKEY DOBBS settled in the middle of the field through the turn while two wide and finished evenly in the
stretch run. STRIKING SERMON bumped SPEEDY LOU C at the break, had no speed early, was three wide on the turn and passed tiring foes in the
stretch. B J'S SPIRIT stalked the pace while three wide and weakened in the stretch run. SPEEDY LOU C was bumped by STRIKING SERMON at the start,
was unhurried through the turn while two wide and was not a factor. Race times updated after data review.

sixteenth to prevail. LOVELY HUSSAR bobbled at the start and chased the pacesetters while three wide, gained ground through the turn and into the
stretch and just missed for the win while a clear second over the rest. PETE'S INFERNO was hustled to sit just off of the pacesetters through the turn while
four wide and weakened in the stretch run while holding for third. ROYAL DANIELLE broke on top and set contested fractions through the turn while three
wide and tired in the drive. ROBBERYINPROGRESS contested the early pace with ROYAL DANIELLE while saving ground on the turn, was outrun off of
the turn and finished evenly in the late going. SHARP CURVE stalked the pace from a ground saving trip along the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER made a middle move to take command of the pace, was two wide on the second turn, led into the stretch and was confronted by
SUMMER FUN nearing the furlong marker, dueled with that rival and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. SUMMER FUN bumped RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT
leaving the break, settled in the midflight through the second turn, improved position while four wide on the second turn, came to terms with BROKEN
FINGER,dueled with that rival and could not get by, while running on the left lead late. DRASARIO (IRE) prompted the pace by BROKEN FINGER into the
second turn while three wide, lost a bit of ground off of the turn and was outfinished by the top two in the stretch, while holding third. VOICE OF VICTORY
was bumped by RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT at the start, chased the pace through the second turn while saving ground and finished evenly in the stretch run.
RULER OF ANGELS settled in the middle of the field, was four wide on the second turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch but was not affecting the
leaders. STORMY THUNDER was off slowly and settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch.
GOVERNOR ARTHUR chased the pace for a half-mile, lost position on the second turn while three wide and faded in the stretch run. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT
was bumped by SUMMER FUN at the start and in turn bumped VOICE OF VICTORY, trailed through the second turn and was not a factor. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE INVOLVING #1 VOICE OF VICTORY, #2 RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT AND #3
SUMMER FUN AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.
