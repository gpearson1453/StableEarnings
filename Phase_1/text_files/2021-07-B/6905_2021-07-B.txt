BE A LOVELY DAY hustled from outset and shared the early command as the outer rival of two abreast, trekked the two path around the bend and refused
to relish command in securing the victory. HONEYFROMTHESOUTH rushed away from the break and exchanged command as the inner rival, saved
ground through the turn, then was outdueled in final furlong for the honors. LITTLE SURE SHOT led the second flight throughout and proved best of rest
after giving chase to the front running dueling duo. MISS TYRO failed to menace while giving chase from a ground saving stance. HOPE AND A DREAM
trailed from outset.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ASYA broke alertly, assumed command at first step, and was unchallenged in a gate to wire romping. SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL established a
ground saving stance, rated in the second flight as the inner most rival of three abreast, and finished a clear second but was no match for the runaway
winner. BETTY JEAN settled into the second flight between rivals, chased the speedy pacesetter around the bends, then finished evenly while unable to
catch top pair. RIVER LIBERTY trekked three wide throughout and lacked a rally in the end. SHANGHAI SALLY failed to threaten while giving chase from a
back rated pose.

PLAYING WITH JAXS motored from outset, quickly established a comfortable margin on rivals, and steadily widened the margin while racing alone in front.
HUSHED chased the early pacesetter and eventual winner from a two path stance while leading the second flight, shook clear of second flight rivals long
the backstretch, but proved to be no match for the tough winner in the end. PEARLY finished evenly after giving chase from along the inside early and
trekking the two path at upper stretch. I'M A STEPHANIE lacked a needed rally after showing reserve in the early going. MISS COFFEYVILLE lost ground to
front runners with a wide journey.

ROCKPORT KAT hustled from outset and shared the command for the opening half as the inner most rival of the pacesetting trio, maintained the command
through the final bend, then shook off all challengers en route to the score. TOTALLY TIGER showed reserve and trailed the field for the opening half before
rallying for place by circling rivals with a three wide move through the final turn. SI ES GOYA rushed from the break and set the pace in tandem as the outer
most rival of three abreast for the opening half, then came up empty in the latter stages and was unable to sustain bid. HE'S MUNNIE lacked a rally and was
unable to gain on leaders in the final strides after giving chase from a wide pose. BLUE HARBOR retreated rapidly in the latter half after setting the pace in
unison from between rivals.

RARE WARRIOR hustled form outset to establish a ground saving stance, led the field at every call and kicked clear in the final furlong for the score.
DOWNEASTER ALEXA was unhurried along the backstretch then rallied strongly along the rail to earn the place. MORNING VALENTINE weakened in the
final furlong after pressing the pace while trekking the two path around the bend. ADCATS RIDE travelled widest of all and lost ground to front runners by
doing so. S S SUPER SPORT gave chase to pacesetter from a three path position and tired in the late going. BLESSED KIP came away slowly and behind
all rivals and gained experience in her debut.

TEXAS GOLD RUSH hustled from outset and established a two path stance, assumed command shortly after the start, then steadily drew off from all rivals
in a runaway win. OBSTRUCTED VIEW settled into a to path position, chased the pacesetting duo through the half, angled out and circled JUST BUBBA
inside the half pole, and finished a clear second but was no match for the runaway winner in the end. JUST BUBBA disputed the early pace with the
eventual winner for the opening half then gave way to the top pair in the latter half of contest. MALIBU PRINCE saved ground to no avail. RED FLASH
trailed throughout.

SHEMINE FELINE stalked the pacesetter while saving ground, maintained that line at upper stretch and dug in in the closing furlong for the score. SHE'S
EARTHBOUND rushed from outset and assumed first command, led the field at upper stretch from a two path stance, then was caught in the final sixteenth
and forced to settle for place honors. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN showed reserve and trailed the field through the opening half before rallying strongly to earn
the show. FLAT QUICK settled in behind rivals around the opening bend, closed the gap on leaders along eh backstretch, tucked to the rail just inside the
quarter pole and was gaining on the leaders at the end. DAISY FIFTYSEVEN lost ground to front runners with a wide trip. GEORGIANO travelled wide while
rating mid pack and failed to menace. BLING SPRINGSTEEN faded in the late going after flashing early interest and pressing he pace from between rivals.

HUMOR'S REWARD was unhurried in the opening half, trailed the field by a wide margin entering the backstretch, then responded to urging along the
backstretch and rapidly closed the gap on the leaders, circled all rivals through the final bend, and finished the huge rally under a stiff drive. TOWN DRUNK
rushed form outset and led the field through three calls from an inside stance before being caught in the final furlong by the hard charging rival. WRITTEN
PERMISSION settled into a ground saving stance off the pace, was roused nearing the conclusion of backstretch, split foes mid turn, then crowded an inner
rival at head of homestretch and finished full of run. HIGH CLASS EURO came up empty in the end after stalking the front runner from a three path pose.
MAYFAIR HEIGHTS rated close up as the inner most rival through the opening half, was looming boldly through the final bend, then was forced to take up
at the eighth pole when crowded by a rallying rival. JUST FRED lacked a needed rally to end a wide journey. MAJOR BROWN failed to threaten from a back
rated position.

LUCKY AND FAST broke amongst the leaders and established a two path position, shared command through the half, then shook clear in final sixteenth for
the score. CATSTHANKMUYIHIDIN hustled away from the break and assumed first command, led the field in unison with eventual winner as the inner rival
through the half, but failed to match strides with that rival in the final sixteenth. ELIJAH GHOST settled into second flight as the outer rival of three abreast,
chased the pace setting duo along the backstretch while leading the second flight, and finished with no gain, no loss to front runners. TRUMP'SPRIDE
settled into second flight through the opening bend, rated between rivals along the backstretch, then was vid of a rally in closing stages to improve placing.
VALID FINALE threatened mildly from a wide stance. J BOB was unhurried in the early going, giving chase from a three path pose, tucked to save ground
through the final bend, and was no menace to outcome. TRIPP SETTER travelled extremely wide into the opening turn and never recovered from the lost
ground.

Footnotes
CALEBS TIGER rushed from outset to set the early pace, exchanged command through the first two calls with JEANO, then won the nod at the end of a
lengthy duel with that rival for the honors. JEANO hustled from outset and set the pace in tandem with CALEBS TIGER, locked into a duel with that rival in
the final furlong, and was outnodded by the slimmest of margins at the wire. GRUFFANDTOUGH loomed along the inside and rated well within striking
distance throughout, then was gaining on the leaders and just missed the win by finishing with strong strides three wide in the final sixteenth but the wire
came too soon. EUROEAST settled into second flight as the outer rival of two abreast, stalked the pacesetting duo along the backstretch, rated close up at
upper stretch, then was outfinished by top trio in final furlong. RUNFORUSRUN lacked a closing kick after giving chase from a three path stance and rating
along the inside at upper stretch. GENTLE ROCKET improved placing with late interest after trailing the field in the early going. HEARTASTORMIN failed to
menace. FAMILIAR DREAM was no threat from a back rated position.

Footnotes
J LOVE rated mid pack nearing the half pole, travelled widest of all through the opening turn, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretchby circling
rivals, continued the wide route through the final bend, then secured the victory with the strongest strides of all in final furlong. SHIANNSLANE pressed the
early pace from a two path stance, gained command nearing the quarter pole, led the field at upper stretch, but failed to fend off the rally of eventual winner
in final strides. SEXY SOCKS rated four wide through the opening bend, responded to asking along the backstretch, rated close up between rivals at upper
stretch, then was outfinished by top pair in final sixteenth. ONE FAST CASH rallied mildly to improve placing after travelling wide early. HARLOW'S VISION
gave chase from a two path stance and weakened in the late going. HARPERS VISION lacked a late bid after settling in behind the early front runners and
saving ground. KEEP A PROMISE trekked three wide through the closing turn and was little menace in the outcome. FIRST AT THE SCENE was no threat
from a back rated stance. GO HONEY GO flashed early foot and led the field through the opening quarter before fading rapidly in the late strides. LENA'S
SHADOW trailed the field by a wide margin and was never involved.

QUALITY ROCKET hustled form outset to assume early command, set the early pace in tandem as the outer most rival of three abreast, trekked the two
path along the backstretch, then shook clear of all rivals in final furlong securing the score. TOMMYHAWK rallied along the rail to earn the place after
showing reserve through the opening half. WELDER came up empty and failed to match strides with top pair after rushing from outset and setting the early
pace in tandem with QULITY ROCKET. COWBOY MISCHIEF settled behind the early frontrunners and trekked the two path through the opening bend, was
roused nearing the quarter pole, then finished full of run while gaining on leaders at the finish. KWIK gave a god chase and lacked a rally. WILLY SPECIAL
CATS failed to menace after being unhurried in the early going. A FLICKER OFSILVER pressed the early pace from an inside route then tired quickly in
closing stages.

Footnotes
FETCHUM KETCHUM hustled away from outset, established an inside position, and led every step of the way in a gate to wire victory. STARWARD
pressed the early pace from a two path stance, rated between rivals along the backstretch, backed out nearing the quarter pole, angled out to three wide at
upper stretch and fought back for the place. CATALE STORM showed some hustle in early strides and forced the pace issue as the outer most rival of three
abreast through the opening half, but came up empty in final furlong. INTIMIDATING improved placing with late interest by splitting foes at the eighth pole
after being unhurried early and trailing the field while saving ground through the first bend. ARCHER lacked a rally after settling into mid pack. WITH THE
BAND travelled widest of all around the first turn and weakened in the crucial portion of contest. CELTA VIGO trailed the field early and passed a tiring rival
in late going. MIGHTY BUGSY showed reserve in the opening half and tired in closing strides.
