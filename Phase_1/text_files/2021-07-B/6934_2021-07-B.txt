KHOZYS CROWN unhurried to the turn, angled out for clear run, rallied past and spurted clear. GOOD FAITH pressed pace outside, dueled between turn,
led late outkicked. HALF LEGEND no speed to the stretch, rallied widest while coming on late. ESPECIALLY YOU brief speed inside to turn, backed up to
stretch, came again late. GIRLINTHEFIREPLACE rushed outside to turn three wide, bid quarter pole, flatten out. NATION'S POSSE hustled along from the
gate, speed to quarter pole, weakened late. RED SAPPHIRE off tardy from gate, never menaced thereafter. STARLET WARRIOR through after half,
dropped back. NOBLES FEELINGS never a threat.
