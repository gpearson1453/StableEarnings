Footnotes
CANDY CARLOS stalked the pace outside, bid and led at the quarter pole, moved briefly clear then prevailed in a long drive, returned lame and was vanned
off. WELLING controlled the pace inside, was collared on the final turn then came again just missing in a determined effort. EVEN THUNDER stumbled at
the start, was restrained through the initial three furlongs; angled out in the stretch and went evenly late. OXIDE pursued the pacesetter inside, was asked
for run into the final turn but had no response and faded. CALIFORNIA SWING dropped well behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THAT IS KEY stalked the pace, bid to the front when ready on the final turn, repelled a challenge and drew away under moderate pressure. NURSE
RACHETT settled outside, moved with the winner near the five sixteenths pole but proved no match in the stretch. CAR LADY trailed far behind then passed
rivals without menacing. M. J.'S LADY raced close up in the two path early and weakened steadily. DONNAMEUP saved ground within range for half a mile
and faltered. SMART RED broke awkwardly and was never in contention. KEFALIANI broke slowly and was rank early, rushed wide to the front on the first
turn, led then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
GHOST HUNTER vied inside under rating, took over when ready on the final turn and pulled away strongly through the stretch. DOVER CLIFFS settled
inside, angled out and rallied into the stretch, was no match for the winner but easily second best. DASHING LOU was fanned very wide into the first turn,
stalked wide and weakened. SON OF A SAINT was reserved off the leaders three wide and lacked a solid closing kick. CHATEAU DE VIZILLE dropped to
the back of the pack, was asked for run into the far turn then swung wide into the lane. TOSS was taken up sharply and ducked out into the first turn and
raced wide on both turns. ZAYA dropped back early and was never a factor. ROCK SOLID GOLFER prompted the winner outside to the final turn and
stopped.

BABY CLOUD well placed outside the dueling leaders, bid to the front midway on the turn, quickly pulled clear and was kept to moderate pressure.
WINDRUSH KARMA broke alertly and vied outside, moved inside on the turn and continued gamely for the place. RAPIDAMENTE made a menacing three
wide move on the turn then flattened out. HOLIDAY RAID dropped well behind inside then passed fading rivals. PROMISE OF JOY flashed speed along the
inside and was finished on the turn. EMME ROO chased wide off the pace and weakened steadily.

VANZZY angled over into the first turn, was blocked on the final turn, split foes, into the stretch and gamely prevailed between opponents. ANGELUS
WARRIOR taken up into the first turn, saved ground, angled wide on the final turn, battled the winner but was outfinished. ALWAYSMINING prompted the
pace outside, earned a brief lead into the stretch and continued willingly. SHANE'S JEWEL broke alertly and led inside to the stretch and weakened.
ASPECT trailed inside, moved wider in the stretch closing the gap while no threat. SAND DANCER dropped back early and lacked a solid rally. HONOR
THE FLEET prompted the pace outside then gave way. SARATOGA JACK broke very poorly, rushed wide to contention then stopped. A claim of foul by the
trainer of the runner-up against the winner for interference into the first turn was dismissed. The race was hand timed.

CLOSE SHAVE dueled outside to midstretch then edged away through the final furlong while kept under a drive. MISSION KEY stalked the dueling leaders
three wide, advanced on the turn and was up for the place late. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE vied with the winner in hand early then shortened stride nearing the
eighth pole. AWARD NOMINATED chased close up between rivals then flattened out in the stretch. KODAPENDENT sluggish early, moved up inside then
began fading on the turn. VOLTAMOUR broke poorly, rushed up along the rail then gave way readily.
