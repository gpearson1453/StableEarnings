able to hold the show. TYLER'S ADMIRAL raced back early then angled out at the quarter pole and was in contention at the head of the stretch but failed to

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT KARMA sprinted to the lead and steadily drew off. DENA'S BOLD MOVE raced wide then made a late rally to be up for the place. GEE GEE
tracked the leaders from the inside but was no match for the top two. FLAT OUT FLIRTY chased the leaders then drifted out but was able to improve her
position. FRENCHIE FROU FROU was close up in the two path then gave way in the stretch. SALESGIRL failed to menace. POSSE GONE WILD raced in
the middle of the pack and was not a threat. BAYLOR was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROCK N SAKE was rushed to the lead to draw clear under a drive. HOT APRIORITY trailed the field for three eighths then made a late rally between horses
in the stretch to be up for place. CHEERS TO BERTI raced five wide in the second flight and was up for the show. ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE led early then
faded. FUTURE RULER raced four wide in the second flight and weakened. OUR FREDDIE MAC was not a factor. WONDER RUN raced three wide in the
second flight and gave way.
