WAND OF POWER reluctant to load, showed good early speed racing three wide, dueled two wide on the turn, led into the stretch, responded, drew clear
and was ridden out. MISS YUM YUM chased close up on the rail, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, finished well but second
best. CLASSICAL ROMANCE was bumped at the start, set the pace racing in the two path early, dueled inside of the winner on the turn, weakened in the
lane and held for third. OPENING NIGHT raced off the pace, chased the leaders on the turn, went five wide past the quarter pole and closed belatedly
outside. LADY MOSLER was bumped at the start, outrun early, raced inside in the stretch and failed to threaten. I LOVE MARIA chased outside, went four
wide past the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
LUMINO tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied outside in the final furlong, surged late and was up in time.
REINER pressed the pace in the two path, bid two wide on the far turn, rallied to a short lead in upper stretch, edged away, then drifted out in deep stretch
in front of LARGER THAN LIFE, dug in and was caught at the wire. SPIRITUAL KING set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely on
the rail in the stretch drive and held on for third. LARGER THAN LIFE raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, rallied behind rivals past midstretch,
then was in tight and forced to check sharply in deep stretch. SHALDAG stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, lacked a
rally and weakened. SUPER HOUDINI was forced wide entering the first turn, settled two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. WICKED GRINCH was
steadied leaving the chute, then veered out entering the first turn, settled off the pace and failed to threaten. ENANO dropped far back early. After a
Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of LARGER THAN LIFE against the top two finishers, REINER was disqualified and placed fourth for
drifting out in deep stretch.

D' TIGER LILY stumbled at the start and bumped hard with POWERGIRL, quickly recovered to set the pace, dueled inside on the turn, dug in gamely inside
rivals in the stretch run, edged away and held on determinedly late. TAKEITTOCOMITTEE stalked close up outside, bid two wide on the turn, dueled into
the stretch, dug in gamely between rivals in the final furlong and came up second best. TAFFY CANDY was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside,
chased inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside in the stretch. WILDLY GOOD LOOKIN stalked between rivals, chased
two wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. JOY'S PRIDE raced off the pace, chased on the turn and gained belatedly on the rail.
POWERGIRL was bumped hard at the start, then outrun.

rivals and finished willingly for the win. BLAME THE GODS vied two wide for the early lead, took over on the first turn, showed the way into the far turn, dug
in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive and held on for the place award. JAYDINE vied inside for the early lead, eased back off the pace, tracked inside,
saved ground on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely outside in the final furlong and was outkicked. PEGGY O'PRADO raced off the
pace, three wide on the backside, between rivals on the far turn and lacked a rally. TERPEYE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, moved up four wide at
the five furlong marker, stalked two or three wide, bid on the far turn, then weakened. PATRONA was off a bit slow, moved up five wide at the five furlong
marker, chased three wide on the far turn and faded. RISEN CHANGE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. CONGAREE ROSE raced off the
pace inside and gave way.
