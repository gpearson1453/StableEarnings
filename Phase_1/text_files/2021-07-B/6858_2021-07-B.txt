MATT'S HONEY settled well, took over on the far turn and dug in gamely in the stretch run to hold his stable mate safe. SOCIAL CIRCLE led early, was
headed on the far turn, fought back in the stretch but it was not enough. MEAN ERIKA settled while four wide, advanced on the far turn and stayed on while
three wide in the stretch. FLATOUTANDFOXY never menaced. MOSTLY AWESOME stalked the pace and dropped back on the far turn. BRILLANT MIND
