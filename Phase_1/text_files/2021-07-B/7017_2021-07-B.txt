Footnotes
PRESSURE FRONT was in touch, a factor on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch proved best. RASPBERRY WILD was off the pace, hustled along on
the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. KEEP YOUR SILENCE was unhurried early, moved up on the far
turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. LOADED ONCE MORE tracked the early leader and dueled on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and vied to mid stretch but had nothing
left. MYSTERY DAY was in range but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

CITIZEN'S ARREST was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was up in time. EASY ACCESS set the pace and had a
clear lead on the turn but was caught late. RIVER OF PEARLS was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
needed more. DONT WAKE THE BEAR settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was no real threat. NUDGENUDGEWINKWINK was in range
but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

ACT OF BOB was away alertly, set the pace and with a clear lead on the turn was much the best. THY KINGDOM was well back, saved ground on the turn
and was clearly second best. GLITTER MOUNTAIN stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
evened out. TARA CITIZEN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. SAILIN STREET had no speed,
showed little and from the six path at the top of the stretch was outrun.

CHALDEA was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and angled in in mid stretch to get up in time. TOURIST ATTRACTION was in touch and a factor
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. PLAY IT SMART was away alertly and had a slim lead on the turn
but gave way late. HIDEY HIDEY showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. WILLED was off the pace, trailed the field on
the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. MACHISIMA showed no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the
seven path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. WICKEN CENTS was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch had no kick.
