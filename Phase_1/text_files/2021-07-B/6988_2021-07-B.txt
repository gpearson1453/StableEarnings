HUMBLE BEGINNINGS raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, launched a determined drive and was up
just in time. SEA FRET broke outward, chased into the turn, gained through the stretch but was outkicked late. LITTLE MISS CAT emerged with the lead
mid way through the backstretch and moved clear, was all out through the stretch but failed to contain the top two in the final yards. THE TWELFTH raced in
mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn, rallied gamely on the fence and was gaining to the end. OUTCLASS was herded outward leaving the
gate and settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. BELLASPINA was herded outward leaving the gate and
settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. PESARO, herded outward leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, dropped
back on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. Race times updated after data review.

gave way grudgingly. CARROBIO, bumped by MEET THE TENOR leaving the gate, pressed the early pace, stalked o the turn but lacked a closing
response. MEET THE TENOR was bumped by ADELAIDE COURT at the outset setting up a minor domino reaction, settled off the pace, closed three-wide
late turn then rallied mildly. ABSTEMIOUS hit the gate leaving and settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch and chased to no
avail. SILENT FIRE stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and flattened out. MAGIC CONQUEST pressed
the early pace, dropped back on the turn and did not menace. ADELAIDE COURT broke outward and bumped MEET THE TENOR, gained a short lead,

SEAMIALAUGH was rated off the early pace, closed late turn, rallied determinedly and was up late, driving. HIT AND RUN moved up to duel on the
backstretch, forced the pace on the turn, bid a furlong out, dueled, but the pair was passed by a closer in deep stretch. IS THERE A FOREST moved up to
duel into turn, gained a short lead and set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was joined a furlong out, battled, but was passed late.
DIVINE GENESIS raced in mid pack, chased hard four-wide late turn then closed gamely outside. LA PRINCESSA POLLY raced in mid pack, closed along
the rail through the turn then chased gamely to the end. SUPER DUPER broke outward then showed brief early speed, pressed the pace, came three and
four-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. QUIET ASCOT settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, dropped back late turn
and lacked a rally.

ARTIE'S STORM raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn, rallied outside a rival in the stretch and prevailed under a drive. MEYER showed
brief speed, dropped to mid pack o the turn, closed into the stretch, was all out but was outfinished for the win. WAVE BABY forced the pace, bid late turn,
drew clear upper stretch but was passed by two closers in the final furlong and had to settled to the show. BRITISH ROYALTY broke alertly but outward and
was taken to the rear, was hustled along the rail through the turn, faced traffic through the stretch and no amount of maneuvering could get him to the front.
FIFTH SEASON raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but had no closing response. EXCEED raced in mid
pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS settled in mid pack, was
hustled from the rail on the turn, rallied between foes in the stretch, moved back to the rail and evened out. DANCERS GHOST bumped with TYCOON at
the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then lacked a rally. TYCOON, bumped at the outset, showed speed, set a
pressured pace, was joined late turn and gave way in the stretch.

the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn, chased hard into the stretch and was all out to the wire. BETTER BOOGIE raced in mid pack, saved ground
on the turn then finished under a determined drive. KEEN SAMURAI bumped with MR NARCISSISTIC at the start, forced the pace, led into the turn, dueled
from mid turn but yielded a furlong out. JACOBS CALL settled at the rear early, closed late backstretch, came four and five-wide through the turn, was
widest at the top of the stretch but failed to menace. MR NARCISSISTIC ducked out and bumped a rival at the outset, raced in mid pack, chased two to
four-wide on the turn then evened out in mid stretch. ITMAKESMEWONDER pressed the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn but lacked a

JOLIE OLIMPICA (BRZ) broke on top but was allowed to settle while three wide stalking, bid late on the turn and stuck her head in front turning for home,
grinded into an open lengths lead and was kept to her task to keep a closing rival safe in the final stages. ABSCOND off the pace early, gained ground while
three wide on the turn behind a wall of horses, shifted out to the seven path when turning for home and closed strongly, looking a danger to the winner at
the sixteenth pole but running out of real estate to come up a length short. OUR SECRET AGENT chased in midpack between rivals, angled out from the
two path to the five path turning for home and closed resolutely for the show without threatening the top pair. TAPPITTY TAPPITTY off the pace early,
started to rally gradually from midway on the turn along the inside, drifted off the rail turning for home but dove back to the fence at the three sixteenths and
outfinished the balance with a good run. MERVEILLEUX was three wide chasing in midpack and stayed three wide on the turn, came out into the five or six
path at the top of the lane and mildly rallied down the lane without threatening. HONEY CAKE (IRE) was headstrong on the engine quickly, settled down
somewhat to hang on to the front before being headed by the winner turning for home, staying on gamely to the eighth pole and tired at that point. ABBY
HATCHER (IRE) was herded in by a rival at the start, settled in midpack along the inside, advanced to be in behind the leaders turning for home but tired in
the final furlong. SARATOGA VISION had two beat heading into the turn, rallied into the stretch but stalled at the eighth pole and was never a danger.
ROYAL WEDDING moved up into mid pack while three to five wide on the turn, was widest trying to rally into the stretch but ran out of gas in the final
eighth. CRYSTAL GLACIER was devoid of early foot and far back, came off the inside coming out of the turn with a mild run but could not muster a bid.
SUNSET KISS (GB) midpack early, dropped back before the turn to be at the rear and never entered contention. ANOTHER TIME broke in at the start,
rushed up inside before angling out to be on the flank of the leader into the turn, bid late on the bend but couldn't sustain any bid and retreated down the
lane.

Footnotes
JELGO set a pressured pace, quickened on turn, widened mid stretch and held sway under a drive. BEYOND MY DREAMS pressed the early pace, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch and a good late effort earned the place position. TOURIST'S DREAM stalked the
pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then chased gamely to the wire. BENLION raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn
and finished gamely inside. STAR SCHOLAR settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. WENJACK forced the early pace,
chased three-wide late turn but flattened out in the stretch. PRIDE AND PASSION raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn but lacked a
closing response. DOC FISHMAN settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail late turn, swung out for the drive but his rally stalled. VERRAZANO
LEGACY broke inward then stumbled a few strides later, was hustled two-wide from mid pack on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally.
