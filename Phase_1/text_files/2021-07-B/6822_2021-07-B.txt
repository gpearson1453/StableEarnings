Footnotes
EL FRANCO trailed the field in the two path around the first turn, patiently awaited racing room while saving ground turning for home, tipped five wide in
upper stretch to commence a rally outside of rivals, and drove past the leaders inside the final sixteenth. CANDY CURL showed the way along the inside
into the first turn, vied down the backstretch inside of EYE BLACK after that foe produced a bid, regained an advantage around the far turn, gamely inched a
margin from a group of outer pursuers approaching the furlong pole, but was bested by an outer surging foe in the late stages while holding place. AMES
MISTER pressed two wide around the first turn, backed off from between horses into the backstretch to stalk from the outside, attempted a bid while being
floated four wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival inside the final furlong, then failed to reach place. G FOR GERRY stalked along the
inside, then from the two path around the far turn, but lacked a kick between horses in midstretch, and failed to factor. EYE BLACK gained three wide
around the first turn to vie for the lead outside of CANDY CURL down the backstretch, sustained vying position turning for home, but weakened between
horses in midstretch. ALL REVVED UP saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, attempted a four wide rally around the far turn, but failed to
sustain a bid.

Footnotes
THANOZAPPER bobbled slightly at the start but recovered to press the leader two wide, vied with that foe around the far turn before forging a narrow
advantage at the quarter pole, dueled through upper stretch as his inner counterpart fought on, but edged clear from that foe through the final furlong.
DAME CINCO set the pace along the inside, vied inside of THANOZAPPER around the far turn, dug in entering the lane after being headed, but was bested
by that foe passing the furlong grounds, and safely held place. SOVEREIGN APPEAL settled off of the pace two wide, claimed show from an outer tiring for
entering the lane with multiple lengths to find on the dueling leaders, and chased them home evenly. LENNI BE LUCKY stalked along the inside, got a bit
keen in tight quarters around the first turn, shifted outside of the leading pair with five sixteenths to run, but failed to respond to coaxing, and faded entering
the lane. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN stumbled at the start and trailed the field early, saved ground around the turns, but to no avail. EASYONMYEYES tracked
the pace setters three wide, but came under a drive to keep pace into the far turn, failed to respond, and weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
WARRIOR IN CHIEF broke a bit outwardly, pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as DAVIDIC LINE ranged up along side,
dueled between horses through the lane, forged an advantage under a long drive a sixteenth pole, and held safely from his outer rival late. DAVIDIC LINE
tracked three wide, inched closer turning for home, chased outside of a pair of foes through midstretch, progressed late under a long drive to attempt a bid
approaching the wire, but was fended off. EASTSIDE COOL set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids approaching the quarter pole, resisted well
through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. STRIKING A POSE settled at the rear of the short field two to four wide around the turns, and stayed
on mildly outside of foes late. GIGGING achieved an inside stalking position entering the backstretch, but came under coaxing to keep pace at the five
sixteenths pole, then only managed to chase the leaders through the lane without producing a bid. MAKE NOISE saved ground off of the pace, yet faded.

Footnotes
ANTHROPOLOGY broke a bit outwardly, set the pace along the inside, shifted across a pursuing ON THE RISE's path while inching clear in upper stretch,
but failed to kick on and met that foe's inside bid a sixteenth out, but held to the wire. ON THE RISE pressed the pace setter from the outside, chased
entering the lane, shifted inside of that foe at the furlong grounds after that rival wandered, grinded away to bid in the final sixteenth, but missed.
LEGENDARY GIFT bobbled minorly at the start, tracked the pace three wide, came under a drive to pursue the leading pair into the turn as those foes got
away, but only managed to chase them through the lane while proving best of the rest. RIGHT TRAPPE tracked the pace two wide and from between
horses, but failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, cut the corner turning for home, and kept on for a minor share. PURRFECT LOVE brushed the
gate at the start, lagged well behind the field into the turn, cut the gap while shifting five wide entering the lane, and passed tired foes in the final furlong.
ANNA'S MOONLIGHT was brushed between foes at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor.
PALACE MAGIC took the turn four wide while off of the pace, and never got involved. SPITZ stalked along the inside, but faded while saving ground turning
for home.

GREY STREAK saved ground from midpack, shifted five wide at the quarter pole to circle the leaders entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong pole,
dueled thereafter as THERE GOES HARVARD fought on courageously, and prevailed via a head bob. THERE GOES HARVARD stalked three wide, bid for
the lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage approaching the furlong grounds as GREY STREAK rallied alongside, tenaciously resisted that foe
through the final furlong, but was bested via a head bob on the wire. HARD RYE GUY settled off of the pace two wide, tracked three to four wide around the
far turn, but was outmoved by an outer foe entering the lane, then stayed on through the late stages to claim a minor share. IRONSTONE ROAD trailed,
shifted to the four to five path in midstretch, and improved past tiring foes late. LA LA LAND (IRE) pressed the pace two wide, vied into the backstretch, then
from between horses entering the lane, but faded in midstretch. EL AHIJADO broke inwardly but was clear of inner foes, set the pace inside of a vying LA
LA LAND (IRE), but proved no match for a pair of outer foes at the furlong grounds, and gave way thereafter. SONO GRATO stalked along the inside, but
chased while under a drive around the far turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
BEAVER HAT stalked the leading pair from the three path around the first turn, made an early bid for the lead at the five furlong pole, vied outside of IRISH
UNITY thereafter, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, the drew away from that rival through the final furlong. IRISH UNITY set the pace outside of a
heavily pressing INVENTING BLAME around the first turn, went off after that foe backed off entering the backstretch, vied inside of BEAVER HAT after that
foe bid passing the five furlong marker, but was headed by that rival at the quarter pole, dug in entering the lane, but gave way at the furlong grounds.
SAVVY stalked the pace from the four, then three, paths around the turns, inched closer turning for home, but only managed to chase the leading pair
through the lane. JUNGLE WARFARE trailed along the inside, progressed mildly three wide around the far turn, then stayed on late for a minor share.
AZTEC EMPIRE never got involved. INVENTING BLAME vied along the inside through a quick pace around the first turn, backed off to stalk along the
inside at the five furlong marker, but faded into the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
TURNERLOOSE was off a beat slow, pressed two wide, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and held firm from bidders on both sides. CAILIN DIANA
tracked from midpack three wide, rallied turning for home to bid in midstretch, but was fended off. STEPPER stalked along the inside, attempted a rail bid in
midstretch, but was turned away. SEAL SHIELD set the pace along the inside, but faded between horses approaching the furlong grounds. NANA'S GRAY
lied forwardly placed two wide, but faded turning for home. JOY IN THE BATTLE took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, and failed to make an
impact. EYEOFTHEBEHOLDER never got involved. JOY MOON was pinched back between horses soon after the start, and got outrun. CANDY RAID
broke off a step slowly, then was done early.
