Footnotes
LADY LEBDA broke sharply, made the early pace between rivals, was bumped while moving two wide to reclaim command into the turn, drew clear entering
the stretch and widened under intermittent urging. MYSTERY ITEM moved to a short lead inside the winner before a quarter, bore out into that one entering
the turn then tired. MIRACLES SUNSHINE was slow early, raced widest into the stretch and passed tired ones. SIEGLINDE was caught in tight along the
inside nearing and entering the turn then flattened out once clear. OUR NIKKI L had position three wide between rivals for over a half then stopped.
COUNTESS SHANAKILL advanced four wide on the turn then stopped.

MADE TO HUSTLE made the pace along the rail and held under brisk urging. PRINCESS RUNAWAY pressed two wide and weakened. SONG SAVER
chased the top two, angled to the rail on the turn and lacked the needed closing. TIP TOP TAPPER came out three wide while not far back nearing the
stretch and couldn't gain. KAZ'S PRINCESS broke slowly, lagged inside the final furlong then found best stride too late. CALI DIVINE stayed inside around
the turn and failed to matter. PRETTY PANTS was no factor. MAJESTIC GREELEY wasn't far back inside, came out two wide for room on the turn then
flattened out.

AGAINST THE ODDS was unhurried after a slow break, rallied four wide around the turn, and ran clear late. CUMBERLAND GAP advanced two wide
around the turn, moved to a short lead past midstretch but was little match late. PETTINBERG ducked in leaving the gate, took over soon after, stayed out
from the rail around the turn then weakened. LOVE THAT JAZZ broke slowly, was sent up the inside, steadied in tight entering the turn then fell back. TIZ
SAMURAI wasn't far back to the turn then stopped. IRONBOUND was outrun.
