Footnotes
Z U SOON led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn, drifted out and was in close quarters with POPPY'S BOYS near the sixteenth pole and dueled gamely down the lane to hold the win. POPPY'S
BOYS brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, angled in to save ground around the first turn, raced into traffic and was forced to steady
entering the backstretch, settled off the pace on the inside through the next quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole,
dueled gamely down the stretch while brushing mildly with Z U SOON near the sixteenth pole, and was unable to go by that rival. TALIS PARK GRAD raced
in the three path around the first turn, rated behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn,
swung out to find racing room in upper stretch and chased the frontrunners home, the best of the rest. MAJESTIC DAY trailed the field from the three path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two and three path around the far turn and passed tiring horses
from there. CONVICT PIKE raced in the two path around the first turn, moved up to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle
from the two path around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch and continued to fade down the lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, began to drop
back while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
ISABELLACANNETELLA was placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, opened up when shaken up in upper stretch, and held safe under
a drive. RARE ACTION ATTACK chased the leading pair inside of RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH early, hugged the rail while tracking the leading pair around
the turn, was driven inside into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, got up for place past the sixteenth pole and was gaining to the
wire. LIPLINER was sent for early speed but outsprinted to the lead by ISABELLACANNETELLA, tracked the leader, offered a mild bid in the three path
past the three eighths but could not get to the pacesetter, raced two wide into the lane, continued to lose ground on the pacesetter, and flattened out.
RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH chased the leading pair outside of RARE ACTION ATTACK down the backstretch, continued at the rear of the main group in the
four path on the turn and into the lane, offered mild improvement late but missed the show. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN settled at the rear, trailed in the three
path on the turn and into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, and mustered no rally.

Footnotes
EMINENT VICTOR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began an outside bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole, gained ground in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. SWOONATRA led the field on the inside in the
early going, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn, was caught with a furlong to go and chased the eventual winner home, the best of the
rest. SUMMER BELLE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the three
sixteenths pole and improved position late from the rail. FREEDOM ROSE pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, dueled for the lead from
the two path around the turn and could not go with the top two in the stretch while finishing evenly. MISS RAISON veered in slightly leaving the gate, settled
off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, swung out entering the stretch and gained ground mildly on
the outside late. WINGSPUN tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was outkicked entering the
stretch. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE hopped up leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the two path, drifted
in in upper stretch and was empty from there. LADY BERNADETTE was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field from the rail up the backstretch and
around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. MASTERFUL MISTRESS dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the three path around the turn, gave way nearing the five sixteenths pole and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
CORE VALUES was lightly bumped by DOUBLE BLESSED in the opening strides, chased two wide toward the rear through the clubhouse turn and into the
backstretch, split horses near the half to take closer order but settled back again to chase two wide through the far turn, was driven three deep into the lane,
angled slightly further out and continued to rally five wide, fought on outside of FLOWN in the final furlong and got up in the final jumps. FLOWN was
anxious in the gate, settled near the rear inside, continued patiently approaching the far turn as other horses began to make bids, raced in second last in the
two to three path on the tar turn, was urged between horses into the lane, continued to rally four wide through midstretch, got up to the lead at the sixteenth,
ran on inside of CORE VALUES but was caught in the shadow of the wire. DOUBLE BLESSED came in and lightly bumped CORE VALUES in the opening
strides, settled at the rear, saved ground through the far turn while pushed along came into the lane along the rail, angled out six wide in upper stretch,
improved under a drive, found her best with a sixteenth remaining and got up in time for the show. SPRITZ was sent for pace but outsprinted to the lead by
BIG BAND LUZZIANN, switched out to prompt outside that foe into the clubhouse turn, tracked behind her into the backstretch, encroached again into the
far turn, tracked as that one inched clear again around the bend, came into the lane between horses, led approaching the furlong mark, was headed at the
sixteenth and caught for the show. POSTNUP chased the leading pair inside of FOREVER BOSS, took closer order inside into the far turn, chased while
saving ground around that bend, was driven up the rail into the lane, went two wide to get around the fading BIG BAND LUZZIANN and was outfinished
between horses late. FOREVER BOSS tracked the leading pair two wide, took closer order four wide into the far turn, was urged three wide for a bid on the
far turn and continued three wide in range into the lane, was outkicked by SPRITZ approaching the furlong mark and outfinished between horses. BIG
BAND LUZZIANN was reluctant to load, raced keenly to the lead, was pressured by SPRITZ into the far turn, cleared approaching the three quarters, began
to take pressure again into the far turn but inched clear briefly again in the two path, was swarmed approaching the furlong mark and weakened.

PACKED HOUSE was urged to the lead right out of the gate, showed the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to open
up on the field while saving ground around the far turn, and drew off down the lane to win handily, much the best. GALAHAD KID saved ground around the
first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position from the three path around the far turn and continued to gain ground on the outside
while proving to be no match for the winner. ROAR OF THE LION raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch at the back of the
pack, began to move up from the three path while racing around the far turn and continued to gain ground from there, while never threatening the winner.
VENETIAN DREAM saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back slightly while racing on the rail
around the far turn, and came on again in the stretch to improve position late. RIVER FINN chased the leader from the three path around the first turn and
up the backstretch, moved up to challenge headed into the far turn, raced in the two and three path from there and weakened in the final furlong. BORA
BORA saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn and was outkicked in the stretch. RENEGADE BOB raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack,
navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. CHAPEL BARN raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the frontrunner between
horses up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired on the rail in the stretch. MANGO TREE raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, raced in the three and four path around the far turn, swung wider still
entering the stretch and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
BIZZEE CHANNEL tracked the leading pair, was keen inside into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader inside of BETWITHBOTHHANDS through the
clubhouse turn, continued to track the leading pair down the backstretch and while saving ground through the far turn, bid inside of TWO EMMYS into upper
stretch, led approaching the furlong mark and held sway to the wire. TWO EMMYS eased to the lead about a furlong from the gate, cleared into the
clubhouse turn, took mild pressure from BETWITHBOTHHANDS into the backstretch, edged clear again into the far turn, set the pace in the two path
through that bend and into the lane, was confronted by BIZZEE CHANNEL to his inside in upper stretch and headed approaching the furlong mark, kept on
willingly under a drive but was not able to retake the lead. ANOTHER MYSTERY chased two wide down the stretch for the first time, continued to chased
the leading trio through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took closer order outside of BIZZEE CHANNEL approaching the far turn, chased three
wide through the far turn and into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair from upper stretch but chased on clearly best of the rest.
BETWITHBOTHHANDS came away sharply, was keen when passed by TWO EMMYS about a furlong into the race, tracked the pace two wide through the
clubhouse turn, edged forward to put mild pressure on TWO EMMYS into the backstretch, was pushed along between horses through the far turn, went to a
drive between horses into the lane and flattened out. ZULU ALPHA chased inside of ANOTHER MYSTERY the first time down the backstretch, settled back
second last to run through the first turn, angled four wide while still racing second last down the backstretch, took closer order approaching the far turn,
raced in the three path around that bend, was driven approaching the quarter pole, and came up empty from upper stretch. CAPTIVATING MOON settled
patiently at the rear, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter, swung to the eight path at the head of the
stretch, and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
NAVAL LAUGHTER tracked behind the leading flight down the backstretch, continued to track that leading line outside of JOY EPIFORA through the
clubhouse turn, down the backstretch, and in the three path through the far turn before angling out four wide near the five sixteenths for a bid outside that
line, drifted out in upper stretch while continuing to rally under a drive, led past the furlong mark, veered inward late while clear but nonetheless held safe.
JOY EPIFORA (ARG) chased behind NAVAL LAUGHTER down the stretch for the first time, tracked the leading flight inside of that foe through the
clubhouse turn and down the back straight, chased that flight in the two path on the far turn, was taken six wide into upper stretch and carried further out
when NAVAL LAUGHTER drifted out in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, and was gaining on the winner late. BRAMBLE QUEEN settled toward the rear
of the main group inside, edged closer to the first two flights inside past the five eighths, saved ground around the far turn, swung three wide into the lane,
rallied, split horses approaching the furlong mark, kept on willingly but was ultimately outkicked. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN settled toward the rear, raced
inside of CURLY WURLY through the clubhouse turn, continued at the rear of the main field down the back straight, improved in the two path around the far
turn while still racing inside of CURLY WURLY, swung out six wide under a drive into upper stretch, and rallied to prove best of the rest. BREEZE RIDER
prompted the pace three wide, began to vie for the lead from the quarter pole and into the lane, proved no match for NAVAL LAUGHTER from the furlong
mark and flattened out late. TWO SIXTYONE came away quickest, set the pace inside while pressured by FAMILY WAY and BREEZE RIDER, was headed
by BREEZE RIDER at the quarter, kept on to vie for the pace inside until midstretch, and weakened inside through the final furlong. FAMILY WAY was keen
to prompt the pace outside of TWO SIXTYONE, attended the pace between horses, was driven between horses into upper stretch, continued to attend two
wide between horses to the furlong mark and weakened. RUSSIAN MAFIA settled in second last well behind the main flight but still ahead of PYTHONESS,
took closer order approaching the far turn, raced in the two path around that bend, went to a drive when swung three wide into the lane, but lacked the
needed finishing kick. CURLY WURLY settled toward the rear, raced three wide around the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, took closer order past
the five eighths outside of BRAMBLE QUEEN, raced in the three path outside of ENJOYITWHILEWECAN on the far turn, swung five wide to upper stretch
and came up empty. OH SO TERRIBLE settled toward the rear of the main pack into the first turn, raced between horses down the backstretch and into the
far turn, was driven between horses toward the rear around the far turn, swung out four wide into upper stretch under a drive and made no bid.
PYTHONESS settled at the rear, made a brief three wide bid into the far turn, was driven in the four path on that bend but came up empty past the three
eighths.
