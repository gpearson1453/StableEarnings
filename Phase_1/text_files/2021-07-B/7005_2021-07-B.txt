GALLINIPPER assumed the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, pulled away through the stretch and was under urging until allowed to relax late.
CLEVER AND GREAT , outside the winner, chased that one to the stretch then weakened. STAND MY GROUND lacked speed, was four deep leaving the
far turn and passed tired horses. PAT'S FACTOR advanced along the inner rail leaving the backstretch and gave way leaving the far turn. FUSED , steadied
in traffic entering the first turn, raced outside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn then faltered. MO AMERICAN was outrun.

Footnotes
ANTIPOISON secured the inside and the lead soon after the start, set a rate pace, dug in when confronted past the three eighths, dueled, briefly shook back
clear with a furlong to go, kept on tenaciously under solid handling and prevailed. RIP IT relaxed in range and off the inside, moved up three wide leaving
the far turn and engaged the winner, forced the issue outside of that one from there but just could not get past. RUSH DELIVERY (IRE) , unhurried early
while saving ground, continued inside and steadily progressed past the eighth pole, angled out with a sixteenth to go and closed willingly to gain.
UNORTHODOX broke a bit slowly, recovered and advanced off the rail around the first turn, moved closer past the five sixteenths, chased into the lane then
flattened out. BROADWAY MELODY rated forwardly while saving ground, got through and had aim into the lane, chased and faded. IRISHMAN , taken to
rate early, chased two wide leaving the far turn but failed to kick on through the drive. WEBB angled in early and settled well back, continued inside into the
stretch but failed to rally. FAX failed to menace. LE PEACE TREATY rushed up early, prompted the winner two wide, was under a drive trying to keep pace
past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on and faltered through the final three sixteenths.

Footnotes
SMITTEN ENOUGH dueled inside, shook clear under a drive leaving mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. GLEAMING SWORD broke a bit slowly,
recovered and was hustled up to contention, advanced inside nearing the quarter pole, angled out, ranged up in mid strecth and kept on gamely to just miss.
HAIR OF THE DOG dueled outside the winner, kept up the battle pats the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly through the final sixteenth. LOST UNCLE
rated outside a rival, shifted out four wide into the lane and had belated interest. FLASH IS BACK saved ground in mid pack, eased out to the two path in
upper stretch and continued willingly. PAPA LEW , off slowly, lagged well back while saving ground into the turn, stayed inside from there and offered a late
run. LIL MAJESTY , rank at the beak, dropped in early, came out around the turn, circled four to five wide and had a mild gain. RAVEN RAHY chased the
dueling leaders three wide and gave way in the drive. BALTIMORE BUD had speed then was rated back off foes after a furlong, angled out around the turn,
chased four wide and gave way. DIVINE PROPORTION lacked speed, raced four wide mid turn and failed to menace. IRISH LION bobbled at the break,
was in close soon after and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
AMEN CORNER , inside horses leaving the backstretch, worked his way between rivals on the turn, was taken to the four path at the head of the lane,
closed outside horses, led near the sixteenth pole and drew out. FRANKEE MERCH , quickly clear, set the pace in the two path around the turn, remained
off the rail in the stretch and was out finished. FAST CASH , kept four deep on the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home and passed faders.
DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE prompted the pace three wide around the turn and weakened the final furlong. TRUTH SERUM , rated along the inner rail down
the backstretch, remained along the rail on the turn and was not a factor. SWING YOUR SWORD , snugly rated down the backstretch, raced along the inner
rail around the turn and weakened.

POLISHED GAL , four wide early, dropped in with an aggressive move leaving the far turn, quickly gained while saving ground heading to the quarter pole,
swung back out to be about five wide in upper stretch, sustained under a drive and forged past embattled rivals in the final strides. BUFF'S IN LOVE tracked
a contested pace three wide, bid nearing mid stretch, vied through the final furlong and stayed well while nabbing the place. LADY MAGICA was hustled to
the front, set a pressured pace inside, dueled from mid turn to the final yards and gave way grudgingly. EIFS , away alertly, disputed the pace outside LADY
MAGICA, applied more pressure mid turn, sparred between runners leaving the eighth pole and kept on with interest. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) stalked
inside, eased out for the drive, moved up past the sixteenth pole but was out finished. BUSTIN HEARTS stumbled at the break and failed to menace.
ALGODONAL steadied at the break, steadied while towards the inside entering the turn then failed to make a serious recovery. PRINCESS KILLMAIN , off
the pace, angled five wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. CATERINA ONE , three to four wide, angled in around the turn and lacked a bid. TAKE
CHARGE TINA drafted back inside, steadied into the turn, rated behind rivals then steadied in upper stretch. R TRUE SENSATION chased off the rail and
weakened through the drive. BODES SUNSET was outrun.

Footnotes
CLOSER LOOK , reluctant to load into the starting gate, assumed the early lead, hugged the inner rail and eagerly pulled away through the stretch while
kept to his business. MY GOOD MAN lacked speed, raced near the inner rail down the backstretch and into the far turn, angled out mid way on the bend,
was fanned four deep turning for home and passed tired rivals. WEATHER WIZ stalked the pace, raced in the two path between horses entering the stretch
and weakened. CLUBMAN , along the inner rail throughout, retreated through the stretch. SOLOMONIC chased the pace outside the winner and gave way.
ROUGH SEA was outrun.

Footnotes
ALLURING RUMBA prompted the pace two to three wide outside DEW DAT, moved alongside in upper stretch, dueled, gained a slim lead inside the eighth
pole, wandered outward, was corrected with right handed stick work and dug in to prevail. LOVE DUST , off slowly, gathered momentum while under
pressure off the rail leaving the three eighths marker, circled five wide into the lane and finished well to gain. DEW DAT sped to the front, set a pressured
pace inside, raced two wide into the lane, dueled from the three sixteenths and stayed on well. FIELD TRUFFLE , two wide chasing the pace, angled out in
upper stretch but lacked a serious response. BROADWAY TROUPER , three to four wide, chased to mid turn then gave way. LADY TIZMO saved ground
with pursuit, failed to go on leaving the three eighths and retreated.
