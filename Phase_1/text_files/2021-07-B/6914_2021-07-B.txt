Footnotes
CAYMAN ISLAND was never far back in the three path, quickly rallied clear leaving the furlong grounds and held under urging. ROYAL KAZ showed speed
outside, moved two wide to command just after a half but was little match in the drive. NIGHTENFORD KAZ advanced in the four path around the turn then
weakened in the lane. READTHETRANSCRIPT made the early pace along the rail and faded through the lane. PEG'S WHITE SOCKS broke slowly and
steadily lost ground.
