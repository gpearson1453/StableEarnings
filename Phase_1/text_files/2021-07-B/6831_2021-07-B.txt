MR. PICKLES settled at the rear of the field, was three then four wide on the second turn, mounted a bid in the stretch and confronted and quickly passed
the runner-up with a late kick to prevail. DEALERS HAND sat just off of the early pace, mounted a bid on the second turn to take the lead while four wide,
led into the stretch but was outkicked by the winner while a clear second over the rest. TIME IS GONE set contested fractions through the second turn, was
confronted by the runner-up on that turn and gave up the lead, chased the leader off of the turn and tired in the stretch run. DI LAURIAN contested the early
pace with TIME IS GONE, saved ground on the second turn while two wide, but was outrun off the turn and weakened in the stretch drive.

stretch to prevail. STARS OF BLUEGRASS prompted the pace by the winner, was three wide on the second turn and was outfinished by the winner while
holding for second. MADE IN KAROO was unhurried early then chased the leaders through the backstretch and second turn while four wide, gained ground
on the second turn but finished evenly in the stretch run while pressuring the runner-up for the place. RUNNIN DIVA sat just off of the early pace, was two
wide on the second turn while losing ground and did not rally in the stretch drive. ROUGE BOUQUET had no speed in the early going, trailed through the

MR. TOUCHE set the early fractions through the turn while being pressured, turned away EL BEAUTIFUL into the stretch and kicked clear in the end to
prevail. SCRATCHY APACHE settled in the midflight, was four wide on the turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch to be second best. ELUSIVE
VIRTUE settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground in the two path along the turn, gained ground into the stretch but finished evenly in the stretch
drive. EL BEAUTIFUL pressed the winner on the front end through the turn, was outrun off of the turn and was tiring in the stretch while running on the left
lead. RISE UP MOSCOW had no early speed, was three wide on the turn and was not a threat. SILLY IMAGE broke last of the field, was pulled up soon
after the start, was eased and walked off.

AFTER SUNDOWN sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn and continued with that bid to challenge the
runner-up in the final sixteenth, dug in and held the ALL MY HOPE at bay to prevail. ALL MY HOPE contested the early pace with WAHASHA while three
wide, led into the lane but was confronted in the late stages and could not hold off the winner while besting the rest. WAHASHA set the pace through the
turn while saving ground, relented the lead to ALL MY HOPE off of the turn and tired in the stretch run. BRITE TAN had no speed early, was five wide on the
turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch run. LA CROIX settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch
run.

the head nod at the end to prevail. STRIKE IT LUCKY sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn while gaining ground, continued that bid in the
stretch and was just nipped at the finish while a clear second over the rest. RICKEY B broke sharply and set the pace through the turn while two wide, was
caught in the stretch but held on for the show. ECOLOGIST had no speed in the early going, was four wide on the turn, shifted out in the stretch and made a
late bid but was not challenging the leaders. WHOA BUDDY stalked the pace through the turn while three wide but weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
GEM STATE set all of the fractions through the second turn while three wide and while coming back a bit to the field in the end was clear at the finish.
LINGUA FRANCA stalked the pace, was four wide on the second turn and rallied in the stretch run to get second, but was not challenging the winner.
TYLER'S TEK sat just off of the winner's fractions while saving ground, mounted a bid on the second turn but finished evenly in the stretch, just missing for
the place. EARNEST was unhurried in the early going, was five wide on the second turn and did not offer a rally in the stretch drive. KNOWN was hustled in
the early going to prompt the pace by GEM STATE, was five wide on the second turn, lost ground off of the turn and gave way in the stretch run.
IMPERATOR was fractious in the gate, chased the pace for a half-mile, stopped, was eased and walked off.
