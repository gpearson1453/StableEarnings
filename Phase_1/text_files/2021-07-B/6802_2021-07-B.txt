Footnotes
LADY PREACH sharp from the gate, set all pace to widen each call while ridden out with rider peeking back in the stretch run with nothing coming. CAJUN
DELIGHT broke terrible, rushed inside to chase runaway winner and proved no match while best of the rest. OMI TEN unhurried to the turn, floated out
widest to improve for show spot. HIDDEN DREAMS urged on to turn, floated widest into stretch while no real threat. ROYAL ATHENA chased monster to
turn, could not keep up and backed up readily. BRODY'S GIRL never a menace. PERFECTNESS outrun. BRINCA BRINCA chased winner to turn, threw in
the towel and backed up.
