Footnotes
PHONEMYPOSSEAGAIN broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through deep stretch to win going away while setting a new track record.
DIONYSUS' CHALICE angled out at the start, was put to a right handed whip, closed late past mid track and got up for second. DAMA LEONA chased and
went evenly. MY VICTAURUSECRET close early, faded. CATS VALENTINE was no factor. TIKA broke awkwardly and never threatened.

Footnotes
BIG OHIO trailed into the stretch, closed willingly along the rail, shifted two wide late, surged and got up in the final strides. REANIMATE bumped at the
start, set the early pace from the three path, remained in control near the inside and was caught in the final stage. CHARLEE'S MAGIC was in tight along
the inside near the five eighths pole, checked and altered course three wide then came on again late in a game effort. OAKEN failed to menace. TIGER
TRAIL saved ground through the turn, shifted out to the four path brushing FIREUPTHEJET entering the stretch, closed to the furlong marker then faded.
ROLLIN WAY OVER bumped at the start and was no threat. FIREUPTHEJET was in tight soon after the start, shifted two wide, prompted the pace into the
stretch, was brushed nearing the three sixteenths pole then gave way late. THE STEWARDS OPOSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WOLFINE with the second flight tow wide, shifted four wide nearing the stretch, was forced out to the seven path, drew on even terms for the lead before
the furlong marker and proved best by the narrowest of margins under a hand ride. SUSIE'S KID never far back, rallied five wide in the eight path into the
stretch, gained a slight lead before the furlong marker then just failed. BISCUITS AND GRITS stalked the pace from the inside, angled out three wide past
the quarter pole, loomed boldly then was outfinished. BIG ON BIG pressed the pace two wide for a half, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch,
remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened. ACCURATE was no factor. DOCSLUCKYCAT was hustled up the inside to set a pressured pace
into the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. SOMETHING SACRED was outrun.

LOLA LOUISE contested the lead along the rail the entire trip, was brushed near the furlong marker, dug in under a hand ride, drifted out late bumping the
runner up and proved best in a game effort. EASTER PRIDE dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit under right handed urging brushing
the winner, was bumped by that one nearing the wire and just missed. J J'S FANCY well placed, went evenly in the four path. LEMON SLUSH failed to
menace. MIZZEN SPOILS stalked the pace into the turn then MYSTIC MAGIC trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER
OF EASTER PRIDE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LOLA LOUISE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW
THE STEWARDS DISUQALIFIED LOLA LOUISE AND PLACED HER SECOND.
