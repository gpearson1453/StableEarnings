Footnotes
ORNERY AS HELL rushed form outset and established a ground saving stance, led the field through the bend and finished under a stiff drive to hold off the
late charge of JITTERY TOM , who closed with a rush after settling in behind the front runner and saved ground around the bend. LANG'S FIR DOLL
pressed the pace from a two path pose, rated close up at upper stretch, and was outdueled for the place. DESK POP lacked a needed rally after giving
chase from a three wide stance through the turn. SMALL TOWN BIG MAN trailed throughout.
