SPITTIN HAVOC dueled between horses to late stretch and inched away to prove best in a long drive. KING PARKER dueled three across to late stretch,
couldn't match strides with the winner and finished second best. MR VIEW was off a step slowly, was unhurried and settled off the pace, was roused on the
turn and closed to get up for show. ALBANY FRONT trailed the field while racing outside, went widest in the drive, finished well and gained late.
GEORGIAN ROAD dueled inside to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and dropped back. Hand timed.

OUT FOR JUSTICE set a pressured pace and held on gamely. DESERT BLACK went five wide on the first turn, pressed the pace, went willingly to the wire
and didn't have enough late to get by the winner. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE was in tight entering the first turn, saved ground to the second turn, angled out,
offered a mild bid, hung late and settled for show. STARSHIP CHEWY raced within striking distance and lacked the needed late response. ZERO SUM
GAME was in tight entering the first turn, raced close to the pace outside, fell back and had nothing left for the drive. JEN'S BIG O trailed the field and
lacked a response. Hand timed.

command along the backstretch, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, faltered near the eighth pole and held safely for show. MS MICHELLE
moved up inside to press the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. I'M ALL THE JEDI vied between horses early, fell back and angled out to race

CALL WAITING set a pressured pace to the turn, inched clear and held under steady urging. PAITASKA stalked the pace, lacked the needed late rally and
finished second best. ALL I CAN SAY was never far off the pace, closed willingly and got up late for show. VODKA TWIST pressed the pace, challenged for
the lead on the turn, fell back and finished evenly. SOUTH FRESNO broke slowly and passed tiring rivals. DIVINE BLESSING advanced along the rail on
the turn to get within range, stopped and was not urged thereafter. TWITTERATI was through early. AIDAN'S HARBOR failed to contend. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LOOSE DIAMOND broke slowly and was crowded after the start, steadily advanced while racing outside and drew off in the drive. STEPHEN JAMES was
never far back, rallied outside on the turn, bid willingly and was no match for the winner. BREWERY GULCH bumped after the start, set a pressured pace to
the turn, drew off, weakened in the drive and faded. EL PATRON JET stalked the pace, was roused on the turn, bid and came up empty. KISS ME D ORO
bumped after the start, pressed the pace three across, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and gave way. MORE FIREWATER came out and
bumped after the start, pressed the pace while racing along the inside and gave way on the turn. EZ RULER was not a factor. HIGH FLYIN TIGER trailed
the field and showed little. Hand timed.
