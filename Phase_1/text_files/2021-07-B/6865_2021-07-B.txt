Footnotes
SING N SPURS sped to the lead while angling to the rail in early stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, then grudgingly held ANGEL'S
MAGIC through the stretch to narrowly prevail under right handed pressure. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages,
was prompted between foes to challenge the pacesetter racing through the turn, continued with a steady effort to close the gap in late stages but couldn't
gain even terms with the winner. SHAQ'S MY DADDY, urged along three wide between foes into the turn pursuing the pacesetter, continued in that path to
late stages but lacked the needed final kick. EYES FLYING BYE broke awkwardly losing position to the field, switched outside foes to race four wide into the
turn and continued in that path gaining position to the end. DARK LEOPARD made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide through the backstretch to the turn
and gave way into the lane. DA GHOST settled into stride a bit off the inside but failed to menace. LAST BITA GLITTER, going erratically from the outset,
was taken up by his rider after the opening furlong and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
ICE POP broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, turned back a rival's challenge midway through the
turn, shook clear through upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. LULUMARU was rated between foes just off the pacesetter in the opening
stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn and continued with interest inside foes to prove best of the others. M AND M GIRL tracked just off the
pacesetter along the inside in the opening quarter, conceded some position while switching off the inside on the turn, then split foes racing into the lane to
gain position in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR settled off the second flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide
entering the lane and made an effort to gain some position. FLAN was taken under firm rating to race off the second flight in the opening quarter, switched
outside foes to make some brief progress three deep racing into the the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. BINDING TIME, in touch with the leaders four
wide in early stages, shifted inwards on the turn to press the pace outside the eventual winner to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker.
SUMMER LOVIN settled along the inside early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GRAVES MILL ROAD was urged to terms with the first flight racing four wide between foes into the first turn, lost some position while bearing out markedly
racing past the six furlong marker, was collected to advance four wide into the second bend, wrested the advantage midway through that bend, shifted
inwards under pressure racing into the lane but remained clear under firm right handed pressure. A ROSE FOR RAVEN, bumped at the start, was caught
seven wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to terms with the first flight, eased off those foes to track off the first flight outside foes entering the
backstretch, moved to challenge outside the leader nearing upper stretch, angled in sharply racing past the three sixteenths marker to bid inside the winner
but proved only second best. FLIMFLAM MAN broke out bumping A ROSE FOR RAVEN at the start, was held up off the leaders between foes racing to the
backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn and steadily gained position four wide into the lane. FALLEN EMPIRE, caught six wide between
foes racing into the first turn, was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters midway through the first turn, then again nearing the backstretch, settled in the last
flight to the far turn, then angled five wide in the closing stages while making an effort to regain some position. TWISTED DIXIE, hopped, then was cut off at
the start, tracked the leaders inside foes to the backstretch, gained contention along the rail nearing the second bend, was shuffled back avoiding a tiring
rival entering the far turn, then shifted out to race between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final response. CREATIVE MIND was urged
between foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. EPIC ADVENTURE vied for command three wide between
foes from the break racing to the backstretch and gave way on the far turn. SEATTLE SEE YA ducked out at the start, was urged inside rivals disputing the
pace into the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn. UNBRIDLED BAYOU, urged to contend five wide between foes into the first turn, dropped
out early and was gathered up while losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
MO CLARE'S broke readily, was urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gained a clear advantage while angling to the inside, set the
pace to the second bend, was headed nearing upper stretch but produced a solid second effort to regain the advantage in the closing stages under firm
handling to prevail. MIZZANNA tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half while being
prompted to terms with the pacesetter on the far turn, pressed the issue to strike the front racing into the lane but couldn't contain the winner's late bid.
MARTZ'S MAE settled between rivals in early stages, switched outside foes to race five wide through the backstretch, then continued three deep through
the far turn to late stages while prevailing for a share. PRETTY IN PINK, urged inside the eventual winner prompting that rival's pace into the first turn,
tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn, shifted out nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes late. SHABAM, reserved while
angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, swung out six wide entering the lane and made some
belated progress. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB), reserved along the inside in the opening half, awaited an opening racing into the far turn, shifted out to
race between foes into the lane but had no rally. MONGOLIAN LOTUS settled near the inside early, shifted out on the backstretch to make brief progress
three wide between foes after a half but came up empty in the drive. DAIGLE tracked the pace outside foes in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief
bid nearing the far turn, angled to the inside on the second bend and faded into the lane. DEPUTY DORA settled outside foes in the last flight to the
backstretch and failed to menace. SUPERSTAR BEA tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and retreated early. WILLING TO
BURN tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane. BENTLEY'S DREAM angled inwards to track
off the second flight between foes but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MYNAMEIS PRINCE tracked off the second flight in early stages, made a steady advance on the pacesetter three wide on the turn to take over nearing
upper stretch and kicked away from the field under firm encouragement. TOP DOG tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, shifted out four
wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. NATURAL CHILL tracked the pacesetter outside a rival racing through the
backstretch, was urged to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but couldn't match the winner. SAHM TEQUILA, off a step slowly, gained position along
the inside racing into the turn, shifted out to split foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SOTA KING, a bit reluctant to load, hopped at the
start, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out in the closing stages while making an effort to gain some position late. BOOM TRUCK, caught in close
quarters, then carried out at the start, angled to the inside racing into the turn and made an effort to improve position. HOT ARTIE sprinted to the lead along
the rail, set the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn and gave out once headed nearing upper stretch. RUBY'S RED DEVIL, shuffled a bit avoiding
close quarters at the start, never gained contention. BIG BOY MCCOY never seriously menaced. JEROMIEO angled to the inside racing through the
backstretch but proved no factor. WARBUCKS ducked out early and soon dropped out. ROVERTON angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of
the second flight but emptied out early. HONEY'S COWBOY SOX ducked in at the start and was soon outdistanced.

DODROPIN angled sharply to the inside in the opening stages tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, made a steady advance just off the rail
racing into upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter and narrowly prevailed between foes in an all out drive. HUNTER'S MAGIC angled to the rail in early
stages, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch to bid inside foes for command in the last furlong but was outkicked. JUST PLAIN PRETTY, reserved
in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn, shifted out to split foes four wide in the closing stages but continued willingly to close the gap while
prevailing narrowly for a share. CHARLIES MISSILE, forwardly placed along the inside racing into the turn, inherited the lead nearing upper stretch, drifted
out leaving the furlong marker and failed to sustain her momentum. LEFT OF CENTER settled off the second flight between foes in early stages, shifted out
five wide racing into the lane steadily gaining contention but was outkicked. DUSTY FORD sprinted clear of the field through the backstretch, bore out
markedly racing through the turn and gave way. REESE C tracked off the second flight four wide in early stages and never gained contention. I CAME TO
SHAME threw her head at the start while breaking slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. ALL SING BABY, caught four wide in second flight tracking the
pacesetter in the opening stages, soon emptied out. HONORS HONOR was urged three wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter, bore out entering the
turn and quickly came up empty.

SAMURAI CAUSE angled to the rail in early stages dropping well off the second flight, saved ground on the turn while making steady progress, came
through inside the pacesetter to wrest command leaving midstretch and went clear under firm left handed pressure. SHIP IT RED was urged to force the
pace outside a rival in the opening stages, shook clear on the turn, held sway off the rail to midstretch but was collared late. DRIED PEPPER tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. GOT EVEN SMARTER
tracked off the second flight in early stages, angled five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain position. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN, held up
between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to split foes near the inside leaving the turn, shifted out three wide midstretch and continued to improve
position. PLEASE THE COURT settled along the rail in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out to pass some tiring rivals late. SO
ALIVE, a bit outpaced outside foes racing to the turn, never menaced. FENDER BENDER was off slowly, then angled seven wide racing into the lane and
made no impact. BAYOU GEM stumbled at the start, settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat. TAPPED TO THE MAX tracked the
pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight in early stages, continued three wide between foes into the lane and steadily faded late. SORRISO, urged
along the inside disputing the pace, gave way between foes racing through the stretch. PINTXOS tracked off the second flight five wide racing to the turn
and steadily faded nearing the lane. CRIME SPREE dropped out early.

WILD BEHAVIOR broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage three deep between foes through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the
turn, held sway on a clear margin into the lane and gamely held D C HERO to the end under firm handling. The latter raced in touch with the pacesetter four
wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the lane and made a steady late gain to challenge the winner while just outkicked. SOUL READY
tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside a tiring foe on the turn and continued with interest between foes to
prevail for a share. MISTER NOT FUNNY settled along the inside in early stages, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and made some mild
progress late. OLD INDIAN TRICK tracked the pacesetter between foes as part of the second flight racing into the turn and steadily weakened in late
stages. CAN IMAGINE tracked off the second flight outside foes, was fanned four wide into the stretch and made no real impact. HENRY O'HENRY, urged
to prompt the pace inside the leader racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, shifted inwards on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
CZECHMIGHT was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch but held sway through the lane under firm
encouragement to prove best. JIMMY'S MARCO, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, was urged to close the gap
racing into upper stretch, shifted about under pressure and proved only second best. SIDE STREET DAVE, urged to contend three wide between rivals
racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards on the far turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. ZORICH, urged four wide between foes
through the first turn to the backstretch tracking just off the leaders, was prompted to make some brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but faded
in the drive. LOVE MY BOSS settled last to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes nearing the far turn, swung to the four path nearing
upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. DYRDEK, reserved along the inside early, never gained contention. J P'S PRIDE (IRE) angled to the
inside tracking just off the first flight in the opening half but gave way racing into the far turn. ROCKTHEPULPIT, caught five wide racing into the first turn,
dropped back early. TALKIN MALICE, FRACTIOUS IN THE POST PARADE, DISLODGED HIS RIDER AND RAN LOOSE, NECESSITATING HIS LATE
SCRATCH.
