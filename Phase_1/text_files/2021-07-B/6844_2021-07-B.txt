Footnotes
NEW EVERY MORNING sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. DOUBLE PERFECTION was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid. LAGO DE ORO
tracked the winner from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, failed to gain on the winner late but finished willingly. LINCHTOWN was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. GABBY TOM was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did
not menace. HAVE NO DOUBT showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach contention.

OUR LYLA GRACE was off a step slow and bumped, rushed to vie with IN THE VAULT, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and drew off through
the final yards. IN THE VAULT was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner but
yielded to that rival through the final furlong. UNSINKABLE MOLLY B showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady
bid. NOOSITA settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed closing response. FASTINASTORM was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was eased through the lane.

TEMPLE SECRET broke sharply to press the pace of ICE NEEDS WHISKEY while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run
and was going away late. ICE NEEDS WHISKEY bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when
challenged by the winner but could not match strides through the closing yards. WHISKEY NOT WINE was reserved just off the leaders from between foes,
angled in nearing the quarter, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. FRANKS FIX IT chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in
the drive. SHORT CUT was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DARK N' HANDSOME
was off slow, rushed to contend, saved ground and weakened after going a half. BIG GALUTE was bumped at the break, raced three-wide through the turn
and was not a factor.

REMEMBERTOBREATHE raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away late.
PISTOL POWER settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run, responded when challenged by
the winner but could not hold that rival safe late. SILVER FURY pressed the pace from between rivals and gave way in the drive. MISTER MCLEAN
pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. BUCKLEY BAY bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to open a clear lead
before going a quarter and gave way through the final furlong. BENNY THE JET was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor.

unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. HOT ENCOUNTER showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn and finished with some late run. ROMAN RUSH pressed the pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. LEGITIMATE CAUSE lacked early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. DREAMER'S REALITY was fractious at the gate, settled off the leaders early, moved

Footnotes
CAPTAIN DASHI was away in good order to duel for the early advantage from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch, was headed late by
ALPINE HYPNOSIS nearing the wire and came back to prevail. ALPINE HYPNOSIS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
second turn, led late and shied from the lights to just miss. TRUTH TO POWER was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
second turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. TAP THE BANK was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second
turn, reached a contending position but lacked the needed late response. VICKY'S DIAMOND settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to
rally. OXBOW PARK raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders and did not reach contention. ADJUDGED was away alertly to dispute the
early fractions with the winner while racing three-wide, weakened after going six furlongs and was eased through the lane.
