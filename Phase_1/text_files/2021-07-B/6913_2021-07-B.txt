Footnotes
DIESEL dictated the fractions inside, repelled challenge from the runner-up and edged away through the stretch while kept to his task. STONEGATE
pursued the winner throughout then proved no match in the stretch. PETER G. FOX dropped back outside, bid inside on the final turn and the stretch while
no threat to the top pair. RATED SPECIAL settled off the pace and gave way after half a mile. COUCH DREAMS stalked the leaders inside to the far turn
and gave way. JOHNNY WISHBONE saved ground well back and was never a factor. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT was in tight between rivals entering the first
turn and outrun.

ADVOCATE HARBOR broke alertly and led inside, repelled a rival on the turn then drew away under moderate pressure. BELLITA saved ground close up
and finished willingly in the stretch to be second best. FIFTYSHADESOFRUN went after the winner on the turn then weakened in the stretch. HOLD ME
CLOSER outrun inside early, angled out in the stretch with some energy. I'LL GO ALL IN unseated her rider and ran off briefly in the warm-up, split rivals on
the turn but was no factor. SEVEN YEARS LATER urged close up in the two path early and faltered. SNAPPY RIDE chased very wide and lacked a rally.
PINK VODKA was fanned very wide down the backstretch and turn and faded.

Footnotes
SEVIER moved clear inside, widened under mild urging, continued to increased his advantage and was under wraps late. GETOFFMYBACK pursued the
winner inside and continued gamely to the finish. FIVE MORE MINUTES dropped back early, moved near the inside rallying and closed well.
MONTELEONE dropped back at the start, moved inside then came out in the stretch. KING'S HOUSE prompted the pacesetter to the turn and faltered.
HARD WEST was urged close up wide for half a mile and gave way. BIG BAD BUD lacked speed very wide and was never in contention.
