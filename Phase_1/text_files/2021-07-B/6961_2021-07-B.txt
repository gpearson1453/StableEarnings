HATTIES JEWEL settled well, advanced far on the turn, was angled in approaching the three-sixteenths marker and rallied under solid handling. WHY GOD
forwardly placed, took over on the far turn and proved no match in the late going. FOURTH DESIGN chased while four wide, moved closer on the far turn
and had no finishing punch in the stretch. BIG HEARTED FACTOR led early, lost his position on the far turn and was no factor in the stretch. CALL YOU
TOMORROW stalked the pace, dueled up the back stretch run and weakened in the stretch. JASIRI was checked in the vicinity of the thirteen-sixteenths
pole and never reached contention.
