SOCIAL MOBILITY was rated along the inside early, then moved out five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the lane, closed full of run to hit the front in
deep stretch and win going away late, driving. PASSION POLICE dueled for the early lead on the inside then made a bid on the turn to draw clear past the
quarter pole, then drew out by the furlong marker but was caught in deep stretch while being second best. PARTY AT SALT LAKE was allowed to settle
early and was three wide by the quarter pole while making a bid, but flattened out in the final furlong while saving the show award. COLONIAL LASS chased
the early pace three wide, then was five wide past the quarter pole but lacked the needed bid. SHE'S PRIMO chased the early pace from between rivals,
then was two wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and was empty. FRENCH CRULLER lacked a rally. LEXSOYA dueled for the lead three wide
and weakened.

NIKKI'S DREAM was away alertly to set a pressured pace three wide early, made a bid on the turn to draw clear, then drew off leaving the turn and was
kept to pressure to prove much the best. HEY RED pressed the winner early from the inside, then moved out on the turn when that rival got away, came into
the stretch five wide and held the place award gamely. STAR MANAGER chased the early pace between rivals, then was three wide past the quarter pole,
came four wide into the drive and finished willingly while being outfinished for the place award. WINE TRAIL saved ground while having no rally. REYA

ANNIE ROCKS was allowed to settle early, then was three wide down the backstretch, moved out four wide on the turn to make a bid, then wore down the
pace setter past the sixteenth pole to prevail late under a drive. COLOR CHART set the pace from the two path while clear, then drew clear entering the
stretch, but was headed past the sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the wire but was outfinished. TUXEDO LEMON was settled back early on the inside,
then made a three wide move past the quarter pole but proved to be no match for the top two while clearly besting the rest. KATERI EMPIRE chased the
early pace three wide, then was shuffled back on the backstretch, then made a four wide move past the quarter pole but lacked a late response. BECAUSE
OF SUSAN was allowed to settle early and made a four wide middle move then was empty. DR RUTHLESS was well placed on the inside and tired. VAN

Footnotes
OXLEY GAP was off a step slow, then rushed up on the inside to duel for command early, then made a bid and shook clear leaving the quarter pole, then
drifted off the rail in the drive and held sway late to prove best under a drive, game score. BOLDLEE dueled for the lead three wide, then did not corner well
and came four wide into the stretch, was gaining slowly but needed more late while holding on to the place award. PREFERRED OUTCOME was allowed to
settle while four wide, then came five wide into the drive and rallied. TENENCY chased the early pace and came into the drive four wide but lacked the
needed bid. BLUE SKIES FOREVER was void of early speed, came four wide into the drive and showed some late lick but had no serious rally.
MARGARITA SUNRISE chased the early pace three wide, then moved to the inside past the furlong marker and was empty.

VON ALDENBRUCK was allowed to settle early, then advanced and moved out four wide on the turn to make a four wide bid, hit the front nearing the
furlong marker, then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. LORENZEN pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a
short advantage, but could not hold off the winner in the stretch while running on gamely, second best. REGALITY broke outwardly at the start and slowly,
then went up to set the pace while off the rail, was headed on the turn and gave way in the drive. STRONG DESIRE was well placed early on the inside,
swung out five wide for the drive and was empty. STORM ALFEET lacked a rally.

drifted out by the sixteenths pole while tiring, held place award. STONE HEART stalked the pace setter from the inside, then tipped out three wide past the
