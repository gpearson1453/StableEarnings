Footnotes
GUN IT just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole tipping out to swing four wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the front inside the final sixteenth, then inched away in the late stages to the
finish. SHASHASHAKEMEUP got floated out slightly to be six paths off the inside when SMOOTH B wandered out just after leaving the chute, steadily
tucked five, four, then three wide down the backstretch while in close aim of a duel, continued three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun four wide into upper stretch advancing on the leader, seized command with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under a drive under lone
threat, got collared inside the sixteenth marker while clear for the place honors. MIHOS coaxed from the start, lost his lane when devoid of speed and
chased along the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, took to the two path through the turn coming under light coaxing with seven-sixteenths to
run, swung three wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. SMOOTH B bobbled at the start and broke on top despite it,
floated out to be five paths off the inside leaving the chute trading the front with GIROLAMO'S ATTACK, steadily tucked four then three wide dueling now
with that same rival, tucked to the two path nearing the turn and continued to knock heads through the turn placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to run,
cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, shook off his main pace foe confronted by SHASHASHAKEMEUP and yielded three-sixteenths from home,
then weakened in the late stages. T LOVES A FIGHT two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the turn coming under
urging three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch staying on one paced to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. GIROLAMO'S
ATTACK traded the front briefly early on with SMOOTH B before dueling along the inside with that rival to his outside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths continuing to knock heads, began to get shaken off through the latter portion of the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, then
backed away to the finish.

QUICK RETURN settled on the outside under some urging, went around the turn in the four path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, took the lead
under a right-handed crop into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop into the final furlong then edged clear under strong urging. CLEAR HUMOR
brushed with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, led under a
right-handed crop into the stretch then lost the advantage to the winner, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while
clear for the place. BREW PUB brushed with rivals at the start, settled at the rear, was urged four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response while clear for the show. TAMBURRO'S SOX was last to commence then reserved off the pace, went three wide while let out
on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. ARMS AN ARMOR broke out and brushed with a foe, showed the way while getting
out a bit, vied in the two path under coaxing on the turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole and gave way. REUNION TOUR settled last but one, was
urged in the two path on the turn, moved out under the crop near the furlong marker and failed to respond. BEAU BROWN settled nicely on the inside, was
asked on the turn, hugged the rail under the crop into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
GIACOSA three wide into the first turn, settled tracking the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced
to take command nearing the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. LIGHT IN THE SKY just
off the inside through the opening bend, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick. CHOCOLATE COOKIE stumbled at the start nearly pecking the ground, tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. CLASSIC COLORS crossed
to the inside past the stands the first time and was bumped along the rail and forced to be taken in hand in tight as LIGHT IN THE SKY came tucking
inwards, continued under a guarded hold and was steadied six and a half furlongs out in a bit tight inside GIACOSA heading into the backstretch, tracked
along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid while outkicked to the finish. TIMELESS
JOURNEY chased along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing
with five-sixteenths to go, angled out four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. DIXIE CANNON established the front and showed the way just off
the inside early on and into the first turn before taking to the fence into the backstretch through sensible splits and uncontested, came under pressure for the
initial time near the five-sixteenths and was placed to coaxing in response, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch
and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident on the clubhouse turn as well as an objection by the rider of CLASSIC COLORS alleging
interference against LIGHT IN THE SKY in the clubhouse turn. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the objection by the rider was dismissed
prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
LISHEEN settled towards the rear while two to three wide, shifted four wide while roused midway through the final turn, rallied outside to take the lead in
upper stretch and prevailed under strong urging. BALLACOLLA was last to commence her journey, settled at the rear of the field while saving ground,
moved closer late on the backstretch, came off the rail inside the five-sixteenths then was roused, rallied five wide into the stretch, chased the winner into
the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. ANGELOU was taken under a tight hold early, raced in the three path on the first turn, was rated in
second position in the two path while well behind the pacesetter, moved closer late on the backstretch, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then took a brief
lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths and was outfinished then just lost the place but earned the show.
FORTUNA settled towards the back while saving ground, moved to the two path inside the five-sixteenths, was put to a drive into upper stretch, steadied
briefly while in tight into the final furlong and was out-kicked. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE settled on the outside while racing in the two to three path, moved
much closer late on the backstretch, was asked on the final turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. FLAMING ROUGE was taken in hand early
then reserved on the inside, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn and also came up empty. ENDLESS FRONT went to
the front, opened up a sizable advantage in the two path around the opening bend, remained well clear while inside on the second turn, had the margin
diminish late on the backstretch, vied inside under coaxing on the final turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE LOVE forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, advanced on the leader into the far turn latching on
nearing the three-eighths pole, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on
through the length of the stretch wearing down the leader to take narrow command inside the sixteenth marker loosely between foes and prevailed at the
end. VIOLENT TRICK coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide into the first turn before settling along the inside nearing the backstretch and showed
the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing three furlongs from home as the aforementioned foe advanced and latched on
to her outside, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under challenge and clung stubbornly to the front through to the sixteenth pole, got headed inside
that station and fought on to the finish to preserve the place honors. MONGOLIAN HUMOR four wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside
down the backstretch and continued four wide through the far turn placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, tipped five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive running on willingly to the finish to be along clear for the show honors. YES I'M EVIL chased along the inside through the first turn and then
just off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn getting put to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six six wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild bid. SEEDS OF TIME three wide through the first turn in closest aim of the leader eager and pulling, came under stout restraint to be taken back
and stargazed against the resistance of the rider through the latter portion of the clubhouse turn into the backstretch, remained three wide throughout, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. GRINGOTTS tracked from just off the pace along the inside, came
under a ride three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ANNIKA GOLD two then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

NOVEMBER REIN stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took over while asked for her best in upper stretch and drew away
under steady urging. TOUGH STREET displayed good speed, showed the way in the two path through the turn, lost the advantage to the winner while
under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the pace. KANT HURRY LOVE was coaxed along in fourth position, came out leaving
the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and weakened while just able to get the show. LET HER INSPIRE U
was fractious in the gate, came away in good order, was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and
came up empty. DUFRESNE was urged along off the pace, dropped from three to two wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and capitulated.
RIGBY was hustled from the start, dropped well off the pace under urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. SUCCULENT broke a step slow
then stumbled, spotted the front a few lengths, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AMORE FIRE
was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, drifted inward into upper stretch and failed to respond.
CLASSIC MISS settled under some urging, was ridden along in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SARATOGA
CHROME was void of speed while ridden along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
TOO SEXY tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, spun just off the inside for home, had a seam open up three-sixteenths from home in the three
path and tipped out to it only to be met by AMERICAN GODDESS coming in under an off side crop use to close the hole, wedged her head and front in the
closing seam prying it open and nudging AMERICAN GODDESS back to the four path inside the eighth pole, burst through the opening to surge at the
leader taking command inside the sixteenth marker before edging away at the end to score. MINER'S QUEEN brushed at the start by MUMBAI while under
hustling from the gate, took brief command just after the start before being headed for the front seven-sixteenths from home, chased in closest aim through
the turn and was set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive wearing down the leader to take brief and narrow command
near the sixteenth pole before being overhauled inside that station, ran on to just preserve the place honors over a pair on the wire. AMERICAN GODDESS
three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, wandered out slightly to the four path at the three-sixteenths
and came under an off side crop to correct when bumping and brushing with TOO SEXY attempting to use that seam, got nudged back to the four path just
inside the eighth pole, then ran on to just miss for the place honors. MUSED (GB) tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. BAY JEWEL saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out to follow the eventual winner as a
seam opened up at the three-sixteenths and then tucked back to the two path when observing that rival wedged against foes, followed MINER'S QUEEN
through to the finish kicking on belatedly while unable to impact the top four. RIVENDELL broke out a step at the start, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. MUMBAI broke out a step at the start brushing with MINER'S
QUEEN, came under hustling and was keen early on inside that rival ranging up to take back command seven-sixteenths from home, showed the way
narrowly through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, then tired to the finish.
ZIA'S SONG just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

PATTY H was away alertly from the outside post, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then
was put to a drive, dueled inside of the runner-up to the wire and gamely prevailed under strong urging. EASY TO BLESS settled outside in the second
flight, moved out outside the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, was given her cue coming to the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the
quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and just missed while well clear for the place. POLISHED GEM was well positioned just off the
pace, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong
and weakened while able to get the show. GREATEST LOVE leaned out at the start and broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was roused two then three
wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. KANDY GINGER was hustled from the start, contested the pace down the
backstretch, vied along the rail while inside of the winner on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. MALIBU LUNA bumped with a foe at the
start while off a step slow, settled on the outside, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. RIDING ON A WINNER bumped with MALIBU
LUNA at the start then was taken up early, settled at the rear, shifted from the rail to the three path early on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and also
was no factor.

Footnotes
UNCLE'S GEM was away alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop turning into upper stretch, drifted out outside the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and proved
best under steady urging. KREESA LA WROTE was rated on the outside then carried out near the half-mile pole, dropped in leaving the backstretch, went
two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner on the outside to the wire and was second best. U SHOULD B
DANCING broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, advanced while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide
into the stretch, chased the winner in the lane and weakened but was clear for the show. BAUDI MOOVAN raced well back in the field, went three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. CANDY MONET moved out while just off the pace then gained to press
the pace, lugged out from the three to five path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. RAINING CANDY was bumped
at the start, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ISLE STORM was forwardly placed from the
start then carried out near the half-mile pole, went four wide early on the turn then was carried out six wide and capitulated. FANCY FELINE settled towards
the rear of the field, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond. STRONG MOMENT was hustled from the start, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, suffered a catastrophic injury to her left foreleg inside the furlong marker and fell then was euthanized on the course.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE.
