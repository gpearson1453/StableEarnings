TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT pressed the pace, was roused on the turn to challenge, dueled past the eighth pole and drew clear under urging. DISPUTED raced
mid pack, rallied around the turn, closed steadily and gained late to earn place. LIL LATIGO set the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to
duel past the eighth pole, faltered and settled for show. STELLA SWEEPER was crowded at the start, saved ground and lacked a bid. MERITTRIS was in
tight at the start, settled off the pace and was through after a half. MI MALDITO AMOR came out at the start, was a bit rank, checked and clipped heels
entering the first turn, was taken outside, had the rider lose the whip on the turn and failed to contend. BUBBA BAY appeared to hit the rail and lost his
jockey. The stewards' posted an inquiry and no change was made. Hand timed.

MESANGE pressed the pace while racing inside, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended her lead. AUTUMN ISABELLA set the pace, was
headed on the turn, fell back, finished evenly and was no match for the winner. TROPHY CHEST stalked the pace, bid inside, came up empty and was all
out for show. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY was in tight and steadied on the backstretch, raced evenly and failed to menace. OLD WEST stalked the pace, had
nothing left for the drive and dropped back. WIN LIKE COACH P trailed the field, went widest in the drive and passed tiring rivals. EZ QUEEN got away well,
raced outside and was through early. FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE bobbled at the start and was outrun. Hand timed.

RIDE FOR GLORY rallied along the rail on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in an all out effort. ROUSING RUBBLE challenged three
across on the turn, dueled in tight quarters through the stretch and was outnodded in a game effort. LUCKY ROCKET was impeded at the start, moved up
inside to assume command, responded to duel in tight quarters and yielded. CAPITAL REEF swung wide leaving the turn, closed well and didn't have
enough late. LOGAN MAN CAN led early, fell back and went evenly thereafter. UNCONSCIOUS POWER veered in at the start, showed speed to the turn
and gave way. WED O'S CHAMP failed to contend. Hand timed.

Footnotes
A NEW TREND pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled past the eighth pole and inched away to prove best. ME set a pressured pace,
responded when challenged to duel and yielded grudgingly in late stretch. MR VIEW lagged early, closed steadily, was gaining late and earned show. MO
GEE stalked the pace while racing inside, lacked a rally and hung in the lane. PLEASE DO TELL was void of early speed, offered a mild bid only and
improved position. THIRTY SECONDS OUT showed good early speed, dropped back and went evenly thereafter. INDY'S OUTLAW was not a factor. SUM
CANDY showed brief speed only and had the rider lose the whip on the turn. Hand timed.
