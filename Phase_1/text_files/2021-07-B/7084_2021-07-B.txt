Footnotes
AWESOME VIEW sped clear early, widened the advantage steadily coming off the turn in the three-path, and was kept to steady pressure through the
stretch. SCIENCE was outrun inside to the turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and was up outside BELLA SOFI to be a distant runner-up.
BELLA SOFI gave futile chase to AWESOME VIEW for a half-mile, and was outfinished for the place. KIZZY faded after a half-mile inside. VIVA was outrun
inside. DRILLZILLA was outrun three to four wide. TRINNI BEAUTY bumped with OH NO ITS T B at the break, then was bumped again by that rival after a
few strides, and never got close. SUNDANCE PEAK pursued the winner to late on the turn, and stopped. ALL GRACE was finished early. OH NO ITS T B
bumped with TRINNI BEAUTY at the start, then came in bumping that rival and making light contact with KIZZY as well, and retired after a half.

Footnotes
FIERY SWEET sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and steadily widened under a drive. PURE AMBITION chased the winner
from the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. STRAIGHT TO GO was shut off a forced to steady off heels not long after
the start, saved ground well back, swung five wide turning for home and ran on for the show. BROADWAY BELLE was reluctant to load, chased the pace
three wide and lacked a closing bid. MISS GOODIE GOODIE chased the winner in the clear and came up empty in the lane. RACHEL DREAM was shut off
and forced to check early and made little impact while racing two wide. DA FURIOUS CAT was reluctant to load, raced greenly early and was never in
contention.

Footnotes
MAGIC ECLIPSE bobbled at the start, stayed in range to the turn two wide, swung five wide outside the leaders past the quarter-pole, brushed with TRIPLE
JEOPARDY after straightening away for the drive, and edged that rival all out to the wire. TRIPLE JEOPARDY ranged up four wide to challenge after six
furlongs, brushed with MAGIC ECLIPSE cornering a bit awkwardly into the stretch, and was outfinished between horses. BOLDNESS set a pressured pace
toward the inside, drifted out weakening through the furlong grounds, and remained clear for the show. GODS PROMISE broke a step slow, advanced
mildly coming off the turn in the two-path, but flattened out. SEAZAN faded around the turn while shifting off the inside to the four-path, then ran on evenly
through the stretch on the far outside. GRRR pressed the pace two wide between horses, and faded after six furlongs. KIGER forced the pace between
horses three wide, and tired after six furlongs. JIRAFALES got off to a stutter-step start at the back, and showed little.

Footnotes
MUGURUZA was reluctant to load, set a clear pace inside and held clear under a drive. CANDYMEISTER stalked the winner two wide, bid nearing the lane,
could not match strides with that foe but held well for the place. LLUVIA chased the pace inside and was one-paced through the lane. READY TO RUMBLE
went evenly while racing to wide. BIG SURPRISE saved ground in midpack, angled three wide near the quarter pole, shifted five wide in upper stretch and
was no threat. DAVID'S ROSE got out around the turn, raced in the five or six path through the bend and lacked a serious rally. ISLAND WINTER was
outrun inside. MAGIC VICTORY was carried out six and seven wide early on the turn, angled into the three path late on the bend and made little impact.
DEL REY DOLLY played no factor while racing two wide. SWEETCANDYFACTORY was outrun inside. STERLINA lost contact, was pulled up near the
sixteenth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
KOZY DREAMS raced three wide, cruised up to contention between horses after a half-mile, collared TREVESS from outside leaving the furlong grounds
still on her left lead, and drew clear under a mild drive. TREVESS vied early inside rivals, drew clear around the turn, proved no match for the winner into the
last eighth of a mile but was clearly second best. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL pressed the early pace between horses, could not stay with TREVESS under urging
on the turn, and faded while able to hold the show. RAIN brushed with SALSA RITA at the start, got bumped by R KISS EM GOODBYE while outside that
one entering the turn, moved inside and could not gain through the stretch. FOREVER MARTA broke slowest, and was never a factor racing three to four
wide. SALSA RITA brushed the left side of the gate and made contact with RAIN at the break, and was outrun three to four wide. BAHAMIAN GIRL pressed
the early pace outside, could not stay with the leader around the turn under urging, and gave way. R KISS EM GOODBYE bumped RAIN with her hind end
and took up sharply losing her action just past the half-mile marker, was pulled up coming off the turn and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE CITY set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. KATE'S KINGDOM settled off the early pace two
wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn but could only gain incrementally in the lane. CRYSTAL COAST prompted the winner two wide for seven
furlongs and weakened a bit late. APPOINTED was in range inside, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. IRAZU went evenly while
racing two wide. LIL ANNIE ROSE was outrun inside.

LEGAL DEAL got clear slightly off the inside before going a quarter-mile, got hooked from outside by ISOLATE after a half-mile and relinquished command,
fought back through upper stretch to regain the advantage and was going away at the finish. WITH VERVE saved ground outsprinted early, shifted off the
rail around the turn, fanned widest for the drive and finished well to get up for second. ISOLATE pursued LEGAL DEAL from outside early, moved
menacingly to put a head in front with five-sixteenths remaining, held a slim lead into the stretch, then wandered out and in weakening through the final
furlong. BREWMEISTER broke a length slow, advanced along the rail to loom a threat turning for home, but could not sustain the rally. R MERCEDES BOY
lunged slightly at the start to no ill effect, stayed close into the turn, was ridden along past the three-eighths and came up empty. DOC AMSTER raced three
to four wide around the turn, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
SYLVANELLA prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn, took the lead early on the backstretch, cleared near the half-mile pole, drew off
around the far turn and held well clear under a drive throughout the lane. CACTUS KITTEN settled off the pace along the inside, tipped two wide nearing the
lane and finished willingly inside to gain the place in the final strides. LA RUSIA saved ground in range early, chased three wide around the far turn, moved
into second in upper stretch and was narrowly outfinished for that position. BRODY'S HONOR was in range two wide, was put to a full out drive entering the
far turn but finished evenly. MISS WROTE set the early pace along the rail, chased the winner inside from the half-mile pole and tired in the drive. BLUES
SONGS failed to menace while racing four wide. SISTER IS DEVIL was in range three wide and retreated in the lane. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE played no
factor while racing three wide. JUST LIKE INDY was outrun inside. LIESEL was bumped at the start, raced three wide and was never close. SPECIAL
INCLUSION was bumped at the start, lagged well back inside and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
NACHO MAMA saved ground early in the second flight, got steered off the rail in front of LET'S BE HONEST beginning to get in gear leaving the
quarter-pole, stayed on task through the stretch and rolled past the leaders from outside with 70 yards to go. LA CHICA LATERAL lagged well back for a
half-mile, cut the corner rallying into the stretch, finished with good energy and was up late inside MACKENZIE'S GIRL for the place. MACKENZIE'S GIRL
dueled early inside KARATBARS, disposed of that one on the turn while being joined by IDEAL BREEZE, fought back inside the latter through midstretch,
but was overtaken late from both sides. IDEAL BREEZE bumped with LET'S BE HONEST at the start, eyed the dueling leaders entering the turn, ranged up
to challenge three wide past the three-eighths, shortened stride tardy changing leads until well past the furlong marker, and weakened. LOVELORN LADY
bumped lightly with MY ASHLEIGH at the start, chased the leaders four then three wide around the turn, and faded. LET'S BE HONEST bumped with
IDEAL BREEZE at the start, raced two wide around the turn in the second flight, took up sharply behind NACHO MAMA just after completing a half-mile,
and could not recover. KARATBARS dueled outside MACKENZIE'S GIRL early, could not match strides around the turn and faded steadily. MY ASHLEIGH
bumped lightly with LOVELORN LADY at the start, and tired outside before reaching the stretch. KITTY KITTY broke slowly and was always outrun. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE INCIDENT APPROACHING THE STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
PEARLESCENT was unhurried inside early, advanced four wide around the far turn, surged outside while mostly racing on the left lead in the lane, swept to
the front past the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. GYPSY WIFE raced well back two wide early, circled five wide around the far turn, angled down into
the three path near the quarter pole, rallied between foes and was just up for the place. SIMONELA was bumped at the start, dueled two wide around the
first turn, cleared midway down the backstretch, fought off another bid from CHARLOTTE THE BRIT nearing the lane, shook clear again in upper stretch,
held clear to the sixteenth pole and yielded. COPPER chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT dueled inside around
the first turn, rated back midway down the backstretch, re-bid two wide around the far turn but tired in the drive. KARENINA saved ground off the pace, went
three wide around the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. HOITY TOITY was bumped at the start, raced three to four
wide and never threatened. LAILONI raced three wide in midpack and lacked a closing bid. STAR SWEPT played no factor while racing two wide. CAT'S J
N J steadily faded inside.
