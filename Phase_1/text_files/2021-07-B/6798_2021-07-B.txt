Footnotes
PENDRELL MOON mid pack and off the rail, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead and held. DERBY CHAMPAGNE well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady
gain and missed. ORCHESTRAL stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, weakened late and held the show. ONE SUMMER
NITE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. DAWOOD well placed,
steadily lost ground. GO HIPPO GO allowed to settle, gained position on the two path through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and faded.
LOVE SICK KITTEN was no factor.
