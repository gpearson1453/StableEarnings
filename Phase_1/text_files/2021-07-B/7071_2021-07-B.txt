ROGALLO never far back, closed willingly through the stretch, was bumped by the runner up past the furlong marker, made the lead late and drew off under
right handed. O'HAIRE chased the pace into the far turn, inherited the lead two wide, shook clear, drifted to the six path bumping the winner past mid stretch
then was no match. MACHINE GUNNER stalked the pace from the start, was forced to wait inside through the far turn, shifted out to the four path,
advanced into the stretch, dropped inside the leader then leveled off. TAMANRASSETT failed to menace. HUMBLE HANSEN broke in front, set the pace for
five and one half furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
RELISH THE RIDE always within striking distance split horses three then two wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead, was bumped and
forced inward by the runner up at the furlong marker and proved best in a game effort. GOING PRIMETIME never far back, rallied four then three wide into
the stretch, also drew on even terms for the lead, drifted in bumping the winner and just missed. MOESTER unhurried early, closed fast four wide through
the stretch. THAT'S THE WAY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. RED HOT POWER sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after
the start, set the pace along the rail to mid stretch, was squeezed by the top pair, altered course three wide then dropped back. SASSY POWER pressed
the pace three wide to the top of the stretch then weakened. BOOTS FOR COWBOYS prompted the pace four wide for three and one half furlongs then
gave way. PLAYING BALL trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED GOING PRIMETIME FOR
INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH AND PLACED HER FIFTH.
