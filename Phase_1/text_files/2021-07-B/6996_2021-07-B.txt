Footnotes
BIG BASE sat patiently on the heels of early pacesetter through the opening bend, advanced with a mid move, gained command along rhe backstretch then
opened up the margin in the final eighth. TAPINDEED hustled from outset and led the short field in tandem with WHEW through the opening half, but was
unable to fend off the closing strides of BIG BASE in the closing portion of contest. WHEW gave a good chase from a ground saving stance and finished
evenly. FOREIGN CREATION lacked a rally after giving chase from a two wide stance early and a three wide pose in latter strides.
