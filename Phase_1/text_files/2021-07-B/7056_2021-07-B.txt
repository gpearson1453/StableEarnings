Footnotes
DANCE OR STROLL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, then made a steady gain and drew
off late. ALEXANDRA KAY stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into
the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place. MILE END allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through
inside, angled out and closed well for the show. POQUITO ROSE passed a tiring rival for a share. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon
after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong.

WATCH THE DIP set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, dueled through the lane with ZOODLES, then came again to
edged ahead of that one. ZOODLES well placed and between rivals, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path outside the leader, then
dueled with that one and was outfinished. ANOTHER SOFTBALL never far back, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside into
the stretch, lost some ground while gaining the show. I'M JUST LAUGHING well placed and outside, held position four wide through the turn, bid three wide
into the lane and weakened the final furlong. SIR HIGGINS vied for the early lead on the outside and faded through the turn. CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE was
no factor. WHO YOU SAY I AM lost contact with the field and was eased over the wire.

NEW JERSEY JOHN set the pace on the inside, shook clear in the stretch, dueled with SURF AND TURF and lasted. SURF AND TURF mid pack, held
position two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, dueled with the winner and was outfinished by that one. WAPITI WAY
tracked the pace, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside, then lacked the needed late kick. BOOMIN GOOSE allowed to settle, saved
ground through the second turn on the two path, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. SERVE REVENGE COLD fractious in the gate, looped three
and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide and weakened in the stretch. MY FRIEND FRANK was no factor. SNAP HOOK rated outside the
leader, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded the final furlong.

far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and missed.
MALARKEY broke awkwardly from the gate, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. DAVE'S TEXAS
LADY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the strat, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share.
CONQUESTHARDCHERRY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals, then weakened the final furlong. BRING
IT ON HOME stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then weakened the final

moved up while angling out through the turn, came five wide to bid into the stretch and flattened out. RED CAT (CHI) allowed to settle, moved up while
angling out through the turn, bid five wide into the stretch and evened out. TALE OF KANTHAROS passed tiring rivals, widest. RIDE INTO THE SKY well
placed, gained position four wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. STATION ROCK showed little. KING
ECLIPTICAL stalked the pace on the outside and was through after a half. WHISKEY DASH was a brief factor.

Footnotes
JOYFUL PRAISE mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up late.
KEYPIT stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader, made a steady gain, shook clear,
then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. HONEY BEEST set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened late and held the show. OUT OF POCKET allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane
and closed well for a share. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and weakened the final furlong.
SIDE ACTION well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive.
LYNBROOKE mid pack, gained position three wide into the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally. THIS LITTLE KITTY was never
involved. CLASSY MOMENT was no factor.
