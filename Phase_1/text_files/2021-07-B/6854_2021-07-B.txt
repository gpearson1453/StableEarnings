THE CRITICAL WAY was well placed tracking the leaders on the inside, angled out nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, responded
when asked, gained a short lead nearing the furlong marker, edged away and was ridden out. THE CONNECTOR vied inside for the lead, dueled with
READYFORPRIMETIME on the turn, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch drive and battled on to the end. CAJUN CASANOVA chased two
wide, chased on the turn, rallied mildly in the stretch run and earned the show spot. FOX ROX was steadied at the start and off slowly, outrun early, came
three wide into the lane, closed belatedly and got up for fourth. READYFORPRIMETIME vied outside for the early lead, dueled two wide on the turn, dueled
between horses into the stretch and weakened. MOJOVATION raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SPUN AND WON dueled two wide for the lead, dueled with MO MISCHIEF on the turn, gained the advantage over that rival, then drifted in at the furlong
marker, was straightened up and drew clear. MO MISCHIEF dueled inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, was in tight and checked on the
rail at the eighth pole, then continued on gamely to hold second. WE READY raced off the pace inside, advanced between rivals on the turn, came five wide
into the lane, rallied outside in the stretch and got up for third. CLEMENZA stalked the pace, advanced inside on the turn, angled out, came three wide into
the lane, went evenly and weakened late. COMEDIC TIMING raced three wide off the pace and closed belatedly inside. SKILLFUL raced off the pace,
saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. NOT A POSTINO chased four wide early, three wide on the turn and tired. GHOSTCONQUEROR raced off the
pace between rivals, came six wide into the lane and had no rally. STRATOFORTRESS chased three wide and tired. WHATA GUY raced off the pace
inside, saved ground on the turn and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, along with a Jockey Objection by the rider of MO MISCHIEF
against the winner, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
GREAT ISLAND pulled and was steadied on the inside crossing the wire the first time, then settled nicely at the back of the field, content to trail, moved up
midway on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, angled out at the eighth pole, launched a strong rally outside, finished fast to get up late and win going
away. KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) raced two wide off the pace, stalked on the backside, made a four wide run into contention at the quarter pole, closed
willingly in deep stretch and dug in gamely between horses to the wire. JULIET FOXTROT (GB) stalked the leader on the inside, was bumped entering the
first turn, then tracked inside, waited for room on the far turn, came through on the rail at the quarter pole, quickly kicked away at the top of the lane, then
dug in gamely inside and was outkicked in deep stretch. NAY LADY NAY (IRE) stalked two wide, bumped a rival entering the clubhouse turn, tracked the
pace, bid three wide at the quarter pole and weakened. ALWAYS SHOPPING raced off the pace inside, was asked for run on the far turn and lacked a rally.
NO MERCY PERCY set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled past the quarter pole and faded in the final furlong.

a bid and weakened in the lane. REAL WILD SOLUTION raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and

Footnotes
GRACEFUL PRINCESS raced three wide early, stalked three wide, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied outside rivals into the stretch, closed steadily,
surged in deep stretch and prevailed late. BAJAN GIRL stalked the leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, battled it out with OUR
SUPER FREAK to the furlong marker, then dug in gamely between horses through the final sixteenth and earned the place spot. OUR SUPER FREAK
pulled a bit early on along the rail, came through on the rail to contest the pace nearing the six furlong marker, then took back and tracked the leader, bid
two wide entering the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run and yielded late. THANKFUL raced off the pace,
moved up three wide on the far turn, lacked a rally and bested the others for fourth. VAULT raced off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn and
then failed to rally. WATER WHITE raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and faded. REINA LA KELSY was outrun. MRS. DANVERS set
the pace racing in the two path, opened up a bit on the backside, dueled briefly on the far turn and then gave way.

TRIBHUVAN (FR) flashed good early speed to clear the field, set the pace racing on his own, continued galloping along on the backside, showed the way
into the far turn, responded when roused turning for home, finished willingly and was ridden out. IMPERADOR (ARG) raced off the pace inside, then two

nearing the first turn, then settled into a stalking position, chased outside a rival on the final turn and rallied on the rail for third. SERVE THE KING (GB)
raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch run and closed late for a share. GLYNN COUNTY raced two

HOT ROD CHARLIE tracked early on, then settled into a stalking position racing two wide, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid four wide passing the
quarter pole, rallied outside rivals to a short lead nearing the furlong marker, drifted in in front of MIDNIGHT BOURBON causing that rival to clip heels, then
battled heads apart with MANDALOUN in a spirited duel to the wire and got the nod. MANDALOUN tracked the leaders racing close up on the rail, was well
placed behind rivals on the backside, waited for room on the far turn, moved up between horses at the quarter pole, found a seam two wide turning for
home, responded and rallied willingly inside rivals, then dug in gamely on the rail and battled heads apart with HOT ROD CHARLIE in the final sixteenth to
the wire. FOLLOWING SEA set the pace on the inside, vied inside of MIDNIGHT BOURBON on the backside, dueled on the far turn, could not go with the
leaders in upper stretch, weakened and then checked at the eighth pole to avoid a fallen rider. ANTIGRAVITY raced off the pace inside, saved ground on
the far turn and failed to threaten. PICKIN' TIME was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, chased between on the far turn, tired and was
