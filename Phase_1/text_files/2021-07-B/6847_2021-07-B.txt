STOSH gradually angled in trying to keep a clear path in the early going, moved outside TO THE BANK past the five furlong marker, went for the lead on
the bend, battled under a drive in the lane then edged ahead with little asking the final sixteenth. TO THE BANK broke alertly, gradually angled in the first
eighth, was challenged from outside on the turn, fought gamely through the stretch but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. PICTURE PAINTED was
crowded and steadied briefly near the five furlong pole, boxed in behind the leader nearing the bend, angled out on the turn, floated out to lose some extra
ground into the stretch, was all out, closed well but was too late.

Footnotes
MARYS LAST SONG advanced outside under urging, gradually angled in entering the turn, was encouraged clear on the bend then continued to open up
with little asking in the stretch. HALO COUTURE bumped at the break, was caught in tight along the rail nearing the bend, checked solidly leaving the
seven-sixteenths marker when her path was taken, progressed from inside on the turn, fanned out some for a clear path entering the stretch, took over
second then could only maintain her position late. MISS LEARJET prominent between rivals, was caught in tight quarters and forced in some into the turn,
was three wide taking the bend and weakened for the drive. ELIZABETH'S GHOST broke inward bumping HALO COUTURE, was also prominent between
horses early, crowded, as well, and forced in some entering the bend, did not keep up two wide on the turn, floated out to path four entering the stretch and
continued to yield. NO LETTIN GO well placed just off the inside, lost her path and appeared to clip MISS LEARJET'S heels into the turn, was checked and
altered out and steadily faded from outside the rest of the way.

G CITY WARRIOR rated off the early speed from outside, was roused from path four early in the bend, took over after entering the last furlong, moved clear
and gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure the final sixteenth. HOLD THE SPENDING contested the pace between rivals, was two wide taking the
turn, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but edged ahead for second. MIZ CLIPPER was sent to dispute the pace from inside and also failed to have the
needed late kick. MY WIFE IS BOSS displayed early speed outside HOLD THE SPENDING then slowly wore down in the lane. BIT MONEY in contention
early, began to fade along the rail on the bend.

TIZRIK hit the ground running when the gate opened, showed the way in hand, was roused leaving the quarter pole, all out the last furlong and kept THE
LAST OPTION at bay. THE LAST OPTION was moved to the outside early on, lost ground four wide through the bend, gradually closed the gap under a
drive in the stretch, drifted out under left-handed pressure in the waning yards and came up short. B'S TURNING POINT raced closest to TIZRIK for a half
mile then began to gradually yield in the stretch. SMART TRIAL was in contention outside B'S TURNING POINT for four furlongs and gave way for the
drive.

MEETMEINSTLOUIE soon sprinted to a commanding lead, was under a drive in the lane, drifted out some midstretch but held on under steady handling.
PECOS AUTUMN chased from between rivals, moved to the inside into the bend, closed the gap two wide upper stretch, angled in with a sixteenth left,
closed well but came up short. BEZEL SET hustled along from inside, was checked solidly when her path was taken with five furlongs to go, progressed
widest through the turn, took over third upper stretch, made a very strong move the final eighth, was also too late but easily best of the others. LADY
CHAFFEE also chased from between horses, was two wide on the bend, had the rail for the stretch run but failed to have a late bid. SOONER LEGACY
advanced three wide on the turn but flattened out for the drive. PRETTY LADY TOO moved to the inside with five furlongs to go, was steadied when her
path was taken into the bend, soon gave way, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LIL B QUICK pressed the pace from outside, took over two wide when allowed on the bend, was put to urging into the lane, lengthened her lead under a
drive upper stretch and maintained control under steady handling. SEE GRACE FLY BY bobbled as she broke on top, was soon challenged from both sides,
followed LIL B QUICK on the turn, fanned outside that one to make her bid entering the lane, gained second upper stretch, could not close the gap on the
leader the last furlong but proved easily second best. MORA VALLEY broke outward, bumping LILLET, edged ahead for the lead along the inside after the
first furlong, did not stay with LIL B QUICK on the turn and flattened out for the drive. LILLET bumped at the break, was an early factor but faded from inside
on the turn and had no stretch bid. DARLIN ROSIE chased from outside, was widest taking the bend and also had no late bid.

Footnotes
BILLY NOT WILLIAM rated off the early speed from between horses, moved clear for second from just off the inside on the bend, engaged B G ATTACK
midstretch, battled the rest of the way and edged ahead in time. B G ATTACK broke on top and soon sprinted clear, was put to a drive leaving the turn, all
out the final furlong and was narrowly outfinished in a very game effort. FINAL CALL broke a bit outward, bumping IMPERIAL TEMPLE, progressed from
inside, fanned to path three for the stretch run, made a strong move the last eighth but came up short. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE hesitated slightly then made
a leap from the gate, advanced between rivals on the bend, swung outside FINAL CALL into the lane and found best stride too late. AWESOME SKIPPY in
contention from outside on the backstretch, did not stay close while widest through the turn and improved his position in the stretch without threatening.
IMPERIAL TEMPLE bumped at the start, failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. HAYGRINDER void of speed while toward the outside, gave way before
finishing three furlongs, distanced himself from the rest the last quarter mile and was walked off after the race.
