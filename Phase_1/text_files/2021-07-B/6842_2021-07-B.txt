Footnotes
CONFESSOR crossed over setting the pace in hand, widened on the final turn, drifted out through the stretch but remained safe in a moderate drive. COAL
TRUTH wide on the first turn, went after the winner midway on the final turn but proved no match. OXIDE close up between rivals, dropped back into the far
turn, angled inside and went evenly in the stretch. EVEN THUNDER settled behind the pacesetter, bid briefly closer before the half then faded.

Footnotes
MALIBU BEAUTY broke alertly and took control inside, was asked for run near the top of the stretch and pulled away while ridden out. CAUGHT UP IN YOU
broke sluggishly, advanced wide on the turn, loomed a threat in the stretch but was second best. A. P. PRINCESS prompted the winner outside to the
quarter pole and faded. FIFTEEN ROYALS was urged close up in the two path, weakened on the turn then fell after the finish.
