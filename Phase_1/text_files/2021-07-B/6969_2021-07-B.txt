made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final stages. PRIORITIZATION raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and
moved up in the stretch run. TIZ LIFE set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. DESTINED FOR HONOR was
bothered and in tight early on, chased the pace down the backstretch from the inside, was off the rail into the lane and faded in the stretch drive. KNIEVEL

Footnotes
AWAKENED bobbled at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the leader and cleared the
field in the final stages. FOREIGN RELATIONS broke slowly and trailed the field early on, was in the seven path into the lane and rallied for place in the
stretch run. MY FAVORITE UNCLE stalked the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the rail but weakened late in
the drive. WING COMMANDER pressed the pace early, took over command, was off the rail into the lane, overtaken near the eighth pole and faltered late in
the drive. ALEXANDER VALLEY chased the pace early from the inside, was shuffled back along the final turn, raced on the inside into the lane and
flattened out late in the drive. WARBIRD was off the rail into the lane and improved position in the stretch drive. MAXIMUS AURELIUS was never a threat.
WAR CROSS chased the pace early, was in the four path entering the lane while making a bid but faded late in the drive. PURE COURAGE was never a
factor. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but empty late in the drive. COMMITTED
was never involved. MR. SLATE set the pace for three quarters then folded up.
