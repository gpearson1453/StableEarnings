Footnotes
DONTYOUREMEMBER tracked the pace from the two path through mid-turn, angled into the four path into the lane, gained momentum once straightened,
continued with good energy while in the five path and edged up late. CARMELLA KEY stalked the two rival duel into the far turn, bid three wide into the lane,
was on near even terms for the lead with an eighth to go then was outfinished for the top spot. IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN vied for the lead while along the
inside, continued along the rail to cut the corner into the lane, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole then could not keep up with the top two. NOBLE
PRIZE was in the two path through the turns and moved up while not a threat. BREWSKY was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn,
came into the lane from the five path and lacked the needed response. RUNNINAWAYWITHIT was in the three path through the turns and tired. TOO
CROWDED vied for the lead two wide through the far turn, was still a contender into the lane then was empty.

Footnotes
BROOKVILLE DEPUTY was forced inward at the start, raced along the inside through the turn, entered the lane from the five path, was gaining momentum
when shifting into the four path to avoid a drifting rival then finished with a rush to be up in time. SACRED SKY set the pace from the outset, cleared into the
far turn, widened through the turn and into the lane, had his largest advantage with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. MUSTY RED
stumbled at the start, raced in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the three path, drifted out into the sixth path inside
the sixteenth pole and was outfinished while gaining to the end. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG chased the pace while in the two path through the turn, was well
placed into the lane then weakened. GO EARLY STAY LATE was forced in at the start, raced near the inside through the turn and into the lane then moved
up and was never a threat. STYLISH LIE was never a factor while saving ground through the turn. WHITE SILVER SANDS broke inward and stumbled after
the start, raced near the back and was never in it. BINGE pressed the pace two wide into the turn, chased the pace into the lane then retreated. FRENCH
KID stumbled badly at the start and trailed.

THING pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into lane, edged clear outside the eighth pole then held while drifting out a couple of paths late.
PASSWORD PROTECTED was three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the two path with momentum and steadily gained to the end.
SEVENTY EIGHT set the pace while under pressure into the lane, lost the lead then grudgingly gave ground. PRINCE ACT raced between rivals through
the turn and lacked a closing bid. A LITTLE ECCENTRIC tracked the pacesetters through the turn and into the lane then weakened. ELVIS JUST ELVIS
raced in the three to four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. KOLSCH was off last, raced in the two or three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a response.
