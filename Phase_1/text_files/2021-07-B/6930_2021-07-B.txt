NEVISIAN SPIRIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, shook clear in the lane, then drew off
and was ridden out. MIDNIGHT LEAP allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, bid on the two path into the lane and closed well for the place.
ANNIE UP BUCK tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then lost ground, while gaining the show.
SECRET TEMPLE well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and faded the final
furlong. LACEE stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside the leader and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
BEYOND SMART set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then shook clear into the stretch and lasted under steady
pressure. ENGLISH LAUGHTER well placed and between rivals, moved up three and four wide though the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a
steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. ALFRED well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
lane, weakened late and held the show. GO HIPPO GO allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane,
lost ground, while gaining a share. CORT'N ASONG well placed, gained a striking position four wide into the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and
weakened the final furlong. DIMATE passed tiring rivals, widest. AWESOME HALO stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn.
EASTPORT fractious in thge gate, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, then had no rally. KICHIRO broke awkwardly and was always outrun.
