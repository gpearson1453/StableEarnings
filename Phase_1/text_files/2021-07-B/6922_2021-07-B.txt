Izzadora Bella to take up sharply. A jockeys claim was lodged and stewards disqualified for interference in the stretch and placed fourth. CANOOCHEE
stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, moved four to five wide in the upper stretch and slowly closed in through the stretch drive. BRING
ME ANSWERS was sent clear early on to set all the pace, raced off the inside through the stretch and weakened a bit in the final stages. IZZADORA BELLA
stalked the early pace, moved up between rivals in the lane, was forced to take up sharply near the sixteenth pole due to the winner drifting in. Izzadora
Bella was placed third through the stewards disqualification of the winner. HETTY G. was off slowly, raced in tight quarters nearing the seven eighths
marker and had no late response.

Footnotes
OMATI raced up close early on while racing in hand, took command around the far turn and drew off to be well clear late under strong handling.
FLEETRIDGE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide around the far turn while under vigorous pressure, challenged the leader nearing the eighth pole
but was no match for the winner in the final stages. GHOST STALKER was unhurried in the early stages, moved up five wide at the three sixteenths pole
and had not enough in the drive. MY DANNY BOY showed good early speed along the inside and gave way in the drive. GALILEAN MOON was slow early
on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. UNIDENTIFIED MAN stalked the pace from the inside and failed to sustain a bid.

quarter pole, raced along the inside through the lane, checked near the sixteenth pole and had no final response after a troubling trip. UNCLE MO'S AFFAIR
was reluctant to load, pressed the early pace and gave way while racing off the inside. BLUSHABLE dropped back early and failed to respond. NAKIBEYA

Footnotes
KEEPYOURGUARDUP stalked the early pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. WHERE U
B showed good early speed to set all the pace and couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to finish second best. SCREEN STAR raced up close
early on, was near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. EXCHANGE FEVER settled off the early pace, raced five
deep into the lane and flattened out. GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR raced three wide around the far turn and never threatened. ARTILLERY raced towards the
inside around the far turn and never menaced. ZEN ARCHER stumbled at the break and never threatened.
