ASK ME HOW IKNOW was hustled along to set a pressured pace, responded to the challenge of CEDAR RUNS CASTLE nearing the five sixteenths pole
and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and inched clear the final yard, while the latter, closed to even terms nearing the five sixteenths pole and
contested the turn two deep, dug in leaving the turn, but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. LAST PARTY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn
at the rail and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. CRYPTOBLUE chased, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly. GENESIS G G
chased, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little further. ROCKET COLONY steadied early then gave chase, came through the turn in the three path,
drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened. ROCKET BLUE gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and weakened the
final furlong.

Footnotes
TWEET THIS took the lead at the three quarter pole and rated a clear pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on
the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. MINI BOLT saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail then dueled through the stretch for second. THORN OF ROSE HILL raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started
a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran five wide on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. STRIDE ON BY came through the first turn
about the three path and entered the backstretch outside, started a bid past the three eighths pole, ran six wide on the far turn and passed rivals widest.
LET'S GET STARTED settled off the pace off the rail the opening turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, steadied
off the heels of Thorn Of Rose Hill nearing the eighth pole then flattened in the lane. BECOMING SMITTY rated off the pace inside the first turn, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then weakened. WINTER IS HERE stalked the early pace off the rail, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and weakened. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the steadying
incident at the eighth pole, but determined there was no foul.

WHOSE THAT LADY settled back off the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled three
wide into the stretch, dug in to take over later yards and ran clear under the wire. KIM'S DIAMOND settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, eased
out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, circled opponents six wide on the far turn and dug in through the lane to take second the final
yards. DIAMOND TRAIN saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was eased outward on the far turn, entered the
stretch in the seven path then closed well to take third the final yards. BUFF N stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and appeared a
solid factor in the three path of the far turn, dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch, but flattened later yards. GOIN GANGSTA rated a slim lead inside, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch then weakened the final
sixteenth. LIL MISS FIBER settled close about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three wide then
weakened. ELLIE BEAR rated just off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded approaching the far turn. This race was
hand timed.

DECEITFUL ANTHONY settled off the pace toward the inside on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, edged toward contention nearing the five
sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide at the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on. GOOFY BOY saved
early ground then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, steadily improved in the three path of the far turn and was steadily encouraged to make late
gains. COMPROMISO raced well back while saving ground the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then angled
to the five path toward the head of the lane and dug in to take third the final strides. DYNAMIC DAY became fractious and sat in the gate then set the pace
inside entering the first turn, was met a the nine sixteenths pole and dueled through the backstretch, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened inside the eighth pole. BROTHER SKYE raced with the early pace then took a slim lead at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure past
the three eighths, gave up the lead at the quarter pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. FLAMING HOT saved ground off the pace and
showed little response through the backstretch. TIZ AUCTION TIME raced with the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase nearing the

of that one approaching the quarter pole and was steadily handled down the lane. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW rated close toward the inside then picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in through the final furlong and was gaining late. MACKENZIE'S STAR stalked
off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and came along
for third mid-stretch. RUN ON ENERGY saved ground the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showe little
more. LONGSTORYLUCY saved ground well off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran
in the four path of the far turn but showed little further. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY was reluctant to load then stalked two deep, challenged into the backstretch

Footnotes
MOONLIT SHADOW moved to the lead shortly after the start and rated the pace inside, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. EYE OF THE NEEDLE rated close inside the first turn, started a bid approaching the five
sixteenths pole, took aim two deep midway on the far turn but couldn't improve further and settled for second. STELLA SEVILLE raced well back while
saving early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, eased outward on the far turn and entered the stretch four wide and was along for third
mid-stretch. FEEL THE LOVE veered out leaving the gate then saved some ground on the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. CREATIVE SPLENDOR ran in the three path the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened into the far turn. ELLIES LIL CASTLE stalked two deep the first turn, gave chase
past the seven sixteenths pole then weakened three wide on the far turn. HANDSOME JOANIE saved ground off the pace the first turn then faded through
the backstretch.
