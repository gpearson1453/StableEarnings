Footnotes
ONE BAD DUDE raced forwardly while four wide, advanced on the turn, dug in for the stretch and gamely held APPLICANT safe. The latter ducked in at the
start, settled well, moved closer on the turn and finished willingly. STORM THE FIELD stalked the pace and lacked a substantive rally. CIRCUIT RIDER
failed to threaten. MASTEROFMATRIMONY led early, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN veered in at the start and did not
factor. CANTWAITTOGRADUATE was always outrun. COMEGETSOME was bothered at the start and never involved.
