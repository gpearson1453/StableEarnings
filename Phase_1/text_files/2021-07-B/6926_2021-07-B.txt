Footnotes
MURDO pressed the pace two wide and in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, caught the leader after straightening and
drove clear. EL PIQUIN set the pace while under pressure and in the two path through the turn, dueled with the winner into the lane, could not keep up with
the winner after straightening in the lane but kept on well to be clear for the place spot. CHRISTMAS PRESENT raced along the inside into the turn, moved
off the rail and into the three path in late turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and offered a mild gain while drifting in three paths through the last
eighth. KULMER was just off the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three path then advanced along the rail when not a serious threat.
COPLEY was in the four to the three path through the turn when chasing the pace then tired. LEMME C UR VOUCHER pressed the early pace three wide
into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
JOVA chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, made first run on the tiring pacesetter in mid-turn, quickly cleared into the lane while in the four or
five path, widened to the eighth pole and was under strong handling to hold. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN was unhurried while off the inside, moved three wide
through the turn when gaining interest, came into the lane from the six path with aim on the leader then steadily closed ground on that one but ran out of real
estate. INTREPID HEART reserved into the far turn while moving through the four path, was asked for more entering the lane, straightened in the five or six
path and offered a belated gain while angling in late. TWO LAST WORDS was in the two path through the turns and into the lane then finished evenly.
PERUVIAN BOY was along the inside through the far turn and never was a factor. RARE FORM hustled out to gain the lead at once, widened through the
firs turn and into the backstretch, continued clear into the far turn, was caught before the three-eighths pole, chased the new leader into the lane and was
done.

VEGAS WEEKEND chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch, pressed the leader into the far turn, inched to the front into the lane then
widened through the final eighth. HYPERNOVA set the pace while near the rail into the far turn, was joined by the winner in mid-turn, stayed with that one
into the lane then could not keep up. ROC'S PRINCESS chased the top two around the course and lacked a closing response. IN A DREAM was always
last along the inside. The half-mile time was hand timed..

THUNDERSTRUCK set the pace from the outset while in the two path through the turn, widened each call and extended the advantage while being ridden
out. SUMMER HOME was in the four path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path with momentum and moved up to be
second best while never a threat to the top one. SHARP JUSTICE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and raced a
bit erratically through the final eighth while being clear for the show spot. MISS SUGARBAKER was along the inside through the turn and into the lane when
a contender, could not gain on the top one and lost the show spot late. LOOKIN ROYAL was unhurried while in the three to the two path through the turn,
entered the lane from the three or four path, angled in inside the eighth pole and showed belated interest. DREAMERS DREAM was near the rail through
the turn and and never was a serious factor. BETRAYAL chased the pace from the three path into the turn and was empty late. GET LUCKY JUSTICE was
in the four to the three path through the turn and made no impact. JOY UNBRIDLED was slow away while brushing the gate, rushed up to contend into the
turn, chased the winner into the lane and retreated. JAVJAVJAVIE got off slowly and trailed along the inside.

Footnotes
MOJO MAN was four wide into the turn when never far back, continued in the four path through the turn, entered the lane from the five path, lost a bit of
ground straightening for the stretch run, inched up from the five path, caught the leader approaching the sixteenth pole then edged clear late. DOUBLE
TUFF was two wide through the turn when inching up on the leader, came into the lane from the three path with aim on the top one, was joined by the
winner outside the eighth pole, continued between rivals to inside the sixteenth pole and was outfinished while saving the place spot. LONG WEEKEND
vied for the lead two wide into the turn, gained the lead after mid-turn, continued with a short lead into the lane, dueled with the top two near the eighth pole
then could not keep up after the sixteenth pole. HOME BASE was in the two path when behind rivals through the turn, came into the lane from the three
path, continued to shift out, was in the seven path inside the eighth pole and never was a threat. ROCK N JUNE BUG hustled to the lead soon after the
start, raced under pressure with the lead into mid-turn, was headed soon after and steadily faded along the rail.
