RUMPOLE dueled for the early lead, responded gamely to brisk pressure on the inside and prevailed. NORTH SIDE forced the pace, gained a narrow lead
on the turn and finished willingly. TARUCA outrun early, commenced a bid on the turn, was swung out five wide into the stretch and kept on. LOUD N
PROUD chased the pacesetters, remained in contention for the stretch run and had no finishing punch. GO GET THAT settled while three wide, moved out
four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed bid. KING OF CANDY hopped at the start and never reached contention. BLACKTOP LEGEND raced
forwardly while four wide and faded.
