RULE FOLLOWER came inward and soundly bumped QUALITY HOUR in the opening strides, was lightly nudged early to take the lead, set the pace while
clear and in hand in the two path on the far turn, opened up a large lead when asked lightly in hand in upper stretch, and was allowed to canter home the
final furlong. RETAIN was bumped by QUALITY HOUR in the final strides after that one was bumped by RULE FOLLOWER, settled at the rear, trailed in
the two to three path on the turn, took closer order on the chasing flight into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out but nonetheless chased on
well enough to get up for the place near the sixteenth mark. OUTRIDER broke sharply but slightly outward, stalked the leader down the backstretch and in
the three path on the turn, was pushed along near the three eighths, proved no match for RULE FOLLOWER past the five sixteenths, was driven into the
lane in the four path, and flattened out late. QUALITY HOUR was bumped soundly by RULE FOLLOWER in the opening strides and bumped into RETAIN
as a result, chased the leading pair down the backstretch, inched into closer order inside of OUTRIDER while racing in the two path on the turn, was driven
inside into the lane and came up empty.

JOEY B chased the leading pair into the clubhouse turn, gradually inched forward inside down the backstretch to track the leading pair inside of RIVER
EVANGELIST, tracked while saving ground around the far turn, shifted two wide into upper stretch, came out and forced SPLASH FOR GOLD out near the
eighth, rallied under a drive in the final furlong and got up in time. CADET CAPTAIN cleared to the lead into the clubhouse turn, set a measured pace
through that bend and down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, continued on the lead as SPLASH FOR GOLD encroached to his outside
nearing the five sixteenths, turned back that foe into the lane, cleared through midstretch, kept on under a drive late but was caught. SPLASH FOR GOLD
tracked the pace leader through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, made a two wide bid past the three eighths, loomed from the five sixteenths
to the head of the stretch, proved no match for CADET CAPTAIN into the lane, was bumped and carried out by JOEY B midstretch when that foe came out,
and flattened late. TIMINGISEVERYTHING chased two wide outside of JOEY B through the clubhouse turn, kept on in second last down the backstretch,
chased four wide around the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled at the rear into the
clubhouse turn, trailed down the backstretch and in the three path around the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, came into the lane still in the
three path, and passed a tiring horse. RIVER EVANGELIST raced at the rear into the clubhouse turn, advanced around that bend to track the leading pair
past the seven eighths and into the backstretch, raced three wide into the far turn, began to weaken from the seven sixteenths and had no more for the
drive. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

the three path and dueled gamely in upper stretch to prevail in the final sixteenth of a mile. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC tracked the leaders in the middle of the
pack through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two and three path around the turn, and gained ground steadily on the outside in late stretch.
DREAM KEEPER dueled for the lead on the inside early, opened up to lead the field outright while saving ground around the turn, battled in upper stretch
and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile. SPECIAL PRYCE pressed the pace on the outside in the opening stages, dropped back to chase the leader
headed into the turn, raced in the two path from there, and weakened between horses in the final furlong. DUCKDEVIL raced off the pace on the outside up
the backstretch, began a bid between horses approaching the half mile pole, improved position while saving ground around the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. COMMODORE PERRY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and tired entering the

Footnotes
DARK WOOD (IRE) chased at the middle of a strung out field through the clubhouse turn, took closer order down the backstretch, was pushed along inside
of EGOMANIAC into the far turn, chased in the two to three path around that bend, was urged inside into the stretch, shifted out five wide in upper stretch
for the drive, rallied, led three wide with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and cleared. TOM'S LAST GENERAL settled toward the rear of the main group
through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was patient while positioned three wide into the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths,
rallied between horses into the lane, dove inside of DARK WOOD near the three sixteenths as that one was shifting out, rallied up the inside and proved
second best. AGAVE KID led into the clubhouse turn, was engaged and headed by LADY CREED to his outside near the eleven sixteenths, tracked the
pace as that foe edged clear into the backstretch, engaged inside her again near the five eighths, continued to press from the inside while saving ground
around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, cleared through midstretch, but was outfinished between horses. LADY CREED was unruly in the post
parade, did not break on top but advanced to engage outside of AGAVE KID near the fifteen sixteenths, led narrowly into the backstretch, briefly inched
clear, was once again pressed from the inside by AGAVE KID from near the five eighths, carried a narrow and pressured lead two wide on the far turn, was
headed in upper stretch and flattened out. MANGO TREE soon trailed, took closer order five wide on the far turn, was driven seven wide into the lane, and
lacked the needed kick. POWERFUL MAN chased well behind the leading pair through the far turn, edged closer to them down the backstretch, tracked that
pair while positioned three wide through the far turn, floated six wide into upper stretch and weakened. EGOMANIAC settled at the rear of the main group
through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, began a mild outside bid past the five eighths, chased four wide on the far turn, was driven three wide
into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
DEVILEYE dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a formidable bid from the rail nearing the eighth pole and
gained ground quickly in the final furlong to get his head in front in time. I'M CORFU pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to duel
for the lead from the two path around the turn, continued to battle gamely down the lane and was caught in the final stride. WHAT'S UP DUDE raced off the
pace on the inside early, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn, swung out entering the stretch and gained ground quickly on the
outside in late stretch. WELLABLED broke quickly, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn
and continued to battle down the stretch, giving way in the final strides. HIDE THE DEMON brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, improved position mildly in upper stretch and was no match for the top
finishers. WILE E PEYOTE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn between horses
in the two path and was outkicked from there. NUCLEAR OPTION brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and faded entering the stretch.

Footnotes
HERE COMES KYLE was reluctant to walk to the gate, tossed his head at the break and was hard to settle afterward, soon trailed, began to edge closer in
the three path on the turn, swung out five wide into the lane for the drive, rallied, and took the lead outside of BOOM BOX and MONGOL BULL near forty
yards out. BOOM BOX chased midpack early, tracked behind the leading line into the turn, saved ground around the bend while edging closer, chased
MONGOL BULL under a drive in upper stretch, sustained his rally between horses, but was narrowly outkicked by the winner. MONGOL BULL was sent to
the lead, briefly raced clear early, was confronted by a line of foes outside him into the turn, inched clear again in the two path around the bend, continued
clear through midstretch, held a diminishing lead resolutely under a drive but was caught near forty yards out. SHANGHAI POINT was pushed along to
show speed, attended the pace three wide approaching the turn, steadied near the three eighths, chased in the four path around the rest of the turn,
dropped toward the inside and was driven into the lane, and chased on best of the rest. RIPE ATTACK broke midpack but was urged to attend the pace four
deep into the turn, tracked the leader four wide around the bend, was outkicked by the pacesetter into the lane and flattened out. POWER CRY was sent for
speed, engaged to prompt outside of MONGOL BULL into the turn, was pushed along three wide around the bend as that leader edged clear, and emptied
out two wide into the lane. SEANSHINE chased inside of BOOM BOX early, settled back second last into the turn, began to lose position from the seven
sixteenths while racing in the two path, was driven inside into the lane and offered no further response.

Footnotes
SIMPLE LOGIC dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, took over while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
drew off down the lane while drifting out late. GOOD YEGG raced off the pace on the inside early, began to move up while saving ground around the turn,
drifted mildly in midstretch and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. PERFECT DIVA dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening
quarter of a mile, dropped back to chase the leader from the three path around the turn and finished well on the outside in late stretch. LOOK AWAY raced
off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, still at the back of the pack, and passed tiring horses in the stretch.
DREAM ATTACK raced at the back of the pack in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, improved position mildly in upper stretch and was
no match. ROCKET RIDE lugged in leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. POLITO tracked
the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and faded on the rail in the final furlong.
KINGSBURRY ATTACK chased the leaders on the inside through the opening half mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and
continued to tire from there.
