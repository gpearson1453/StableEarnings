Footnotes
INDIAN LAKE was able to clear off early and dictate under rating and towards the inside, was put to asking as rivals gained near the five sixteenths, spurted
away under a strong drive in mid stretch then dug in late to hold off EXPERIENCED. EXPERIENCED settled in the clear, took closer order while off the rail
nearing the half mile marker, came under firmer asking past the three eighths, circled four wide with momentum into the lane, switched leads twice through
the final furlong and finished well to gain. WOOTTON ASSET (FR) rated in range while in the two path, angled three wide leaving the five eighths and
picked up the chase, loomed three wide when advancing towards the quarter pole but failed to sustain through the final furlong. TAKE PROFIT , unhurried
early while saving ground, angled out under a ride nearing the lane, moved up between foes leaving the eighth pole then continued on willingly to the inside
of WOOTTON ASSET (FR). HANFORD tracked inside while in hand, remained a forward factor under a ride past the five sixteenths but lacked a solid
response. SHACKLED LOVE , taken in hand and stalked the winner two wide, was under a ride pursuing into the lane, failed to kick on past the three
sixteenths and gave way.

EIGHT OAKS stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn three deep, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole, drifted in near
the sixteenth pole and lasted. CONGRESS HALL lacked speed, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch and rallied outside. FAMILY FORTUNE ,
two wide on the turn, chased the pace, was well positioned in mid stretch and flattened out. SACRED LADY bumped with ZIG leaving the starting gate,
raced inside horses throughout and failed to rally. ARBUTUS lacked speed and showed a mild, late move. ZIG bumped with SACRED LADY leaving the
starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, saved ground on the turn and gave way.

CAN THE QUEEN rated kindly three wide and to the outside of foes early on, took measure of the leader into the lane, responded and secured command
past the three sixteenths, opened up under a drive heading to the sixteenth marker then held firm while kept to task. FLYINGONTHEGROUND , brushed at
the break, saved ground off of a somewhat contested pace, angled out four wide for the drive, straightened away and finished with good energy. WHAT A
TRICK vied inside early on, shook clear under some rating around the turn, was hooked near the three sixteenths, fought on to past mid stretch and faded.
GOLDEN CAN had speed between foes, steadied back out the pace battle heading towards the turn, regrouped to stalk, came three wide for the drive but
lacked a solid response. SO GRACIOUS settled outside a rival, swung five wide into the lane but lacked a serious response. DENDROBIA , in close at the
break, lagged well back while saving ground, angled six wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. PAT'S NO FOOL , sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
SCOTTSDALE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and held sway under steady handling. LITTLE BAY , a forward factor between
horses on the turn, chased the winner through the stretch in an even effort. GOLDEN G , four deep on the turn, failed to rally in an even showing. POWER
BACK lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones with a late move. ZIP THE LIP , lightly steadied along the inner rail near
the three eighths pole, was no factor. GET LIT , sluggish leaving the starting gate, was four deep entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. PRICEY
VICTORY , inside horses around the turn, chased the pace and gave way. TRUE SHIPMAN trailed.

Footnotes
TIGHTLY TWISTED drafted in towards the rail early on and gained a tracking spot, rated kindly inside rivals through the backstretch run, eased out and was
put to pressure leaving the five sixteenths, responded and forged clear under left handed rousing in mid stretch, was corrected with right handed stick work
after drifting a bit then dug in tenaciously to fend off COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE). COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) settled off the rail, edged up behind rivals
nearing the half mile marker, dropped in towards the rail and followed the winner past the quarter pole, shifted out to close willingly and steadily bridged the
gap. SAILINGINTOTHEWIND pulled her way clear early and set a rated pace, had rivals close in near the half mile pole, spurted back away after roused
leaving the far turn, could not resist the winner inside the three sixteenths then weakened through the final seventy yards. MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE)
broke a step slow, settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane but lacked a solid response. SISTER HANAN was hung out three deep around the first
turn, remained wide stalking the pace, failed to kick on under a ride past the five sixteenths and faded. NO MO LADY prompted the pace two wide, was
ridden along leaving the three eighths pole, gave futile chase into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
FIELD PASS , taken to rate off the leader and saved ground, awaited room near the five sixteenths, took advantage of a seam along the rail past the three
sixteenths, responded and got through to challenge past mid stretch, kept on determinedly under strong handling and forged ahead in the final yards.
RAMSEY SOLUTION was nudged to the front in the opening furlong, dropped in a bit and set the pace, stayed off the rail into the lane and past the three
sixteenths allowing the winner room, dug in when confronted leaving the furlong grounds, battled gamely but just wasn't quite good enough. TALK OR
LISTEN (IRE) tracked the pace three wide, had aim under a ride into the stretch but lacked the needed finish. POSTERITY , never far back, was under a
ride three wide into the lane but failed to generate a legitimate response.

Footnotes
EXTRA MEDIUM , unhurried behind horses down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, angled to the four path in mid stretch, closed outside foes late
and was up approaching the finish. TOM TERRIFIC , between horses around the turn, battled outside FLAT RATE through the stretch and finished gamely.
FLAT RATE showed speed, hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace, raced on his left lead in stretch and finished gamely. CONFUSION BABY BOY
showed speed between horses down the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and failed to rally. PASCAL CHANT , four deep prompting the pace around
the turn, weakened. TICKER TAPE PARADE , five deep entering the stretch, was not a factor.
