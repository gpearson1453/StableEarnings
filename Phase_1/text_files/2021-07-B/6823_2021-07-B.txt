Footnotes
JENNIFER'S ARCH away in good order, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch closest to the inside, dueled into and through the turn, inherited a
clear advantage when the other speed fell in upper stretch, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. SWORN SILENCE in the second group off the
inside, chased the dueling leaders into the lane, bothered slightly when TIZ THE TIME fell in front of her, could not get to the winner late, remained clear of
the others. GOLDEN BET hopped at the break to be off a step slow, trailed early, finished up best of the rest. FRENZY chased the dueling leaders early,
began to fade before three furlongs. TIZ THE TIME broke alertly, pressed the winner early to that one's outside, dueled through the turn, fell upper stretch
and was injured, vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN OUT OF THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.

JAZZ IT UP broke sharp, set the pace inside, rated in the run through the turn, drew out through the lane while being kept to task. TEN BUDS chased the
winner in vain throughout, proved no match, clear for the place. SCHEMER last away, raced off the pace along the inside, continued to save the most
ground through the turn, improved position slightly. CAN IF I CAN settled off the pace just off the inside, came up empty for the drive. SHOT ON WINDY
HILL broke back, continued to lack speed, failed to muster a response in the drive. CLOSING AMERICAN broke in then veered out sharply, remained back
and was not a factor.

BEYOND D'ORO broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternated in the run up the backstretch and through the final turn, disposed of the
other speed when straightened for home, steadily increased advantage under brisk right handed pressure. APHRODITES REVENGE off the early pace
after breaking back, ranged up four wide into a challenging position turning for home, drifted out in upper stretch then could not match the winner in the run
to the wire. STORM BREACH alternated up front inside the winner, first to blink exiting the final turn, continued to weaken to the finish while comfortably
saving the show. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN chased the dueling leaders for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. EYESEEMONEY broke back, trailed,
finished well back to be always outrun.

Footnotes
THREE EYED RAVEN last to leave, lagged in the run up the backstretch, ranged up five wide to become a forward factor late in the turn, challenged on the
outside to the leaders inside the furlong marker, proved best in a determined effort. LADDIE BOY moved up to within striking distance soon after the start,
three wide behind the leaders through the turn, roused right handed turning for home, bid, took over just inside the furlong grounds, could not contain the
winner in the final strides. SOUTHERN SWAGG broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to show the way into the lane, drifted slightly
approaching midstretch, weakened a bit, saved the show. I'LL RAISE YOU void of speed outside, four out to five wide turning for home, improved with some
moderate late interest while widest in the drive. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI broke well, chased the early leader off the inside, moved up to briefly challenge that
one turning for home, caved in the drive. MISTAKE PRESENT raced back off the early pace, failed to muster a rally. WHENTHEDOVESCRY tired while

Footnotes
JACKS RUN WILD close from the start off the inside, challenged in the turn while between horses, dueled into the lane, edged away late under steady
handling. MADAME JANE forwardly placed while racing outside, three wide bid outside the winner turn, dueled with that one into the lane, could not keep up
the final furlong, far clear of the others. TAYLORS BABE in the second flight, came three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to be up late for the show,
not a threat to the top two. SARAH'S GOLDEN broke alertly, narrowly showed the way into the turn, vied inside the top two late in the bend, could not keep
up with that duo in the drive, weakened late to be caught for the show spot. GRIS TORMENTA broke slowly and outward, trailed early, improved late turn,
flattened out in the drive to finish up evenly. YAZHI OKEUS in mid pack while racing off the inside, four wide exiting the turn, went evenly to the wire.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS broke back, moved outside, came five wide into the lane, lacked a rally. NOT THIS LUNA broke flat footed to be slow away,
raced in traffic late in the turn, got through along the rail entering the stretch, lacked closing bid.

MOMENT moved up to narrowly show the way through the first turn off the inside, continued to set a legit pace the middle half, shrugged off the other speed
to be well clear when straightened for home, all out to just last in the final strides. MAROON MANIAC allowed the pace to go early, came three wide when
advancing into the stretch, late punch on the leader outside that one to narrowly miss. DANCE KINGDOM last to leave, lacked speed, two path through the
final turn, roused for the drive, closed ground on the top two in the final sixteenth. GOOD INTENT void of speed, moved out, came four wide for the drive,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. ELUSIVE D'ORO pressured the winner from along the inside for six furlongs, gave way in the drive.
TRIVISTA forwardly placed in the early going, beat a steady retreat. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
BLACK SWORD in mid pack while racing outside, four out to five wide into the lane, set down, challenged while widest past the furlong marker, kicked well
clear while under a steady right handed crop. IZZY'S BABY BOY back off the early pace, in some traffic late in the turn, split foes in midstretch, finished
willingly to be edging clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. SMOOTH COLLIERY broke out and slowly, raced back, moved a bit closer then
steadied and was shuffled back late in the turn, lagged into the lane, mounted a belated rally through some traffic to be up for the show. C'MON VE broke
sharp, dueled up front off the inside, narrowly showed the way through upper stretch and past the furlong marker, proved stubborn until late. FIRE
BLASTER back off the pace and the inside, steered out around some traffic and came four wide and behind the winner turning for home, could not keep up
with that one to the wire while improving position slightly late. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR forwardly placed in the early going, saved some ground through the
turn, had little left for the stretch run. SR. CLARKY forwardly placed for four furlongs, weakened in the drive. DOUBLE BARREL MAN remained always
back. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER dueled up front closest to the inside for a half and backed up through the lane. CAJUN UP broke out, was always outrun
while racing four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
MISS HURRYUPNWAIT stalked the early leader off the inside, advanced and challenged between horses late in the turn, long drive, proved best under
steady handlng. TAP THE CAT forwardly placed outside, advanced to the fore outside the winner late in the bend, pressed that one through upper stretch,
gave ground grudgingly to that rival late, edged clear for the place. ITS GLITTER TIME off a step slow, moved up to race off the early pace, came in the two
path for the drive, displayed some late interest to be closing the gap on the top two. LAST GHOST void of speed, moved outside for the drive, improved
position, not enough for the show late. BESTIEVERHAD sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way through much of the turn, gave way when
headed by the top two entering the stretch. LITTLE WILD ROSE was finished early to be always outrun. G G'S WRECKINGBALL back off the pace, lost iron
midway up the backstretch, raced outside through the turn when fading, trailed home.
