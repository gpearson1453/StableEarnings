Footnotes
LONGLIVEJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, quickly cleared when straightened then widened to
the wire while drifting from the four to the two path late. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE unhurried while in the the three then the four path through late turn, came
into the lane from the four path with aim on the leader, could not gain on that one while finishing well clear for the place spot. MELTDOWN vied for the lead
while two wide through the turn, gained the lead after mid-turn, was joined by the winner into the lane, was no match for that one and just saved the show
spot. ASTROMAN saved ground through the turn and into the lane and missed the show spot while not a serious threat. TAY'S LAST CHANCE was in the
four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and never was a factor. TIP UP TOWN saved ground to no avail. DEFENCE MODEL vied for
the lead along the inside into the turn, continued on near even terms with the others into the lane then gave way along the rail. RUH ROH RAGGY stumbled
at the start, moved up to mid-pack and was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
HOPPED UP chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained the lead into the lane, was clear
with an eighth to go then inched away through the final sixteenth. MR HOOVER was in the four to the three path through the first turn, followed the winner
through late turn while moving into the four path, came into the lane from the seven path and could only chase the top one home. SEMINOLE JUSTICE
pressed the pace two wide through the far turn, dueled into the lane, could not keep up outside the eighth pole then kept on to save the show spot.
ALTERNATE NIGHTS chased the pace from along the inside into the lane then lacked a closing kick. DAAHER STREET was never a factor while in the two
or three path through the far turn. EL BOHEMIO set the pace along the inside while under pressure through the far turn then gave way entering the lane.

Footnotes
PARKER was checked off heels into the first turn, raced well off the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, was five wide in late turn when gaining
momentum, entered the lane from the seven path and finished with steady energy to just be up in time. BENNY'S LEGACY stalked the pace from the three
path, bid three wide through mid-turn and into the lane, cleared when straightened, continued on a clear lead inside the eighth pole then could not hold the
winner safe. R B BANNER vied for the lead two wide into the turn, continued between rivals while on near even terms into the lane then yielded to the
runner-up after straightening into the lane. IT'S THE SUNRISE moved into the far turn four wide continued four wide through the turn when moving to near
even terms for the lead, continued a serious threat while in the four path into the lane then flattened out late. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE was never a serious
factor while near the rail through the turns. KULMER vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, began losing ground after mid-turn then faded
through the lane. HEZA MISCHIEF was near the rail into the far when being pulled along by the field then was done after entering the lane.

Footnotes
SACRED SKY hustled up to quickly clear before the first call, continued on a clear lead through the turn while near the rail, widened into the lane, was
asked for more just inside the eighth pole then drew away. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG raced along the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the
three path, angled in after the eighth pole then showed energy late to be up for the place spot. MUSTY RED tracked the pace along the inside through the
turn and into the lane, was in the two path while chasing the winner through the final eighth and was caught for the place spot along the rail. BENNY BOO
BOO settled to the back, guided out of the two path and into the five path and four wide in late turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up
while not a threat. FRENCH KID stalked the pace from the three to the two path through the turn and into the lane then tired. GO EARLY STAY LATE was
never a factor while in the four path through the turn. GREAT STYLE chased the pace from the two path through the turn then steadily faded. TALK FAST
was done early while along the inside.
