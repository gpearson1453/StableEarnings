Footnotes
COPPER HALO sat just off of the early leaders, mounted a bid leaving the quarter-pole to challenge the pacesetters, extended the lead off of the turn and
drew clear in the end. ROUSING SLAMMER dueled for pace duties through the turn while saving ground in the two path, lost ground off of the the turn and
weakened in the stretch run while besting the rest. THEYREMINISCEOVERU chased the dueling pacesetters through the turn while four wide between
horses and tired in the stretch run. TIME TO ZOOM had no speed early, was five wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch run. ANOTHER CHAMP
dueled for the early lead with ROUSING SLAMMER, was outrun on the turn while three wide and gave out in the stretch.

MOOGIE CAT broke alertly and set contested fractions through the turn while two wide, extended the lead off of the turn but was pressured late by the
runner-up and held on to prevail. PROOF OF PARANOIA pressed the pace through the turn, lost ground coming off of the turn but made a late push in the
final sixteenth to challenge the winner and just missed, while holding on for the place. LUCKY CAUSE was away a step slowly, chased the early fractions
then vied for the lead on the turn while four wide, lost ground off of the turn but made a late bid inside of the sixteenth pole and just missed for second.
PROUD MUSKET chased the field from the rear while three wide on the turn, swung widest into the stretch and made a mild late bid but was not pressuring
the top three.

SOMARA sat just off of the early pace while two wide on the turn, mounted a bid off of the turn to confront CHARGING HOME, battled with that one for the
final furlong and just won the head nod at the end to prevail. CHARGING HOME broke alertly and set the pace through the turn while three wide, was
confronted inside of the eighth pole by SOMARA, battled with that one and was just nipped at the wire, while a clear second over the rest. COASTAL
STARLITE settled in the midflight in the early going, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but finished evenly in the stretch run.
RAMONCITA LIGHT tracked the pace through the turn while three wide and did not offer a rally in the stretch run. SLIGHTLY broke last of the field, trailed
through the turn while five wide and was not a factor. MADAME JEANETTE dueled with CHARGING HOME on the front end for the first quarter-mile,
chased that one on the turn while four wide and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CODE RIBBON was off a step slowly, tracked the leaders into the turn, was three wide on the turn while gaining ground, confronted FIRE ESCAPE nearing
the furlong marker, wore that one down and drew clear in the end in a good debut. FIRE ESCAPE set all of the pace through the turn while saving ground,
was confronted by the winner nearing the eighth pole, briefly battled back but could not hold CODE RIBBON off and was outfinished while an easy second
over the rest. JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET chased the pace through the turn while four wide, gained ground on the turn but was outrun into the lane and
weakened in the final stages. MAGGIE BE MINE was away slowly and had no speed early, was five wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch.
REMEMBER SUE was allowed to settle in the early going, was five wide on the turn and tired in the stretch drive. HELLO BABY stalked the pace, was four
wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch run.

NARDINI prompted the pace by DUTCH PAINTING while rating kindly through the early stages, was four wide on the second turn, overhauled the runner-up
off of the turn and drew off in the stretch. DUTCH PAINTING (GB) set contested fractions into the second turn, was three wide on that turn when confronted
by the winner, was outrun into the stretch and was no match for the winner but a clear second over the rest. TIME VOYAGE (IRE) was allowed to settle in
the early stages, saved ground on the second turn while improving position but did not go on with that run and flattened out in the stretch. CONVINCE
chased the pace for a half-mile, was four wide on the second turn while losing ground and gave way in the stretch. ROSE PRINCESS was unhurried in the
early going, was three wide on the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

DAY PLAN set contested fractions through the turn while saving ground, put away that rival off of the turn and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. DO
YOU HEAR THAT stalked the early pace, was three then four wide into the stretch and was outfinished in the drive while besting the rest. JEANNE B
chased the dueling pacesetters while six wide on the turn and finished willingly in the stretch to get third. SWIFT NONNI pressed the pace of DAY PLAN
through the turn while three wide, lost ground off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN was away a step slowly and had no
speed early, saved ground while two wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. POINT BREAK settled at the rear of the field, was five wide on the turn
and did not offer a bid in the stretch. TESS'S WILD CAT tracked the pace while two wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch run. EMPIRE HOUSE
stumbled at the start, then was soon pinched by neighboring horses, steadied leaving the quarter-pole and tired in the late going.
