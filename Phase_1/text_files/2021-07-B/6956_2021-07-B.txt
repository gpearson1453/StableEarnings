Footnotes
GRECIAN ADMIRAL hopped from the gate and was pinched a stride later, settled back off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid
toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage while two deep, took the nod approaching the eighth pole and dug in from
that point to draw clear later yards. MELDON rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the
rail on the far turn, gave up the nod nearing the eighth pole, raced close in the upper stretch but yielded later yards. LUCKY PENGUIN stalked the early
pace two deep then settled close into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled three wide into
the stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. WHAT A STORY saved early ground racing well back, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and
could only improve position at the rail on the far turn. ANY WAY NOW stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase from the three eighths pole then
weakened into the far turn. This race was hand timed.

WHALE OF A RIDE was hustled along in close chase then eased off the rail approaching the quarter pole, dueled for the nod in the three path nearing the
head of the lane then dug in under determined handling to inch further ahead of ROCK BREAK through the final yards, while the latter was hustled along on
the lead, raced clear at the five sixteenths pole and moved to the rail nearing the quarter, was caught toward the eighth pole and dug in gamely, though,
relented later yards. OFFICER UNBRIDLED gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly down the lane. IN
THE GOSPEL chased, raced in the three path of the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. VIDMER'S COURAGE chased through the
backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and passed a rival in an even finish. BEAR'S ESTATE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then

NORTH ATLANTIC raced well off the early pace while saving ground, gave chase into the backstretch and improved four and five wide on the far turn,
lugged in across the path of Aaron's Tap leaving the eighth pole then dug in to get up the final strides. FANCY CONCHO raced off the pace in the three path
the opening turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and took a slim lead four wide approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch but
was caught in the final strides. HERO'S MAN contested the pace inside through the front stretch then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, checked at the
rail past the three eighths, eased out to resume his bid and raced off the rail while between horses on the far turn, came back to take third later yards then
flattened stride. AARON'S TAP saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced a close factor three wide on the far
turn, checked at the heels of North Atlantic past the eighth pole then weakened leaving the pole. SAGEBRUSH contested the pace through the front stretch
then took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail toward the head of the lane
then weakened the final sixteenth. SHY GUY raced in the four path the first turn and was well back leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, closed the gap at the rail on the far turn but showed little more in the lane.

yards. EPIC WEST took the lead past the half mile pole and rated the pace, was pressured at the quarter pole and raced near the rail on the turn, lost
ground into the lane, dug in under steady encouragement and was outfinished the final yards. UNION GRACE gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn,
eased to the five path leaving the turn and dueled for third. FLUENT IN SARCASM chased inside, steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, resumed
the drive past the quarter then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. DREAM D'ORO chased through the backstretch, raced in the five path of the turn and
passed a rival in an even finish. BUCKED TOOTH chased, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. BOURBON STREET rounded the turn
off the rail then flattened stride. SCHLOSSER gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane.
