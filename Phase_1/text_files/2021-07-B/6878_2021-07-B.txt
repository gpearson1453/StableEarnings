Footnotes
DULCE KIARA was off slowly, settled off the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn, had to wait for room nearing the quarter pole,
angled three wide at the eighth pole to split rivals and finished well to get up under strong handling. HASHTAG LUCKY stalked the early pace, raced four
wide around the far turn, moved up five wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished second best. MEXICALI ROSE showed good early speed to set all the
pace, raced just off the inside through the stretch and weakened a bit in the final stages. PEACE OUT pressed the early pace while racing between rivals
and weakened in the drive. TIPSY TOURIST settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MISS BOSCONOVITCH
was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced three to four wide through the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BRUTUS tracked the early leader while racing three wide, took command nearing the far turn, raced off the inside in the stretch run and held gamely to be
clear under strong encouragement. SAVVY STREET was allowed to settle early on, moved up around the far turn, shifted out nearing the eighth pole while
racing four to five wide and finished second best. CHARGING LION stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole and kept on
willingly to the wire. DASHING LOU settled towards the back of the pack early, raced four wide past the quarter pole and had no late response. HAYNE'S
FEVER was slow early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GLENGAR showed good early speed to set all the pace and tired
readily.

Footnotes
FOX FORCE FIVE was unhurried in the early stages, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to be clear under steady handling.
NAUGHTY NOTION showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced just off the inside in the lane and couldn't match strides with the winner in the final
stages to finish second best. MONSTER RISING stalked the pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. LEIA ORGANA
stalked the early pace, raced three wide while racing between rivals in the stretch run and had not enough. LOVE MY CAT settled off the early going, raced
five wide at the eighth pole and had no late rally. PAU HANA raced up close in the early stages, saved ground and had no late response. BLAZE FINERY
dropped back early, awaited room into the lane while racing from the inside and never was a serious threat. NOTION INTERRUPTUS was off a step slow,
raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

JOYFUL NOISE settled off the early going, moved up five wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. STAY OUT pressed the
early leader, took command nearing the far turn, raced three deep in the lane and finished second best. CALYPSO GHOST showed good speed from the
inside and weakened a bit in the drive while racing four wide. AWESOME PAL broke to the outside, was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced
six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. SILENT FLUIDITY was off a step slow, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.
BUSTIN HEARTS stalked the top pair early on and weakened a bit in the drive while racing three wide. PROMENADE PRINCESS settled off the early pace,
raced towards the inside around the far turn, gave way and walked off after being pulled up near the sixteenth pole.
