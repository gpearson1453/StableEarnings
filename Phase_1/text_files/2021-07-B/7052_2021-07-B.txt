Footnotes
JUMP RIGHT IN set the early pace while near the inside, passed before the first call, guided into the two path into the turn, pressed the pacesetter through
the turn, asked for more into the lane, drove clear and was ridden out late. APRON STRINGS was in the four path through the turn when never far back, bid
into the lane from the four path, got closest to the winner outside the eighth pole, could not gain on that one but finished well clear of the next rival. NIECE
JACKIE DAVIS was unhurried while along the inside through the turn, came off the rail into the lane and advanced from the three path. BETCHA set the
pace along the inside through the turn then gave way after entering the lane. MYERS TIGER reared at the start, nearly lost rider and spotted the field about
five lengths, hustled up to rejoin the others, moved into contending position in mid-turn then was empty after straightening in the lane. QUITE A BABE was
outrun while along the inside.

Footnotes
SWEET SKY set the pace from the outset while racing near the inside, came into the lane from the two path, was under a drive through the lane and held in
an impressive first effort. LITTLE MAEMI chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was slowly inching
up late. Z'S LUCKY GIRL stalked the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, was a serious contender with an eighth
to go then could not keep up with the top two late. SENORITA EMMA was never a factor while racing in the four path through the turn. SHOTGUN KATIE
was never a factor while in the three or four path through the turn. TWO LUCKY stepped out at the start and bumped outside rival, raced near the inside
through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor. SEQUEEKER bumped at the start, settled to the back and was never in it.

Footnotes
GRATZ PARK was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, found energy just inside the eighth pole and
surged to the front late. HEAD START chased the pacesetter through mid-turn while in the three path, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
dueled with the leader through the lane while exchanging brushes, gained the lead very late but was outfinished by the fast-closing winner. EDUCATED
GUESS was hustled up along the inside after breaking towards the back, gained the lead before the first call, continued with a clear lead through late turn,
engaged by the runner-up straightening in the lane, dueled with that one through the stretch and yielded late. RUBY JANE was in the three to the two path
through the turn when unhurried, moved closer to the inside into the lane and improved position while turning in and even performance. LEXI SUN pressed
the pace two wide through mid-turn, chased the pacesetters into the lane then faded. LACE REVOLUTION never a factor while racing well off the rail into
the lane. ROYAL ROSIE was in the three then the two path when chasing the pace through the turn and tired. The time for the first quarter was omitted due
to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
EYE FLIRT bobbled and bumped at the star, chased the pace into the turn, moved up to press the leader in late turn, took over turning into the lane, cleared
then widened to the wire while being kept to the task. WEST COAST JUSTICE raced in the two path through the turn when unhurried, came into the lane
from the three path and moved up to be closest to the winner while not a threat to that one. VENTANA DANNA was bumped, forced out and steadied at the
start, raced in the three path through the turn, continued in the three path into the lane and got up for the minor share. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE set the
pace along the inside into the turn then gave way after entering the lane. QUEEN CHARMAINE was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and
never factored while tiring. ESTA EVE made no impact while racing near the rail. HEATED KISS chased the pace from the two path into the turn then
steadily faded. BOB'S PRINCESS chased the pace into the turn while in the three path and was suddenly done before mid-turn.

Footnotes
LONTANI settled off the pace while in the two path, moved just behind runner-up three wide in mid-turn, shifted into the four path in late turn, continued in
the four path into the lane, quickly cleared for the lead and slowly widened while put in hand late. EVIL EYE chased the two rival duel into the far turn, bid
three wide in mid-turn, gained the lead but felt pressure from the winner at once, could not stay with that one into the lane and just lasted for the place spot.
MAX EXPRESS trailed for three-quarters, bid four wide into the lane, continued with momentum while drifting into the seven path and just missed the place
spot. MR. GARY D raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and offered a mild gain while not a serious threat.
COMFORT ME NOW raced in the three or four path through the turn, was in the six path into the lane and never was a factor. MYSTERY UNBRIDLED vied
inside through late turn and gave way entering the lane. HOME RUN TRICK vied for the lead two wide through the far turn then gave way entering the lane.
