Footnotes
BROOKLYN LAW set the pace while racing off the rail and being well handled, shook clear leaving the turn and by the furlong marker then held sway late to
prove best under right handed urging. SNEADS stalked the winner four wide down the backstretch, then made a bid on the far turn four wide to prompt the
pace setter, then that rival spurted clear again when straightened, then was slowly gaining late. DR. MARBOOZ was allowed to settle early while three wide
down the backstretch, made a bid between horses by the three eighths pole, then angled in leaving the quarter pole to be on the inside in the stretch but
flattened out. LUTHERAN RAGS stalked the early pace from the inside, then swung out four wide leaving the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
BIG BOSS LADY was rated along the inside on the first turn, then moved out four wide entering the backstretch, made a four wide move to duel for
command on the far turn, then drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. TOP HAT INVASION vied for the early lead on the inside, then
dueled with the winner on the turn and to the furlong marker, but proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. CATSKILL RIVERS was off
slowly, then was reserved on the inside, continued to save ground throughout getting the nod for the show award. HELMERS RUN was reserved early while
three wide, then came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show award. DIXIE QUEEN was allowed to settle early, came three
wide into the drive and had no rally. DONNA'SWAY stalked the early pace three wide, then was forced out five wide on the backstretch while tracking the
pace and tired. LOVELEE HONOR vied for the lead three wide and stopped.

BELLAGIO was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and drew out to prove much the best under mild
urging. GO CASH GO was reserved early on the inside, then advanced on the inside on the backstretch and into the far turn, swung out six wide for the
drive for racing room and rallied well. TRAPPE THE DREAM chased the early pace and was five wide down the backstretch, then made a four wide bid on
the far turn, but flattened out in the drive. ON MICK'S DAY set the pace while unchallenged, then was headed past the furlong marker and weakened.
BOOK OF DELANCEY passed the tiring rivals. SLEEPY JOE chased the pace four wide on the backstretch, then made a mild bid three wide on the turn but
came up empty in the drive. GO WITH HONOR was allowed to settle on the first turn in between rivals then dropped back. BELLAMY'S TREASURE lacked
a rally. CANYON OF HEROS was inside on the first turn, then moved out to stalk the pace three wide on the backstretch then stopped.
