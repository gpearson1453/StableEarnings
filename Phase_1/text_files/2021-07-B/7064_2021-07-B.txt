MOBEATYABAD broke alertly and took control inside, set the pace in hand and stayed clear under mild urging. EXPENSIVE STYLE chased three wide,
went after the winner on the turn but proved no match in the stretch. ANNAMATED MOON sluggish early, moved in the two path and rallied mildly.
SPOTTED BULL lacked speed through the opening quarter, moved extremely wide into the stretch and was no threat. JUST ENOUGH raced near the
inside, made a brief bid on the turn and faded. NO FLY ZONE flashed speed inside to the three eighths pole and stopped. ANZIO BEACH chased wide and
weakened steadily.

UPCYCLE trailed to midway on the turn, advanced strongly very wide, offered a late surged and quickly moved clear. PECULIARITY vied inside then angled
to the two path on the turn, rallied and finished gamely for the place. LA FAMILIA dueled outside, moved clear on the turn and continued willingly to the
finish. TAK E LADY stumbled twice at the start, rallied and loomed a threat into the stretch but flattened out. SUMMER SWEETHEART dropped back early
and was never a factor. JORDIN'S SURPRISE briefly close along the inside, stopped badly losing contact with her field.

CALLS lacked speed outside and finished willingly while no factor. BROOKS ROBINSON broke slowest, rushed up inside then proved empty in the stretch.

TAPPIN FOR GLORY settled inside, bid into the far turn, angled inside wide rivals into the lane, rallied and was up through the final furlong. TRUE GRACE
engaged the pacesetter after the half, was challenged both sides into the stretch and continued very gamely. FLIGHT RISK rated three wide just off the
pace, bid on the final turn, led briefly but hung and faded. BRONXVILLE hustled close up just off the inside, faltered on the final turn. UPPER CROWN
dropped back between rivals and lacked a rally. YOU ARE AWESOME dropped back inside then passed stopping rivals. ENKIDU chased wide down the
backstretch and weakened steadily. DAVID'S PROSPEC slipped through inside to the front on the first turn but was finished after five furlongs.

THUNDERSHOOK moved easily outside the pacesetter, took over near the five sixteenths pole and drew away under moderate urging. BIG BEAUTIFUL
WALL lacked speed, advanced inside, angled out in the stretch but proved no match for his stablemate. THE RIGHT PATH broke slowly and trailed early
then rallied outside to gain the show. YOUNGEST OF FIVE settled close up inside, bid on the final turn then faded. FEDERAL CASE took control inside to
the final turn, was collared and weakened. FORTUNATE FRIENDS saved ground off the pace early and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MALICIOSA broke in a complete tangle and raced far back, split rivals and surged clear late. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE quickly picked off rivals on the turn,
led in the stretch but could not last. JOYCE G. chased close up and continued well while no threat to the top pair. MISS SVENGAIL dueled in the two path to
the quarter pole and faltered. MONKEY ON MY BACK settled close up inside, awaited room then faded when clear. STILLHER chased outside, was
bothered and bobbled near the top of the stretch when tiring. MIAMI GOLD dueled outside, led briefly on the turn then weakened. ENOUGH KISSES
dropped back early and was never a factor. COMMISSION ACTRESS lagged far behind, lost contact with her field and was eased. A claim of foul by the
rider of STILLHER against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
