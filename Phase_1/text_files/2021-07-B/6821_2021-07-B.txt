Footnotes
LEPRINO stalked off the rail, came five wide into the stretch, struck the front approaching the eight pole and proved best in the late stages.
CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, challenged around the far turn, took over into the stretch, lost command nearing the
furlong grounds but stayed on gamely for the place. GRAY MAGICIAN lunged at the start and was hustled early, chased off the rail then came four wide into
the stretch, lacked a serious bid but held the show. HOUSE LIMIT angled to the inside early, unhurried in the beginning, traveled along the inside then two
wide into the drive, steered out in upper stretch and went evenly inside the furlong grounds. STUDLY PERFECTION stumbled at the start, recovered to
show speed and take control from inside, pressured around the far turn and relinquished command into the lane and weakened. CONQUEST COBRA
bumped rival leaving the gate, went five wide into the first turn then angled in a couple paths and traveled three deep, moved back out and came five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. GOLDEN DRAGON got bumped at the start, steered in soon after, raced between rivals early, coaxed along past the
half-mile pole but came up empty. DR. TROUTMAN stalked in the two path on the first turn, dropped back around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
HIDING THE BRICK sped clear, showed the way four wide through the turn, drifted out and bumped with FLASH OF GENIUS repeatedly in the stretch and
dug in late to prevail. FLASH OF GENIUS stalked outside five deep early, bid outside leaving the turn, bumped with HIDING THE BRICK repeatedly in the
stretch and went gamely to the wire. CHARTER OAK chased along the rail to the stretch and finished well from inside. GET BACK GOLDIE settled off the
pace, went six then five wide around the turn and finished willingly for a minor share. AXEL STEEL stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, chased four
deep early, angled in on the turn, came two wide into the stretch and needed more late. RESPECT THE CODE broke out, raced in range three deep, went
three to four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. FORMAL ORDER tracked off the rail, came five wide into the lane and weakened. MIDNIGHT
MAMMOTH chased between then angled in around the turn and weakened. C'MON MAN bumped and steadied between at the start, dropped back, angled
six wide around the turn and made no impact. SENATE CHAMBER threw head and was off slow, raced two wide into the drive and was never a factor.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED HIDING THE BRICK FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR SHIFTING OUT AND BUMPING
FLASH OF GENIUS REPEATEDLY IN THE STRETCH, COSTING FLASH OF GENIUS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

save the place. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) bumped leaving the gate, was unhurried in the beginning, lacked room behind rivals on the far turn, swung out

moved out and showed a mild response to run on for a minor share. DISAPPEARING ACT stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, tipped out in the lane
but lacked further response. PULPIT RIDER reserved in the early stages on the inside, moved out into the two path then exited the far turn three wide and
could not rally. CATCH THE EYE bumped with inner rival at the start, went two then three wide around the first turn, remained three wide into the stretch

Footnotes
GIANNA'S WILD CAT stumbled leaving the gate, pressed from inside in the two path, gained command in upper stretch and drove clear. WEDDING
CHAPEL got bumped at the start, shook it off to take the early lead, set the pace under pressure from inside, led four wide through the turn, could not match
strides with the winner in the final furlong and held the place. DON'T JU FORGET settled along the inside, moved into the two path leaving the turn and
finished well to earn the show honors. DORIS MAE raced in range early, angled in around the turn and lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch.
DENDERA stalked the top pair from inside, came out on the turn, four to five wide into the stretch and flattened out. SQUARE FUN stumbled leaving the
gate, was well placed in the early stages behind the top pair, came four wide into the lane and weakened. ABHITA was off slow and bumped inner rival,
traveled four then three wide around the turn and never threatened. AMANDA ROSE tracked in the two path into the turn, angled out and exited the bend
five wide and weakened. HEAVEN'S GHOST was off a bit slow to begin, angled from the three path down to the path around the turn and failed to menace.
AM YISRAEL CHAI threw head and came away slow, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SEA TO SUCCESS vied for the lead early before taking control, showed the way two then three wide around the turn, felt some pressure from ALLEVA to
the outside but turned away the runner-up under right-handed urging and drew away in the final sixteenth. ALLEVA vied for the lead from outside then
ceded the lead to SEA TO SUCCESS, chased that rival three to four wide around the turn, was within striking distance at the top of the lane but was no
match for the winner in the final furlong. STREET BEHAVIOR traveled in mid-pack early on, went four wide through the turn and held the show. NEXT
REVOLT raced near the back of the pack inside a pair of rivals, navigated the turn two then three wide and missed the show. QUESTION AUTHORITY sat
off the pace, angled five wide into the stretch and improved position. REBEL WAR chased the speed from inside to the lane and flattened out. EUSTACE
tracked the pace from inside into the turn, steadied briefly behind rival nearing the three-eighths, moved out into the two path on the turn and failed to
threaten. UNTHROTTLED chased outside a rival, bumped with that foe at the three-eighths, angled to the rail on the turn and weakened. UPPER ROOM
tracked the pace outside UNTHROTTLED, bumped with that foe at the three-eighths and came up empty in the drive. CROOKED FINGER RAY lacked
early speed, went two wide into the turn, angled out into the four path and was always outrun. ENERGIZER chased from off the pace outside rivals,
navigated the turn four then five wide and never made an impact.

Footnotes
LITTLE JUANITO raced up close on the inside, entered the lane a bit off the rail, tipped outside the leader in the stretch and drove clear. COMMANDER
KHAI was off alertly and sped to the front, angled to the two path, inched away while moving to the rail around the bend, lost command in mid-stretch and
stayed on to save second. BAD BEAT BRIAN traveled off the pace off the rail, raced outside rivals around the turn, swung six wide leaving the bend and
produced a late rally to earn the show. PERFECTIONISTIC chased off the rail, ran up on heels and checked near the three-eighths, lacked room off heels
on the turn, came two wide into the stretch then angled to the rail and finished willingly. BENCH JUDGE broke in and bumped rival at the start, angled five
wide leaving the bend and produce a mild rally to advance. FINALLY HERE tracked the pace from inside, saved ground into the lane, angled off the fence
and finished evenly. SUPERMAN SHAQ got bumped at the start, stalked between rivals and steadied on the turn, went three wide into the stretch and
flattened. JAMMING EDDY entered the turn four wide, exited five wide and lacked any response. BEDROCK stumbled and got shuffled back at the start,
saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. POSTERIZE was forwardly placed outside rivals, angled to the two path around the bend and faded.
MCWHERTER stalked outside a pair of rivals early, checked on the turn, remained between rivals into the lane and faded.

TEAM MERCHANTS stalked the top pair early on, bid three deep or four wide late on the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, cleared in upper
stretch and held over the runner-up. I GOT NO MUNNY pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader near the five-sixteenths, vied between into the
stretch and fought gamely from inside to the wire. ADARE chased along the inside then two wide leaving the turn, could not threaten then top pair in the final
furlong but finished a clear third. BOX OF CHOCOLATES got bumped repeatedly early from outside, raced three wide into the lane and flattened out.
FREEDOM FIGHTER set the pace under pressure from I GOT NO MUNNY, dueled with that rival on the turn then vied inside rivals entering the stretch and
weakened. MR. DOUGIE FRESH got pinballed early, dropped back and raced outside a rival, angled from the four path to the two path around the turn and
weakened. KAHUNA MAGIC chased four wide into the turn, drifted while being asked around the turn, came six wide into the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
FLASHIEST pulled at the back early, went outside rivals on the backstretch, advanced four then five wide on the far turn, rallied through the final furlong and
got up in time. CREW DRAGON raced in mid-pack early on, exited the far turn three wide, launched a bid in the stretch but got outkicked by the winner. NO
FOOLERY HERE raced two wide then moved inside, cut the corner in the lane, closed well in the late stages and missed. HOCKEY DAD away quickly to
from outside, vied for the lead into the first turn before taking control, held a short lead into the far turn, dueled around the bend, cleared mid-stretch and got
caught in the closing moments. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN stalked in the two path, raced two to three wide into the stretch, bid between rivals in the drive
but lacked the needed late punch. PETRUCHIO raced near the back early on, angled out in the stretch, summoned a mild rally and improved position.
JUNGLE CRY steadied briefly early, went four then five wide around the first turn, traveled four wide around the second bend and needed to find more
inside the furlong grounds. DREAM SHAKE chased off the rail into the first turn then tugged his way to race outside the leader, stalked up the backstretch
then dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, fought to the furlong grounds and weakened late. NONE ABOVE THE LAW raced in mid-pack off the
rail, came four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. HARBORED MEMORIES chased along the inside, roused into the stretch and failed to
produce a bid. FIGHTING FORCE allowed to settle near the inside, saved ground to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, remained inside and could not
make an imact. INGEST vied for the lead from inside then ceded the lead while pulling some, chased the speed from between rivals and faded in the lane.

the front nearing the eighth pole, shifted inward inside the furlong marker, continued to drifted in late and drew off. ALBIZU went four wide around the first
turn, went up to vie three deep between rivals, led in upper stretch, was overtaken near the eighth pole, bothered by the winner shifting in past the furlong
marker and continued on to secure the place. EXALTED JOY trailed the field early, went between rivals into the far turn, exited the bend four to five wide
and was along for the show. UNCLE JEFF took the first turn five wide, went up to vie four deep for command and weakened in the lane. THE LONGEST
NIGHT chased off the inside then vied between rivals up the backstretch, battled through the far turn, led into the stretch and weakened. THE BEAT was
bothered by OX BRIDGE on the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep into the far turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and lacked a rally. RECKONING
DAY was coaxed early from inside and took control early, met with a trio of rivals and vied up the backstretch, battled two wide into the lane and gave way.
MONGOLIAN LEGEND stalked the pace from inside then two wide into the stretch and came up empty in the drive. OX BRIDGE stumbled badly at the start,
drifted out and pulled on the first turn, sat off the pace through the early stages and had little left for the drive. ACTIVE ACCOUNT tracked off the inside then
between rivals, dropped back on the far turn and tired.
