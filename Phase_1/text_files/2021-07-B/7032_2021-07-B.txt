a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. WHAT'S ON TAP tracked the early leaders but chased on the far

GIMBALA set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. SPROG was in range and moved up
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BLONDE ATTITUDE forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. I HAVE FEELINGS was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no late kick. IT'SNICETOBENICE was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.
TACKLE THE NORTH was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. JACK'S MEMORY was well back, showed nothing and from the
eight path at the top of the stretch was never a threat.
