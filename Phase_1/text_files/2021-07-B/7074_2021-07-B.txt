Footnotes
PACHI chased the leading pair down the backstretch, continued to chase in the three path on the turn, took closer order from near the three eighths, shifted
five wide near the three sixteenths, rallied under a drive, was carried further out midstretch when IRISH LIGHTED ROAD drifted out, nonetheless sustained
his rally, got up near thirty yards from the wire and cleared. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD was sent for pace but outsprinted to the lead by CHOPPER, tracked the
leader down the backstretch and two wide on the turn, chased the leader into the lane, drifted out midstretch but nonetheless gained on the leader, gained
even terms with the pacesetter between horses about thirty yards from the wire but was outfinished by the winner outside him. CHOPPER was sent for
speed, set the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, maintained a comfortable lead into the lane, opened up further when driven
in upper stretch, began to tire past the furlong mark, drifted out, and was caught late. LAST SPRING settled near the rear inside of WELLFIELD early,
inched forward to chase inside of PACHI while saving ground through the turn, took closer order in tandem with PACHI past the three eighths, was driven
inside into the lane, kept on with continued interest inside, but was ultimately outkicked. WELLFIELD broke inward and soundly bumped FAST ONE in the
opening strides, settled toward the rear two wide early, raced in the two to three path toward the rear around the turn, came into the lane inside toward the
rear, continued to gradually take closer order inside down the lane but was outfinished. FAST ONE was bumped soundly by WELLFIELD in the opening
strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch and offered no rally.

SATIATE opened up a clear early lead in first quarter of a mile, continued to show the way under a hold up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
and kicked clear entering the stretch, ridden out to the wire. KURINGAI trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung
wide to began a bid entering the stretch, was forced out slightly when LITTLE CHICK drifted out near the eighth pole and closed well on the outside while
never threatening the winner. LITTLE CHICK raced well off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path nearing the
three eighths pole, drifted out in upper stretch, carrying KURINGAI with her a bit, and flattened out late. BE AUTHENTIC settled well off the pace on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and faded in the final furlong.

TEMPER TANTRUM tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair into the backstretch after ANDREAS pulled to engage outside
of COMING UP ACES, took closer order between horses near the five eighths, prompted the pace two wide around the far turn, was driven two wide into
the lane, rallied to lead with a furlong remaining and drove clear. IOYA AGAIN settled at the inside of the rear flight, continued at the rear down the
backstretch and into the far turn, began to improve in the two path past the seven sixteenths, swung three wide into the lane, went to a drive at the three
sixteenths, rallied but was unable to catch TEMPER TANTRUM. COMING UP ACES broke sharply, led into the far turn and dropped to the inside past the
mile pole, was attended outside by ANDREAS past the three fourths, was engaged by TEMPER TANTRUM outside past the five eighths but still carried a
short lead while saving ground through the far turn, was confronted in earnest by the winner in upper stretch, lost the lead to that foe near the furlong mark,
and flattened out late. ANDREAS raced two wide in the chasing flight around the far turn, began to pull near the seven eighths, prompted outside of
COMING UP ACES near the three quarters, ceded the closest tracking position to TEMPER TANTRUM past the five eighths, tracked the leading pair three
wide around the turn, was driven two wide into the stretch and flattened out. TUFF ATTACK chased inside through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase
the leading trio down the backstretch and while saving ground through the far turn, and came up empty under a drive in the lane. IWILLPERSEVERE raced
two wide in the rear flight around the clubhouse turn, continued two wide near the rear down the backstretch, was urged in the four path on the far turn and
driven near the five sixteenths, came into the lane still in the four path and proved empty.

HIPPIE COWGIRL dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, led the field from the two path around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and drew off in the final furlong under a drive. MY MY MUNNY pressed the pace between horses in the early going, began a bid from
the two path passing the three eighths pole, and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. JOAN'S WAY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving
the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, improved position from the three path around the turn and continued to gain ground mildly in
late stretch. SHARP HERO tracked the leaders on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and weakened on the rail late.
COLOROFACLOUD bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and was outkicked from there. FINE COTTON stumbled leaving the gate, fought her rider from the back of the pack on the inside
through the entire opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, ONLY THE FINAL
TIME IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS RACE.

WINNING QUALITY settled at the rear of a compact field early, raced in the rear flight inside of BOBBIE TOO TOO into the turn, began to improve in the
two path approaching the three eighths, swung four wide into the lane in range of the leading pair, rallied with good interest, struck the front outside the
leading pair just past the furlong mark and drove clear. BOBBIE TOO TOO raced behind the leading trio early, settled back outside of WINNING QUALITY
into the turn, chased toward the rear in the five path, began to improve position past the three eighths, raced five wide into the lane, offered a mild rally
outside and got up for place in the final strides. BACKSIDE BEAUTY came in and bumped NICE AND TRUE in the opening strides, was urged for early
speed, set the early pace while hounded by NICE AND TRUE to her inside, continued on a narrow lead in the three path around the turn with that foe
attending inside, vied outside of NICE AND TRUE in upper stretch, could not keep pace with WINNING QUALITY as she came past midstretch, flattened
out, and lost the place in the final jumps. NICE AND TRUE was bumped by BACKSIDE BEAUTY in the opening strides, sent for speed, attended the early
pace inside of BACKSIDE BEAUTY down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven into upper stretch and vied for the lead when that foe,
had no answer when WINNING QUALITY kicked past near the furlong mark and weakened. NEW RULES stumbled out of the gate, was urged for pace but
outsprinted to the lead by NICE AND TRUE and BACKSIDE BEAUTY, tracked that pair into the turn, weakened in the four path from near the three eighths

CACHACO was reluctant to load, dueled for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to open up while saving ground
around the far turn, and continued to draw off down the lane. LORD BOLSTON raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders in the middle
of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and chased the winner home, no match for that rival but the
best of the rest. CHOCOLATE BUNNY swerved in leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead from the inside through the opening half mile, saved
ground around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch and finished evenly. TEA AFTER BALLET raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the
field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and came up empty from there. ROCKET RIDE hopped up leaving the gate,
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.
