Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION took control quickly from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, roused midway around the turn, held a short lead over FLAT OUT
JOY into the stretch, responded in the final furlong and shook free from the runner-up under some right-handed urging and strong handling. FLAT OUT JOY
stalked the leader from outside, bid three wide leaving the turn but faltered in the final furlong. CIVIL SUIT stalked the leader from inside to the stretch,
remained along the fence in the lane and held the show. ROYAL BLEND tracked off the rail, four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. JAMMINJL bumped
with rival at the start, traveled two wide into the turn, a bit off the rail into the drive and failed to respond. COAL SHAFT bumped with inside rival leaving the
gate, chased four to three wide around the turn and made no impact.

Footnotes
STELLAR SOUND stalked the speed quartet to the turn, waited for an opening around the bend, shifted four wide into the stretch, drew alongside the
runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and got up. SCOTISH STAR (ARG) attended the pace three deep, launched a bid at the quarter pole, struck the front
nearing the eighth pole, challenged by the winner at the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly. FIRST STAR raced at the back of the pack early on, angled
off the inside around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and edged BELLA VITA for the show honors. BELLA VITA broke through the gate prior to the
start, went up to dueled from inside, battled with rivals leaving the turn and held a short lead into the stretch, relinquished control in upper stretch, flattened
out and was overtaken for third. ROAD RAGER showed early speed outside the top trio, could not keep pace around the bend, chased five wide into the
stretch and weakened. ACTING OUT broke through the gate prior to the start, sped to the front between rivals, dueled for command past the half-mile pole,
vied between with a quarter mile remaining and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SEVEN SISTERS veered out while coming away quickly, set the pace to the inside of ISLAND FLIGHT, headed by that rival at the five-sixteenths, kicked
clear past the quarter pole and drew off. SO VERY SMART broke well from the far outside, stalked the top pair outside a rival or rivals, went four wide
around the bend, finished willingly but was unable to challenge the winner. SUPERSONIC FLYER stalked the pace from inside to the stretch and held the
show. LIVIN' AT THE BU raced off the pace three deep early, went five wide around the turn and kept on to earn a minor award. ISLAND FLIGHT was
forced out by the winner at the start, pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, lost contact leaving the turn and weakened. BIG
NEWS COMING was off slow to begin, went to chase in mid-pack, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. ICONIC STORM stumbled and got
herded out at the start, angled in to saved ground around the bend and was never a factor. ROSES FOR LIFE chased between rivals early, four wide on the
turn and had little left for the drive. SUGAR PLUM came away to an awkward beginning, shifting in and out at the start, went three wide into the turn, moved
down to the two path then angled four wide leaving the bend and came up empty. BABE'S GOT APPEAL broke slow, chased between rivals early, two to
three wide around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
RED STORM RISEN unhurried in the beginning off the rail, angled five wide leaving the far turn, then closed outside CONO in the final sixteenth to be up in
time. CONO vied for the lead early then cleared into the first turn, moved over to control the pace on the inside, led clear into the final sixteenth and got
caught. FIRST PREMIO traveled near the back of the field in the two path, swung four wide into the stretch, six wide at the top of the lane, finished well and
gained the show. KAZAN (IRE) tucked inside on the first turn, angled four wide into the lane, moved out widest in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to
round out the superfecta. IRISH HEATWAVE traveled in mid-pack early on, angled four wide into the lane and needed to find more in the late stages.
BLAMELESS away quickly from inside, ceded the lead on the first turn, stalked the lone leader to the second bend, went two wide into the stretch, came
back to the rail and lacked the needed late punch. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS traveled along the inside, shifted three wide into the lane, gave a mild response
to urging but never threatened. KEYSTONE FIELD raced in range outside a rival, took aim three wide leaving the far turn but weakened in deep stretch.
KING OF SPEED stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, faded in the lane and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CHOLLIMA broke in and bumped rival, chased the pacesetter off the rail or outside a rival, bid outside leaving the turn and into the stretch, struck the front
nearing the eighth pole and drew away in the final sixteenth. ISLAND LIFE took control early and angled to the inside, set the pace into the and around the
turn, pressured entering the drive, relinquished command with a furlong remaining but stayed for a clear second. A J ROCK knocked into rival at the start,
traveled three deep early, three wide around the turn, went evenly through the final furlong and held on for the show. MADAME BARBARIAN got bumped
from outside and steadied early, took the turn three then four wide and missed the show. GRAZEN HONOR lost her path and checked early, raced off the
pace, entered the turn four wide, exited five wide and moved up in the lane. YOUR ROYAL COIL chased outside a rival then between foes past the half-mile
pole, went two wide around the bend and failed to respond. STRADARI came in early, was closest in pursuit while angling down to the two path, moved to
the rail on the turn and weakened. KIRSCH TRUFFLE bumped leaving the gate, lost her path and checked early, went three wide into the turn, moved out
into the five path around the bend and was never a factor. ZILLINDA stumbled in the beginning, chased on the inside, dropped back on the turn, tired and
eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
FEATHERS (IRE) went three then two wide around the first, lacked room through the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, rallied between and got bumped
from both sides past the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. CECILE'S CHAPTER raced outside a rival on the first turn then in the two path, went three to
four wide around the far turn, bid from outside in the lane, drifted in and bumped rival past the sixteenth pole and earned the place.
CHASINGSERENDIPITY rated along the inside, waited for room on the far turn, bid from the rail in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped rival past the
sixteenth pole and was edged for second. FRAZZLED was off slow to begin, reserved in the early going, went three wide into the lane and summoned a
mild rally for a minor award. AMERICAN BOURBON sped to the front, showed keen early foot to open up leaving the first turn, held a diminishing lead into
the second bend, led into the furlong grounds, drifted out and bumped rival at the sixteenth pole and flattened out. BOLD ARTICLE went three to four wide
around both turns and failed to menace. PLUM SEXY stalked on the inside then moved out a bit on the backstretch, bid outside on the far turn, got bumped
from inside and checked at the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. DADDY'S GIRL traveled along the inside to the stretch and was always
outrun. ST HELENA stalked off the inside, got forced out and checked in upper stretch and faded. THERE WERE TWO INUIRIES INTO THE RUNNING OF
THE SIXTH RACE. THE REVIEW INVOLVED FEATHERS SHIFTING OUT AND BOTHERING ST HELENA IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION. THE STEWARDS THEN LOOKED AT THE INCIDENT INVOLVING CECILE'S
CHAPTER AND PLUM SEXY AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH CECILE'S CHAPTER DID DRIFT INWARD THE OUTCOME
OF THE RACE WAS UNNAFECTED AND THERE WOUD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LADY MYSTIFY broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, sped clear and angled to the inside, showed the way along the rail into the drive, responded
when called upon and held gamely. GINJA stalked in the two path through both turns, chased the winner all out through the final furlong but could not
summon the needed late kick. SHE'S A DIME hopped at the start, tracked off the inside, drifted four wide into the lane and weakened. LUCKY PERIDOT
raced along the inside to the far turn, angled three wide leaving that bend and could not rally. DID I STUTTER bumped both sides at the start, raced in the
two path then came four wide into the stretch and also lacked a rally. LAST FIRST KISS stumbled a bit and got bumped from inside at the start, entered the
lane five wide and never made an impact. MISS PEAKY BLINDER stumbled and broke out, trailed through the early stages, exited the far turn two to three
wide and had nothing left.

Footnotes
OVER ATTRACTED reserved off the pace, traveled in the two path into the lane, waited for room in upper stretch, found an opening and rallied between
rivals inside the eighth pole, fought with PRANCE late and prevailed. PRANCE tracked inside, moved out a bit leaving the first turn, angled out in upper
stretch, rallied five deep with a furlong remaining, dueled with the winner late and got outclosed. BUY WAVE BUY stalked three wide through both turns, bid
four deep in upper stretch, proved no match late for the top pair but stayed on to secure the show. BRITTLE AND YOO angled into the two path early,
shifted out entering the stretch and put in a mild late bid. STARSHIP SKY hesitated and came away a bit slow, tucked inside early, raced near the back of
the pack, checked past the three-eighths pole and improved position. NAVY QUEEN pressed the pace from outside, challenged with a quarter mile
remaining, took the lead in upper stretch but weakened in the late stages. MULLIGAN set the pace under pressure from NAVY QUEEN while on the inside,
maintained a short lead into the stretch, was overtaken approaching the eighth pole and weakened. LISTEN TO BLUE sat off the pace on the inside, saved
ground into the drive and weakened. AVISSE raced off the rail through out and came up empty. WARREN'S MEMORABLE went three to four wide around
both turns and was never a factor.
