WRITE ITINTHE DUST assumed command three across on the turn, drew off and extended his lead while ridden out. DOUBLE DOWN BROWN was
hustled along to set the pace to the turn, fell back, finished evenly and was no match for the winner. BID IN THE BACK hesitated at the start to be off slowly,
lacked a bid in an even effort and did not threaten. EL PATRON JET lacked a response in an outside trip and showed little. SILVERS BLING stumbled and
steadied after the start, contended to the turn and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
GEORGIAN ROAD settled off the pace, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. STONE CREEK bumped at the start, vied inside to the sixteenth
pole, was in tight quarters in the stretch drive and was outclosed. READY TO FORGIVE vied two wide to the sixteenth pole, was in tight quarters in the
stretch drive and was outclosed. SON OF ELEANOR broke awkwardly and brushed at the start, raced mid pack towards the outside and offered a mild bid
only. BAJA BRIDGE bumped at the start, was never far back while racing inside and lacked the needed late response. SALSA VERDE was not a factor.
BARTOLOMEO brushed at the start and was outrun in an even effort. CANT DO THE DANSE was outrun in an outside trip. Hand timed.
