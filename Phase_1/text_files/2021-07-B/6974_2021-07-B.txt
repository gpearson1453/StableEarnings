Footnotes
PRINCE CINDERELLA prompted the fractions by DON'T LEAD ME ON, gained ground off of the turn, confronted the runner-up inside of the furlong marker
and wore that foe down inside of the sixteenth-pole to prevail. DON'T LEAD ME ON broke alertly and set the fractions through the turn while saving ground,
was met by PRINCE CINDERELLA nearing the eighth pole, dueled with that rival but was bested in the final stages while a clear second over the rest.
LOVER BOY TOM settled off of the early pace while traveling in the two path, and finished evenly in the stretch to be a clear third. UNUSUAL CODE lugged
in at the start, chased the field from the rear through the turn while saving ground and made a mild late rally but was not challenging the leaders.
NORWESTER had no speed early, was four wide on the turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch. HANDSOME HUSSAR tracked the pace through the
turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CHARMING VINTAGE sat just off of the early pace, improved position while five wide on the second turn, led into the lane and felt pressure in the final
sixteenth by AL MILLION BOB but held on for the win. AL MILLON BOB was unhurried in the early going, was five wide on the second turn, rallied off of the
turn and pressured the winner late but could not close the margin while besting the rest. BLAKEFORD settled in the midflight while saving ground, rallied in
the stretch but lacked the needed response to challenge the top two. OMAHA RUTSCH took command of the early pace and set fractions through the
second turn, was confronted nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the stretch run. HELLO HANDSOME prompted the early pace, was four wide on
the second turn, was still in contention off of the turn but tired in the stretch drive. PREACHER BROWN tracked the pace, was three wide on the second
turn, took up when in traffic nearing the three-sixteenths marker and tired in the stretch. ERRIGAL had no speed in the early going, trailed into the second
turn while four wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAYCEE JO settled in the midflight through the turn while saving ground, waited for racing room leaving the turn, found a seam nearing the furlong marker
in the three path in the stretch to collar SWANEE and drew clear in the end. SWANEE sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn, vied for the
lead off of the turn and led into the final furlong, was collared by MAYCEE JO and was outfinished while besting the rest. ST. ANNIE'S INDY settled toward
the rear of the field in the early going while saving ground, vied for the lead off of the turn but weakened in the stretch run. JUSTA POPPIN tracked the
leaders into the turn, was three wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. MISS LADY ANN bobbled at the start, had no speed in the early going,
saved ground on the turn and did not offer a bid in the stretch. MAGGIE'S MAGIC was hustled to set the fractions through the turn while saving ground, was
confronted off of the turn and faded in the stretch. CIRCULODEGANADORAS prompted the pace by MAGGIE'S MAGIC, was two wide on the turn, was still
in contention at the head of the lane but gave out in the stretch drive.

BIGFOOT CITY sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the second turn, mounted a bid off of the turn and had late surge in the last sixteenth to get
by STONE GROOVE to prevail. STONE GROOVE set the contested pace through the second turn while saving ground, led into the final sixteenth when
collared by BIGFOOT CITY but held on for second. CHOSEN MOON settled in the middle of the field in the early going, was four wide on the second turn,
gained ground off of the turn and continued that rally to get the nod for third. LINFIELD settled in the midflight while saving ground and rallied in the stretch,
just missing for third. HYPERSONIC pressured the pace of STONE GROOVE through the second turn, was four wide on the second turn, was still in
contention inside of the last furlong but tired late. AGENT ZERO was unhurried in the early stages, was three wide on the second turn and made a mild late
rally in the stretch. KALINE stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground and weakened in the drive. LUCKY GENERAL was away slowly
and had no speed early, was four wide on the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MECKLENBURG (IRE) prompted the pace of JAMMERS JUSTICE through the second turn, came to terms with that rival off of the turn, dueled and gamely
just won the head nod at the end to prevail. JAMMERS JUSTICE set all of the fractions, saved ground on the second turn, was met by the winner coming off
of the second turn and dueled the length of the stretch and just missed winning the head nod at the end, while a clear second over the rest. FUENTE (GB)
settled in the midflight while saving ground, mounted a steady bid through the second turn but finished evenly in the drive. AMERICAN FARMER was
unhurried in the early going, gained ground on the second turn while three wide but flattened out in the stretch. MUGARITZ stalked the pace, was four wide
on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. SACRED RIDER tracked the early pace, lost ground along the backstretch, trailed through the second
turn and did not rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
STOPDROPANDROLL broke sharply and set the fractions through the turn while saving ground, extended the lead off of the turn and was kept to task
through the last sixteenth to prevail in a drive in a good debut. TAMARA MINE chased the winner through the turn and into the stretch and could not reel her
in but was a clear second over the rest. VRONSKY FEINT tracked the pace while saving ground on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run.
DERRYGOOLIN chased the pace, was three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. GOLD RUSH GAL tracked the leaders while two wide
between horses on the turn, took up and lost position nearing the five-sixteenths marker and tired in the stretch run. SILVER AFFAIR had no speed in the
early going, was four wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. ZAZEN settled toward the rear of the field, was improving position when steadied
nearing the five-sixteenths and weakened in the stretch drive. NISHICO was away slowly, had no speed in the early going and trailed throughout.
