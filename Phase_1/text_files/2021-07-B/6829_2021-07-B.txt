mild urging. COLOR FORCE was hustled to the front at once, made the early pace outside the winner then couldn't keep up through the final three furlongs.
MAGALIE was steadied in tight behind rivals around the first turn, trailed into the stretch then passed tired ones. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE was caught
wide around the first turn and was finished after three-quarters. WICKED T was finished early. Race times updated after data review.

LITERALLY was prominent outside from the start, moved two wide to command before a half, drew clear in early stretch and was all out to last.
JEBOLOGIST ducked out into TYLER leaving the gate, made the early pace along the rail, fell back in early stretch and was slowly getting to the winner at
the end. ATHELSTANE was unhurried early, made a three wide run around the turn, moved closer in early stretch then couldn't gain. TYLER was bumped
leaving the gate, raced between the top two for over a quarter then weakened. CLASSY SOLUTION broke slowly, moved up inside early then stopped.
