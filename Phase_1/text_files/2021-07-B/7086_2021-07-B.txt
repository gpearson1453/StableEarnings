Footnotes
FLY FLY AWAY set the pace on the inside, dueled with LION CHARMER on the far turn, responded when roused, edged away in upper stretch and then
dug in gamely in deep stretch to hold on. LION CHARMER tracked early on, then stalked two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled with the winner, could not stay
with that rival in upper stretch, then dug in gamely in the final sixteenth to the finish. BEE MAJOR raced off the pace between rivals on the first turn, then
tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and closed mildly late outside. CROI MOR raced off the pace, had a ground saving
trip and rallied mildly on the rail. SEEKING REVENGE raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the stretch and finished evenly. I SAY I PLAY
stalked close up racing two or three wide, came three wide into the lane, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. A GIRLS BESTFRIEND did not factor.
CARPENTER raced three wide on the first turn, settled two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ARRIVEDERCI hooked up with FLATEXCEL on the first turn, dueled outside of that rival in a prolonged battle to the quarter pole, then dug in gamely inside
rivals in the stretch drive and edged away late in a determined effort. INDIAN GULCH stalked the pace, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dueled between
rivals past midstretch and dug in gamely to the end. K D'S CAT BIRD bobbled a bit at the break, settled two wide off the pace, made a four wide bid at the
quarter pole, dueled outside rivals in upper stretch, dug in and then was outfinished. FLATEXCEL dueled inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the
backside and far turn, then weakened. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE raced off the pace on the inside and failed to respond. MAC'S REVOLUTION stalked early
on, then tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and tired. AMERICA'S SIMMARD raced three wide early, settled off the pace and did not factor.
