Footnotes
OH MY OH forwardly placed while off the inside exiting the chute, remained in a striking position into and through the turn, took over from the outside turning
for home, shook clear nearing the furlong grounds, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. OKALANI last away, raced back off the pace, moved
closer along the inside late in the turn, shifted out for room past the furlong marker, slowly gaining on the winner late, well clear of the others. SWEET
AMELIA broke back, trailed much of the way, three wide into the lane, drifted out upper stretch, was straightened and raced widest to the wire, well clear for
the show. CANDY CANDY CANDY away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, weakened in the drive. MISS INVADER broke well, set or forced the
pace for five furlongs along the inside, gave way. CABO SUNSET settled in mid pack early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
ONEROLLOFTHEDICE last to leave, lacked early foot, steered out to be four wide late in the turn, rallied while remaining well out in the strip, kicked down
the leader in the waning strides. HALF KOO KOO dueled up front while closest to the inside, continued to alternate into the turn, shook off the other speed
to be clear turning for home, led late, could not contain the winner, well clear of the rest. KIDDO TOWN in mid pack for three furlongs, moved closer along
the inside late in the turn, shifted to the outside of the runnerup for room when straightened for home, finished up flatly to prove no match for the top pair.
FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS fell back to trail after a quarter, swung out to be five wide into the lane, picked off a couple of rivals to improve position, not a threat
to the top three. SHADES OF TRUTH closest to the dueling leaders for over three furlongs, came up empty for the drive. GIRL IN BLACK dueled up front in
the two path outside the runner up, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
FAMILY CREED broke in to bump with the runner up, settled in the second flight while racing in the two path, dropped to the rail for the drive, rallied up the
inside to take over late and edge clear. GRUNT broke on top despite being bumped by the winner, clear early, dueled through the turn closest to, but not on
the rail, put the other speed away to be well clear past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late. STARSHIP FESTIVAL moved up to duel
outside the runner up before a furlong, floated out by that rival to be three wide into the lane, could not keep up with that same rival to the wire nor prove any
match for the winner, comfortably clear of the others. REAL CITY SPEED broke back, moved up to race behind the leaders through the turn, lacked a
closing response in the drive. NICE STAR broke back, failed to menace. JANET'S DEVIL broke out, lacked speed, also failed to muster a rally. BIG
RESULTS broke out and a step slow, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
CITY PARK within striking distance outside early, advanced three wide into the far turn, vied into the stretch remaining on the outside, shook clear late, held
the runner up safe late while drifting out under a firm right handed crop. OCTOBER SURPRISE in the second flight while toward the inside, continued to
save ground while in some traffic second turn, switched out nearing the furlong marker, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late while being floated
out by that rival in the waning strides. KISS OF THE WOLF broke alertly, got clear before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch, responded when
the winner challenged midway on the final turn then could not keep up with that one through the stretch nor contain the runner up. PAYNT BATTLE rank
while racing in traffic through the first turn, continued to be slow to settle in traffic onto the backstretch, steadied with five furlongs remaining, moved out five
wide by late in the final turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. SIR POKERFACE broke back after being lightly bumped at the break, steadied when in
a bit tight along the rail soon after, saved ground second turn, improved a bit into the lane and flattened out. EASY TO MISS closest to the leader four
almost six furlongs, weakened from those early efforts. COCO'S MAN was finished after a half. HONORARIAN lacked early foot, improved a bit the middle
half inside, steered out four wide into the lane and had nothing for the stretch run. OPENING QUARTER MILE SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

MEAN CRUISER fell back steadily the opening quarter to trail, continued to see them all through the turn, angled out to be six wide turning for home, rallied
down the middle of the strip to be up in time. PERFECT PERIGEE in the second flight outside, three wide through the turn, advanced and challenged just
inside the furlong marker, led late, drifted out into the winner, caught by that one in the final strides. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE back off the early pace, two
path through the turn, dropped inside for the drive, rail bid past the furlong marker, flattened out in the late going to finish best of the rest. FLASHBURN
broke out then steadied, outrun early as a result, moved toward the inside for the turn, steered out to be three wide for the drive, in traffic with a furlong
remaining, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position a bit. NO QUARTER back off the early pace, also encountered some traffic in
midstretch, finished up evenly when clear. COAST GUARDSMAN moved up to press the early leader from the outside, dueled through the turn, faltered in
the drive. CAJUN NAVY away in good order, showed the way early,dueled through the turn closest to the inside, also gave way when the real running
began entering the stretch. FIRST METAL COUNT broke sharp, fell back off the early issue, continued to fall back after three furlongs. SHADY MONKEY
forwardly placed for three furlongs, stopped.

MAGAWILDTIME showed the way through the first turn, dueled and headed in the run up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed turning for home and
drew strongly clear to the wire under steady handling. COACH KENNY lacked speed toward the inside, steered out three wide under the crop turning for
home, rallied for the place spot late while not a threat to the winner. WISH UPON A STAR bumped at the start to be last away, trailed for a half, advanced
far turn, steered out to be four wide for the drive, rallied outside the runner up, outkicked by that one at the wire. GRAVY HOUND broke on top, pressed
early, dueled in the two path outside the winner, tired in failing to keep up in upper stretch while drifting, continued to weaken to the wire. VENN five wide
into the first turn, was forwardly placed off the inside in the run up the backstretch, moved a bit closer while three wide late in the final turn, hung in the drive.
FIFTY PROTECTION four wide into the first turn when with the main body, remained in mid pack the middle half, improved a bit in the second turn, lacked a
further response in the drive while drifted out nearing the furlong marker. DEER CROSSING in mid pack first turn, fell back, five wide into the lane, failed to
muster a rally. SY MICHAEL broke out, bumped with foe, void of speed, six wide out of the final turn, remained back. CUSTOM DEELITE six wide into the
first turn, moved closer into a forward position onto the backstretch, stopped far turn, jogged in. OPENING QUARTER MILE SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE

Footnotes
AREYOUINABAND broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to set pace turn, shook well clear when straightened for
home, held the next two safe late under steady handling. GALAXY THIRTYSIX bothered at the start to be last away, unhurried up the backstretch and into
the turn while saving some ground, two path into the lane while between horses, steered out a bit more in upper stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the
winner late and proving determined for the place. MIAMI ROSE lacked early foot outside, four wide late in the turn, also rallied through the lane to be cutting
into the winner's margin, outfinished late by the runner while while outside that rival. DUEFORADATE chased the winner early, second flight through the
turn, remained closest to the victor past the furlong marker, little left late to lose a couple of positions. LIL ALLIE DANCER void of speed, raced five wide into
the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. DIVA'S RANSOM settled in mid pack early, tired in the drive. TAILORBESWIFT
forwardly placed, bit closer off the inside late in the turn, caved in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BOERNE broke on top, showed the way first turn, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, edged away when straightened for home
and steadily drew out while being kept to task. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR pressed the winner early along the inside, fell back the middle four furlongs while
continuing to save ground, moved out for the drive, set down, came back late for the place, not a threat to the winner. SHES OUR FASTEST prompted the
pace off the inside, closest to that one in the run up the backstretch, chased the winner into and through midstretch, nipped late for the place. OFFSPRING
raced back off the pace, made little impact. QUINN ELLA last away, moved up to race in mid pack early, moved closer after a half, had little left for the drive.
DRESS SHOPPING fell back to trail, showed little. OPENING QUARTER MILE SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BRAVE CITY GIRL moved up inside to set pace, shook clear into lane, drew out while being kept to pressure. EPONHER forwardly placed from the start,
pressed the winner through the turn in the three path, proved no match for that one in the drive, held sway for the place. WHO DAT GREY broke well then
fell back to mid pack, saved some ground turn, improved position while remaining inside into the stretch, no threat to the top two late, saved the show. OAK
HILL SENIORITA broke back, lacked speed outside, came five wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip to be gaining for the
show. POINT OF VICTORY pressed the issue early off the inside, began to weaken before a half. KIKI KAT went one paced throughout in lacking a closing
response. LIGHT AS A WHISPER in the second flight early, had little for the drive. MADI STRONG off a step slow, fell far back, continued to lag into the
turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest. LAST GHOST in mid pack early while outside, gave way in the turn, trailed home.
