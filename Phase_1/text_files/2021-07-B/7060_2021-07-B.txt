Footnotes
NYOMAN tracked the leaders on the inside early, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack from the two and three path around the turn, began a bid
nearing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily on the outside to pull clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. ROAD GAME dueled for the lead on the
outside up the backstretch, continued to battle between horses in the two path around the turn, took over entering the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong,
and was caught late while finishing well. WILL KNOWS chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to challenge
approaching the half mile pole, dueled from the three path around the turn, and finished evenly between horses. EASTER MUSIC stumbled leaving the
gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two and three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch
and flattened out in the stretch. DIDDLEY led on the inside in the early going, dueled while saving ground around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and
continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME chased in second last early, edged forward to join the tracking flight outside of CAN'T SAY NO into the turn, tracked the leading pair
two wide around the bend, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, and got up in the final jumps. YOU SPLIT TENS prompted the
pace outside of BIG SPORT down the backstretch, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, headed BIG SPORT near the five sixteenths and
carried a narrow two wide lead into the lane, came in on BIG SPORT past the three sixteenths, cleared midstretch, drifted out late and was caught. BIG
SPORT set the pace while pressured by YOU SPLIT TENS to his outside down the backstretch and while racing in the two path around the turn, was
headed at the five sixteenths but continued in close range to that foe's inside into the lane, checked past the three sixteenths when YOU SPLIT TENS came
in on him, switched outside that foe, continued willingly under a drive but could not reel him back in. PRESIDENT ELECT settled at the rear, trailed in the
two path on the turn, swung out into the seven path into upper stretch for the drive, and lacked the needed kick. CAN'T SAY NO tracked the leading pair
down the backstretch, saved ground at the inside of the tracking flight around the turn, came up empty into the lane and weakened. THE STEWARDS
MADE AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED YOU SPLIT TENS FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM
THIRD FOR COMING IN ON BIG SPORT PAST THE THREE SIXTEENTHS.

FOX FREY dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew
off to the wire under a drive. ROYAL MISSION chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the
turn, and gained ground on the outside in late stretch, while never threatening the winner. U CAN DO IT dueled for the lead on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, drifted in mildly in the final furlong, and was outkicked while finishing evenly. MIDNIGHT FROST chased
the leaders on the inside in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field from the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was
empty from there. DEEP DISH bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving
ground around the turn and continued to tire from the rail in the stretch.

Footnotes
PURR SEA was asked for early pace but outsprinted to the early lead by RUNWAY FLAIR, tracked the leader down the backstretch and into the far turn,
launched a bid in the three path from near the seven sixteenths, led outside of RUNWAY FLAIR approaching the five sixteenths, opened up a clear lead
when given a few strikes of the crop near the three sixteenths, and continued to draw off the length of the stretch while hand ridden and being shown the
crop through midstretch. RUNWAY FLAIR was sent to the lead, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was confronted by PURR
SEA and headed near the five sixteenths, proved no match for that foe into the lane, but chased on and held place under a drive inside. JOURNEYIST
chased the leading pair inside of IGGY BIGS down the backstretch, got rank near the half mile mark and began to lose ground on the leading trio, settled
better near the three eighths while racing in the two path, was driven in the three path into the lane, showed her best inside the final furlong despite drifting
out slightly and missed the place. RAPID FIRE MICKY settled at the rear, raced in the four to five path around the turn and while driven into the lane,
chased on evenly and passed a tiring horse late. IGGY BIGS was anxious in the gate, chased the leading pair outside of JOURNEYIST down the
backstretch, saved ground while chasing well off the leading pair around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
OL GREY GHOST was urged to the early lead, showed the way up the backstretch and around the turn while saving ground, dueled gamely in upper stretch
and dug in to pull clear late. FUTURE PERFECT tracked the leader between horses in the early going, pressed the pace from the two path around the turn,
moved up to challenge approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled gamely down the lane, grudgingly gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile and was the
best of the rest. IRISH TUFF settled on the inside just off the pace for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and finished evenly
while chasing the top two home, no match for those rivals. ZOFFA stalked the frontrunners on the far outside through the opening half mile, raced wide in
the three and four path around the turn and was outkicked from there. THE LAST FACT chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, angled in to
save ground around the turn, and faded entering the stretch.

Footnotes
HOLY IMAGE was a bit slow into stride but soon improved to chase midpack, continued to chase in the four path on the turn outside of SHE'S SO CALI,
swung six wide into the lane, improved position when driven in upper stretch, continued to gain into the final furlong, took the lead just past the sixteenth
pole and held. READY AT MIDNIGHT was hard to settle early while racing at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, began to take closer order to the
rest of the field past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, rallied between horses midstretch, shifted out for room, continued to drift out further
while rallying, kept gaining to the wire but could not catch HOLY IMAGE. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY was sent for speed, set the pace early while pressured by
FOX ABLE CHARLIE, inched out to a defined lead into the turn, set the pace while saving ground around the bend, opened up under a drive in upper
stretch, kept on while drifting out, was caught inside the sixteenth pole by HOLY IMAGE and flattened out late. SHE'S SO CALI chased the leading trio
between horses down the backstretch, continued to chase the two path on the far turn while racing inside of HOLY IMAGE, improved position in the two
path in upper stretch while proving no match for MISS HIGH N MIGHTY there but continued to chase on, could not match the kick of HOLY IMAGE or
READY AT MIDNIGHT in the final sixteenth but kept on willingly to the wire. FOX ABLE CHARLIE was urged for pace, prompted the early pace outside of
MISS HIGH N MIGHTY, stalked that leader in the three path on the turn, floated five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for MISS HIGH N MIGHTY
from upper stretch and chased on evenly in the final furlong. LIL HOLY OAK was reluctant to load, chased the leading trio inside foes early, was pushed
along into the turn but began to lose position, raced toward the rear in the four to five path around the bend, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, and
rallied mildly outside. SWAY TO GO was fractious in the gate, settled near the rear, saved ground through the turn, was driven up the inside into the lane,
took mildly closer order in upper stretch but ultimately lacked the needed kick. MY DAMS ATITUDE attended outside the leading pair down the backstretch,
tracked them in the four path on the turn, began to flatten out from the quarter pole, race four wide into the lane and was no further threat.

Footnotes
MORETHANSOULTITLE raced off the pace on the inside early, moved up to run in the middle of the pack headed into the turn, began a bid from the two
path approaching the three eighths pole, took over with a furlong to go and drew off the wire under a drive. GOLD INCENSE raced between horses in the
opening strides, dueled on the outside through the next quarter of a mile, opened up a clear lead while saving ground around the turn, could not go with the
eventual winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. JUST BEN dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, dropped
back slightly while racing in the three path around the turn, and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the top two. FIFTY ONE NINETY chased
the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and was outkicked in the stretch. EL LAY was pinched
back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and came up empty from there. KING ZION raced off pace on the
outside up the backstretch, began to improve position from the two path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. HATCHET CREEK broke quickly
and dueled on the inside early, dropped back to chase the leaders up what remained of the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired on the rail
in the stretch.

POCKET PLAYER settled in second last well behind everyone but MISTER CHARMING, inched closer down the backstretch and into the far turn, began a
circling bid from past the three eighths, came four wide into the lane, sustained his rally when driven in upper stretch, led at the sixteenth and cleared.
COSMIC TREASURE was bumped by PACKED HOUSE in the opening strides, led inside into the clubhouse turn while prompted by PACKED HOUSE,
ceded a narrow lead to that foe near the three quarters and pressured the pace down the backstretch, dueled into the turn, held a narrow lead over
PACKED HOUSE past the three eighths, drove clear in upper stretch, but was caught near the sixteenths. PACKED HOUSE broke inward and bumped
COSMIC TREASURE in the opening strides, attended the early pace outside of that foe, got his head in front near the three quarters, set a pressured pace
down the backstretch, vied in the three path into the far turn, had no answer as COSMIC TREASURE wrested a narrow lead past the three eighths, proved
no match as that foe kicked clear into the lane, flattened out but salvaged the show under a drive. NOT VERY GENTLE chased inside around the far turn,
continued to chase behind the tracking flight down the backstretch and in the two path on the far turn, was driven between past the three eighths, came
three wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick in the final furlong. MISTER CHARMING settled at the rear well behind all foes except POCKET
PLAYER, continued patiently down the backstretch and into the far turn, began to take closer order in the two to three path past the three eighths, continued
to rally up the rail into the lane, but flattened out in the final furlong. DRAMATIC KITTEN chased between horses through the clubhouse turn, inched forward
to track behind the leading pair into the backstretch, continued to track along the rail around the far turn, was driven between horses into upper stretch and
came up empty. SMILING SILAS chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, inched forward past the seven eighths to track the leading pair, continued
outside of DRAMATIC KITTEN in the tracking flight down the backstretch and in the four path on the far turn, began to lose ground past the three eighths
and emptied out into the lane.
