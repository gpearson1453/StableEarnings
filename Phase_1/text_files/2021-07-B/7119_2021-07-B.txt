gamely in the stretch. ASTROLOGICAL stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, was determined but evened out in
the late stages. BEAT THE SYSTEM bumped with BUTTERED TOAST leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn then
finished evenly. SUPER LUNAR settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide through the far turn but never reached contention. DAMA

close early but settled at the back of the pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. LA LIBERTEE in range,
stalked the pace from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. DIRTY DANGLE in touch, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn
then rallied gamely from the outside. CAN'T BUY LOVE has early speed with several others and was taken back to the rear late backstretch, closed two to
four-wide through the turn and finished under a determined drive. HARD STREET showed speed, set a pressured pace, was headed at the top of the
stretch and tired after a brief chase.

Footnotes
SILVER MAGNATIZED stalked the early duelers while three wide, loomed outside that pair in upper stretch in the four path, drove to the front inside the
three sixteenths pole on her wrong lead, switched back to her proper lead inside the sixteenth and held a safe margin of victory to the wire. SWOOP TO
FINISH broke slow and settled off the pace, commenced a gradual run to get up on the midpack runners by the eighth pole while lugging in a tad, really
motoring in the final sixteenth while widest to grab the place spot. SMART BIRD settled in midpack, followed the winner in the three path late on the turn and
into the stretch, on her wrong lead and lugging in down the lane and had second at the sixteenth pole but lost it to a closer late. MIZZ GEMMA off the pace
and along the rail heading into the turn, closed in the two path into range and was a bit erratic in upper stretch, up for a minor award late without threatening.
INTRO herded from her inside post at the start and trailed the field into the stretch, came off the rail down the lane and bested the balance while in the five
path late. ONEOFTHEMGIRLS broke in at the start, rushed up to duel inside a rival, shook that one off turning for home and had a clear lead in early stretch
but was headed at the three sixteenths and faded from there. ALLPAIDUP chased along the inside, got in behind the leaders by the three sixteenths pole
but lugged in and on her wrong lead could not be coaxed off the fence to go by the tiring pacesetter, levelling off the final stages. NICE QUIST hesitated at
the start and jumped up early, well off the pace throughout and never entered contention. SILENT GHOST dueled outside the leader, drifted out into the
three or four path late on the turn and in upper stretch, tiring and fading in the final furlong.

vain. SUMMER SUNSET hopped out of the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. ULTIMATE

SOUPER MUNNINGS in mid pack early but was steadied back to off the pace down the backside, came rail to three wide late on the turn and shifted out to
the five path looking for a seam turning for home, got through in upper stretch and drove to the front at the eighth pole, needing the wire late to hold on.
GREY SEAL led before being guzzled back along the inside, was on heels through the entire turn, still in traffic and drifting out searching for a seam in
upper stretch, found room in the six path by the eighth pole and was closing in on the winner but ran out of real estate. QUEEN'S SPEED off the pace early,
was still trailing late on the turn, shifted out to the eight path in turning for home and closed resolutely down the center of the course to get up late for the
show spot. GOLDEN GARTER was taken hold of hard early to get in behind the leading duelers, got a seam on the fence when the pacesetter drifted off the
fence at the three sixteenths pole, but could not quicken late and was picked up for the show spot on the wire. SAY HEY (FR) sat two to three wide stalking
the dueling pacesetters, loomed dangerously to their outside in upper stretch but could not match the energy of the closers, hanging in the final sixteenth.
BOBBI'S LEGACY broke slow, circled from the rear three to five wide on the turn, out in the eight path turning for home but her rally stalled at the sixteenth
pole . SCATTER THE CLOUDS led shortly after the break, dueled with a rival late backstretch and around the turn, stayed game until headed at the eighth
pole and lost positions in the final sixteenth. STOKES broke on top but was taken back to three wide chase the early duelers, to the outside of the eventual
place finisher when three wide around the turn, still in range in upper stretch but could not sustain her bid. MEADOW BEAUTY stalked and pressed the
early leader throughout, tiring and dropping back in the final furlong. MIA AT MIDNIGHT off the pace early, was near the rear and two to three wide on the
turn, fanned into the six path when rallying mildly turning for home and did not respond.

PUNCH HARD led quickly, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held off COLLECTIVE FORCE under a drive. COLLECTIVE
FORCE settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely and was gaining late. MARITIME MISSION was bumped at the
start and was steadied, settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch, appeared to hang then responded in
the late stages and closed well. LOMAKI FORCE, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, forced the issue on the backstretch, dueled two-wide on the turn,
was headed at the top of the stretch and tired. RUNNINFORCOVER, off slowly, stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, chased into the
stretch then flattened out in the late stages. BLAST IN THE SNOW raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn then evened out in deep stretch.
LOADED SNIPER pressed the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly.
