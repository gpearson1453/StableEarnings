Footnotes
HENRY STANDINGBEAR exchanged contact with Thorn Of Rose Hill leaving the gate then raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, dueled close three wide on the far turn, was carried out leaving the turn but dug in under steady encouragement
to get up just under the wire. STRIDE ON BY raced with the pace through the front stretch then took the lead past the half mile pole, dueled with the
advantage down the backstretch, was met toward the quarter pole and raced just off the rail on the turn, came out a path toward the eighth pole and
consequently had his heels clipped, was steadily encouraged past the pole but was nipped under the wire. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN rated close inside the
first turn, picked up the chase leaving the eighth pole, raced in the five path on the far turn, checked sharply and angled wide to avoid a spill at the eighth
pole, then came along for third later yards. CHOPRA raced with the pace through the front stretch then gave chase leaving the first turn, continued close at
the rail on the far turn but showed little further. MINI BOLT raced off the rail while well off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but showed little more. DEPUTY JAMES rounded the first turn about the five path and raced outside into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn, was carried wide into the lane and could only improve his
position in the stretch. MIKI saved ground through the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole then checked sharply to avoid a spill nearing the
eighth pole. LET'S GET STARTED rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and raced outside into the backstretch, showed only mild response
through the backstretch then checked midway on the far turn. THORN OF ROSE HILL broke awkwardly and exchanged contact with Henry Standingbear
leaving the gate, stalked three wide on the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and dueled close between horses on the far turn, but clipped the
heels of Stride On By approaching the eighth pole and lost his rider. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the incident at the eighth pole, though, took
no action.

QUITE SUGGESTIVE became a bit anxious in the gate then broke inward to make contact with Audrey Lucille, rated a short lead through the backstretch,
kept the advantage nearest the rail on the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. CHARM WEAVER steadied lightly leaving the
gate then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, dug in down the lane and just lasted in second. DIAMOND TRAIN gave
chase, raced in the three and four paths on the turn, finished strong and just missed it all. CLUBIN TILL DAWN engaged in close chase inside, raced near
the rail on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. DAKOTA MIST chased through the backstretch, raced close in the three path on the turn then
flattened the final sixteenth. LADY SPARROW gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path. STERLING FURIOSA was bumped leaving the gate,
raced well back and raced in the five path of the turn. AUDREY LUCILLE was bumped inward and into Sterling Furiosa leaving the gate, gave chase and
saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
BURN THE SHIPS stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms past the three eighths and dug in from there to
take the nod inside the sixteenth pole, then moved off later yards. DUSKY rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and was met past the three eighths, dug in with the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was headed just past the sixteenth pole and relented later yards.
CHAMPTOWN HOPE saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and angled to the four path past the three sixteenths pole, though, showed
little further. DUNLUCE CAISSLE steadied lightly soon after the start and settled back off the rail the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving
the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and showed little more. FLASH LIGHTENING rated close inside, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then weakened. LUV THE PAINTER raced off the early pace in the four path, bid into the
backstretch and ran in the five path of the far turn. ALWAYS BIZ showd little response through the backstretch. PRINCE OF FREEDOM came through the
opening turn in the three path and was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
PERUVIAN DANCER stalked from the two and three paths the first turn then challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms in the
vicinity of the three eighths pole and contested the edge from that point, dueled clear midway on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement
to hold off the effort of BUZZHOUND, who settled off the early pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close in the
three path of the far turn, continued a factor through the upper stretch but relented the final sixteenth. FOREFRONT stalked inside, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled to the four path into the lane and was along for third the final strides. THE
SEVEN FIVE saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, then flattened inside the eighth
pole. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE ran in the six path the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the
far turn about the four path and showed little further. FLASHY READY RICK took the early lead approaching the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated inside,
came under pressure when met leaving the three eighths and contested at a close disadvantage past the pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far
turn, showed no further response and was eased in the lane. ORIENTATED rounded the opening turn about the five path and showed little response
through the backstretch. INJECT THE LIGHT saved ground.

Footnotes
TALKTHETALK rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled close into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead three
wide midway on the far turn, drew clear approaching the top of the lane and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. CHINA CAT raced in the four path the
first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved position in the three path of the far turn and dug
in down the lane to take second the final strides. HOUSE OF LOVE stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and
raced close at the rail on the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and relented second the final strides. INFINITE REWARD saved early ground racing
well off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. YOUR EYES TO MINE raced with the early
pace two deep then dueled with a slim lead between horses through the backstretch, was caught at the rail leaving the quarter pole then weakened
approaching the top of the stretch. PETES PRIDE came through the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the five path of the far turn. COOL MO raced off the pace inside, picked up the chase approaching the three
eighths pole, but weakened in the three path of the far turn. PUT POSITION saved ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail then weakened. KATIE'S BAYOU set the early pace inside, was caught past the half mile pole and gave chase at the rail from that point,
but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole and faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
RAVIOLI MAMA accelerated to contention while angling in, took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and rated on the front end, was pressed clear at the five
sixteenths, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to widen. CASTLE'S TUFFY settled off the earlier pace in the two and three
paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted a bit into the lane, dueled for second mid-stretch
and finished well. SWEET PIPER rated off the pace inside the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn,
dueled for third mid-stretch but showed little more. GRANDMA SCHNUR angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught at the nine sixteenths pole
and gave close chase from that point, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened in the lane. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET saved ground well off the
pace on the first turn, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little further.
UNEXPECTEDLY rounded the first turn in the three path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, showed only mild response and flattened in the
four path of the far turn. MISS CHEENY rounded the opening turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and bid mildly to improve her
position. CHERISH YOUR DREAM saved ground well off the early pace and showed little response through the backstretch. LIL TINKERBELL showed little
response. CROOKED WAYS rated close off the rail the opening turn but faded readily from the half mile pole.
