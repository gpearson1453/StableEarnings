Footnotes
FARZIN was slow at the start, chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane, lugged in a bit nearing the sixteenth pole,
edged past the leader and held in the final stages. JERRY'S SECRET tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid down the lane
but did not have enough in the final stages. CARDINAL BIRD raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining
in the late stages. KANTPAYTHETOLL was off slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced off the rail into the lane, angled out in the stretch, rallied
and was flying late in the stretch run. PITMAN was slow at the start, chased the pace, was getting out in the turn, raced in the four path into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. LASTTRAINTOBOSTON pressed the pace early, took over command, raced off the rail into the lane,
was lugging in the stretch, drew clear near the eighth pole but was swallowed up soon after. LINE OF GOLD set the pace early, was on the inside into the
lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. CAPTAIN YENNER came out at the start and was no threat. TIGER SHARK was done early.
