Footnotes
BIG LUCK settled early, progressed from outside on the backstretch to take over the lead three wide on the second bend, moved clear leaving that turn,
angled in some entering the lane, widened command under a drive and kept to task until the final sixteenth. MARLEE vied for the lead inside rivals from the
beginning, did not stay with BIG LUCK on the second turn, slowly wore down and gradually floated out the last furlong but held second under steady
handling. MEXIA hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, was also settled, gradually progressed from inside to reach contention on the second
bend, fanned outside BIG LUCK for the stretch run and was closing in on MARLEE late. LITTLE MOLITTA disputed the pace outside MARLEE for five
furlongs then began to flatten.

Footnotes
READY SEEKER outrun from inside leaving the chute, advanced between horses to vie for the early lead, angled in beside CARSON RESERVE with a
quarter mile to to, battled that one through the lane and shook free the final sixteenth. CARSON RESERVE contested the pace from along the rail, lost the
advantage on the bend, did not relent in the stretch, slowly wore down in the late going but was easily second best. ENGLISH disputed the pace between
rivals, did not keep up two wide on the turn, moved to the rail midstretch, was no match for the top pair but was unchallenged for third. PINCH MINE raced
in contention just inside ENGLISH on the backstretch but began to yield with three furlongs to go. ASIA ASIA broke awkwardly, was an early factor from
outside but faded widest on the bend.

Footnotes
VEGAN GOES BEST a step slow at the break, advanced from outside to share the lead, moved ahead into the bend, angled in some, floated out some as
she was roused entering the lane, was kept to a steady drive and held sway. AMERICAN HOLIDAY vied for the early lead inside horses, had the rail on the
bend, had every chance in the stretch but lacked the extra late kick. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN displayed early speed between rivals, did not keep up into the
turn, followed VEGAN GOES BEST through the bend, angled outside the latter after entering the last furlong, was all out, closed well but was too late.
ALMAFUERTE fractious in the gate before the start, was taken out and examined by the veterinarian, reloaded on the vet's okay, was hustled along once
the race began, prominent on the backstretch, took over third widest on the bend but slowly yielded for the stretch run. WOOD NOT MIND was also a step
slow at the start, slow to find her stride, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn but had no late bid.

Footnotes
PALAGO a step slow at the start, was rated at the back, let out from along the rail nearing the turn, roused leaving the bend, rallied under a steady drive
from path two in the lane and swept past AUNT STELLA nearing the wire. AUNT STELLA soon moved to a clear lead, showed the way from inside,
lengthened command under a drive in the stretch, was all out the last furlong but did not have enough left. CHARLO forwardly placed from outside, lost
ground widest through the bend, could only make up minor ground late but caught HEART OF REASON for third. HEART OF REASON pressed the early
pace, was in path two on the bend, drifted out slightly upper stretch and slowly yielded the final eighth.

TOUR ON was kept close from outside, roused five wide on the bend, under a steady drive through the lane, took over approaching the final sixteenth and
drew off under urging. R U FORREAL settled at the back, advanced along the rail on the turn, steadily progressed inside rivals through the stretch and got
up for second with seventy yards to go. ENCHILADA well placed between rivals early, was four wide taking the bend, took over second upper stretch,
leveled off inside the last eighth but caught ROCKET QUEEN for second near the wire. ROCKET QUEEN broke alertly, set the pace along or just off the
inside, widened command upper stretch under a drive but began to wear down inside the final furlong, gradually drifted out under left-handed urging and
yielded between horses. LADY WARRIOR was away slowly, advanced between horses to press the early leader, was in path three on the bend then
flattened out for the drive. COUNTRY ASSETS raced in contention from inside but began to tire before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
STUMP broke on top and sprinted clear of the rest, was challenged from outside on the turn, drifted out to path three entering the stretch, battled under a
steady drive and held ITALIAN CHARM at bay. ITALIAN CHARM broke a step slow and outward, bumping VIRGA, advanced from outside to race in the
second flight, closed the gap on the leader while three wide on the bend, fanned out further to stay outside STUMP into the lane, fought gamely but had to
settle for second best. JUSTENUFFTUFF was prominent between rivals, also closed the gap on the leader on the turn, fanned out some leaving the bend,
altered in upper stretch for a clear path, had every chance but failed to have the extra needed in the late going. VIRGA was a step slow, as well, at the break
then bumped, recovered to race in contention from inside, waited for room on the bend, got through along the rail leaving the turn and flattened out the last
eighth.
