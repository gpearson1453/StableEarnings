best. MORO LEGEND was allowed to settle early on the inside, then came five wide into the stretch while making a mild bid but came up empty in the drive,
bested rest. OREGON COUNTY steadied on the first turn, then settled in four wide down the backstretch and tired. MAX BET stalked the early pace and
made a three wide bid past the half mile marker, then raced on the inside on the far turn while tiring. KITKAT KITTEN was not a factor while saving

CH BERN was well rated early towards the inside, then eased out on the far turn to make a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, drew clear to prove best
under a drive. LAST TO KNOW was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung three wide entering the stretch, split rivals leaving the three sixteenths pole,
finished willingly. DEGRASSE stalked the early pace and then went up to vie for command three wide on the backstretch then took over past the turn but
faded in the drive, held show award. I DON'T FLY COACH was bumped hard at the start, then offered a belated rally. JADE'S CLASSY ONE vied for the
early lead and then stalked the pace three wide on the backstretch and weakened. TWO CHIPS vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. TAP A
MIRACLE was distanced and eased to the wire.RACE WAS HAND TIMED

best. TWIDDLE chased the early pace four wide and weakened, bested rest. KASEN'S SISTER lacked a rally while on the inside. MY LOVELY CHARLIE
broke inward, then ducked in sharply leaving the chute, then was hustled four to five wide down the backstretch and failed to menace. RACE WAS HAND

TENSAS TODDY lunged at the start, then settled in on the inside down the backstretch, was asked on the turn and advanced on the rail by the quarter pole,
then closed well late on the inside to get up in time under a drive. LUCKY INFERNO tracked the early pace and made a four wide move nearing the quarter
pole, then shook clear in the furlong grounds but was caught late, good effort. FANCY THIS set a pressured pace on the inside, then shook clear on the turn
then was headed leaving the turn and moved off the rail by the three sixteenths pole, gave way grudgingly in the final furlong while saving the show award.
BEST LITTLE MAN was bumped at the start, then rated between horses down the backstretch, moved out on the turn to be five wide by the quarter pole but
lacked the needed kick in the drive, missed show award. THEORIST pressed the early pace three wide and tired. BIG GIG broke inward at the start
bumping a rival, then had a inside trip but failed to menace. HUMPHREY was four wide into the first turn, then raced five wide down the backstretch and had
no response. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
