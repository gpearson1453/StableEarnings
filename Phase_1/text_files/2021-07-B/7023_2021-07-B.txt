Footnotes
GREEDY CREEDY grabbed the early lead, pulled away leaving the far turn and was driven clear in the stretch. ALLEN'S ROCKET settled while three wide,
advanced on the far turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch. IDEOLOGY stalked the pace, was outpaced leaving the far turn and proved no factor in
the stretch. POINT OF IMPACT never menaced. HEZA WILD RIDE threw his head at the start and was never involved. MAHOMES raced forwardly while
four wide and dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
BOO BE RIGHT gained the early lead, edged clear leaving the turn, drifted out and was all out to hold RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT safe. The latter saved
ground, was angled off the rail approaching the eighth pole and closed ground. BLANK IT chased while four wide and stayed on well. BLACKTOP LEGEND
attended the pace and dropped back leaving the turn. TWO PAIR was void of speed. GASPERGOU failed to threaten. SHANGHAI MIKE chased along the
inside and weakened.
