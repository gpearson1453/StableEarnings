Footnotes
KITTEN'S SOLUTION stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, rallied, led mid stretch and drove clear. MAS CHIKILIN broke inward , closed
quickly on the rail to take a short lead mid backstretch, set a pressured pace, was challenged a furlong out, held off TRANQUILITY BASE in the final furlong
but could not contain the late running winner in the final 16th. TRANQUILITY BASE forced the pace from the second path, was hustled on the turn,
challenged a furlong out but could not stay even and chased to the wire. SPANISH EXPRESS broke sharply then settled in to stalk the pacesetter, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. DISTINCT PASSION was away slowly and settled at the back of the pack, was hustled three
and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. WHISKEY VICTOR, at the rear early, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished
evenly but did not threaten. SUMERIAN BELL stalked the pace from the rail, was under a ride but falling back on the turn, tired at the top of the stretch and
was eased, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
NOVEMBER FOG stalked the pace, pressed the issue early backstretch, dueled briefly and moved clear into the far turn then widened in the stretch under a
hand ride. DEJAS TOO raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely but was clearly second best. SPIDER BELLE
broke inward and bumped HIDDEN IDENTITY leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then finished
evenly. IVY'S STAR settled off the pace, fell further off the pace on the backstretch despite saving ground then posted a mild rally just getting up for a minor
share. HIDDEN IDENTITY, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide through the far turn but never reached contention. SO ELUSIVE
led quickly, was pressured early backstretch, dueled briefly but was headed approaching the far turn, chased hard along the rail then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHEDAT led the first time past the grandstand, set a reserved pace and held sway under a hand ride. COURT RETURN broke inward and settled off the
pace, came along the rail and two-wide on the first turn, was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and closed gamely.
TEACHER'S PET raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the final turn then finished under a determined drive. TRISH THE DISH
stalked the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. STORMY DERBY DAY settled in mid pack, rode the
rail on both turns, was hustled into the stretch and finished gamely. BAYOU BELLE, in range, chased two to four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing
response. RAPUNZEL'S DREAM raced in mid pack, came three then two-wide through the clubhouse turn, chased two and three-wide on the final turn then
evened out in the stretch. HANCHY settled off the pace, saved ground on the turns but was never in contentious.

Footnotes
KING CAUSEWAY sat on the fence in midpack early, moved up in behind a wall of runners at the three sixteenths pole, angled out into the five or six path
turning for home and found a seam, closed resolutely to get the front at the eighth pole and was inching away in the final stages from a stubborn foe.
BODE'S TIPSY stalked the leader while three wide to late on the turn, bid outside two rivals in upper stretch and was head and head for the lead in upper
stretch, gave way stubbornly to the winner inside the sixteenth pole but was a clear second best. ENGLISH CONQUEROR settled between rivals chasing
the leaders, came up the inside of four rivals in upper stretch to gain a very brief lead near the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. FINALIST
sat in midpack when three wide, advanced four wide on the turn and was fanned out in the seven path when the winner came up his inside turning for home,
continued to inch up late for a minor award while drifting in. SEE FOREVER stalked the leader throughout, bid at the top of the stretch in the four path, in the
middle of five for the front nearing the eighth pole but could not sustain his bid and lost ground the final sixteenth. RELIABILITY began awkwardly, circled
four to five wide into midpack on the turn, was floated out into the nine path turning for home and lost ground in the final furlong when not changing leads. U
S NAVY CROSS off slowly, had two foes beat midway on the turn and came up the three path in the stretch with a mild close to get into a midpack finishing
spot. ARGENTIUM trailed by a wide margin, passing a few stragglers down the stretch. FAY DAN led under pressure throughout, was headed in upper
stretch and retreated in the final furlong. MUCHOKOVA rushed up the rail down the backside to be in behind the leaders into the turn, still in range turning
for home but empty in the final furlong. FLAME ZAPPER well off the pace throughout, was asked midway on the turn but did not respond.

Footnotes
WHEAT KING raced in mid pack, chased along the rail angling out to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied gamely and got by the
leaders in the late stages. DOTTED LINE forced the issue on the backstretch, took command entering the turn, set a pressured pace, was engaged a
furlong out by PIVEN, battled with that one, was passed by a closer in deep stretch and won the nod for place. PIVEN pressed the pace, was hustled up
close three-wide on the turn, challenged upper stretch, dueled to the end, was passed by the closer in the late stages and was outfinished for the place
award. FORESTER'S TURN broke outward then sprinted to the early lead, set a pressured pace, was headed near the turn, forced the issue two-wide,
chased into the stretch and evened out. IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) was away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch, finished all out but did not menace. GIGANTIC BREEZE broke slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and
two-wide on the turn then lacked a closing response. WHERE'S ANTHONY broke outward and was steadied, forced the pace, dropped back a bit on the
turn then flattened out in the stretch.

MARCH TO THE ARCH broke slowly and settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the stretch, bumped with BELICHICK a furlong out,
drove to the fore and widened and was taken in hand near the wire. BELICHICK settled in mid pack, chased along the rail and two-wide through the turn,
angled out for the drive, bumped with MARCH TO THE ARCH then lost his path when PRIMO TOUCH came out in front, then showed good effort at the end
to earn the place. THEREGOESJOJO broke alertly then settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied willingly from the outside.
PRIMO TOUCH showed early speed then pressed the pace, dueled from mid turn, gained the lead upper stretch but came out with a furlong to run and
tired. CURRENT settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail then two-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and closed willingly. SIR
SAHIB settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, angled out upper stretch but failed to menace. ADMIRALTY PIER held a short pressured pace
on the backstretch, dueled from midway through the turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. WOODBRIDGE raced from off the pace, was
hustled along the rail on the turn but never reached contention. MNEMBA ISLAND broke inward and settled off the pace, chased two-wide and then the rail
on the turn then also lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
PERSEVERANCIA settled in midpack while three wide, advanced in behind the top trio while still three wide on the turn, tipped out to go around the
eventual place finisher in upper stretch, had the lead by the three sixteenths and only the margin of victory was in doubt, never asked for her best at any
time. SWEET SERENADE broke out somewhat at the start, stalked a pair of leaders three wide throughout, bid for the front late on the turn and went by the
leaders in upper stretch with the winner to her outside, no match for that foe but a clear second best. BEQUIA broke in and bumped a rival at the start, was
in behind a wall of rivals when the field bunched up coming out of the turn, got through between at the eighth pole and outfinished a foe for the show spot.
SMARTY ILLUSION off the pace and inside into the turn, angled out into the four path midway on the bend, lost her path and steadied at the five sixteenths
pole, regrouped and rallied down the lane but was outgamed for the show spot in the final stages. WHO SAYS sat a nice trip in behind a trio of leaders late
on the turn, came inside in upper stretch but could not quicken when a large hole opened up, unable to take advantage of a fortunate turn of events.
CANDY GARDEN cleared quickly, allowed a rival to her inside the front after a quarter mile, stalked and headed that one inside the eventual place finisher
late on the turn, battled on to the three sixteenths pole but tired from there. BUTTERED TOAST trailed early, circled three to five wide into midpack on the
turn, out in the seven path turning for home and was out of gas at the eighth pole when widest. FLAXEN broke out and bumped a rival at the start, rushed
up inside to grab the front after a quarter mile, was headed nearing the turn for home and retreated down the lane. JEAN'S REWARD settled in along the
rail in midpack, dropping back from midway on the turn and down the stretch. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions were omitted pending review.

Footnotes
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE broke slowly and settled off the pace, raced three-wide on the turns, closed on the far turn, angled out between foes in the
stretch, rallied gamely and swept to the lead in the final 70 yards. PICCADILLY BEAU forced the pace. chased hard on the second path through the far turn,
hustled into the stretch, took the lead a 16th out but was passed at the 70 yard pole. AMBERWOOD off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled two and
three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. FORESTER'S DESTINY stalked the pace, was hustled along the
rail on the far turn, tendered a bid inside the field at mid stretch but was outkicked. MIRACLE SILVER lost his path just out and was taken off the pace, was
under strong restraint on the first turn and backstretch, closed three to five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. NEVAEH'S
VALENTINE set a pressured pace from the rail, quickened and moved clear on the far turn but was swarmed mid stretch and faded. DANI'S VICTORY was
taken back at the outset and was rated off the pace, closed three-wide into the far turn, was hustled four-wide into the stretch and flattened out in the final
furlong. DUKE OF MIAMI raced in mid pack, rode the rail throughout but evened out in the final furlong.

pressed the pace, chased hard while up close on the turn then finished all out. BALLROOMS OF MARS pressed the early pace, stalked from the rail on the
turn then finished gamely. ARRIVISTE was herded at the start then rated off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn and gained steadily in the stretch.
TAQUANYAH, bumped at the start, stalked the early pace, came three and four-wide on the turn then closed determinedly in the stretch. MELROSE STAR
bumped with ENGLISH SHIRL leaving the gate, settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide through the turn then rallied mildly in the stretch. JOKERS
