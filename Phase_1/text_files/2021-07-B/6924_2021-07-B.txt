Footnotes
TEMPLE QUEST within striking distance inside, challenged along the rail midway on the turn, drew out steadily through the lane under a steady hand ride to
win ridden out. SWEET JACKIELEIGH last away, trailed early as a result, advanced to briefly challenge the winner from the outside late in the bend, proved
no match for that one in the drive, clear for the place. CUSTOM MADE one paced off the inside, lacked closing kick in the drive to finish up best of the rest.
BRIDLED UP chased the leader early, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. SAMMY JAMMY broke on top, cleared early, bore out badly through the
turn to lose considerable ground, trailed home.

Footnotes
MY REBEL GIRL lacked early foot, began a steady advance from between rivals after five furlongs, challenged four wide turning for home, edged clear late
under steady handling. MISS MABELEE broke alertly, set or forced the pace throughout along the inside, could not match strides with the winner late,
narrowly held the place. LAST DESTINY void of speed while four wide through the first turn, continued to be outrun up the backstretch, raced five wide
through most of the second bend, drifted in under a right handed stick, was straightened and improved position late while widest at the wire.
TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, dueled up front off the inside the middle half, continued to vie between
rivals into and through upper stretch, weakened a bit late to lose a couple of positions. ABIGAIL G pressed the issue up front while between foes, remained
on even terms with the lead pack into the lane, also tired a bit in the late going. EMERY'S DREAM last to leave, raced back off the pace, failed to muster a
closing response. BE A BANDIT vied up front three wide, stopped. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

HICCUP allowed the pace to go early, advanced smartly on the leader in the three path turning for home, put a head in front entering the stretch and drove
steadily clear. TOO TUFF TO CRY off a step slow, continued to lag well back in the run up the backstretch, rallied three wide and behind the winner into the
stretch, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire while finishing up willingly to be clear for the palce. OUR BUCKET LIST in the second flight off
the rail, closer while between horses into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. SHARP MEMORIES away in good order, quickly sprinted well clear,
attempted to rate late in the turn, faltered when headed when straightened for home. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT back off the early pace, failed to rally. MAS
O MENOS chased the early leader, gave way abruptly in the turn, was pulled up in distress, vanned off. THREE QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME

Footnotes
PRETTY CREATIVE broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way through the final turn, two path into the lane, drifted out slightly
while maintaining a slight advantage inside the furlong grounds, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. ONE TIME GEM forwardly placed off the inside,
chased the leader up the backstretch, closer turning for home, saw that advance stall a bit past the furlong marker, came again late while widest of the first
flight to earn the place, outkicked by the winner. YOUNG THOMAS broke back, unhurried early, began to move a bit closer toward the inside second turn,
set down for the drive, challenged late inside the two leaders and proved best at the wire in a determined effort. STEAL IT BACK within striking distance
most of the way while racing outside, came up empty for the stretch run. D TOWN BABY off a step slow, tucked inside early in the first turn to save some
ground, remained back in failing to threaten. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SET HUT away alertly, pressed the issue in the two path up the backstretch, dueled through the turn and into the lane, late push, gained the nod in the final
strides in a determined effort. HOMEVIEW broke with the leaders, narrowly showed the way the opening quarter, dueled through the turn, continued to hold
a slight edge into the lane, extended that advantage slightly past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end in a game effort to narrowly miss. BOSTON
REPO chased the dueling leaders throughout, had little for that pair in the drive, remained clear of the others. ONEHOLYLION mid pack inside, crept a bit
closer into the turn, made little further advancement to finished up evenly. FAST VERDICT made little impact in remaining well back. COLONEL PIKE
lacked speed off the inside, failed to rally. MASTERLY fell back immediately after the start to trail, raced wide, remained sluggish and was well beaten at the
end.

VIOLENT WAYS broke alertly, sprinted clear soon after, showed the way into the turn along the inside, turned back the runner up in upper stretch to
reestablish a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, expanded that margin late under steady handling. TAPIZARS SECRET moved up to press the
winner from the outside, lodged a brief bid turning for home, could not keep up in the run through the stretch, all out to hold the place. FLASHY BREW
settled in the second flight off the inside, two path into the lane, shifted out nearing the furlong marker, slowly getting to the runner up late. LEMNISCATE
one paced behind the leaders outside, four wide early turn, continued outside, lacked a closing kick. PALVERA off slow, trailed, displayed some mild late
interest to be closing the gap on the field the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
BIRDCATMOUSE in the second flight early toward the inside, fell back in some traffic late in the turn, moved out for the drive, engaged the leader from the
outside with less than a furlong remaining and wore that rival down under firm handling. ARKANSAS BLING dueled early off the inside, vied between rivals
into the turn, disposed of the other speed to be clear when straightened for home, responded when confronted by the winner soon after and proved
stubborn. MIDNIGHT TRIP broke back, advanced on the outside into contention by late in the turn in the four path, continued to made progress on the top
two late. VELVET NIGHT forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, advanced to vie three wide and outside the winner through the turn, weakened in
the stretch, lost the show late. CABO SUNSET fell back to trail soon after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat.
FORTHELOVEOFLUCY dueled up front early inside the winner, gave way in the turn. SALT LIFE ANGEL off a step slow, moved up a bit early, began to
fade before a half.
