chased and finished clearly best of the rest. LOBSTA forced the issue along the two path for a half mile, dropped back three from the rail into the lane and
weakened. JAA MODE broke sluggishly, saved ground throughout and weakened. HOLD THE SALSA well placed in hand along the two path up the

Footnotes
EVRYBODYLUVSNORMAN away on top, set the pace along the rail, was headed briefly at the top of the lane, asked and drew off. HANGOUT tracked
along the two path, challenged briefly at the top of the lane, chased and held the place. JET FOR ANDY well placed along the three path, angled out in the
lane and finished with interest. IN THE ZONE ducked in at the start, saved ground and finished inside. STARSHIP OREO gained some along the three path
on the turn, angled wide and drifted out some in the stretch. FINANCIAL DRAW in hand along the three path, two path on the turn, eased out some and
failed to gain. K AND G saved ground on the turn, angled wide in the lane and checked at the sixteenths pole. NEVER EVOLVED hit the gate at the start,
four wide on the turn, was not a factor. E MOLINARI broke slow, saved ground and tired. HOPING AND PRAYING broke slow and then was outrun while
saving ground.
