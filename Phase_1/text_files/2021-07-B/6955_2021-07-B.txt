Footnotes
KICK IN THE GAS set the pace along the rail and drew off under an unrelenting drive. STATEN ISLAND lacked early speed, advanced inside around the
turn and was clearly second best in the lane. CAMPEADOR prompted the winner two wide, was no match for that foe and churned on to hold third.
SWEENEY'S CAT failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SETTE STELLE had brief speed three wide. FINDING MISCHIEF broke awkwardly,
saved ground and never threatened. MARTIN FIERRO was always outrun while mostly racing in the two path and angling five wide nearing the quarter pole.
HALFWAY RIGHT was briefly in range three wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GRAN RESERVA took over inside MY MISS MIRACLE shortly before completing the first quarter-mile, widened the advantage up the backstretch, repelled
a challenge from MY MISS MIRACLE approaching the top of the stretch, and drew away again under a mild drive. MY MISS MIRACLE led early, yielded to
GRAN RESERVA leaving the chute, narrowed the gap to loom a threat coming to the quarter-pole, got turned away once straightened away for the drive,
and ran on second best. STARSHIP BLANCA was a step slow to begin, and trailed near the inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG
FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

PRETTY RACHEL vied early inside BEYOND HEAVENLY, edged away after a half-mile, shifted off the inside three or four wide as I'M A COCO PEBBLE
challenged to her outside past the quarter-pole, moved clear again while drifting further out through the furlong grounds and was kept to pressure. I'M A
COCO PEBBLES saved ground close up into the turn, moved out to take a run at PRETTY RACHEL after six furlongs, was shaken off into the stretch and
ran on clearly second best. BEYOND HEAVENLY contested the early pace outside PRETTY RACHEL, could not match strides after a half-mile, and faded
steadily. LOVIN LIVIN stayed in range early outside, moved in around the turn, and was finished after six furlongs.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER settled off the pace inside, advanced inside around the turn, cut the corner into the lane, seized command near the
three-sixteenths pole, immediately cleared, drifted out slightly and drew off while ridden out. GO POKE THE BEAR lacked early speed, raced three wide
around most of the turn, swung eight wide near the quarter pole, ran on outside and outfinished a foe for the place. BRAY lagged well back in the five path
for six furlongs, rallied between foes in the lane but was outfinished for second. AREYOUTALKINGTOME raced four wide in midpack and lacked the
needed rally. TENACITY ZIP stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, bid outside of the pacesetter nearing the lane but tired
in the final furlong. SWING WEST failed to menace while racing five to six wide. SOUPER JAGUAR had early speed two wide, chased in the three path
around the turn and came up empty in the lane. EVERYONELOVESJAMES set the pace in the two path to upper stretch and stopped. AMBASSADOR JIM
chased the pace four wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
MERSEYSIDE tracked from outside to the turn, challenged outside R PREROGATIVE coming to the quarter-pole, battled through a long drive exchanging
bumps and brushes and prevailed all out. R PREROGATIVE pursued outside LIZA STAR early, reached the front between that one and MERSEYSIDE past
the five-sixteenths, moved to the rail turning for home, fought inside MERSEYSIDE making contact several times and was edged to the wire. AWESOME
ANNMARIE crept closer after a half-mile while shifting off the inside, came four wide for the drive, and was gaining gradually outside the top two at the
finish. PENS STREET broke in bumping DOMINEERING and was slowest away, raced three to four wide, and could not gain late under pressure.
DOMINEERING bumped with PENS STREET at the break, was sent hard early but had to steady when outsprinted by rivals, and never recovered while
saving ground. LIZA STAR sped clear early, showed the way entering the turn in the two-path, could not hold off challengers before going a half-mile, was
eased up drifting out through the late stages, got unsaddled past the finish and was ponied back.

Footnotes
KITODAN settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide to reach even terms near the three-eighths pole, angled into the two path soon after, dueled
outside of WINGING IN from there and prevailed under a steady drive. WINGING IT set the pace inside, dug in inside of the winner from the three-eighths
pole, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch, fought on inside throughout the lane and just missed in a game try. NEPOTI stalked the pace from the rail,
was no match for the top two but stayed on the be well clear of the rest. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP chased the pace three wide and faded after a half.
PANADERO was outrun inside. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY played no factor while racing four wide. OCTOBER TIME was off slow, saved ground and was
through early. MORE ADVENTUROUS had early speed two wide and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
BAILEY broke a length slow, saved ground early in the second flight, moved out four wide advancing to contention late on the turn, caught ONE FAST from
outside leaving the furlong grounds and drew clear. ONE FAST sped to the front after the start, rated along near the inside to the stretch, dug in when
challenged by BAILEY, yielded a sixteenth out and was clearly second best. FIRST RULE chased three wide for a half-mile, and lacked the needed closing
bid. RESIDENT was outsprinted early inside, moved out three wide improving position leaving the turn, but could not sustain the rally. FREE FLAY broke out
into STAR JUANCHO, pursued outside ONE FAST to the turn, and weakened after a half. THE ICE BEAST chased inside early, edged a bit closer to the
leaders past the midway point on the turn, then steadied while giving way outside the quarter-pole. STAR JUANCHO was bumped by FREE FLAY at the
start, moved out four wide on the turn, and could not reach contention.

Footnotes
MIRANDA SOFIA stalked the pace inside, advanced two wide around the turn, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and
widened under left-handed urging. LUNAR BLAST chased the pace four wide and stayed on outside to be clearly second best. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS set
the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and held on for the show. EXAGGERATED
MOMENT raced well back two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. CIDSTAYINURLAINE was in range three wide and
came up empty in the lane. SIERRA GOLD prompted the pace three wide and tired in the drive. MAY BEAU was outrun inside. SUGAR ON TOP saved
ground and made little impact. ART ROCK gave distant chase four wide and was eased through the lane.
