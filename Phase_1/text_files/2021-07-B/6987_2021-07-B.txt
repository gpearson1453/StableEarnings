Footnotes
ASHAAR went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the action while inside on the far
turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, spun into the two path entering the stretch, came under a right-handed crop while still on his
inside lead at the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead into the final sixteenth and
held under strong urging. GIOCARE was asked leaving the gate, saved ground on the first turn, moved out with six furlongs to run, was urged four wide on
the far turn, gained five wide into the stretch under the crop and finished willingly to just get the place. ROYAL REALM was asked to establish early position,
rounded the first turn in the three path, prompted then tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch under the crop, pursued the winner to the wire and lost the place while able to get the show. PRIME TIME PLAYER brushed with a foe at the start,
went four wide on the first turn, settled in third position, was roused three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch under the crop, pursued
the winner in the drive and was out-kicked then missed the trifecta. GOOD CULTURE navigated the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged
along passing the five-eighths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the far turn and was no factor. BREAKING STONES broke very awkwardly and a bit
slow while also brushing with an opponent, went two to three wide on the turns and failed to respond. JUMPSTER raced in the two path on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was coaxed along passing the five-eighths and retreated then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
PATHETIQUE established the front and showed the way under rating through comfortable splits uncontested and unattended while along the inside,
remained on hold down the backstretch and through the far turn awaiting a challenge settled into a comfortable rhythm, got given a notch and was set down
taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat inside the final seventy yards and
held on to prevail. SO ENCHANTING settled under a firm hold tracking along the inside from mid pack, tipped to the two path through the far turn, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home let out for the drive, issued a challenge through the final sixteenth bidding too late while not
showing enough and was along safe for the place honors. LADY VALENTINE forward from the start, got eased off PATHETIQUE shortly after the start and
settled just off the inside under a hard hold and in the clear in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TRACY FLICK three wide through the opening bend, settled under a rating hold just off
the inside behind the cover of the aforementioned foe, came under urging with five-sixteenths to go, cornered just off the inside for home, offered up a bid
but was outfinished. MISS BONNIE T under a hard hold just off the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and was outkicked. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS under a hard hold just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing tipped three
wide with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, made some ground while making no headway. SITTING PRETTY tracked
the pace along the inside from mid pack behind the cover of SO ENCHANTING, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch and made no headway. SUFFRAGETTE saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, cornered just
off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. UNIONDUESINCLUDED raced three wide throughout coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, swung four to five wide into upper stretch growing detached at the tail of the field and tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
STROLLING bumped with a rival at the start, settled in third position on the outside, ranged up three wide to make a bid with three furlongs to run, was
asked near the quarter-pole, had the rider knock the whip out of the hands of ALCOOLS jockey inside the three-sixteenths then was given one pop of a
left-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop shortly thereafter and prevailed under strong urging. CANTRELL HILL bumped with a
rival after the start, settled at the rear of the field, was roused two then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished willingly to get the
place at the wire. ALCOOLS tossed his head a touch at the start then bumped with a rival, tracked the pace on the outside, gained to make a bid between
foes with three furlongs to run, held a slim advantage passing the five-sixteenths, had the rider get the crop knocked out of his right-handed inside the
three-sixteenths, fought with foes while losing a bit of focus in the final furlong and was outfinished then lost the place on the line. THE SICARII moved his
head at the start and was off a couple lengths slow, settled on the outside, was asked three to four wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch, chased into
the final sixteenth and was out-kicked and missed the trifecta. WIN WITH PRIDE bumped with a foe just after the start, set the clear pace, was challenged
while inside midway through the turn then came under urging, fought on well under the crop into upper stretch, battled inside of foes into the final furlong,
dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. POPIZAR settled off the pace, was urged two to three wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty.

set down spinning three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch, inched clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish kept to task.
CLAMOR chased just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out spinning
three wide for home, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jumps. COUNT DOWN coaxed from the start, pressed the pace three then
two wide latched on to the outside, got roused swinging four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to procure the
show honors. BARDOLINO bobbled at the start recovering outwards and was corrected, chased just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside riding a
pocket trip through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on through to the wire. KNOCKOUT PUNCH broke out at the start bumping
TALLAJ solidly in tandem with VODKA LEMONADE, came together soon after a second time and squeezed back TALLAJ while conceding himself three
lengths to the front, chased just off the inside from near the rear coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, bid
through the stretch but was outkicked. FORCED three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DISCIPLANARIAN three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to
go, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TALLAJ got bumped solidly at the start when VODKA LEMONADE broke inwards and
KNOCKOUT PUNCH broke outwards, got bumped again soon after jostling for position as DISCIPLANARIAN tucked inside and got squeezed back
between foes conceding four lengths to the front, angled inside and chased along the rail down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. VODKA LEMONADE broke in at the start brushing the near
side stall before bumping TALLAJ in concert with KNOCKOUT PUNCH twice, squeezing that middle rival out the back while conceding nearly three lengths
to the front himself, chased eager early on pulling on the bit and had to nudge PETRUS to the five path before settling inside that rival four wide, tucked
three wide through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. PETRUS got nudged to the five path near the five-eighths as VODKA
LEMONADE pulled keenly after a troubled start, chased five then four wide before tucking mostly three wide through the turn, angled five wide into upper
stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
MARACUJA came out in front then was asked for early speed, dogged the leader on the outside in the two path, was joined on the outside by CLARIERE
early on the backstretch as that foe made a premature move to contest the pace, dropped back then was given a breather under coaxing, moved out
outside the half-mile pole, chased three wide under a strong hand ride on the far turn, gained four wide under a drive at the quarter-pole, made a bid under a
left-handed crop into upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and gamely prevailed under vigorous handling. MALATHAAT was
urged against the rail into the first turn, set the pace while hounded from the outside by MARACUJA for the opening three-sixteenths then CLARIERE from
outside the five-eighths pole, was asked while dueling inside of CLARIERE while along the rail on the far turn, came under a left-handed crop in upper
stretch, battled inside two foes past the eighth-pole, fought on gamely with the winner while drifting out some in the final furlong and was denied but well
clear for second. CLAIRIERE was coaxed four wide on the first turn, made an early move into contention with six furlongs to run then pressed the pacesetter
from the outside, vied in the two path under urging on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and weakened.
ROCKPAPERSCISSORS bobbled slightly at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped to the rail near the five-eighths,
came up empty on the final turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

MIDNIGHT WORKER hustled from the gate, got coaxed along inside down the backstretch just off the top pair, tipped to the two path at the
seven-sixteenths before making his way three wide near the three-eighths pole forcing IRISH SEA to cross almost over his heels when that rival tucked
inside, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command from an embattled pair just inside the three-sixteenths, inched away briefly
before coming under threat to his inside through the final furlong, dug in gamely fending off that foe and prevailed by a head on the wire. BOURBON HEIST
bobbled at the break, then got bumped between foes and pinched back at the start conceding three lengths to the front, chased two then three wide from
near the rear, made progress through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive loosely splitting
rivals near the eighth pole to issue a challenge through to the finish showing good courage to fight on to the end but was ultimately bested to the wire while
just preserving the place honors over a fast closing rival. VOLCANIC stumbled at the start and recovered forward before dropping off to settle in mid pack
three paths off the rail, got nudged to the two path by IRISH SEA tucking inwards as FLUID SITUATION tucked five then four wide to their outside, came
under coaxing nearing the three-eighths while just off the inside through the turn, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish outside
closing with a rush in the late stages and missed at the end. SOUTHERN SENSE coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and bidding into contention swinging five wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. WATASHA coaxed from the gate, chased three then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out,
swung four wide into upper stretch bidding into prominence outside the top trio, then flattened out in the final furlong. FLUID SITUATION coaxed from the
start, prompted the pace from the outside five then four wide nudging IRISH SEA into VOLCANIC five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path into the
turn and advanced to take over the front just inside the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and relented just inside the
three-sixteenths, then weakened in the final eighth. CHILENO broke in at the start brushing the stall on his left side before bumping BOURBON HEIST,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole to the
five path and offered no response. LABARDE hustled from the gate, established the front and showed the way from the two path early on under pressure
from FLUID SITUATION to the outside, tucked inside into the turn, got headed for command just inside seven-sixteenths remaining, returned the favor to the
new leader pressing that rival to his inside, took the inside route into upper stretch, got brushed straightened away by FLUID SITUATION and weakened to
the finish. IRISH SEA hustled from the gate, chased four paths off the inside early on until nudged three wide by FLUID SITUATION and in turn nudged
VOLCANIC to the two path, went three wide into the turn, had MIDNIGHT WORKER tip out in front nearing the three-eighths and went slightly over that
rival's heels tucking inwards to the two path at that station, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. FAITH RUNNER coaxed from the gate,
strode greenly with short strides four paths off the inside down the backstretch, grew detached at the tail of the field and tucked to the two path through the
turn, continued just off the inside for home and trailed.

Footnotes
SIFTING SANDS (GB) settled nicely on the inside, moved to the two path late on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, tipped out a path just
inside the three-sixteenths, rallied to make a bid just inside the furlong marker, gained the advantage coming to the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed
under strong urging. NEVER EXPLAIN jostled with a foe nearing the first turn, went four to five wide on that bend, moved up to prompt the pace on the
outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, led under the crop into the stretch, responded gamely under threat from the winner in the final furlong and just
missed while able to get the place. MIRA MISSION was taken under a tight hold early then pulled under restraint, was rated in the two path, drafted behind
horses on the final turn, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole, lacked room in traffic from the top of the stretch to near the sixteenth-pole, moved
out for clear space late and finished willingly for the show. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) saved ground on the first turn, was reserved in the back half of the field,
traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused after turning into the stretch and also finished willingly but missed the trifecta. HOMBRE broke in at
the start, went to the front then was taken in hand, raced near the inside on the first turn, gave up the lead inside the three-quarter pole, tracked the pace
from that point under restraint, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, pursued the leaders in the stretch and was out-kicked. SIGILOSO
navigated the first turn in the two path, was rated under a tight hold, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed kick. SPACE LAUNCH traveled around the first turn in the three path, went to the front inside the three-quarter pole, vied inside
on the far turn, lost the advantage to the runner-up before the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. FUTURE VICTORY raced in
the three path on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, steadied at the seven-sixteenths, went around the far turn in the two path, came three wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PERFORMING ARTS saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged four wide on the
far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MUNQAD hit the outside of the gate hard at the start, jostled with a foe nearing the
opening bend, was rated while keen in the three path, came under urging on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed
response. CALIBRATE went three then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. DREAM BIG DREAMS was last to commence, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at
the rear, saved ground on the far turn, was roused late on that bend, cut the corner under a drive into the stretch then moved out inside the three-sixteenths
and had nothing left. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

Footnotes
RASTAFARA (IRE) just off the inside just off the pace tracking behind the cover of MIDNIGHT CHOIR, remained patiently handled until set down spinning
three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, inched away under a drive kept to task. EGO TRIP (IRE) broke a beat slow and
awkward at the start, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, tipped out
near the eighth pole and closed well outside to secure the place honors. SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. INGRESS three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and improved position for the last major share. MIDNIGHT CHOIR attended the leader from the
outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, seized narrow and brief command at the
three-sixteenths before being displaced near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. BABY BLYTHE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. VINTAGE STYLE struck the off side stall at the start
then got bumped by NAKED ON THE BEACH, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. NAKED ON THE BEACH broke in at the start bumping VINTAGE STYLE, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered
just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. GOOD TALK showed the way in hand along the inside under the watchful eye of MIDNIGHT
CHOIR but facing little pressure from the outside until nearing the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing at that station, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining and tired.

when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, drew away under a drive into the final sixteenth then was
placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. AMENDMENT NINETEEN settled off the early pace then stalked the leaders, made a bid in the
four path early on the turn, dropped to the three path under a drive at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and proved no match but
was well clear for the place. FIRING CAROL settled between horses, was urged three then four wide on the turn and came up empty while best of the rest.
GLASS CEILING was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, raced inside under urging early on the turn then moved to the two path at the
three-eighths and failed to respond. FLASH MAGIC veered out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while outside of foes on
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA was forced out at the start,
settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and also failed to respond. MAKINGCENTS was hustled from the start, moved up under urging then
dropped back outside the five-eighths, fell to the rear with a half-mile to run, went two then three wide on the turn and faltered. ENTREAT moved in while

Footnotes
CARAVEL just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, remained patiently handled until angled three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive,
closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking over command a sixteenth from home, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. IN
GOOD SPIRITS two to three wide in pursuit, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under urging five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jumps to the wire. ROBIN SPARKLES coaxed from the gate, showed the way
in hand just off the inside through swift splits, continued in the two path into upper stretch, got roused near the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was
collared a sixteenth from home, then got nailed in the last jumps while able to preserve the show honors. TASS just off the inside in pursuit from near the
rear of the field, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. FLOWER POINT three
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. JAKARTA hustled from the start, chased three
then two wide in closest aim of the leader coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. Please note that due to an error reporting JAKARTA as scratched that entrant ran for purse money only.

roused four then five wide on the far turn, rallied under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, closed well to make a bid into the final furlong then took the
advantage and held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. CARA'S DREAMER went two to three wide on the opening turn, settled towards the
rear, was taken in hand briefly behind a troubled foe leaving the backstretch, went three wide while asked on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast to just miss while clear for the place. FREEDOM MACHINE bumped with a foe at the start, moved in on
the opening straightaway, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, dropped in a touch leaving the backstretch, raced inside
to the two path while roused on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show while unable to go with the top two. MOPOLKA
saved ground while showing speed on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the final turn, took the
lead under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and weakened. CHOOSE HAPPINESS went three to four wide
on the turns, was asked near the three-eighths, swung six wide into the stretch and improved position. UNICORN SALLY dropped in on the initial
straightaway, settled on the inside, lost action then checked sharply leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was roused in the two path
nearing the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. ELECTRIC YOUTH was taken under a tight hold early then reserved on the inside, came under
urging while saving ground on the far turn, chased into the final furlong and tired. MY LIPS ARE SEALED went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two
path, showed the way through solid fractions, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage inside
the three-sixteenths and weakened. VALLARAND saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back of the field, was taken in hand briefly behind a
checking foe leaving the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and was no factor. JUST OK IS NOT OK was
keen under restraint between foes early then steadied, went three wide on the first turn, settled more kindly while outside on the backstretch, was asked four
wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and came up empty. EMMA AND I saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear,
was taken in hand briefly behind a checking foe leaving the backstretch, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. JAMAICA
JOY went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, came up empty in the three path on
the final turn and retreated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN INTO THE TURN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF
