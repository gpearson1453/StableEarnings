MACHO MADNESS stalked the pace, advanced on the turn and edged clear in the stretch. PAY DIRT grabbed the early lead, was challenged on the turn,
proved no match and stayed on. PRIVATE TRUTH ducked in at the start, saved ground, made no impact and stayed on. PACK'N IRON settled while three
wide, was urged on the turn and lacked a rally. FERRIC was bumped at the start and no factor. BIKER TIM was carried in at the start and never involved.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE HALF MILE FRACTION OF :46.17 WAS HAND TIMED BY THE EQUIBASE CHART CALLER.

TOUGH COMPANY seized command leaving the first turn, responded leaving the far turn and readily kicked clear thereafter. FOXY ACE saved ground,
was checked when short of room at the three-quarter pole, was angled three wide into the stretch and finished well. EAST MOON LAKE outpaced early,
commenced a bid on the far turn and stayed on in the stretch. WHATA PERFECT DAY was void of speed and never involved. RANCHO BARGO chased
the pace while three wide and faded. WOKE UP WILD led early and retreated.

FIREHORN stumbled badly, went to his knees at the start, chased the pacesetters, responded to pressure in the stretch and gamely edged clear in the late
stages. ONE SON OF A CHIEF raced in striking position while three wide, continued three wide into the stretch and stayed on. FLY FIRST CLASS forced
the pace, remained in contention for the stretch run and lacked the needed bid. LOUD N PROUD dueled, held well into the stretch and was worn down late.
GALACTICA never menaced. REBOUNDER was always outrun.

stayed on. HOLDTHATLOVE stalked the pace and dropped back leaving the far turn. HUSH Y'ALL took no part.
