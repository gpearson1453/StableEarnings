Footnotes
SAND MOUNTAIN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
BLUE SKY'S ABOVE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place.
MAXIMUM FACTOR stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, weakened late and
held the show. DETANGLER tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out.
DAHOG allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and improved his position. GOHARA lunged at the
start, moved up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. THAT'S BUCKBEAK was no factor.

the place. THE TWO NANCY'S rated close up, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the lane and passed tiring rivals. DANCE OR STROLL rated
inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and weakened. GET SASSY broke awkwardly from the gate,

HE'S A BELIEVER allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up in the final
strides. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and
missed. SHAENA BUE chased the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and lacked the
needed late kick. LORD BYRON mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. HEY SACH sprinted
to a long lead, then weakened the final furlong. SILVER DOLLAR CITY mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and had a
mild late gain. PATHWAY TO VICTORY well placed outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane and faded the
final furlong. COMMANDER TRUMP allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and had a mild gain. WHOOPS ran evenly.
BETTYS BOMBER never far back, held position three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF

LEXINATOR rated close up, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear and held under
steady pressure. PEPPER well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then could not gain in the
late going and held the place safe. BABY DRAGON allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn on the two path, bid on that path and had a mild gain.
POSH PLAYDAY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, weakened and held a share. DANA'S BEAUTY set the pace on the
inside and faded in the lane. BIG ANGEL was never involved.

steady gain and edged up late. GOODTIME ARTIE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a
steady gain to finish on equal terms for the place. HESASMOKIN mid pack, looped up four wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the
lane, then lacked the needed late kick and finished on equal terms for the place. SPROLES allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals and did not have enough late. NOT QUITE WRIGHT set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened
late. TESTIFIED mid pack, gained position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and weakened in the drive. RAMIRIN passed tiring
rivals. GOLDEN OAK well placed in the early going, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path and faded the final furlong. SQUIRREL vied
