Footnotes
ZIDIKAI was herded in slightly by COOKIN ROSES in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear flight, was pushed along into the turn and began
to improve two wide, continued to improve three wide into the lane, veered out under a drive in upper stretch, continued his rally, struck the front
approaching the sixteenth and ran clear. COOKIN ROSES broke slightly inward, was sent to the lead, edged further clear in the two path on the turn, was
driven into the lane, kept on while drifting out under continued urging, but was no match for ZIDIKAI in the final sixteenth. ANTECEDENCE settled outside of
ZIDIKAI down the backstretch, was urged from the rear four wide on the turn, was driven into the lane in the five path, and passed outside tiring horses.
ARBITRARY was asked for early speed but outjumped by COOKIN ROSES, tracked the leader outside of TIME BREAK down the backstretch, chased the
leader while positioned three wide on the turn, came into the lane between horses and flattened out. TIME BREAK tracked the leader inside of ARBITRARY
down the backstretch, chased the leading pair while saving ground on the turn, was driven inside into the lane and came up empty.

nearing the five sixteenths pole and gained ground on the outside in late stretch, no match for the winner. LADY ATLANTIC raced off the pace between
horses in the early going, began to improve position from the two path around the turn, and chased the winner home, getting outkicked for second in late

Footnotes
FINNEGAN (IRE) dueled inside of ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS, began to clear from the three sixteenths, and drew off in the final furlong while kept to the
task. OFFLEE FUN raced between horses in the rear flight down the backstretch, continued at the inside of the rear flight into the turn, took closer order in
tandem with LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS while positioned two wide past the three eighths, chased in upper stretch, bulled his way through horses near the
sixteenth and got up for the place. TRE LEE DIVINE broke sharply but was outsprinted to the lead by FINNEGAN and ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS, settled
back to chase midpack, chased three wide on the turn and into the lane, drifted out under a drive in upper stretch, kept on willingly but was outkicked for the
place. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS raced three wide in the rear flight down the backstretch, continued in the rear flight on the far turn, took closer order four
wide past the three eighths, was driven four wide into the lane, altered out near the sixteenth to get around a group of horses, and passed tiring horses.
ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS dueled outside of FINNEGAN down the backstretch and around the turn, proved no match for him from the three sixteenths,
and weakened while drifting out. MUTAKDDIM ROAD tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, chased well behind the leading pair on the turn while
saving ground, was driven inside in upper stretch and weakened inside. CANARY ISLANDS settled at the inside of the rear flight, pulled up just past the half
mile mark and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SENSE OF SELF chased outside of HERO ALEXANDRA through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, continued to chase in the five path on the
far turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch, finished strongly in the final furlong and got up in time. GOOD MONGOLIA cleared to the lead into the
clubhouse turn, set a clear pace around the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, was confronted by DRINKS ON ME into the far turn, vied inside of
that foe from the five sixteenths to midstretch, kept on as DRINKS ON ME began to flatten out, was caught late but kept on gamely to hold the place. RAPID
TRANSIT was wrangled to the rear early, inched closer to join outside of KINGSBURY DREAM on the backstretch, edged closer in the three to four path on
the far turn, dropped inside to upper stretch, rallied inside, altered out past the furlong mark for room, and was gaining late. KINGSBURY DREAM settled
second last early, raced inside of RAPID TRANSIT in the rear flight down the back straight, raced at the rear in the two to three path on the far turn, came
two wide into upper stretch to rally past HERO ALEXANDRA, shifted three wide past the sixteenth and continued to gain through foes. DRINKS ON ME
tracked the leader two wide through the clubhouse turn, offered a two wide bid into the far turn, engaged outside of GOOD MONGOLIA near the five
sixteenths, vied outside that foe to the furlong mark, and flattened out late between horses. LADY BREXIT chased midpack, continued in the four path on
the far turn and into the lane, was grazed and pushed out by BRUNELLA as she weakened midstretch, and ultimately lacked the needed kick. BRUNELLA
tracked the pacesetter inside of DRINKS ON ME through the first turn and down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the far turn and
into the stretch, weakened between horses from the three sixteenths, and drifted out to graze LADY BREXIT as she weakened. HERO ALEXANDRA
chased inside of SENSE OF SELF through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, began to flatten in the two path on the far turn and was no further
threat in the lane.

Footnotes
IN LOVE (BRZ) raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two and
three path, began an outside bid nearing the three eighths pole, and dueled gamely on the outside down the lane, holding his narrow margin of victory to the
wire. DYN O MITE hopped up slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn,
dueled gamely down the lane, and was outfinished. SNIPER KITTEN raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second turn, and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. MY BARILEY trailed the
field from the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, and made a mild improvement in late stretch,
while proving to be no match. STAR OF KODIAK pressed the pace from two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from
the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and tired entering the stretch.
