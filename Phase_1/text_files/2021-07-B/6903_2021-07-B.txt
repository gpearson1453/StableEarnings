Footnotes
LOVE LIFE settled between foes through early stages, launched a four wide bid at the quarter pole, was ridden along three deep into the lane, turned back
the bid from MALIBU HEAVEN and finished clear. MALIBU HEAVEN tracked the pace through the backstretch, hustled up three wide around the far turn,
vied with the winner in the final furlong but could not get by. JESTFUL rated through early stages, swung five wide into the lane and steadily edged up
closer. SAM IN STYLE rated inside through early stages, waited for a clear path at the quarter pole, steadied at the head of the lane, got through then
finished evenly. HONOR MY WORLD was unhurried, angled out turning for home, steadied in the upper stretch then finished with response. SWIFT KID
raced off the pace, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. COMMANDER KEITH settled through early stages, saved
ground around the far turn and failed to kick on in the lane. GOT FLOFFY set the pace, got collared at the head of the lane and gave way. O CIGANO
stalked inside through early stages then weakened in the lane. CAVATINA raced in range, urged three wide around the far turn and failed to move on.
AGENT MULGANNON saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
PALIO attended the pace along the inside, shifted out inside the three-sixteenths pole, quickened once uncovered, reeled in the leaders and was drawing
away. TOLAGA BAY was unhurried into stride, wheeled to the outside entering the stretch, kicked on willingly to prove second best. UNCLE ANDREW
prompted the pace outside, forged command midway through the second turn, weakened during the drive but had enough left to hold the show. BLACK
PRONG settled in hand, made a sweeping move four wide, loomed large entering the stretch, but failed to sustain the drive. GOSPEL WAY contended three
wide, dropped back between rivals, came five wide but failed to make headway. GET DOWN BROWN set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed
on the second turn and gave way readily.

TUNED (GB) tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, sustained a steady effort into the lane and drew clear.
EMPRESS ELEANOR raced in range through early stages, sat patiently around the far turn, lodged a two wide bid at the head of the lane, roused forward
near the lead then got outkicked by the winner. SECURE CONNECTION stalked the leader through the backstretch, urged two wide around the far turn,
briefly held a slim lead then lacked closing response. INSIDE THE BOX settled in the last flight along the outside, hustled up four wide into the lane and
needed more for impact. WAR CANOE settled inside through the backstretch, angled out a path at the head of the lane and failed to move on. DON'T
BLAME JUDY raced outside not too far off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the lane and had no response. BOOGIE WITH ME set the pace,
got collared at the head of the lane and weakened.
