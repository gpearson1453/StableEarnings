finding best stride too late. L. A. STAR raced mid pack firing along the inside into upper stretch angling out for a final push needing more late in the four
path. SAY IT SWEETLY a step slow lagged to upper stretch giving modest response inside there posing no menace. CABBAGE played no factor. SHARP
