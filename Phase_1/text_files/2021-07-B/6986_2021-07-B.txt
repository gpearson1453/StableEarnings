Footnotes
NEW YEARS GIRL was just a bit fractious in the gate, sat off the dueling leaders just off the inside, went two then three wide on the turn, took aim at the top
of the stretch then took command past the furlong marker and won going away under steady handling. OVERTIDE dueled outside a rival going two wide on
the turn, took charge and was clear while shifting in past the three-sixteenths, overtaken in upper- to mid-stretch and was second best. TEXANA saved
ground on the rail through the turn, was along for show. PRETTY SAYLEE was reluctant to load, dueled inside the runner-up, switched outside that one past
the three-sixteenths, tired in the drive. ZIPPIN BY U failed to rally after racing inside a foe but three to four deep on the turn. SPECIAL PRIDE failed to rally
going four to five wide on the turn. MS. LEA lacked early speed, went in the two path on the turn, gained late along the inside.

Footnotes
CHAMPITO switched off the inside early, entered the turn two wide beginning to pick it up while moving out four deep on that bend, came into upper stretch
six wide, drifted out under left-handed urging in late stretch and brushed a rival lightly. S L R GUS MCCRAE steadied multiple times during an awkward
break and beginning, advanced outside and just off the eventual winner on the turn going four then five wide on that bend, floated eight deep into upper
stretch, was carried out by that one and brushed late but could not get past. ON A WARPATH stalked the leading duo from outside, went three wide on the
turn, made a mild bid turning for home but proved no match for the top pair while just holding show honors. IMPUTED settled well back, went three wide into
the turn fanning out six deep on that bend before entering upper stretch nine deep, ran on but missed show. ADORABLE BRITTANY set the pace from off
the inside going in the two path on the turn and in the clear, gave way in upper stretch. ZENMAGIC failed to rally racing just off the rail on the turn. BULLY
BABY chased inside briefly, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
STORMY WORLD settled outside foes off the leaders, advanced on the turn starting four then moving out seven wide with aim on the lead at the top of the
stretch, took over in mid-stretch and won going away under a drive. CRITICAL DECISION stalked the pacesetter from outside a rival, went two then three
wide on the turn coming four wide into upper stretch, altered inside a drifting foe past the furlong marker and ran on to secure the place. A GREAT VICE set
the pace in the clear racing one path removed from the rail on the turn, lugged out two paths in upper stretch and had no extra for the late stages but safely
held show honors. BETTY C settled off the pace, moved out from three to seven wide on the turn, improved position in the lane. SUPERDUPERJUSTICE
veered in and steadied sharply at the start, saved ground on then just off the fence through the turn, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and ran on. DONNA WHO
raced between foes early and on the turn going four then five wide on that bend, moved out at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. DAWN TERA broke
alertly but lacked early speed racing inside foes mid-pack off the leading trio but well off the rail, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally.
IMGOINOUTTONIGHT chased inside, weakened and steadied slightly in mid-stretch as a rival drifted in. ROBTHEQUEEN failed to threaten racing three
then two wide on the turn. SHESAPACKINPUNCHES raced outside mid-division, went six deep on the turn, steadied near the furlong grounds as a rival
drifted out.

Footnotes
TIZ DONNA BELLA stalked from outside, entered the turn six wide moving in a bit early on that bend, struck the lead past the quarter pole and drew off in
the lane. RECEPTION vied between runners going three then two wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but saved the place from SINGING
NICOLE, who was inside the eventual winner just off the leaders entering the turn five wide, checked near the five-sixteenths, continued in the five path and
ran on evenly to narrowly miss second. CITYONTHENILE pressed from outside early then between runners four then three wide on the turn and failed to
rally. LAUGHAROO vied two wide and between runners, dropped back on the turn, came out turning for home and continued to weaken some. BOBBI
BABY RUN contended for the lead inside then came up empty. AGO GO GAL shifted in early, trailed while just off the rail, went in the two to three path on
