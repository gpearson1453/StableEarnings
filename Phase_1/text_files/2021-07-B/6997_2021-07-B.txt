Footnotes
PRORIKA sat just off of the early pacesetter while three wide on the turn, improved position off of the turn to confront and pass DESERT FOG, was clear
and was geared down in the final sixteenth. THRILL'S LEGACY tracked the leaders while saving ground on the turn, rallied in the stretch but was
outfinished by the winner while a clear second over the rest. MARK WHATS MINE settled off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn and finished
evenly in the stretch run. DESERT FOG broke alertly and set the fractions through the turn while saving ground, was confronted by the winner off of the turn
and weakened in the stretch. GARDEES WORLD chased the leaders for a quarter-mile, was four wide on the turn while losing ground and did not rally in
the stretch run. CLOCHARD STREET was away slowly and had no speed in the early going, trailed through the turn and was not a factor.

WINNING APPEAL sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn while improving position, confronted WATERFALL nearing the head of the
stretch, was kept to task through the lane and held on in the end over the oncoming runner-up. BRASTIKA settled in the midflight in the early going, was
four wide on the turn, made a long rally off of the turn and through the stretch and applied pressure at the end on the winner while besting the rest.
PREDETERMINATION tracked the leaders while saving ground on the turn, gained ground off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. WATERFALL
broke on top and set the pace while two wide on the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the head of the stretch and tired in the drive. BIG CALI
GIRL was off slowly and had no speed in the early going, was four wide on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. RUNNING LUCK chased from the
midflight while five wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. LAUREN SQUARED attended the early pace of WATERFALL, was three wide on the
turn and was empty in the stretch run. JAN'S BEST had no speed in the early going, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
RIDEO sat just off of the early leaders, was three wide on the second turn while mounting a bid to confront KING EDDIE, came to terms leaving the turn and
dueled with that rival through the stretch and just won the head nod at the end to prevail. KING EDDIE set all of the pace through the second turn, was
confronted by the winner on the second turn, gamely dueled through the stretch and was just nipped on the wire while a clear second over the rest. AIGLE
was unhurried in the early going, improved position while four wide on the second turn but finished evenly in the stretch run. UPO settled in the midflight
while saving ground and did not offer a rally in the stretch run. EARNEST prompted the pace by KING EDDIE through the turn, was three wide on that turn
and weakened in the stretch run. KATZUMOTO stalked the pace while saving ground, lost ground on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run.
ARCH ANTHEM was unhurried in the early going, was five wide on the second turn and was not a factor.

SILVER CLAIM was hustled to set the pace, saved ground on the turn and was confidently handled through the stretch to draw away in the end. ICE OR
FIRE tracked the pace while four wide on the turn and was outkicked by the winner but got up in the late stages to get the place. WISE RIVER RAY
contested the pace of SILVER CLAIM while three wide, lost ground and weakened in the stretch run, just missing for second. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET sat
just off of the early pace while saving ground on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. CAJUN BETTOR was away a bit slowly and had no speed early,
was four wide on the turn and made a mild bid on the turn but finished evenly in the stretch run. SMOKIN ENCOUNTER settled toward the rear of the field
while saving ground and did not rally in the stretch. POTENTE ALBA settled in the midflight while four wide and did not offer a bid. STREET MOXIE chased
the early fractions, lost ground on the turn while three wide and was not a factor.

ENOS SLAUGHTER set all of the pace while saving ground on the second turn and drew clear in the end to prevail. K P D DAY settled in the midflight while
saving ground, mounted a bid off of the second turn and into the stretch but was outkicked by the winner while holding on for second. OUR EXPECTATION
sat just off of the early pace while saving ground and was outfinished in the stretch, just missing for second. SPACE ODESSEY tracked the leaders while
traveling in the two path on the second turn, was losing ground when drifted out nearing the sixteenths-pole and bumped ROBBER BARRON and weakened
late. LOAFERS BOY settled near the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn while gaining ground but flattened out in the stretch run. BLOOD
RED MOON was unhurried in the early going, was four wide on the second turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch. ROBBER BARON chased the early
pace, was four wide on the second turn while improving position, was losing ground in the stretch when bumped by SPACE ODESSEY nearing the
sixteenths-marker and tired in the stretch. FREEPORT JOE settled toward the rear of the field while saving ground and ran evenly in the stretch run.
MCGEORGE prompted the pace by the winner and weakened in the stretch. AWESOME DUDE had no speed in the early going, was five wide on the
second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FAIRY TALE BLISS settled in the midflight while saving ground, gained ground off of the turn, split horses inside of the furlong marker, met the challenge of
REIWA inside of the final sixteenth and just held that one off to prevail in the end. REIWA was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the second turn
while mounting a long rally, continued that run in the stretch by angling out and dueled FAIRY TALE BLISS down to the line and was nipped on the wire
while clear of the rest. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU sat just off of the early pace while saving ground, mounted a bid on the second turn, vied for the lead off of the
turn but was outfinished in the stretch. MISS INDEFATIGABLE prompted the pace of DON'T UNZIP ME, was three wide on the second turn, led into the
stretch but weakened in the late going. DON'T UNZIP ME was sent to set all of the pace, saved ground on the second turn but was confronted nearing the
head of the stretch and gave way in the stretch drive. THIS IS THE ONE stalked the pace, was four wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.
CHIEFTAIN'S LADY settled in the middle of the field, was outrun on the second turn while four wide and did not rally in the stretch. SURE ANGEL was
unhurried in the early going, trailed through the second turn while five wide and was not a factor.
