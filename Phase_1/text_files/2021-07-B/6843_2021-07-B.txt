Footnotes
HIGH TIDE stalked from behind the pace setter around the first turn, split foes leaving that bend to vie for the lead outside of MIDNIGHT LEWIS down the
backstretch, assumed command after that foe tired into the far turn with FORT KNOX in pursuit, then safely held sway through the lane from that chasing
rival before shying out mildly at the wire. FORT KNOX stalked from the three path, inched closer to pursue the clear leader into the far turn, but only
managed to chase that foe thereafter, and proved second best. LAKE NAKURU trailed along the inside, slipped inside of foes around the far turn to claim
show in upper stretch, but failed to threaten the leading pair. BOLD MINISTER failed to factor. MIDNIGHT LEWIS set the pace along the inside, vied inside
of HIGH TIDE down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn, wilted between horses around that bend, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SOMETHING NATURAL sat reserved off of the pace, tracked from behind the leaders two wide around the turn, swung six wide to be outside of those rivals
entering the lane, rallied to bid passing the furlong pole, and edged ahead of CANCELLARA through the final sixteenth. CANCELLARA trailed the field early
on, circled the leaders four wide around the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied through upper stretch as SOMETHING NATURAL rallied
alongside, but was outkicked by that foe passing the sixteenth pole. ALLEN stalked three wide early on, bid outside of CITI CHARM into the turn, vied, then
from from between horses at the five sixteenths pole, shifted three wide entering the lane and sustained vying position through midstretch as outer foes
made bids, but was outkicked by a pair of them passing the sixteenth pole. CATIPARI tracked two wide early on, stalked the leading pair from the outside
into the turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole as CANCELLARA drew alongside, sustained vying position between horses through midstretch, but yielded
a sixteenth out. ORIENT MAGIC pressed along the inside, stalked from the pocket into the turn, but awaited racing room turning for home while other foes
to produced bids, then lacked a rally along the rail through the lane. CITI CHARM set the pace two wide, cleared an inner pressing rival into the turn while
ALLEN made an outside bid, got headed by that foe and a pair of outer bidding rivals at the quarter pole, shifted two wide in upper stretch, and gave way
passing the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
ROGER MCQUEEN dueled for the lead two wide, cleared his inner counterpart at the quarter pole while BACK TO NORMAL attempted an outside bid, but
responded to driving pressure at the furlong grounds to repel that foe, and drew off under steady hand urging through the late stages. BACK TO NORMAL
broke flat-footedly, stalked the dueling leaders from along the inside into the turn, inched closer outside of those foes turning for home, but was repulsed
passing the furlong grounds, and proved second best. EXCLAIM lied midpack in the four path around the turn, then hung on his left lead through the lane,
and reached a tiring foe for show on the wire without threatening the leaders. MR. BOUMA dueled for the lead inside of ROGER MCQUEEN around the
turn, but gave way to that foe at the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane. KINGER failed to factor. TOTALIZER trailed by a long distance while not
being urged around the turn, came under mild coaxing entering the lane, and was ridden out through the wire under steady hand urging despite being
outrun.

LUCKY BOSS dueled for the lead inside of CALL ME GUSTO, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch while KISS THE SKY attempted to commenced a
rally, then safely held to the wire from that gaining foe late. KISS THE SKY stalked along the inside, chased the leader while hanging on his left lead through
midstretch, claimed place from an outer tiring foe while switching leads a sixteenth out, then sustained a late gain on the leader through the closing stages,
but ran out of ground. CALL ME GUSTO dueled for the lead outside of LUCKY BOSS, but gave way to that foe in upper stretch, then lost place to an inner
rival at the sixteenth pole. HAPPYIZE saved ground from midpack, then stayed on along the rail through the lane to claim a minor placing. LUNI SIMA
tracked from the four to three path around the first turn, gained outside of the leading duo into the far turn, pressed those foes around the bend, but flattened
out entering the lane, and faded on his left lead thereafter. CREATIVE BID settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn four wide, but failed to factor.
WESTERN RIVER was never involved. LOLAS BEAU was outrun and showed little.

COLONEL BOWMAN prompted the pace three wide, vied outside of NOTARY entering the backstretch, dueled with that foe around the far turn, sustained
the suspenseful battle through the lane, and just prevailed on the wire. NOTARY set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared an inner rival as
COLONIAL BOWMAN produced a bid into the backstretch, dueled inside of that foe around the far turn, dug deep and gamely clung to a narrow advantage
through midstretch, but was nailed on the wire. COUSIN LARRY trailed early on, rallied four wide around the far turn to be in range of the dueling leaders
turning for home, but leveled off entering the lane, failed to keep pace with those foes in upper stretch, and safely held show thereafter. CRYO tracked four
to three wide, cut the corner entering the lane while chasing behind the embattled leaders, then failed to produce a bid. PERFECT CUT tracked two wide,
but failed to factor. NOTABLE EXCEPTION vied along the inside around the first turn, took back to stalk from the pocket entering the backstretch, but faded

Footnotes
KING'S MISCHIEF tracked along the inside, shifted two wide into the far turn, tipped four wide turning for home to commence a rally, then sustained a
charge through the final furlong to drive past the leading pair at the sixteenth pole. INJUNCTION stalked the leading duelers down the backstretch, shifted
three wide and chased the clearing leader while under hand urging around the far turn, sustained his bid under a long drive through the lane to wear down
that foe a sixteenth out, but was outkicked by an outer rallying rival. TONAL IMPACT broke slowly, shifted from the seven path to the four path while very far
off of the pace around the first turn, advanced in the four path around the far turn, then sustained a rally outside of foes through the lane to reach show on
the wire. ENGRAVE dueled for the lead inside of a rival, drew clear from that foe into the far turn, opened up a large advantage turning for home, but tired in
the final furlong, succumbed to a pair of rallying rivals a sixteenth out, then further weakened and lost show on the wire. PALABRAN was off slowly, saved
ground at the rear of the field around the turns, shifted three wide entering the lane to split foes while commencing a rally, and willingly chased the leaders
home. MOUNT KENYA tracked from midpack two wide, but failed to factor. NO SLO MO never got involved. CENTRIFUGE vied four to two wide around the
first turn, dueled outside of ENGRAVE down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. SPRINKLEHEAD saved ground off of the pace, but faded
through the lane. MY PAL JOHNNY lied forwardly placed three to two wide around the first turn, but was through passing the five furlong pole, wilted, and
was eased through the lane.

BANGO vied two wide, forged an advantage with five sixteenths to go, drew away from his inner counterpart approaching the furlong pole, and widened
under a brisk drive. SIR ALFRED JAMES showed the way inside of BANGO into the turn, but was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, proved no
match in upper stretch, then tired, but lasted for place. GUEST SUITE trailed the field around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on for
a minor share. LAMARTINE (BRZ) stalked the leading pair from along the inside, tipped outside of those foes a the five sixteenths pole, but only managed
to chase entering the lane before fading in upper stretch. DARK OAK pressed the pace three wide early on, but steadily faded around the turn.

the lane, under a long drive down the lane and edged clear in the final stages. CHARGER set the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, under a long
drive in the stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. SURVEILLANCE broke out and was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early on from the
inside, was in the three path into the lane, lugged in down the lane and weakened late in the drive. REBOPPER vied for the lead early on while two wide,
raced three wide along the turn, was in the three path into the lane and faded down the lane while on the rail. FREER was bumped and put in tight at the
start, through after a half. CALL OF HONOR broke slowly and was done early.
