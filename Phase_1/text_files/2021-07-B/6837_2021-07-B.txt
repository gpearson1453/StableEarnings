Footnotes
CANADIAN SECRET settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the turn, launched his rally along the fence in the stretch, bid in the final 16th, responded
to left hand encouragement and surged to the lead. FRAT PARTY raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into
the stretch, bid a furlong out, edged ahead but failed to contain the winner in the late stages. ACT OF BOB showed a brief turn of speed then forced the
pace, came two-wide through the turn, dueled into the stretch and took command, was headed in the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. DARK ALE
raced from off the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide through the turn, was up close at the top of the stretch but evened out and failed to menace.
STERLING ICE had early speed then forced the pace three-wide, fell back on the turn then mustered a mild rally and did not threaten. JERSEY DIAMOND
dashed up to a short lead on the backstretch, was pressured into the turn, dueled into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
KNOTTY BY DESIGN pressed the pace, stalked on the backstretch and was patient on the rail through the turn, chased into the stretch, moved off the wood
in the final furlong, and got up in the late stages. ONE WAY TO WIN set a pressured pace, moved clear through the far turn, was under a drive in the stretch
but failed to contain the winner in the late stages. PARTY OF NO pressed the early pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the
stretch but evened out as he approached the wire. NO TOLERANCE bumped with POOL SIDE leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled on the
final turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. BIG BOY BENNY was rated in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the far turn, charged into the
stretch and finished all out. CALMING INFLUENCE broke slowly, raced in mid pack, was under a ride but dropped back while three and four-wide on the far
turn then lacked a closing response. POOL SIDE bumped with NO TOLERANCE leaving the gate, settled off the pace, chased hard on the far turn then
flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHARP'S RIVER had brief speed and was headed, bid early turn, dueled, was headed in the stretch but continued to force the issue and wore down his
rival in deep stretch. CHAIRMAN FOX had speed and held a narrow lead late backstretch, was joined in a duel, edged ahead in the stretch but failed to
stave off the winner in the late stages. GENDRAGON raced in mid pack, closed four to six-wide on the turn, shifted in to the rail in the stretch and continued
to close on the leaders. CARDIFF HALL steadied at the start and gained a position in striking range, was steadied again at the turn, closed along the rail
then finished under a determined drive. RIGHT TO STRIKE briefly pressed the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out late. POUROSO raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. GRAND GIZMO whose
rider did not carry a whip, stumbled leaving the gate, stalked the pace, steadied at the turn, angled from the rail to five-wide on the way to the stretch then
lacked a rally. PATERNOSTER was away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. HYPER WILLY
steadied at the start, stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn although dropping back to mid pack, chased into the stretch but had no
rally. MIRACULOUS BREW settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then lacked a rally. BAYTOWN FINLEY raced off the pace,
was hustled four-wide through the turn then lacked a closing response.

WAKE UP MAGGIE trailed quickly out of the gate, advanced two wide into the turn and angled out to be five wide at the quarter pole and gaining, floated
out into the six path turning for home with momentum and drove by the leader with a rival to her inside at the sixteenth pole, widening in the final seventy
yards. THE GOOD WITCH was in behind a four pack of leaders early, two to four wide on the turn, split tiring rivals turning for home and closed inside the
winner, getting by the pace survivor at the sixteenth pole but outkicked by the winner, settling for the place. BONNIE LEE was inside a four way battle for the
early lead, managed to shake off the two remaining pace rivals turning for home and had a clear lead in upper stretch but was caught by the top two
finishers at the sixteenth pole, remaining game to be third best. SEA ANNA DREAM sat on the rail behind the mad scramble for the lead, got a dream run
up the fence turning for home when the pacesetters drifted out but could only rally mildly to get a minor award. HELLO ANNIE brushed slightly with an
outside rival at the start, dueled three wide throughout, finally tiring as they turned for home, retreating down the lane. DIVINE MARTHA rushed up between
rivals to make it four in a line for the lead, stayed on until turning for home but tired from her early efforts. MOKSGMOL was four wide in a scramble for the
early lead despite the rider's attempts to restrain her numerous times down the backside, then drifted out badly on the turn and was eased down the lane,
then walked off.

HARLAN ESTATE settled off the pace, saved ground, closed on the backstretch, continued to gain on the far turn, rallied inside and was just up under a
drive. DANCE SOME MO pressed the pacesetter, lapped onto him entering the backstretch, forced the issue to the far turn then took the lead, set a
pressured pace to the stretch and shook clear but was caught on the wire. UPSTART GENTLEMAN was in mid pack early, closed on the backstretch then
was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but finished evenly. ONE FLINT pressed the early pacesetter the stalked on the backstretch, chased two and
three-wide on the far turn and finished gamely in vain. LUMBERJACK settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the final turn but lacked a closing
response. CRUDEN BAY rank and in tight passing the wire for the first time, settled in mid pack, chased rail to three-wide on the far turn then lacked a rally.
DECIMATOR led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, was headed at the far turn, pressed the new leader to the stretch and retreated. A STEWARDS'
HAD AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN PAST THE WIRE FOR THE FIRST TIME CONCERNING CRUDEN BAY AND DANCE SOME MO. IT WAS DEEMED
THAT CRUDEN BAY HAD BEEN RANK EARLY AND WAS IN TIGHT BETWEEN RIVALS. THE RESULTS, THEREFORE, WERE LEFT AS POSTED.

Footnotes
RIPTIDE ROCK broke outward, settled off the pace, closed on the rail and stalked on the turn, moved out a couple of paths in the stretch, rallied gamely and
was up in the late stages. AL HEYBAY pressed the pace, came two-wide through the turn, bid a furlong out, battled, was passed by the winner and held
place. COMEDY TOWN set a pressured pace, was engaged a furlong out, dueled until being passed by a late runner and weakened. FROSTED ICING
hopped out of the gate and settled off the pace, closed to mid pack, chased on the turn then finished evenly. UNLIMITED TALENT raced in mid pack, was
hustled four-wide o the turn then finished evenly. COMMANDER TOM settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing
response.

Footnotes
INSIDER TRADING raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied gamely and got up late under a drive.
KNOPFLER settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, rallied and gained command in the late stages but was caught approaching
the wire. SELF INFLICTED broke slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide through the turn, launched a determined stretch drive but
missed. CONQUER HIM was taken off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn, rallied widest but was late. SOCIETY JOE stalked the pace, angled
from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, bid a furlong out, led briefly and was passed. DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES race din mid pack,
came two-wide through the turn and was all out to the wire. KNIGHT KINGDOM raced in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns then was boxed in through the
stretch and there was only room for a mild late run. STOP THE HUMBUG in mid pack early and at the rear on the far turn, chased into the stretch but was
also boxed in with no where to run. DR CHAPPELL was steadied at the start, had speed and set a pressured pace, dueled on the far turn, was passed a
furlong out and faded. PUGIN forced the pace, dueled two-wide through the far turn, was passed with a furlong to go and gave way. WHITE WEDDING was
rank and pulled hard to a stalking position and was under strong restraint especially on the backstretch, settled somewhat and forced the pace on the turn,
lodged a bid at the top of the stretch, dueled briefly and was passed then retreated with SOCIETY JOE and PUGIN.
