Footnotes
QUID rated inside through early stages, angled out turning for home, was set down five wide for the drive and drew clear. JAY VEE BEE raced off the
second flight, lodged a four wide bid heading into the lane, roused forward to the lead then got outkicked by the winner. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE stalked
through the backstretch, hustled up three wide into the lane and sustained a steady bid for a share. THE BEST DISTANCE tracked the early pace, saved
ground around the far turn then flattened out in the lane. DREAMING OF CARATS vied inside for the early lead, battled on around the far turn, shook free at
the head of the lane then gave way in the final sixteenth. READY REWARD dueled outside of DREAMING OF CARATS for the lead, could not match strides
at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. SOAKING WET raced two to three wide and lacked a needed rally. JUST CHITU rated two wide near
midpack then had no response when called upon. ZALFIERRO was off slow at the start and failed to move into contention.

clear under a driving finish. BORGOBYTHESEA sped to the lead at the start, set the uncontested pace through the backstretch, held firm around the far
turn, continued on top near the inside into the lane, fought back under pressure but could not hold off the bid from the winner. PRINCE AMADEUS tracked
the pace along the rail, saved ground around the far turn, launched an inside bid at the head of the lane and sustained steady inside response for a share.
THE WILD FLYER settled through early stages, hustled up four wide around the far turn, took closer order then evened out in the lane. BASSETT rated
along the rail through the backstretch, angled out and ridden along three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. TRANSFER THE
