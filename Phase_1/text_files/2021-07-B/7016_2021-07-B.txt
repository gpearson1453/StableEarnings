HIMELSTEIN away well, set the pace in hand along the rail, responded when roused and widened as clearly the best. BOWING SNOWMAN broke
sluggishly, tracked along the two path, chased in the lane and then was clearly no match. HIS BOY ELROY broke sluggishly, well placed along the rail and
then failed to respond inside. SMOKIN' ALONE ducked out at the start, four wide on the turn and finished wide. OLIVER WITHA TWIST trailed along the two
path and failed to threaten. LORCAN stalked along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it and tired.
