HARBOR KITTY sat just off of the early pace while saving ground on the turn, tipped out leaving the turn and made a late push to get by EL BEAUTIFUL to
prevail. EL BEAUTIFUL set the pace while saving ground in the two path, had a comfortable lead leaving the turn but was confronted and passed by
HARBOR KITTY inside of the sixteenth marker while an easy second over the rest. MAGIC IS FLYING stalked the pace while four wide the turn and was
outfinished in the stretch drive. PROJECT LOGIC broke sharply and prompted the pace of EL BEAUTIFUL while in the three path on the turn and weakened
in the stretch run. BIG DISCOUNT had no speed in the early going, was four wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch drive. PERSEVERANCE was
off a step slowly, saved ground on the turn while chasing the field and was not a factor. YEARNINGTOBEFREE settled in the midflight while three wide and
was not a threat.

Footnotes
TORREY'S GIRL sat just off of the fractions of TURF KITTY while three wide on the turn, steadily narrowed the margin in the stretch and made a late surge
inside of the last sixteenth to get by that rival for the win. TURF KITTY broke on top and set a quick pace while saving ground on the turn, was tiring in the
final sixteenth and gave way to the winner but held for second. BACK ON THE STREET settled in the midflight while four wide on the turn and finished
evenly in the stretch run. LADY PACIFIC chased the field from the rear in the early going, was five wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but was
outfinished in the stretch run. VALRAVN stalked the pace while three wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. INDIAN JAZZ tracked the pace for a
quarter-mile, saved ground while losing position on the turn and gave way in the stretch. CLEAR WIN was away a step slowly, chased while three wide on
the turn and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SEQUENTIALLY sat just off of the early pace of HONEYMOONZ OVER, saved ground while two wide on the turn, gained ground on the leader in the
stretch and just held on at the finish over oncoming rivals to prevail. ITALIANO tracked the leaders while three wide on the turn, made a bid in the stretch
and was pressuring the winner late and just missed the win while holding for second. TORPEDO AWAY settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on
the turn, made a long rally leaving the turn and just missed for the win while holding for the show. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke alertly and set the pace
through the turn while saving ground, led into the last sixteenth but was tiring in the end and weakened in the final stages. SUNSET DRAGUNN chased the
early pace while saving ground, lost ground on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. EMERALD MAGIC settled in the middle of the pack, was four
wide on the turn and did not offer a bid. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was away last of the field, had no speed in the early going, saved ground on the turn and
was not a factor.

was outkicked by the winner. MUNN SHE'S PRETTY pressured the early pace while three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch drive. QUEEN
