willingly and won under right handed urging. KOLE MAN CAN allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch outside in the six path and finished second best.
THIS MAN CAN pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. INTO THE OUT was hustled
along to pressure the leader inside, angled out two wide before the turn, inched closer then came up empty in the drive. CAPTAIN RILEY failed to menace.

five path into the stretch, angled into the three path late and was steadily gaining ground. LUCKY QUARTERS made the lead shortly after the start, set the
pace along the inside until mid stretch then was outfinished. SHELLEY'S GEM never far back, swung wide and had a mild late rally. HOBOKEN HUSTLE
was rank while loading then went evenly. FRIDAY well placed, failed to respond. READY TO CHARM was no threat. TICKETY BOO was fractious in the
gate prior to the start and trailed.

win as much the best. BERTRADA chased the winner and was no match while clearly second best. LITTLE BIRD FLASH stalked the pace along the inside
and went evenly. DR KAAK offered a mild bid in the four path into the stretch then leveled off. TIPARILLO was never close. BLAZING ZENNA was no factor.

MUCHO PROSPECT unhurried early, closed with a burst of speed four wide near mid stretch and was along in time. GOLD SHARK stalked the pace three
wide, dug in determinedly late and finished second best. HIGHLAND PARK HERO dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch and was outfinished.
NANO contested the lead along the inside until deep stretch then weakened. RULING EMPIRE had good early speed then faded. KEYED ON TOP vied for
the lead along the rail, checked entering the turn and dropped out of it. GUCCISSIMO pulled up shortly after the start and was walked off.
