Footnotes
NEURO just off the inside near the rear down the backstretch, tipped three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide
into upper stretch, offered up a good finish closing in tandem with WAR SMOKE and was up in the last jumps to prevail. WAR SMOKE bumped between
foes at the start who each broke his way, chased three wide from near the rear under urging from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch,
closed well outside the aforementioned foe through the stretch missing at the end. GIRAMONTE dueled from the four path briefly before tucking three then
two wide knocking heads with SHERIFF BIANCO to his inside, took over narrow command near the five-sixteenths under coaxing, spun three wide for home
and was headed for command, dug in under a drive continuing the duel taking back the front inside the eighth pole under growing threat from a trio, fought
on to the finish and was caught by a pair in the final strides. SHERIFF BIANCO dueled briefly from the three path before knocking heads from the two path
and then the inside from the half mile pole, came under urging at the five-sixteenths headed for the front, spun just off the inside for home taking back
command, dug in dueling once more and was collared inside the eighth pole, battled on to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages. MARTINEZ two
to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and stayed on one paced to the wire. THE GREAT GAZOO broke a half a beat slow, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch until
tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. I'M BLAMING YOU coaxed
along in pursuit just off the inside just off the pace, angled four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
MAJESTIC TIGER broke in at the start bumping WAR SMOKE, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and offered no response. OLIVER'S FORTUNE just off the pace four then three wide, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide
for home and weakened in the late going. FREUDIAN FATE coaxed along chasing inside, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. GONNA

Footnotes
BABY YODA was hustled from the start, moved up to take the lead then went clear, vied in the two path while challenged to his outside early on the turn
then dropped closer to the rail, responded well when set down into upper stretch then shook off the runner-up, came under a right-handed crop outside the
furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best he did while placed under a confident hand ride in the final
seventy yards. JAKE ROCKS tossed his head just as the gate opened but came out in front, switched outside the pacesetter then tracked outside on the
backstretch, issued a challenge in the three then two path on the turn, was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch under the
crop, pursued the winner in the drive and was outfinished while well clear for the place. REPO ROCKS broke a bit slow and spotted the front a couple of
lengths, moved up under urging then settled in mid-pack, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and weakened while
clear for the show. CHRISTOPHER settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch, moved out around the
sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. TRASH TALKER settled comfortably on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. THE GREAT DANSKY was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, chased inside on
the turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated. CAUSE OF ACTION settled at the rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path and
was no factor.

THIRD DRAFT settled three then two wide near the rear of the field latched on alongside MISSPELL, remained patiently handled through the far turn until
set down angled four to five wide into upper stretch, closed well on the outside through the stretch surging late and just got up in the shadow of the wire to
score. MISSPELL bumped at the start by LOVE AND MONEY breaking inwards, settled unhurried early on dropping to near the rear of the field and rode
the rail through the first turn until tipped to the two path down the backstretch, remained on hold until put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge a furlong out to take command inside the sixteenth marker leading late and nearest the
finish until nailed in the very last jump. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) saved ground through the first turn, then chased just off the inside settled in mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LOVE AND MONEY broke in at the start bumping
MISSPELL, spurted away in hand a bit keen along the inside through the first turn under some restraint in an attempt to throttle his charge down, settled
better midway down the backstretch and had the field take closer order, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper
stretch, got roused just outside the eighth pole under challenge to the outside, dug in clinging stubbornly to the front until collared inside the sixteenth pole,
ran on to preserve the last major share. AMALFI PRINCESS forwardly placed along the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside
route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BATTLE BLING three wide into the first turn, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader
coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive threatening latched on through to inside the
eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. MISS DELICIOUS four wide into the first turn, raced three wide in range of the front coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. SEASCAPE three wide in pursuit, came under encouragement at the

Footnotes
MATTY'S EXPRESS went three wide on the opening bend, was rated on the outside, pulled his way forward to force the pace inside the three-quarter pole,
took the lead with seven-sixteenths to run, dropped from the two path to the rail on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to
a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. CATCH THAT PARTY bumped soundly with a foe at the start, was taken in
hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, tugged hard at the bit under stout restraint inside the three-quarter pole then leveled out when removed
from cover shortly thereafter, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased three then two wide on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive into
the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and just missed while able to get the place. AUSTRIAN brushed with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was roused five then four wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the show.
GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR traveled three wide on the initial turn, settled near the middle of the field, was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole, chased
four then three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick. THE GOLDEN DOOR raced inside to the two path on the
first turn, settled towards the rear, dropped from three to two wide on the far turn while roused, moved out in upper stretch and improved position.
PERPETRATE brushed with a foe at the start, dropped back between horses early, went four wide on the first turn, settled outside near the back, was urged
four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and gained late but failed to impact. COTTON saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the
pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SIMPLY dropped to the rear, saved ground on the first turn,
lagged at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor. GREAT WORKOUT saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
asked three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the crop and failed to rally. THE LAST ACE bumped soundly with an opponent at the
start, went to the front, dropped to the rail on the first turn, showed the way while getting company to the outside on the backstretch, lost the lead passing
the seven-sixteenths pole and faded.

Footnotes
CHATTALOT got brushed and leaned on at the start by MONTAUK POINT who broke outwards, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in tussling with the runner up through to the finish and
gamely shook away at the end to be first at the wire. CARPE ALL DAY shied out at the start filling the space left vacant by MONTAUK POINT breaking
outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes taking
command near the eighth pole, got headed inside that station and fought on to the finish latched on inside the eventual winner getting shaken off a bit in the
late stages. SEAL BEACH coaxed along in pursuit three to four wide down the backstretch, climbed a bit greenly into the turn facing some splashing
kickback and wandered out a path to be five wide through the bend, swung three to four wide for home and offered up a mild kick to close in belatedly for
the show honors. MONTAUK POINT broke out at the start brushing and leaning on CHATTALOT, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then
four to five wide through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. RED DANGER coaxed along in pursuit three then
two wide, angled inside to take the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. DETROIT CITY hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed
along on the pace just off the inside, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught near the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. FROMANOTHAMUTHA bobbled at the break, chased just off the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. UNINVITED GUEST coaxed along five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path through the turn, went three wide at the head of the stretch and trailed.

PORTFOLIO COMPANY established a forward position early then became very rank under restraint nearing the first turn, moved from the inside to the two
path on that bend, followed the leader while leveling out better on the backstretch, moved up to make a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on
the far turn, was asked while taking over into upper stretch, kicked clear under a left-handed crop at the the three-sixteenths and held under strong urging.
JAMES ALOYSIUS brushed with a rival just after the start, went two then three wide on the first turn, was reserved in the back half of the field, came under
urging in the three path on the far turn, was driven four wide past the quarter-pole, lugged in while rallying under a left-handed crop in the stretch, got in off
the heels of the winner late and missed but was clear for the place. BOSTON FLAGSHIP brushed with a foe soon after the start, was taken up while
becoming very rank nearing the first turn, saved ground while rated off the pace, was asked outside the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch under the
crop and lacked the needed kick but earned the show. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace on the inside under a snug
hold, was challenged with a half-mile to run, vied inside of that foe while along the rail on the far turn, lost the advantage into the stretch and weakened.
INFORMAL was bumped at the start then forced in and off a bit slow, settled while saving ground, was urged on the final turn, shifted three wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. ANSEL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced
under vigorous restraint late on the backstretch, continued in hand while losing a bit of position on the far turn, was roused late on that bend then swung four
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. R DOC broke in and bumped a neighboring rival, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
jostled with foes on both sides inside the nine-sixteenths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
came up empty. GREAT BRITAIN tucked into the two path on the first turn then brushed with an opponent, settled near the middle of the field, moved up
midway down the backstretch then jostled with a foe, was asked three then two wide on the far turn and faltered. COMMANDER COMPTON was off slow

away to the finish kept to task. SHEKKY SHEBAZ hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed along from the two path, tucked inside through the turn,

COMPETITIVE SAINT four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and kept
on to secure the show honors. SOUPER DORMY three wide down the backstretch, floated four wide early on forcing DURESS to check off his heels five
furlongs out, tucked three wide inside that juncture and through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and kept on
for the last major share. GHOUL (BRZ) four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and passed tired foes. BATTLE STATION just off the pace chasing along the inside, came under coaxing three

three wide through the turn under urging from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CHIMNEY ROCK chased just off
the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. DURESS got checked off the heels loosely

BEAU LIAM broke alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace along the rail while under pressure to his outside, responded well when asked at the
three-sixteenths, was put to a left-handed crop at the eighth-pole, dueled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. WITSEL was well
placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, tipped out behind the leader in upper stretch then
gained to make a bid passing the eighth-pole, dueled outside of the winner under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and was denied on the wire while
well clear for the place. MAHAAMEL broke in and hit the gate then bumped lightly with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. WUDDA U THINK NOW
bumped lightly with a rival at the start then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was put to the crop into upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. NEWBOMB was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground under
urging on the turn and failed to threaten. TEN FOR TEN was rank under stout restraint on the backstretch, tugged extremely hard at bit, was asked while
three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. ANGKOR was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. MR SIPPI broke
very awkwardly, settled towards the rear, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to respond. SOMEBODY raced well back in the field, went three to four
wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and showed little. STRIKING SPEED broke in and was off a half-step slow, dropped to the rail leaving the
chute then switched out after being crowded, went two to three wide on the turn and never reached contention.

coaxing from the three-eighths, advanced on the front through the latter portion of the turn and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, took over
command nearing the three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive to prevail. HEADLINE REPORT three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to the finish well clear of
the rest for the place honors. DANCE CODE stumbled badly at the start conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the get go, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and improved position showing good courage to secure the show honors.

pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CANDY LANDING broke in at the start and
was corrected, chased just off the pace along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. TRUST OUR JOURNEY hustled from the gate, showed
the way coaxed along the inside through swift splits, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat from a pair, yielded the front straightened away and
folded. SEIZE THE NIGHT stumbled awkwardly at the start conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn and into upper stretch and tired. DUE VINI six paths off the inside near the rear of the field, went
three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MARYLAND BRANDO stumbled
at the start, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before going three wide through the turn, spun four wide for home and tired. LUCAGO leapt up
and lunged from the gate, conceding five lengths to the front, chased briefly seven paths off the inside before crossing to the three path and steadily making
his way to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make
an impact.

Footnotes
ALTHIQA (GB) dropped in nearing the first turn then tucked into the two path, was reserved while given cover, traveled around the far turn under patient
handling, was roused at the quarter-pole then swung four wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead inside the furlong marker,
drifted in under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. SUMMER ROMANCE (IRE) was fractious in the gate
but came away in good order, strolled to the front, showed the way under a snug hold while racing from the two path to the inside, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a tap of a down-turned crop, was put to a left-handed crop while still in front into the final furlong,
lost the lead to the winner shortly thereafter, fought on with her stablemate to the wire but missed while clear for the place. LA SIGNARE (FR) was taken in
hand early then rated on the inside, steadied when POCKET SQUARE dropped in front into the far turn, saved ground in hand on that bend, shifted three
wide while asked at the quarter-pole, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to get the show. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL went three
to four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and
lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. POCKET SQUARE (GB) was taken in hand early then rated in the two path, dropped to the rail and
bothered LA SIGNARE into the far turn, saved ground while roused on that bend and lacked the needed response. MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) saved ground
on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, went three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. VIGILANTES WAY went
three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased into the final
furlong and came up empty. LEMISTA (IRE) was carried in nearing the first turn then reserved in the two path, came under encouragement on the far turn,
dropped to the rear into upper stretch and failed to respond.

down spinning three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to the finish to be along well clear for the place honors.
SOUTHERN FLAG just off the inside down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and improved position in tandem with LEMON DROP ROAD through the stretch and just bested that rival for the show honors. LEMON
DROP ROAD chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch, improved position knocking
heads with the aforementioned foe to the finish but was ultimately just bested on the wire. ABAAN coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide until
