Footnotes
THE WALK broke alertly, prompted the pace outside BERNIE'S ON FIRE, overtook that one approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BERNIE'S ON
FIRE , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, gave way grudgingly and was vanned off. KINGSTON PIKE lacked speed, hugged the inner rail
entering the turn, eased out to the three path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. NO MORE TALK , a forward factor three deep around the turn, drifted
out entering the stretch and weakened. MICE AND MEN , in the two path between horses around the turn, was not a factor and gave way in the drive.
COMPANY CLOWN , along the inner rail around the turn, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
HELL IN A SHELL broke alertly, disputed the pace outside GREEN EYES, gained a short lead near mid stretch, drifted in slightly under right handed rousing
with about a sixteenth to go, corrected and kept on resolutely to fend off MS. HAITI. MS. HAITI tracked the embattled leaders while about two wide, shifted
out leaving the three sixteenths, ranged up to threaten in deep stretch, kept on gamely but was kept at bay. KEEPYOURSKATESON saved ground while
forwardly placed, checked entering the turn, recovered to make a rail run in hand past the five sixteenths, waited into the lane, eased out, worked between
runners past the sixteenth pole, dropped back in and kept on willingly. AMERICAS WOMAN settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, swung out past
mid stretch and finished with good energy. GREEN EYES dueled inside holding a short lead, was headed near mid stretch, battled on as her rider's right
rein dangled briefly, steadied when in tight near the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. YIRA broke a step slow, was sent up soon after then steadied,
lost ground four wide around the turn but lacked a bid. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run as well as an objection by the rider of GREEN
EYES against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch. No action was taken.

PETITION PRAYER stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, eased outside in upper stretch, drifted out in mid stretch, took the lead inside the eighth
pole and was under a vigorous hand ride while drifting out a bit late. MURPH saved ground on the turn, was taken to the three path near the eighth pole
when caught behind rivals and closed inside the winner. SENSON sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened late.
WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER bumped with CANDY FABLE leaving the starting gate, was well off the rail on the turn and failed to be a factor. ALL WORKED UP
prompted the pace two wide and weakened the final furlong. CANDY FABLE bumped with WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER leaving the starting gate, chased the
pace while outside horses down the backstretch and gave way leaving the turn.

Footnotes
MARSAC vied between early then went clear around the turn, dropped in to set the pace, dug in when confronted near the furlong grounds, shook back
clear under strong handling past the sixteenth marker, switched over to his left lead and held firm. CHARM CITY BAND vied inside then rated back off the
winner heading towards the turn, checked off the heels of ALWAYS MISBEHAVING nearing the quarter pole, regrouped to angle out then came back on
while on his left lead to gain the place. ALWAYS MISBEHAVING had speed between foes then steadied back a bit leaving the half mile pole, advanced
between foes leaving the three eighths then came in slightly continuing progress past the quarter pole, ranged up to draw on near even terms in mid stretch,
could not match strides and faded late. DESHACKLED saved ground with pursuit, eased out in upper stretch but lacked a solid response. CRYING FOR
MORE , off the pace, raced inside rivals through the final furlong and offered a mild kick. STRAITOUTA CONGTIN , brushed at the break, was rated back
off the pace, raced between runners past the sixteenth marker but lacked the needed finish. MOONZANO , in close after the break, was taken wide and
rushed up, circled five wide into the lane but failed to make an impact. TYREEK , four wide into the lane, lacked a bid. JUST GO WITH IT forced the pace
three wide and tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS hugged the inner rail throughout, found room inside the eighth pole, led inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. HUFFLEPUFF
brushed with PRACTICALLY DIZZY leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside LIVE AID, held a short lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly.
DEVILISH AFFAIR stalked the duel around the turn, eased outside at the head of the stretch, challenged for the lead near the eighth pole then gave way.
PRACTICALLY DIZZY , steadied when brushing with HUFFLEPUFF leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, swung outside near the sixteenth
pole and showed a late move. LIVE AID saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace, came off the rail in upper stretch and weakened the final
furlong. BUTTER PECAN , always well off the inner rail, was not a factor. MOSLER'S IMAGE stalked the duel around the turn, was four deep entering the
stretch and gave way. FANCY PRINCESS , no factor, was four deep on the turn.

MAMBA ON THREE had speed then drafted back off the leaders to be two wide and between foes, steadied briefly and dropped back a bit near the three
eighths, regrouped and was put to pressure, angled four wide into the lane and leveled off under left handed stick work, closed sharply to take comand in
deep stretch and drew out. GALE WINDS vied in hand and to the inside of UNCLE ROAMIE, moved to a short lead past the five sixteenths, shook clear
under asking in mid stretch, kept on past the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and held the place. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , off the pace and three
wide leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch and rallied. UNCLE ROAMIE broke sharply and gained a short lead outside GALE WINDS,
sparred with that one around the turn and into the lane, kept on willingly to about the sixteenth marker then faded. RAD PAISLEY saved ground, steadied
nearing the turn, steadied again mid turn, angled out and finished with interest. HEIR PORT , four wide outside rivals leaving the half mile pole, dropped in
to about the two path to pursue mid turn then came up empty. KENNY HAD A NOTION , three wide between runners early on, angled to the rail around the
turn, stayed in touch into the stretch then faded. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , sluggish from the gate, lacked speed, raced wide in the drive and failed to menace.

menace and passed tired horses. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. CLEM

Footnotes
B DETERMINED , taken to rate while saving ground, edged up near the half mile marker, awaited room past the three sixteenths, forged through past to
challenge then drew clear under a steady drive. AWESOME JAZZ broke slowly, settled early, advanced inside past the five eighths, moved out a path
leaving the far turn, dropped back in, awaited room from the three sixteenths past mid stretch, got through late and finished well to nab the place. FERMAT
broke slowly, rushed up four wide into the backstretch, rated forwardly past the half mile marker to stalk, ranged up five wide outside rivals into the lane, vied
past mid stretch then hung late. RECYCLE stalked the pace, moved up near the half mile marker, bid between foes in mid stretch and continued with
interest. PRINCE OF CAPS opened up early, set the pace towards the inside, saw his lead dwindle after a half, raced two wide into the lane, held rivals at
bay till mid stretch then faded late. ESPECIALLEA , taken to rate off the pace, raced between foes leaving the far turn, swung out for the drive and came up
empty. MONSTER MASON , three wide, moved up after a half mile, had aim between foes into the lane, challenged for command in mid stretch then faded
late. BUSSTER VON TRAPPE saved ground leaving the backstretch and failed to respond. ERAWAN , three wide leaving the far turn, gave way.
