Footnotes
STOLEN BASE moved in while showing speed then chased the pace, raced in the three path under a strong hand ride on the turn, came under a
left-handed crop turning into the stretch, pursued the runner-up determinedly into the final furlong then gained the advantage, was given one pop of a
right-handed crop after taking the lead and proved best while placed under a hand-ride to the wire. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE showed speed while moving in
then set the pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was set down in upper stretch, remained on his inside lead under a right-handed crop,
led into the final furlong then was overtaken while able to hold the place. BIG SCULLY was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, gained
some under a drive while four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. SAILOR SPEED
dropped back between horses while out-sprinted early, raced at the rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and
improved position without threatening. GOOD SKATE settled towards the rear of the field, was urged three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive, remained on his inside lead to the wire and failed to threaten. NOT YET CHARLIE was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, was
carried out in upper stretch and failed to respond. KING OF STING leaned out at the start but broke with the field, showed brief speed then dropped back
under urging, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then moved out around the three-sixteenths and also failed to
respond. UNBRIDLED BOMBER moved in while ridden along in the back half of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. WHISKEY GENT
was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside, was taken back off the pace leaving the backstretch, chased along the rail on the turn, fell back late
on that bend and retreated then was placed under a protective hold outside the sixteenth-pole.

Footnotes
TIME LIMIT broke in a step at the start bumping KINKY SOX into SARATOGA LOVE, raced three then two wide in pursuit from just off the pace, remained
patiently handled through the turn until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged away under
a drive kept to task. FETCHING coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, got let out spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path at
the three-sixteenths as SARATOGA LOVE backed up in front, ran on to secure the place honors by a head over a rival at the wire. THE IMPORTANT ONE
just off the inside early on, tucked inside and saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch in behind the leader, ran on to just miss for the place honors. KINKY SOX bumped at the start by TIME LIMIT, who broke
in a step at the start and in turn bumped SARATOGA LOVE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for
home and improved position to the finish. VIOLENT POINT hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from
SARATOGA LOVE to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught
just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. AWSUM ROAR lunged at the start getting away last and conceding three lengths to the front,
chased three wide put to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SARATOGA LOVE got bumped at the
start by KINKY SOX due to pressure from TIME LIMIT, raced forwardly placed just off the inside down the backstretch before advancing to apply pressure to
the leader through the turn placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, got roused spinning into upper stretch from the two path and weakened.

BIG EVEREST (GB) was taken back under restraint early then became keen, continued keen under restraint while inside through the first turn then was
reserved while last but one, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch then shifted six wide at the three-sixteenths,
unleashed a furious rally down the center of the course under a hand ride, closed with a rush to take over inside the furlong marker, powered away under a
hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final forty yards while much the best. AMERICAN LAW bumped with a foe at the start, saved
ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked while shifting three wide at the quarter-pole, moved further out
around the three-sixteenths, chased into the final sixteenth and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. REALM OF LAW leaned out at the
start, was eased back from the outside early then tucked into the two path on the first turn, raced in the back half of the field under reserve, was asked in the
three path on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
MUBTADAA was asked to establish early position, rounded the first turn in the two path on the first turn, was rated on the outside, ranged up three wide to
make a bid on the far turn, was asked for his best while on even terms for the lead in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong, dropped back into the final
sixteenth and weakened then just missed the trifecta. NO BURN hit the inside of the gate at the start, went to the front, tugged hard at the bit under restraint
into the first turn, set an uncontested pace under a snug hold, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage
inside the furlong marker and also weakened. CHARLESTON STRONG bumped with an opponent at the start, pulled while keen into first turn, tracked the
pace while racing from the three path to the two path, was given his cue on the final turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. FRENCHBORO went three
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, drifted in some in upper stretch and came up empty. ARISTON was last to
commence, went two to three wide on the turns and failed to respond. FRACTIONS WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TELETIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
I LOVE JAXSON four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through to the finish and was up in the very last jump to score. JUST RIGHT veered out at
the start bumping SICILIA MIKE and squeezing that rival back forcing him to steady in tandem with pressure from MANIFEST DESTINY who broke inwards,
raced along the inside early on before attempting to tip to the two path from in behind the leader into the lane of MANIFEST DESTINY, had that rival hold his
lane as DARK MONEY came inwards and held his lane to that rival's outside, continued floating outwards until able to squeeze back MANIFEST DESTINY
in concert with DARK MONEY near the nine-sixteenths, rode the twio path through the turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, seized command straightened away into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside, got worn down and was nailed on the
wire. SICILIA MIKE got bumped between foes and shut off at the start as JUST RIGHT veered outwards and MANIFEST DESTINY came inwards and was
steadied, conceded four to five lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. DARK MONEY coaxed from the gate, chased three
wide down the backstretch, placing MANIFEST DESTINY in tight between foes against JUST RIGHT, traded leans with those rivals before pinching back
MANIFEST DESTINY in tandem with JUST RIGHT near the nine-sixteenths, continued three wide through the turn, got let out spinning four wide into upper
stretch and weakened. BIG MOUNTAIN coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. DURKIN'S CALL coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. VICAR'S LEGEND coaxed from the start, chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide for home and made no impact. MANIFEST DESTINY broke in at the start bumping and
squeezing back SICILIA MIKE in tandem with JUST RIGHT, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, had JUST RIGHT tip off the inside and DARK
MONEY float in from the outside and was placed in very tight between foes, attempted to hold steady and keep his lane but steadily got leaned and brushed
before being pinched back between those rivals with nine-sixteenths to go, chased along the inside through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
TUSCAN QUEEN dropped off the pace then settled in the middle of the field, fell a bit further off the pace leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on
the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch then closed fast to take the lead under confident handling, disposed of the runner-up under a few pops of a
left-handed crop from the eighth-pole to the sixteenth-pole then powered away while placed under a hand ride to the wire. SAND AND SEA veered out at
the start then was corrected by the rider, settled on the outside, stalked four wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dropped in a path while making
a bid in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. GAILHORSEWIND broke a step slow,
settled off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path around the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch then shifted five wide
at the five-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead until just outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while up for the show. FLEETING
GLIMPSE broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out into the final furlong and failed to threaten but completed the
superfecta. CEASE AND DESIST angled in early while settling off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung
five wide into the stretch then moved out a path further and failed to rally. ARCH OF FIRE settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on
the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. SIX FEET APART set the pace on the outside under a hold, vied in the three path while outside of
a foe on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. DAME TIME was hustled from the start, prompted
the pace on the inside, drew even with the leader at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole then dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

cut the corner into upper stretch in behind CAROM and was taken hold off the heels of that rival before tipping to the two path straightened away, tipped to
the three path at the three-sixteenths, paused in behind a wall of rivals awaiting OPRY to clear outside a furlong out, tipped to the four path once that rival
cleared fully roused and rallied to issue a challenge latching on the top pair a sixteenth from home, before going by in the final strides to victory. JAIS'S
SOLITUDE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a pair and was nailed in the last jumps to the wire. OPRY forwardly placed two to three
wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the leader just inside the eighth pole, dug in under a
drive between foes through the final sixteenth while clear for the show honors. DOT MATRIX lunged at the start in tandem with AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM
to his outside, raced three wide through the first turn in closest aim of the leader, went three to four paths off the inside past the stands for the first turn
before tucking to the two path into the second turn, tracked the leader just off the inside from that juncture advancing to apply pressure nearing the far and
final turn, came under coaxing when seizing command just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. HE'S NO LEMON settled two to three wide at the tail of the field, went three wide into
the far and final turn and was nudged four wide midway as JOURNEYMAN tipped out three wide, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and came up empty. JOURNEYMAN bumped at the start by AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM, who lunged outwards, tracked just off the inside
from mid pack, tipped out three wide just inside the three-eighths nudging HE'S NO LEMON to the four path, came under urging five-sixteenths from home
and tipped five wide into upper stretch, then offered no kick. CAROM established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, came
under pressure for the initial time into the far and final turn and was put to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front just inside five-sixteenths remaining,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DEPUTY FLAG broke alertly then was hustled, showed the way on a clear advantage, drew off in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked at
the quarter-pole, remained on his inside lead under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, remained clear while still on his inside lead and shortening stride
into the final sixteenth then held desperately under strong urging. FOREST SPIRIT broke a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground under
some urging on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, tipped into the two path while rallying at the furlong marker and closed fast to just miss while able to
get the place. DEE BO was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
kept on in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. PAPA SMOOTH bobbled slightly just after the start, lugged in midway
down the backstretch then switched to the outside, was urged three wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. TAINO was coaxed along off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two path under stronger encouragement and failed to threaten. U. S. STEEL stumbled at the start but recovered quickly,
raced just off the early pace, dropped back while crowded along the rail midway down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four
wide outside the quarter-pole and came up empty. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU broke a bit slow then moved out early, was urged three wide on the turn and
was no factor. MAGNIFICENT CHROME was hustled from the start then coaxed along on the outside, went four wide while ridden along on the turn and
failed to respond.

JUDGE N JURY bobbled at the break, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to
issue a challenge midway, took over command with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to the finish leaving
the outcome in no doubt. BIG BOBBY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. DEVIL'S CODE seven paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked three wide at the half mile pole, floated out four wide put to coaxing near the three-eighths as NINTH HOUR got out to his inside,
swung four to five wide for home and improved position to procure the show honors. TROUBLESHOOTER fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased just
off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. NINTH HOUR hustled from the gate,
vied from the two path inside a pair briefly before dueling with QUICKFLASH, tucked inside half a mile from home, got taken under a firm left hand grip into
the turn and dropped off, backing away before getting out to three path inside the seven-sixteenths and floating DEVIL'S CODE four wide, tucked back
inwards and spun just off the inside for home, then tired in the drive. COLORMEPAZZI chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path, came under
coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and tired. QUICKFLASH vied from the three path with a pair flanking him early on,
then dueled with NINTH HOUR to his inside before that rival backed away leaving sole command now in his hands, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths
and came under pressure to the outside, got displaced at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. TRUE PALACE vied briefly
from the four path before chasing in close aim of a duel, tucked to the two path into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide for
home and tired.

Footnotes
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) was taken under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path under tight restraint, was rated just off the pace on
the inside, tipped off the rail inside the five-sixteenths then was given her cue, rallied outside to make a bid in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong
and held under steady urging. FLUFFY SOCKS settled near the back while saving ground, was roused on the far turn, came off the rail at the quarter-pole
then was driven between horses in upper stretch and finished with good energy to just garner the place. TOBYS HEART tucked into the two path on the
opening bend, settled outside on the backstretch, was asked with three furlongs to run, moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the final
turn, dropped to the three path under a drive into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. RUNAWAY RUMOUR
raced in the three path on the first turn, settled near the back on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and
improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. MINAUN (IRE) went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the
final turn then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. AMY C (GB) settled towards the back in the two path,. was roused on the final
turn, came three wide into the stretch then went between horses around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. DEMODOG was keen under
restraint while saving ground on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was asked along the rail on the far turn and failed to rally. JOUSTER
went to the front, set an uncontested pace through solid fractions, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and gave
way. NAVRATILOVA raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked outside while in hand on the backstretch, was asked in the two path early on the far
turn, moved to the three path late on that bend and came up empty.

swung three wide for home and kept on to procure the show honors. CLOSERTOTHEHEART broke out at the start bumping CODE NAME LISE, chased
three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share.
EPICUREAN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide before taking to the inside through the turn facing some pressure most of
the way, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.
ADDIE'S TOUR got pinched back at the start and taken in hand when MISS DOMINA came inwards and took over the lane in front as ARTYISTHEPARTY
kept her lane, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HIGH FAIR
chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ADELE KAT chased along the

near the rear, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, swung three to four wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. THISMIGHTBETHEONE
broke out at the start heading towards the outside fence when corrected conceding three lengths to the front, ranged up down the backstretch six paths off
the inside into contention tucking four wide into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch and
tired. SOUPSTER forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
swung five wide for home and tired. CODE NAME LISE bumped at the start by CLOSERTOTHEHEART, darted to the inside just after the start and rode the
