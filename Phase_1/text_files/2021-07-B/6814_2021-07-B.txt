BLUSHING BETTY pressed early, rallied in the stretch and gained the lead, drew off late while being ridden out to win as much the best. WAR CAT set the
pace for a half, was no match for winner in the lane but was second best. SAINT PATSY had good position early, lacked a bid and went evenly.
CHARLENE'S JOY allowed to settle, failed to menace. DARLING BELLE was no factor. GEORGIE'S KINGDOM was getting out on the turn and was eased
in the stretch and walked off.
