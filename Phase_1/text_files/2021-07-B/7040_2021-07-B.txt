Footnotes
BELLAS EYES allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, drove clear inside the furlong marker and
held under steady pressure. BEND THE KNEE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. GENUWINE allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
missed the place. COUPLE OF NIKKIS tracked the pace, moved to position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then
drifted in the final furlong and weakened. BLAZE OF JOY passed tiring rivals. SATURDAYS VAPOR sprinted to a clear lead while bearing out, then faded
the final furlong. MIDSHIP LADY well placed, was through after a half.

Footnotes
EVERY LITTLE BIT set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. RUNAWAY STAR tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, weakened late and held the place. COMMODORE BARRY allowed to
settle, angled inside a drifting rival to save ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed willingly. MAGICSTICK allowed to settle, drifted out
slightly while moving up through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed for a share. SHAKIN IT UP LARRY well placed and outside, saved
ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and weakened in the drive. LEONARD'S LEGACY stalked the pace on the outside, gained position
three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
DRIFTWOOD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the lane and held under steady pressure.
TEMPUS broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground on the two path through the turns, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for the place in the final strides. LOWCOUNTRY mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, then weakened
late and held the show. BABY BULL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through on the two path into the stretch, then weakened the
final furlong and held a share. LIDO LEGACY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally.
BUGLE BARRY well placed and between, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened in the drive.
KODIAK BROWN was a brief factor.

Footnotes
ON BASE allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear. KICK IT
CHARLIE stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the stretch, gained a short lead mid stretch, then was no match for the winner and
held the place. VERY REPLACEABLE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch and evened out.
BAHAMIAN PARK mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, weakened late and held a share. HATS
OFF TOO YOU steadied on heels in the early going, angled out and looped up five and six wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and
flattened out. SLY WILDCAT improved position. SUPER STRIKE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin to the second turn, then
stayed on when challenged and faded the final furlong. WHISPERING WIND tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and
had no rally.
