Footnotes
LINDALOUIMAGE shared the early lead from outside, drew away from the rest while in hand on the backstretch, was roused leaving the quarter pole, put to
a drive the final furlong and maintained full control. NURSE SADIE crowded briefly at the break, was settled, gradually progressed off the rail, advanced two
wide on the second bend, moved clear for the place upper stretch, was no match for LINDALOUIMAGE the last eighth but proved easily second best. LADY
DI altered in some just after the start to stay clear of CHRISTY ATTACK, moved to the outside on the first bend, advanced to gain the place while widest on
the second turn, drifted out to the middle of the track into the lane and flattened out. CHRISTY ATTACK vied for the lead briefly from inside, did not stay with
LINDALOUIMAGE on the backstretch and began to yield after five furlongs. LORI ATTACK crowded briefly at the start, moved to the inside early on, was
hustled along but steadily gave way.

ABSTRACT PAYNTER broke on top, was settled outside, picked up his pace three wide on the turn, was all out while widest in the stretch and got up in
time. RAHFEE TOWN was sent to the lead, in hand through the bend, floated out some upper stretch, was corrected, under a drive the rest of the way but
did not have enough left in the waning yards. ROLL CALL commenced his bid two wide on the turn, threatened with a furlong left but leveled off instead.
DANCIN NICKY pressed RAHFEE TOWN from just outside, took the rail on the bend and slowly wore down the final furlong.

BOLD AND BRASSY was hustled from the gate then settled inside, gradually progressed on the backstretch to reach contention on the second bend,
waited for room briefly along the rail, got through two wide nearing the quarter pole, led entering the lane, moved clear, lugged in each time he was
pressured from the right side but maintained control. EUGENE settled outside, commenced his bid after a half mile to threaten widest on the second turn,
lacked the extra needed in the stretch but caught TEARS ON A RIVER for second in the waning yards. TEARS ON A RIVER soon sprinted to a
commanding lead, showed the way in hand, was let out on the second bend, could not maintain his advantage, under a drive through the stretch but did not
have enough left. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS rated while closest to TEARS ON A RIVER through the early going, made his bid just off the inside on the
second turn to have an easy striking position but gave way leaving the quarter pole.

TEMPLUNA shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead and showed the way in hand just off the backstretch, was let out some on the second bend,
put to a drive upper stretch, was kept to task to the waning yards and proved much the best. UNIVERSIADE pressed TEMPLUNA while in a narrow path
along the rail on the backstretch, did not keep up into the second turn, came off the rail some, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive and
was easily second best. MIKE'S LADY moved to the outside into the backstretch, helped prompt the pace for five furlongs then began to fade.

ahead on the second turn, was roused with two furlongs to go then steadily opened up under a drive through the lane. GONZO never far back, saved
ground taking the second turn, came off the rail some entering the stretch, moved clear for second then could only hold his position late. INDICIA retreated
from off the rail on the backstretch, stayed just off the inside on the second bend, fanned out some into the lane, altered out widest for a clear path after
entering the last eighth and gained third. MKAR THE FAST bumped with MEGAN'S HONOR at the start, was prominent from the beginning, two wide on the
second turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and gradually lugged in as he weakened the final furlong. MIAS MOONBEAM shared the early lead outside
MEGAN'S HONOR, did not keep up on the second bend, began to drift out leaving that turn and slowly yielded through the lane.

GO FOR SHERRIE shared the lead from inside, roused leaving the second turn, moved clear into the lane then held sway under steady urging. TRY TRY
AGAIN vied for the lead outside GO FOR SHERRIE, put to urging from between rivals on the second bend, all out in the stretch but lacked the extra needed
in the waning yards. SHOBIZ STAR pressed from outside, weakened the last two furlongs but was easily best of the others. WAY TOO SMARTE moved to
contention from outside on the backstretch, angled to the inside on the second bend and gave way for the drive. DAVKA was a factor from inside for five
furlongs, began to yield, came off the rail some on the second turn and continued to fade.

Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE rated off the early speed, commenced his bid nearing the end of three furlongs, was three wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch
then widened command under urging the last furlong. D' YANK moved to the outside early on, was widest taking the turn, could not close the gap on
ALEX'S STRIKE the final furlong but caught GONEGHOST for second inside the last sixteenth. GONEGHOST was sent to dispute the pace outside
GUMWRAPPER, moved ahead on the bend, was overtaken from outside into the stretch and slowly wore down inside the final eighth. TAP'S BIG SHOT
prominent from inside on the backstretch, waited for room just off the rail on the turn, altered out four wide for a clear path upper stretch but flattened out for
the drive. GUMWRAPPER displayed early speed from inside but began to fade with two furlongs to go.
