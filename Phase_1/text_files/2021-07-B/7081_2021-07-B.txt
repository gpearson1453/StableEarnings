Footnotes
BULU in hand early, gradually progressed from inside to take over after a half mile, drew away on her own through the second bend then continued to
lengthen command with only slight hand encouragement a couple times in the lane. VERRAZANO WOMAN crowded briefly at the start, was settled at the
back the first half mile, picked up her pace along the rail on the second bend, gained second midstretch and was drawing off for the place the final furlong.
INSTA GLAM raced in contention from outside, in path three through the second turn, had second briefly upper stretch then began to gradually wear down.
DARE TO HOPE broke outward, was snatched and made a small leap into the air, quickly recovered to set the pace off the inside, was overtaken from
inside after a half mile and gave way the last quarter mile.

FULL MAGAZINE was allowed to get a clear lead and take the inside into the first turn, rated on the backstretch, let out into the second bend, urged with
two furlongs left, drew away then continued his commanding lead while ridden out the final furlong. FINAL CALL a step slow at the break, was settled inside
the first half mile, commenced his bid after that, swung out widest for the stretch run and took over second inside the last eighth. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE
outrun to the first bend, pressed FULL MAGAZINE from just outside, did not stay with that one on the second turn and began to wear down the last two
furlongs. IMPERIAL TEMPLE was not a factor in a ground-saving trip.

JOHNNY LONGBOAT a step slow from the gate, was unhurried early, picked up his pace along the rail after a half mile, swung to the outside with a quarter
mile to go, rallied under a steady drive and edged ahead of LEE LA DEW nearing the wire. LEE LA DEW pressed from outside, went for the lead three wide
on the second bend, moved clear upper stretch, was all out, did not have enough in the waning yards but was easily second best. CLEVER BOY shared the
early lead outside MESSED UP, was roused and edged ahead from between horses on the second turn, took the rail into the lane and began to yield.
MESSED UP disputed the pace from inside for nearly six furlongs then gave way. BOLD AND BRASSY also a step slow at the start, failed to menace.

ABOVE NIKE broke through the gate before the start, was reloaded then broke on top once the race began, prompted the early leader from just outside, bid
for the lead between rivals on the turn, fought to midstretch, could not stay with BABA'S BOY after that but proved easily second best. THACKER FROMM
was moved to the inside early on, came into contention on the bend, swung out widest for the stretch run and pulled away for third the final eighth. GALLI
ATTACK chased from off the rail, angled to the inside midstretch and had no late bid. MENA'S FIREBALL displayed early speed from inside but began to
fade before finishing a half mile. FADE FROM BLACK showed little.

Footnotes
OIL MONEY quickly took the lead, moved clear on the turn then gradually widened command under a mild drive in the stretch. W W COOKIE MONSTER
pressed OIL MONEY from just outside on the backstretch, did not keep up through the bend and could only just hold second late. ARCHIEMYBOY raced in
contention from outside on the backstretch, did not stay in contention on the bend, moved inside W W COOKIE MONSTER inside the last furlong and failed
to have a significant response. DIAMOND MAXIMUS was not a factor in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
KILLEEN was kept close, closed the gap just outside DR. LIECHTY on the bend, rallied deep stretch and took over with seventy yards to go. DR. LIECHTY
lugged in some after the break, bumped hard with FORAFEWDOLLARSMORE, quickly recovered to gain the advantage, soon moved clear, took the inside,
was challenged on the turn, moved clear again into the lane but began to wear down deep stretch. COLOMBARD angled out between rivals early on,
became a factor four wide on the bend and found best stride too late inside the last eighth. YABA DABA DOO angled out for room midway on the
backstretch, threatened three wide on the turn but could not sustain his bid through the stretch. FORAFEWDOLLARSMORE broke a bit inward, was
corrected then bumped hard with DR. LIECHTY, saved ground and was not a factor. TRUE TEN gradually retreated from outside, was in path two taking the
turn and had no significant stretch response. JACK N JOHN showed little.
