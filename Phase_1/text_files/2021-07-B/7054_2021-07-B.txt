Footnotes
PRINCE OF RAIN chased inside, awaited room on the turn, slipped through at the head of the stretch and quickly drew away while kept to his task.
MANOLITO hustled to a pressured lead inside, drifted out in the stretch and was no match for the winner. KNOW IT NOW prompted the pace three wide
and proved empty in the stretch. FIVE MORE MINUTES dueled between rivals to the stretch and faltered. CLASSY AMERICAN broke alertly and chased
wide down the backstretch before fading. TIZ MANDATE broke very slowly and trailed throughout.
