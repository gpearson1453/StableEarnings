Footnotes
GET DIRECTIONS tracked along the inside, swung outside of the leading pair entering the lane, rallied to range up alongside of TEXAS MAMA in
midstretch, grabbed an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and edged away under a hand ride late. TEXAS MAMA pressed two wide, vied around the turn
before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, cleared her inner counterpart in upper stretch before meeting GET DIRECTIONS' bid inside the final
furlong, but was bested passing the sixteenth pole. ITSALLINTHENOTES raced far off of the pace three wide and between horses around the turn, rallied
between horses through upper stretch to claim show at the sixteenth pole, and safely held from G KATE late. G KATE tracked from midpack four to five
wide around the turn, and stayed on through the lane. BELMAR BEAUTY broke outwardly, got caught four wide while off of the pace around the turn, then
moved up late without factoring. BLUEBIRD SING broke slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, and stayed on mildly while hanging on her left lead.
MANDOLINE STAR was never involved. SHESTHECATSMEOW set the pace along the inside of a pressing TEXAS MAMA into the turn, but got headed at
the quarter pole, and faded in upper stretch. BROOKLYN BABY chased three wide, but faded turning for home. OUR LUCKY BREAK was outrun.

COOL FIRE vied along the inside of LIT A SHUCK around the turn, forged an advantage from that one entering the lane, and held firm from a chasing
SWEET RACHEL late. SWEET RACHEL hopped and broke outwardly at the start, recovered to track the leading pair three wide around the turn, chased
those rivals through midstretch while hanging oh her left lead, then progressed in the late stages to reach place, but did not have enough to catch the
leader. LIT A SHUCK set the pace outside of a vying COOL FIRE into the turn, but was headed by that foe entering the lane, chased well through
midstretch as SWEET RACHEL rallied alongside, but failed to regain even terms and was outfinished for place. CAPTAIN NOBLE stalked along the inside,
but failed to keep pace with the leading trio at the quarter pole. SWEET LEVI chased two wide and from between horses into the turn, but faded
approaching the five sixteenths pole. TENPINS TERRITORY was outrun.

LIL EVA JANE established a clear lead early on, managed a loose advantage down the backstretch, widened the margin turning for home, and was ridden
out to the wire. GAL stalked along the inside while keen around the first turn, shifted off of the rail before tracking between horses down the backstretch,
claimed place from them turning for home, then safely held that position while not threatening the leader on her left lead. MY GIRL EM saved ground off of
the pace, but faded. MEG AND CLAIR tracked two to three wide, chased under a drive around the far turn, and weakened.

POPULIST pressed the pace setter from the outside, bid entering the lane, took over in upper stretch, and held safely from a rallying DREAM HALO late.
DREAM HALO tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, then rallied through the lane to cut the gap on the leader late, and proved second best.
DAYS OF GLORY tracked along the inside, but only managed to chase through the lane, and caught the tiring early pace setter on the wire to dead heat for
show. DUSTY HILL set the pace inside of a pressing POPULIST around the turn, but was headed by that foe entering the lane, then weakened through the
final furlong before being nailed on the wire by an outer foe to dead heat foe show. BOGEY chased three wide, but weakened between horses at the furlong
grounds. FRONT PAGE was outrun.

CRESCENTCITYPRETTY pressed the pace three wide, vied passing the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage outside of OUR LOST LOVE while
under a long drive at the furlong pole, dueled through the late stages, and prevailed. OUR LOST LOVE vied two wide and between horses around the turn,
forged an advantage at the quarter pole inside of a vying CRESCENTCITYPRETTY, dug in after being headed by that foe at the furlong grounds, battled on
gamely to the wire while hanging on her left lead, but was bested. FAME FEATHER trailed two wide around the turn, shifted five wide in midstretch, rallied
through the final furlong outside of the leading duelers, but ran out of ground. MISS JAMIE tracked from midpack four wide, chased the leading pair of
duelers well while still in striking range through midstretch, but flattened out at the sixteenth pole. NUN OF OURS chased along the inside, shifted two wide
in upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid. MY SISTER ANNETTE lied off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. MAYBE I CAN set the pace
inside of a pair of foes into the turn, got headed by them approaching the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch.

GINA'S BISCUIT pressed along the inside early on, stalked the clear leader around the turn, shifted outside of that foe at the quarter pole, bid in upper
stretch, led at the furlong grounds, and held from BIG TINY's rally to the wire. BIG TINY trailed around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, rallied
outside of foes through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leader late. GOODNIGHT GRACIE was off a step slowly, settled off of the pace, took
the turn in the four path, rallied to pursue the eventual winner through the final furlong, but was outkicked for place. IRISH PRIORITY chased three wide, but
failed to produce a bid. SHE'S SEVENTEEN cleared into the turn, held an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, and gave
way. C C'S BABY GIRL failed to factor. GLITTER TIME was never involved.
