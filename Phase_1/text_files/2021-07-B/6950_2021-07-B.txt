the rail into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. CAN'TBETEMALL broke a bit slow at the start, pressed the pace early two wide, was off

RUNAWAY MOM was bothered a bit after leaving the gate and trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane, drove past the leaders near the
eighth pole and drew away in the final stages. HAT TIP chased the pace early, raced between horses into the lane, made a bid down the lane but was no
match for the winner in the final stages. DISCREET KITTY tracked the pace early on, took over and led briefly near the quarter pole, was in the three path
into the lane and faltered in the stretch run. BOURBINA was bothered after the start, stalked the pace early three wide, was in the four path into the lane and
faded late in the stretch. ROSE'S CAUSE was in the six path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. THUNDER BUGGY had early speed then
folded up.

Footnotes
GOLD HERITAGE was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the leaders three
wide and cleared the field in the final stages. ATRAS stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but hung in the late
stages and held place at the wire. IGNITIS set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and yielded late in the stretch run. MONDO GOLD chased the
pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch with a minor gain in the final stages. DRIFTER pressed the pace early while two
wide, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. RED KNOBS raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane, rallied down the
lane with a belated gain. CREATIVE MIRACLE was bumped hard after the start, raced in the four path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive.
NOT THAT SERIOUS chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded late in the stretch. NEWT was never a threat. ROOSTER RUN was
done early. SCATTERSHACK was never a factor. JACKPOT WINNER was through early.
