Footnotes
KATIESDREAMGIRL settled off the pace outside, cruised up three wide around the turn, took over turning for home and drew off under moderate urging.
FLASHY TOO saved ground in range, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane but stayed on to be clearly
second best. CRYSTAL LAGOON pulled her way to the front near the five-eighths pole, set the pace along the rail from there to upper stretch and tired.
BEASTIE GIRL was in range inside down the backstretch, checked entering the turn, angled four wide soon after and lacked a rally. DREAMING OF
AUDREY had speed two wide and faltered nearing the lane. PROMISE ME led early, chased two and three wide and was through after a half.

horses at the start, lacked speed saving ground early, gradually moved out on the turn, and improved mildly outside for a share. MADAME CLAUDE was a
step slow at the start, chased inside to the stretch and faded. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE bumped with ACACIAHELPME at the start, pressed CAJUN COUSIN
from outside for a half, and tired in the stretch staying on her left lead. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY was outrun three wide. RENEESDREAMGIRL bumped with

Footnotes
GILLIGAN vied for command three wide, took over after a half-mile outside HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY, and edged away from that rival through the final
furlong. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY hit the left side of the gate and was off slowly, split FURCIFEROUS and GILLIGAN just outside the half-mile marker,
vied inside the latter around the turn and into the stretch, and stayed on stubbornly. THE TWINS SNEAKERS broke slowly and was outrun to the turn,
shifted out five wide near the top of the stretch, and found his best stride late to go well clear of the others. EL FANTASMA raced three to four wide around
the turn within range, but faded into the stretch. FROSTY WARRIOR was a step slow to begin, and never reached contention. FURCIFEROUS dueled early
inside, got outpaced after three-eighths of a mile, and had the rider drop the crop while retreating just past the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
FLIPPING FISH steadied along the rail in tight past the half-mile pole, came through to challenge inside QUICK STEP ED and JR SPEED on the turn,
dueled with the latter for the last five-sixteenths of a mile and proved narrowly best. JR SPEED vied inside QUICK STEP ED up the backstretch, got the best
of the latter while being joined from the inside by FLIPPING FISH going to the five-sixteenths, responded and fought back through a long drive, and just
missed. LONG BEACH KID bumped with KING CAIRO after the start, alternated between the rail and two-path close up in a tightly-knit group to the stretch,
moved out with aim at the leaders, changed leads awkwardly leaving the furlong grounds and did not have enough. BRACCIO DI FERRO raced four wide
around the turn, and made no headway through the lane. KING CAIRO was jostled around between horses just after the start, steadied in tight between
horses through the early part of the turn, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch and could not gain. QUICK STEP ED vied early outside JR SPEED,
then three wide outside the latter and FLIPPING FISH through the first half of the turn, and began to fade after a half-mile.

FIERY PRINCESS set the pace in the two path, drew off nearing the lane and widened under a drive. MS BIG SPRING pressed the winner in the three
path, was no match for that foe but held clear of the rest. KATNISS KAN raced off the pace four wide and finished evenly to gain the show.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. MIZ CHAPLIN failed to menace while racing four wide. VARSOVIA was bumped at
the start, raced two wide and never threatened. NICOLE PRINCESS bumped with VARSOVIA at the start, saved ground and played no further factor.

Footnotes
HARD TEN was unhurried early, began to pick it up around the turn four then five wide, rallied steadily through the stretch, reached the front from outside a
sixteenth out and drew clear under a mild drive. MR. EINSTEIN settled in the second flight early, advanced around the turn to loom a threat two to three
wide, could not match strides with the winner late but went clear of the remainder. LUVNMESUMCAJUN pressed CHIEFICIA from inside up the backstretch,
moved away from that rival around the turn, remained clear to midstretch, then shortened stride and could only salvage the show. CHIEFICIA set the pace
for a half-mile, could not keep up with LUVMESUMCAJUN around the turn, and faded. POSEIDONS MYTH was finished early two wide. SMART SOLDIER
broke out, showed speed for a half, and gave way three to four wide. TARQUIN was pushed out by SMART SOLDIER at the break, and retired early. EL
ROMANTICO trailed from the start, dropped far back before reaching the stretch, and jogged in.

Footnotes
CLAPTON stalked the pace four wide, seized command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, drove clear leaving the eighth pole, angled in and held safe.
SUPERSTITIEUX broke in a tangle, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked inside around the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied
widest. HEY HIGH POCKETS was bumped after the start, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, bid inside of the winner turning for home,
could not match strides with that foe in the lane, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole and settled for the show. MR. EXTENSION set the pace in the two path
and tired in the drive. BALI BEACH bumped with HEY HIGH POCKETS soon after the start, saved ground and never threatened. RUSSIAN TO WIN had
brief speed two wide. SOUTHERN BREEZE was through early. THE RIDER OF HEY HIGH POCKETS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE BUT THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
KEY BISCAYNE was slow into stride and allowed to settle early, advanced around the turn four to five wide, rallied steadily on the far outside and caught
STARSHIP NTERPRISE in time. STARSHIP NTERPRISE saved ground in range to the turn, moved out to go after THISSMYTIME coming to the
five-sixteenths, took over at the top of the stretch and moved clear, but could not withstand the top one in the final yards. GLOBAL BRAND lagged at the
back for a half-mile, moved off the inside picking up rivals quickly approaching the quarter-pole, loomed a threat three wide into the lane, then flattened out.
THISSMYTIME sped clear early inside, got overhauled by STARSHIP NTERPRISE after six furlongs and folded up. MO OF THE WEST was forwardly
placed early two wide, and tired in the stretch. ELUSIVE MOLLY pressed THISSMYTIME from outside to the turn, and gave way before reaching the
stretch. HEIRESSINDY tired three to four wide around the turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER set a pressured pace along the rail, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole, regained command in upper stretch and edged ahead
under a drive. VITAEMI pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied outside of the winner from there and was turned back.
LAVI vied two wide between foes, had the rider lose the whip near the three-sixteenths pole and was unable to keep pace with the top two in the lane. LADY
FIORELLA chased the pace inside, angled four wide nearing the lane and lacked a rally. MARIALUISA bobbled at the start spotting the field three lengths or
so, and trailed inside.

Footnotes
PIPER put daylight on the field leaving the gate, widened steadily inside and was kept driving to 70 yards out. SENORITA SALSA advanced toward the
inside coming to the quarter-pole, and was up for the place without threatening the winner. BRIGHT AND SHINY broke slowly, raced four wide around the
turn, and improved to go clear of the others. TRIPLET chased after PIPER from outside for three furlongs, and tired. PRINCESS LACIE broke slowly and
was outrun early inside, fanned to the far outside leaving the turn, and improved position. CENTRAL PARK GIRL was outrun four to five wide. SYLLABUS
showed brief speed outside, and tired. SOLDAT TEMPTATION was outrun three wide. COMMISSION tired after three furlongs outside. MAGURLI was far
back throughout.. SMOKING FOX was finished early inside.
