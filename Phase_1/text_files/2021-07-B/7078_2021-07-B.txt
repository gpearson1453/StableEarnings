Footnotes
WARRENS CANDY GIRL reserved between rivals early, angled out on the far turn then moved back to the rail leaving the turn, tipped outside the leader at
the head of the stretch, drove clear at the eighth pole and won going away. OUR MISS MILLIE stalked outside a rival, had aim two wide into the lane, bid
three deep upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. POWERS PRINCESS raced off the pace early, traveled three deep then three to two wide on
the far turn, moved out in the lane, lacked the needed late punch but held the show. FINNLEY'S KITTEN bumped with rival at the start, tracked from inside,
waited briefly past the five-sixteenths, shifted to the two path, angled out in the upper stretch and kept on through the final furlong. ELA CALIMERA MOU
traveled along the inside at the back, angled four to five wide at the quarter pole, angled to the rail in upper stretch then had the rider lose the whip at the
eighth pole and improved position. QUEEN OF POMPEII angled down to the two path early, went three deep at the half, four to three wide on the far turn
and weakened. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE away quickly from inside, set the pace under pressure, cleared rival at the half-mile pole, led into the lane, then folded
when collared in upper stretch. SLEW SOUTH bumped with inside rival at the start, near the back of the pack, angled three to four wide around the far turn
and failed to menace. BANGO ISHERNAYMO stalked along the inside, came out a bit in the stretch and faded. ARISTEIA went three then two wide around
the first turn, pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, dropped back between rivals and was done early.

Footnotes
MELTING SNOW broke in and bumped rival, moved to the two path leaving the backstretch, bid outside the top pair into the lane, rallied to the front
midstretch and drew clear. V BUCKS pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, took over past the quarter pole, fought with
MELTING SNOW to mid-stretch and yielded. MUCHA WOMAN stumbled leaving the gate, went up to set the pace along the inside under pressure, dueled
with V BUCKS at the five-sixteenths, lost command past the quarter pole, could not go on with the top pair in the lane but stayed on well to secure the show.
LATER DAYS bumped at the start, chased off the inside, came four wide into the drive and lacked a bid. BIG AL'S PRINCESS bumped leaving the gate,
dropped to the back, went outside a rival on the turn in the two path and never made an impact. STARSHIP DEFIANT chased the pace from outside,
traveled four then five wide around the turn and faded. TRIP TO FREEDOM got bumped leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ZUBOSHI sped clear from inside, controlled the pace to the turn, inched away again around the bend, showed the way two wide into the lane, roused in
upper stretch and given a tap of right handed encouragement mid-stretch and powered away. DISTORTED DIVA forwardly placed in the beginning,
navigated the turn two wide and bested the rest. FRENCH FRANC (FR) broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased three deep early, outside a rival into
and around the turn, came three wide into the stretch and held the show. CANDY ON TOP chased on the inside, went up to steady off the heels of the
winner at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled off the rail on the turn, exited the bend three wide and finished evenly in the late stages. TOPANGA CANYON
bumped with rival at the start, traveled three deep into the turn, was in tight and steadied at the five-sixteenths, went two wide into the stretch, lost path in
upper stretch, altered out and was ridden out to the wire. WISHING ON A STAR hopped at the start, tracked the pace in the two path, steadied between at
the five-sixteenths, lacked room and shifted out in upper stretch and could not rally. KITTEN CALLS hard to load into the gate, lacked early speed and
steered to the inside, saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor. MACRELLETTA traveled in mid-pack off the inside or outside rivals, went four
then three wide around the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TAMING THE TIGRESS brushed with inner rival at the start, stalked outside a rival, bid alongside with a quarter mile remaining, kicked clear in upper
stretch, urged right handed at the eighth pole and drew off under steady handling. I'M THE BOSS OF ME got bumped from inside at the start, set the pace
from inside then moved clear past the half-mile pole, tested at the quarter pole, overtaken in upper stretch and held the place. DANCING DANA settled
outside rivals, traveled five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path and kept on to earn the show honors. ELGOFRANCO was in range early near
the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and finished evenly. AGREETODISAGREE tracked well off the rail, went six wide into the bend, advanced while
angling to the four path on the turn and lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong. BIG ANDY broke out and bumped rival, traveled along the rail into
the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. PISTACHIO PRINCESS brushed at the start, showed early speed outside the pacesetter,
chased that rival into the turn, dropped back around the bend and faded. THE GREAT HAYNES came away alertly then dropped back to chase between
rivals, went four to five wide around the bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
LENA'S BIG DAY tracked the pace off the inside, rallied four wide into the stretch, gained command nearing the eighth pole and stayed strong to the wire.
MOMMA MOCCA broke out and bumped rival, dueled for the lead from outside early, inched ahead on the backstretch, cleared into the second bend, lost
the lead in upper stretch but finished gamely to the end. VALENTINE GHOST dueled from inside, pressed leaving the backstretch, chased the leader
around the turn, re-bid along the rail in upper stretch but could not find more in the final sixteenth. BIG BELL got bumped from both sides at the start then
steadied between shortly after, angled five wide into the lane and bested the rest. UNUSUAL RIDE stalked outside a rival, crept closer outside the top pair
at the three-eighths, bid between in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages. SKY ON ICE stalked along the inside then moved out a bit leaving the first
turn, traveled two wide into the far turn, angled four wide leaving that bend and failed to produce a bid. KOKO'S MOM broke in and bumped rival at the start,
saved ground at the back and never made an impact. LAKE FLAMINGO tracked outside a rival, coaxed at the three-eighths, started to weakened around
the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
NONE ABOVE THE LAW stumbled at the start, well placed behind the top pair early on, bid three deep into the stretch, kicked clear and widened in the final
furlong. THE CHOSEN VRON broke in, raced at the back early, split foes at the three-eighths, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, rallied and
gained the place. LETSGETLUCKY came away alertly, showed speed then ceded the lead to ATOMIC DROP, pressed the rival then dueled past the
five-sixteenths pole, could not kick on the winner in the stretch but kept to task and edged rival for the show honors. ATOMIC DROP chased inside rival then
went up to take command, held a short lead in the two path into the turn, dueled past the five-sixteenths and into the stretch, relinquished command to
NONE ABOVE in upper stretch, then flattened late and got edged for the show. TOP HARBOR tracked three to four wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
FOUND MY BALL settled along the inside, entered the stretch two wide and lacked further response. TOUCHDOWN BROWN raced off the pace, went four
wide around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
SEVEN CHARMS was bothered a bit by STIRLING DRIVE early on the first turn, angled in on that bend, coaxed around the third turn, cut the corner into
the stretch, rallied along the fence and got up in time. FARQUHAR away quickly from inside, ceded the lead to LIBERAL on the first turn, switched to the
outside to stalk the leader, applied pressured on the final turn, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining and got nailed on the line. BIG BUZZ stumbled
a bit at the start, stalked the pace from inside, two to three wide into the drive, rallied and got up for the show. LIBERAL (IRE) bumped from inside at the
start, sped clear early and moved inward, led clear into the final turn, pressured around that bend, held a short lead into the furlong grounds, overtaken at
the sixteenth pole and got edged for the show. LUVLUV broke out and bumped rival at the start, raced three deep first time through the stretch, angled five
wide around the last turn and summoned a mild rally. COSMO tucked inside early, went between rivals first time through the stretch, roused at the quarter
pole and came two wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane and lacked a bid. LURE HIM IN raced three wide around the first turn, moved to the two path
on the clubhouse turn, angled out and went four deep at the quarter pole and could not rally. CAPITAL CALL raced off the rail throughout and failed to
menace. ENGRAM settled at the back, moved inside on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. STIRLING DRIVE was off slow
to begin, went to up to stalk outside a rival, dropped back between leaving the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
SOMETIMES ALWAYS got bumped from outside then shifted out at the start, was forwardly placed off the inside, bid alongside the leader leaving the turn,
kicked clear in upper stretch and held well. PAINT ME LUCKY raced up close inside the top pair, lost contact with the leader at the three-eighths, angled off
the rail into the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. BIG WELL forwardly placed in the early stages, lost ground around the turn, went three wide into the
lane and closed willingly to whittle the gap late. CARELESS KITTEN vied for the lead three deep, moved clear at the three-eighths, challenged leaving the
turn while having the rider lose the whip, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened in the final furlong. POSEIDON WRATH stumbled, broke
out and bumped rival, ridden along through the early stages while between rivals, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. ALARMING
MOMENT stumbled a bit at the start, settled off the pace and moved to the inside, exited the turn a bit off the rail and was never a factor. CALL NINE ONE
ONE hit the inside gate and bumped rival at the start, raced two wide into the turn, three to four wide into the stretch and never got involved. SIROCCO vied
for the lead between rivals to the turn, could not match strides around the bend, eased out five wide into the stretch and retreated. BRON AND THE BROW
got bumped hard from inside at the start, traveled three deep on the backstretch, four wide around the turn and had little left for the stretch run.
