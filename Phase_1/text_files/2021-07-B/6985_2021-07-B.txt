ITALIAN JUSTICE settled nicely, commenced a three wide bid on the turn, rallied in the stretch and wore down RUSSIAN ROULETTE. The latter grabbed
the lead, held on well into the stretch, dug in and kept on stubbornly. CATECHISM stalked the pace and lacked the needed bid to mix it up with the top pair.
EURO ME never menaced. RAGATAGTAG saved ground and lacked a rally. MADISON WAY was brushed at the start and outrun.

Footnotes
IMA TROUBLE MAKER sprinted clear early, held well into the stretch and maintained his advantage under steady pressure. SILENT POWER settled while
five wide, advanced on the turn and stayed on while four wide in the stretch. AIN'T LIFE GRAND raced forwardly while three wide, moved four wide into the
stretch and finished well. LEGIONARY outpaced early, commenced a bid on the turn and showed late energy in the stretch. EBONY PEARL chased the
pace and never reached contention. INTERSTELLA was bumped at the start and managed a belated rally in the stretch. DEMIDANU chased along the
inside and dropped back in the stretch. ADRIA stalked the early pace and weakened. TOUGH AINT ENOUGH came in at the start and failed to threaten.
COLD AS YOU was off slowly and never involved. THE BONDSMAN was always outrun.

Footnotes
SHY RUNNER dueled for the early lead, edged clear leaving the turn and pulled away in the stretch. RACE DAY DIVA chased along the inside, proved no
match and stayed on in the stretch. DELIGHT SURPRISE void of speed, entered the stretch three wide and managed a belated rally. JUSTIN'S GIRL raced
forwardly while four wide and lacked a rally. ADD IT ALL UP never menaced. REBA swerved in at the start, had a wide trip and did not factor. SLOOPY
HANG ON was always outrun. BREA saved ground and was never involved. YOU JUST WATCHME raced in striking position and dropped back leaving the
turn. DANCING DIAMOND forced the early pace and tired as a result. OUR DOUBLE DIAMOND was carried in at the start and showed little.
