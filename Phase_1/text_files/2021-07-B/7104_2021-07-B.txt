Footnotes
SONG OF FIRE contested the early pace with TALE OF THE TAVERN, opened up the margin on that rival on the second turn, had a comfortable lead into
the lane and drew away in the final stages. LAKAYA sat just off of the early pacesetters, was three wide on the second turn, gained ground off of that turn
but was outfinished in the stretch by SONG OF FIRE while an easy second over the rest. QUICK TIME (GB) was a bit rank in the run into the first turn,
stalked the pace while saving ground on the second turn but weakened in the stretch run. TALE OF THE TAVERN dueled on the front end with SONG OF
FIRE, saved ground on the second turn but tired in the stretch run. IMPECCABLE TASTE chased the early pace, lost position while traveling along the
inside on the second turn and faded in the late going. LADY DOC had no early speed, saved ground on the second turn and trailed throughout.

SWIFT AS I AM sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn, was pushed out a path when COASTAL KID drifted
out nearing the furlong marker, was engaged by PAPPY BOYINGTON inside of the final sixteenth but dug in late to prevail. PAPPY BOYINGTON settled off
of the early pace while saving ground on the turn, mounted a rail bid off of the turn, continued that rally inside of the final sixteenth and dueled the winner but
was bested at the wire while a clear second over the rest. COASTAL KID was sent from the gate to set the fractions through the turn, led into the lane, was
tiring and drifted out a path into SWIFT AS I AM and weakened in the final stages. COPPER HALO chased COASTAL KID through the turn, was three wide
while gaining ground on the turn but gave way in the stretch run. MR. STANG was away last of the field, chased from the rear through the turn and was not
a factor.

COUNTING CARDS prompted the early pace while three wide on the turn, pounced on the pacesetter nearing the top of the stretch and kicked away in the
end to prevail, while under mild pressure from the runner-up. ACE AND KINGS settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and rallied in
the stretch to put mild pressure on the winner late, while an easy second over the rest. EVENEREVENWORSE broke on top and set the pace while being
tracked by COUNTING CARDS, was collared leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch run. ELUSIVE LOVE was off a step slowly, chased the field from
the rear while saving ground and did not offer a rally in the stretch. AUTISM ABILITY chased the dueling pacesetters, was four wide between foes on the
turn and gave way in the stretch. RED'S SHOWTIME chased the early pace, came five wide on the turn and faded in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TOM'S BIRTHDAY prompted the pace while three wide on the turn, took the lead off of the turn, was urged through the stretch and put away U S DEPUTY
in the final sixteenth while holding off the runner-up in a game debut effort. LUVTHEONEURWITH settled just off of the early pace, was two wide on the turn
while gaining ground, made a rail bid in the stretch, pressured the winner late but was nipped for the win, while holding for second. U S DEPUTY was sent
to set the pace while saving ground in the two path, was confronted at the head of the stretch but was stubborn and would not relent until the final stages
when outfinished by the top two. RUNNING ON EMPTY was away slowly and chased the field from the rear, gained ground on the turn while running along
the inside but finished evenly in the stretch run. PRAYFORTATERS stalked the pace through the turn, was four wide on the turn, lost ground into the stretch
and gave out in the late going. FALCON EX settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.

J T'S WATCH was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the second turn, rallied off of that turn, split horses inside of the furlong marker, was kept
to task through the stretch and won in a drive. GALLANT GUY set the fractions through the second turn while being tracked by SENSEMAKER, led into the
final sixteenth but was worn down by the winner while besting the rest. STALKING SHADOW stalked the early pace, was four wide on the second turn,
gained ground off the turn to vie for the lead among a group of rivals but was outkicked in the stretch. FALSELY ACCUSED settled just off of the early pace,
saved ground on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch drive. SENSEMAKER prompted the pace by GALLANT GUY through the second turn,
was still in contention off of the turn but weakened in the stretch.

MISS SUPER SAINT sat just off of the early pace of SEASIDE DANCER, applied pressured to that rival heading into the second turn to take the lead, led
into the stretch and kicked clear in the end to prevail. IMPERIAL CREED was allowed to settle in the early going, was three wide on the second turn, gained
ground to vie for the lead off of the turn but was outkicked by the winner while holding for second. REV REE settled off of the early pace, saved ground on
the second turn, mounted a bid off of that turn and was outfinished in the stretch run, while applying mild pressure on the runner-up late. ODESSA stalked
the early pace, was four wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. SEASIDE DANCER broke alertly and set all of the pace, was
confronted on the second turn by MISS SUPER SAINT and held position to the top of the stretch but tired in the late stages. MOLLIE O ' MCEVOY was
away last of the field and trailed through the backstretch, stopped along the second turn, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
SIX POINT RACK prompted the pace by DESERT DUDE, applied pressure to that foe through the backstretch and on the second turn while three wide,
vied for the lead off of the turn and determinedly got by MOONLIGHT BLUE in the final sixteenth to prevail. MOONLIGHT BLUE sat just off of the early
pace, was four wide on the second turn, led off of the turn and had the lead into the last sixteenth but was caught by the winner while saving the place.
KNOWN was away a bit slowly and settled at the rear of the field in the early going, was four wide on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn and was
closing well late, just missing for second. DESERT DUDE set contested fractions through the second turn, was confronted nearing the top of the stretch and
weakened in the drive. UBER STAR tracked the pace through the second turn, was three wide on that turn, lost ground into the stretch and finished evenly
in the stretch run. ONE EYED ROBIN was away slowly and had no speed in the early going, saved ground on the second turn and made a late rally in the
stretch but was not challenging the leaders. ORCZY (IRE) settled off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch run.
LINGUA FRANCA chased the early pace, lost ground on the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. JOURNEY TO RUN
settled toward the rear of the field in the early going, trailed on the second turn while three wide and was empty for the stretch drive.
