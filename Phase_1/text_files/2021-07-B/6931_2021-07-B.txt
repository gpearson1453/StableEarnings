COPA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits uncontested, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, drew off
under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to prevail comfortably at the end. FROSTED INDIAN four to five wide in pursuit under coaxing from
the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. DEMOCRATIC VALUES coaxed rom the start,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
kept on for the show honors. LARCENY stumbled at the start getting away last while conceding a length or two to the front, chased along the inside down
the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MISSION WRAPITUP four wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MACHO BOY hustled from the gate,
chased two to three wide forwardly placed, came under a ride from three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

BLUE LILY was restless in the gate but came away in good order, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path while taken under restraint, set an
uncontested pace under a snug hold while tugging at the bit, vied inside while confronted on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole
then came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and proved much the best under strong urging. EMPRESS
THEODORA was restless in the gate then hustled from the start, raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, tracked the pace down the
backstretch, was urged along in the two path early on the turn, made a bid passing the three-eighths, ducked in behind the winner after turning into the
stretch and steadied, moved out while put to a drive shortly thereafter and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. EVVIE JETS moved in
nearing the first turn, traveled around that bend in the two path, dropped back some with five furlongs to run then came under urging, was ridden along in
the three path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. WOW was last to commence from the inside post,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, passed two foes around the five-sixteenths, was
driven four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. PEACEBETHEJOURNEY was rated
inside on the first turn then well placed down the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired.
SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON bobbled at the start but broke with the field, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back under
urging with a half-mile to run, came up empty in the four then three path on the far turn and retreated. COALITION BUILDING dropped in to save ground on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn, angled four wide while dropping back at the five-sixteenths and
faltered.

Footnotes
RAFFINITY broke very fast, angled in while going to the front, set the pace with some company to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear
outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong, came under a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. LIVE IN FIVE was hustled from the start, steadied behind the winner coming to the
three-quarter pole, was rated just off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn and safely secured the place while
no match for the winner. GALLINA was carried in early then steadied, moved out then was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the five path
and tired while just able to get the show. HANDLE THE TRUTH was hustled from the start then coaxed along on the inside of an opponent, chased in the
four path through the turn and came up empty. ELEGANT LAOBAN was carried in early, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn
and failed to threaten. MADAME ROSE was carried in early then switched to the outside, prompted the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two
path on the turn, dropped back under urging outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. DECREED hesitated at the start then was taken back, moved out at
the rear of the field, went five then six wide on the turn and failed to respond.

LET'S BE CLEAR coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, rallied to take
command nearing the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. TAKE THE BACKROADS showed the way in hand three then two wide
down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from
home, ran on and just held on for the place honors over a fast closing rival. MORNING MATCHA chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish charging home late and just missed for the place honors. GABRIELA'S
MIRACLE hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper
stretch, tipped out two then three wide at the three-sixteenths and weakened while along clear for the last major share. G MONEY LIV chased just off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, advanced on the rail through the latter portion of the turn, angled four wide for home and weakened. NEXT
TUESDAY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS stumbled at
the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. SOLIB five wide in pursuit, got steadied
briefly off the heels of NEXT TUESDAY when that rival crossed tucking inside, continued five wide through the turn stacked outside a quartet, went seven
wide into upper stretch and tired. HELENS SPIRIT chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch and tired.

SHIRAZ coaxed from the gate, advanced to vie between foes briefly among a quartet latched on nearing the turn from the two path, got shaken off and
chased just off the inside through the bend coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily
gaining through the final furlong and ran down the leader to get up in the final jumps and prevail. FAST GETAWAY broke out at the start and on top, led
early on before briefly vying with a trio nearing the turn four paths off the inside, tucked three wide and shook away into the turn showing the way and
tucking to the two path midway, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under lone threat to the outside and was nailed in the very last strides to the wire. ALPHALFA chased along the inside under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. SWASHBUCKLE just off the inside in pursuit from
near the rear, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the three then four path with
three-sixteenths to go and offered up a mild bid. DISCRETIONARY MARQ hustled from the gate, vied inside a trio briefly before chasing in closest aim of
the leader along the inside through the turn, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch and got on near even terms straightened away for home
before weakening in the late stages. THREE OUTLAWS four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. ROBEY'S BOY chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. GANDY DANCING hustled from the start, chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and was outrun. ANALYZETHISANDTHAT hustled from the gate, showed brief speed three
in aim before latching on between foes briefly vying for the front near the turn before backing away a bit once into the turn, got coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

FORZA DI ORO moved out into the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, turned up the pressure on the leader on the far turn, took
over late on that bend, spun three wide into the stretch then kicked clear under a hand ride, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker,
extended the advantage under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. WEST WILL POWER bumped lightly with a foe at the
start, was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path under snug restraint, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide while asked
on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and safely secured
the place. TRIDENT HIT went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside at the rear, tipped out a path leaving the backstretch, was given his cue in
the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and came up empty while best of the rest. AMERICAN DUBAI was asked leaving the gate
then corrected with a tug of the right rein, dropped in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside with company to his outside, was asked inside
the three-eighths, lost the advantage to the winner around the five-sixteenths and faded. HIGHEST HONORS went three wide on the first turn, settled
comfortably on the outside, came under coaxing around the nine-sixteenths then stronger encouragement with a half-mile to run, dropped back three wide
on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

taking command a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish to prevail. DISTRACTANDATTACK five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors.
DAMILANO got bumped between foes at the start and was pinched back, chased just off the inside from near the rear, advanced through the turn and took
the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the two path straightened away and kicked on belatedly to split foes late and get up for the show honors. ON
OUR WAY BOYZ broke in a step at the start bumping MOMMIE'S JEWEL into DAMILANO, showed the way coaxed along from the three path under
pressure from SANDOR CLEGANE to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and was briefly headed near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch, inched away briefly under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a trio, got collared a sixteenth out and weakened in the late stages.
BOOM BOOM KABOOM three to four wide in pursuit under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. NAPOLEON COMPLEX hustled from the gate, chased four to five wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide for home and
offered no response. SANDOR CLEGANE broke out at the start bumping VANCOUVER'S PRIDE, prompted the leader from the outside four paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then tucked to the two path through the turn, took brief command at the five-sixteenths under coaxing, spun two to three
wide for home yielding the front, and weakened in the stretch. PERFECT BANKER broke out at the start bumping DAMILANO in tandem with MOMMIE'S
JEWEL, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and tired. VANCOUVER'S PRIDE bumped at the start by SANDOR CLEGANE, who broke outwards, chased three wide under a ride from three
