LONG TERM THINKING stalked the pace, gained a narrow lead on the far turn and held sway in the stretch. FLATOUT WINNER led early, was challenged
on the far turn, was no match for the top one and stayed on in the stretch. PAYNTER PARTY settled while three wide, moved closer on the far turn and
managed a mild rally in the stretch. SPORTS FAN was outrun early and never reached contention. GOSPEL MUSKETEER showed little. DATA STORM
retreated.
