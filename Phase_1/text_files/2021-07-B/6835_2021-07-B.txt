Footnotes
RB BLAIR HOPE set a well handled pace from the start, drew off in upper stretch and was clearly best in the end. RB RICH RATH was settled then rallied
three wide in the stretch, was gaining some ground to be up for the place. WMA BIG BABY chased the early pace while two wide, was in a long drive but
weakened in late stretch. PSC MADISON chased the pace while inside then was hard used and faltered. DANCE WITH ME MHF was inside on the turn and
failed to menace. HIGHH DEMAND was inside and failed to menace. GAILSMASQUERADE raced three wide and was no threat. SVR JUANA GO was
unhurried early and no threat. UPTOWN FANCY PANTS wheeled leaving the chute and unseated her rider then was walked off. A steward's inquiry was
held concerning the start. After reviewing the film's, no action was taken. This race was hand timed.
