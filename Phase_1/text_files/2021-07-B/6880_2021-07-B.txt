Footnotes
SHWEET PERSUASION seized command at the outset, remained clear into the stretch and held on well under a drive. JOHN R reserved early,
commenced a wide bid on the far turn and closed ground in the stretch. DOMIKATE chased while five wide, moved closer on the far turn and stayed on
while four wide in the stretch. ITSALLABOUTYOU hopped at the start, was forwardly placed and offered no response when asked in the stretch. DISCREET
INVASION never menaced. MR. SOLO chased the pacesetter and weakened.

Footnotes
ALLEN'S ROCKET settled well, was steadied at the five-sixteenths pole when shut off by STAGE DOOR, found a seam in the vicinity of the quarter pole
when angled five wide, rallied strongly under a right-handed drive and was going away at the finish. GINGER RULES void of speed, commenced her bid on
the far turn, altered her course at the quarter mile marker and offered a six wide stretch bid to garner the place spot. STAGE DOOR chased the pacesetter,
was angled in for the stretch run and stayed on. NIGHT TERROR grabbed the early lead, held well into the stretch and was worn down late. LUCKY LOUIE
raced forwardly while four wide and came up empty in the stretch. BET YOU A BEER was always outrun. YEARS FLY BY had a wide trip and tired in the
stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF GINGER RULES FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF ALLEN'S ROCKET ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THEY DISMISSED THE OBJECTION AND THE PLACINGS
REMAINED UNALTERED.

MIGHTY GHOST settled well, advanced on the far turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. ROLLER reserved early, commenced a bid on the far turn
and closed willingly while four wide in the stretch. SIR BRAHMS outpaced while three wide, moved closer on the far turn, was angled in and kept on in the
stretch. BACK THE BLUE raced forwardly while three wide and lacked a rally. HARDLY SEEN SLIM never menaced. PODEROSO EQUS was always
outrun. TAKE THAT FOR DATA led early, was headed on the far turn and gave way. KID'S MISCHIEF forced the pace and faltered.
