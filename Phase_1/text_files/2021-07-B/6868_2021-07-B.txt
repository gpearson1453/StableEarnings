Footnotes
ROSY DAWN comfortably stalked outside of the pace setter, ranged up to that foe turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, forged an advantage in upper
stretch, drew off passing the furlong grounds, and inched away under driving pressure. ROYAL COUNTY quickly cleared early on, felt pressure from ROSY
DAWN into the turn before meeting that foe's bid at the quarter pole, but was headed in upper stretch, gave way at the furlong pole, tired through the late
stages, but lasted for place. AN APPLE A DAY broke a bit outwardly and spotted the leader many lengths early on, commenced a five wide rally into the
turn, shifted three wide while in range of the leaders around the bend, then chased those foes home well, but missed reaching ROYAL COUNTY for place.
DREAM MUSIC lied off of the pace along the inside early on, got rank inside of foes at the half mile pole, checked into the turn losing a couple lengths of
position, shifted to the three path to be outside of foes at the five sixteenths pole, swung four wide entering the lane, and stayed on well to cut the gap on
the leaders. JALEBI BABY tracked along the inside, but faded through the lane. STANLEY MARKET tracked in the bit while off of the pace two wide, shifted
course three wide entering the lane before altering five wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. SWIZZLECITY chased three to two wide, but weakened
through the lane. LUCKYWISE tracked from midpack four wide through the opening furlong, but was done early. FROST LAKE was outrun. CALIFORNIA
KITTY was off poorly, and showed little.

Footnotes
DIVINE LEADER dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, cleared an inner foe into the turn while still vying inside of
MORETHANSOULTITLE, got headed by that foe at the quarter pole, but regained an advantage entering the lane, disposed of that foe approaching the
furlong pole before meeting GRENDEL's rail bid and ROUSON's outside charge in the final sixteenth, and stoutly held to the wire. ROUSON tracked the
leading duelers from the four path, rallied through the lane to bid outside of a pair of rivals, dueled with those foes through the late stages, but was denied.
GRENDEL lied close up along the inside, stalked from just off of the outer duelers around the turn, produced a rail bid inside of DIVINE LEADER
approaching the final sixteenth, but was fended off by that rival, and outfinished for place. MORETHANSOULTITLE dueled for the lead three wide, then only
outside of DIVINE LEADER while still in the three path around the turn, forged an advantage from that foe at the quarter pole, but was re-headed entering
the lane, and gave way between horses in upper stretch. FREDERICKTOWN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. HEX trailed two wide around the
turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
BIG DREAMING dueled for the lead along the inside of TUT'S REVENGE, was headed by that foe and HAY DAKOTA at the five sixteenths pole,
resurgently fought back to reclaim a narrow advantage approaching the furlong pole as HAY DAKOTA gave way, then tenaciously fended off TUT'S
REVENGE steady bid to the wire. TUT'S REVENGE dueled for the lead outside of BIG DREAMING, then from between horses around the far turn after
HAY DAKOTA bid, gamely repelled the latter in upper stretch as the prior fought on, sustained the duel after the rider lost his whip at the furlong pole, but
was fended off. HAY DAKOTA stalked three wide, produced a menacing bid outside of the dueling pair into the far turn, vied around that bend, but flattened
out in upper stretch. MAILMAN MONEY settled off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, chased from the four path around the far turn while
under steady urging, but failed to mount a challenge. SUPER SOL broke a step slowly before being bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied at the rear of
the field two wide, shifted four wide approaching the furlong grounds, and moved up late. CODE RUNNER was bumped by an inner foe into an outer one at
the start, saved ground at the rear of the field, but to no avail. SMART REMARK broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside,
then from the two path around the far turn, but faded through the lane.

JETS A GINNIN set a hasty pace inside of a pressing SHAPE OF YOU, drew away from that foe entering the lane, widened in upper stretch, and was
ridden out to the wire. PARKING TICKET lied far off of the pace early on, rallied three wide around the turn, forged place inside of a tiring rival at the furlong
pole, and proved second best. SHAPE OF YOU pressed the quick pace from the outside of JETS A GINNIN, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, and
continued to give way through upper stretch. BOW MAKER trailed around the turn, then improved inside of a pair of foes in the late stages without
threatening. SENSE YOU LEFT tracked two wide, but failed to factor. LIL MISS HOT MESS tracked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but
weakened. PER RULING 21-0068 FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION BOW MAKER WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

Footnotes
MARKET RUMOR tracked two wide, produced a four wide sweeping move turning for home to take control in upper stretch, drew clear in the furlong
grounds, and held sway to the wire. CURLY RUTH sat reserved along the inside, gained ground three wide around the far turn to be inside of MARKET
RUMOR at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to match rallying strides with that foe turning for home, shifted four wide in upper stretch to produce her own
rally, advanced to achieve place inside the final sixteenth, then just held that position from ALTA'S AWARD on the wire. ALTA'S AWARD saved ground off
of the pace, shifted three to four wide in upper stretch, then stayed on well through the late stages to bid for place on the wire, but just missed. JEZEBEL'S
KITTEN stalked along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, chased the clear leader thereafter from between horses but missed place to a pair of
outer rivals. FIRST COURSE trailed, took the far turn in the three path before shifting five wide entering the lane, then stayed on willingly to threaten for
minor rewards. FLABBERGASTED prompted the pace two wide, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, but offered little resistance for MARKET
RUMOR's move entering the lane, held place to the final sixteenth, but faltered late. MARIAFOOT (FR) was last away, recovered to stalk three wide, bid for
the lead along with MARKET RUMOR at the quarter pole, but was swiftly outkicked entering the lane, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.
MAJESTIC BLEND set the pace along the inside, but weakened passing the quarter pole.

MAGIC QUEST set the pace two wide, drew clear from a pair of pressing foes on either side entering the lane, then widened her advantage under mild hand
urging through the final furlong. MINUTE WALTZ vied along the inside of MAGIC QUEST early on, pressed that foe around the turn, switched outside of her
in upper stretch after that foe cleared, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, then held place from an inner rallying FABRICATE. FABRICATE tracked two wide,
bid for place inside of MINUTE WALTZ in the final furlong, but was denied reaching that position. BOW BOW GIRL trailed early on, gained three to four wide
around the turn to be in range of the leader at the quarter pole, but flattened out entering the lane. FORTUNA ADIUVAT stalked three wide, but came under
a drive into the turn, and faded in upper stretch. GOOD PENNY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

NEW BOSS dueled for the lead two wide, cleared approaching the quarter pole, and widened under driving pressure through the final furlong. SOUTHERN
GRAYCE dueled for the lead inside of NEW BOSS, but gave way to that foe at the quarter pole, and held place through the lane. BEACHSIDE BUNNY
chased along the inside, then outside of the dueling pair around the turn, and stayed on to secure show. PRODIGY DOLL chased the duelers from the four
path around the turn, and failed to factor. LADY EDITH was outrun.

Footnotes
TEXAS SHUFFLE vied for the lead early from between horses, cleared the field nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane, opened up wider down the
lane while geared down in the final stages. CLOSET SHOPPER chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but
was no match for the winner in the late stages. SOCIAL CHATTER tracked the pace early three wide, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the
stretch run. FLYING GEM vied for the lead early from the inside, was off the rail into the lane and empty down the lane. YABA DABA DIVA showed little.
MSCOVERTOPERATION was through early and distanced.
