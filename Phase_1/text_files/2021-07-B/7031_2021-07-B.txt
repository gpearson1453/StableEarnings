TRY'N SMART'N UP away on top, showed the way along the two path, responded in the lane and turned back UNCLE NED for the score. UNCLE NED in
hand along the three path leaving the half mile pole, continued on that path to the top of the lane, asked outside, responded but too late. RINGGOOD
tracked along the rail and weakened inside. YOU'VE GOT MALE unhurried along the two path, took the rail into the last turn, three path out of it and then
lacked a rally. SHADOW CASTER four wide early, five wide after that, three path on the last turn and then checked at the top of the lane but was always
outrun. BIJEMINI SLEW stumbled at the start, close up four wide early, three path on the final bend and tired. CURLIN'S KNIGHT close up early and then
was done while four wide on the final turn. DUBLIN GREEN broke slow, checked after that, two path on the turns and tired.

NIGHT CAP toyed with SHADOLAMO from the outset, two path on the turn, kicked away some in upper stretch and drew off as much the best. SINGLE
VERSE hopped at the start, two path into the turn, four wide out of it and finished well to get the place. MAYBE A RAINBOW well placed along the rail,
gained inside into the lane, chased and missed the place. SHADOLAMO vied for the lead from the outset, three path lapped outside the winner on the turn
and weakened. VITANZA broke slow, four wide into the turn, five wide out of it and tired.

waited, angled out for room and finished well. CAVARADOSSI broke slow, in hand along the rail into the turn, eased out into the lane and failed to gain.
ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE unhurried along the two path, three path around the turn, angled out and failed to fire. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN contested the
lead along the two path, took the rail midway on the turn and gave way. SARATOGA PROMISE broke awkwardly, lagged back along the two path into the
turn, five wide out of it and finished wide. FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR ducked out sharply at the start, four wide early, three path on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CAT GLASSES KATHY contested the lead along the two path from the outset, kicked loose in the lane and under pressure lasted. KAUFY FUTURES well
placed, gained four wide on the turn to reach the leaders three across at the top of the lane, chased and then drifted out from the sixteenths pole to the wire
while just missing. SPIRIT OF LIFE bumped in the chute, saved ground on the turn, appeared to be blocked leaving the five-sixteenths pole, waited, angled
out and then it was too late. WILD NORTH broke slow, four wide on the turn, angled wide and failed to threaten. DELAWARE DESTINY contested the lead
along the three path to the lane and gave way. FERLAND'S PROSPECT two path into the turn, appeared to be blocked nearing the quarter pole, angled out
and tired. BELLA BAY broke two lengths and was always outrun. WALL EYE three path on the turn and finished wide.
