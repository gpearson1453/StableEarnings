Footnotes
DIVINE MARTHA showed brief speed but was passed by MOKSGMOL early on the main track, pressed the pacesetter, lapped on to the leader through the
turn, challenged at the top fo the stretch and shook clear then held under a drive. SHOW SOME SKIN stalked the pace, closed from the rail to three-wide
late turn then rallied gamely and was gaining late. CLASSY VISION settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then rallied willingly and was
up late for the show position. MOKSGMOL moved up to take a short lead on the main track, set a pressured pace, was headed at the top of the stretch and
gave way gradually. BEAT THE RUSH raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn but never reached contention. TOY SHOW broke
outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TO SING MY SONG broke slowly but sprinted to the early lead, set a reserved pace, quickened at the head of the stretch, drifted out under left handed
encouragement but held under a drive. LOUEMMA, off slowly, stalked the pace from the rail, launched a determined stretch drive and was gaining steadily. I
AM I SAID settled in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn then rallied outside the field. D'S SOUL broke outward and showed brief speed,
chased three-wide on the turn then finished gamely between foes. REAL CHOPPER, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the
turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely between rivals. FLAT OUT FABULOUS stalked the pace, chased three to two-wide late turn but evened
out in the final 16th. TWICK, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn, was blocked approaching the stretch and lacked a closing
response. SENORITA UNO hopped leaving the gate, dropped well off the pace and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ORBALINE forced the pace, stalked three-wide o the turn, chased into the stretch, bid near the furlong marker, drove clear and held under steady handling.
ENGLISH BISCUIT hopped at the start, closed to mid pack by the turn, was hustled two to four-wide then rallied all out. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER in range,
was hustled from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. FOR MY ELBI stalked the pace, was hustled three then two-wide on the
turn and was all out in the stretch. LA BESTIA had speed and a short lead, set a pressured pace, was joined in earnest a furlong out and gave way. ROSA'S
SOUL forced the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, did not bid and faded. DON'T SMILE LILAH was away slowly and off the pace, was hustled two
and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SLASHS RED DIAMOND was rated off the pace, saved ground on the turn but lacked a closing
response. SPARKISHA was off slowly but gained position in range, dropped back three and four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ANITA GRIGIO led quickly, had an open length lead midway around the first turn, stalked and challenged by the place finisher around the far turn and down
the stretch but held stubbornly with that foe at her flank the entire lane. PENETANGUISHENE stalked the wire to wire winner while under restraint through
the first turn and down the backside, bid for the front nearing the top of the lane but could not get by, second best today. STORMY VISION was pinched
back at the start by a rival, trailed the field around the first turn, commenced a two to three wide rally around the far turn, tipped out into the seven path
turning for home and closed stoutly down the lane while widest and not changing leads. NAITAKA got a nice rail trip, in behind the leaders turning for home
but her rally stalled at the eighth pole and she was picked up for the show in the final stages. ROCHE'S POINT broke in at the start causing a chain
reaction, settled off the pace and between rivals, advanced into mid pack on the far turn and dipped to the rail turning for home but could not sustain her bid
and flattened out at the eighth pole. ALTERNATIVE VIEW in midpack early, circled up outside rivals three to four wide on the far turn but could not continue
her rally and levelled off in the final furlong. SWEET SHADES stalked the eventual top two finishers throughout, still three wide on the far turn but faded in
the stretch. ECHO IN THE FOREST was pinched back at the start, always far back and trailed midway through the far turn, never a threat. LA BONITA sat
in midpack along the rail, asked for run midway on the far turn but could not respond.

Footnotes
QUEEN ANDHER COURT pressed the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, took the lead in the final furlong and held under a drive. MY
GINNY BEAR led early, set a pressured pace, was passed in the final furlong but held the place position. NATURAL HABITAT pressed the early pace in
hand, stalked on the backstretch, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then finished all out. YOU THRILL ME, rated off the pace, came two and
three-wide through the clubhouse turn, closed outside the field on the backstretch, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then got up late for a minor award.
JUST SILENT settled in mid pack, closed on the backstretch and was hustled three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. DYNAMIC
CONTRAST stalked the pace, forced the issue into the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally.
