Footnotes
STONE BEAUTY set a pressured pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. BEMBE lacked early speed while racing
two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and finished well outside. FLOR DE PLATA was in tight soon after the start, advanced three and four wide
around the turn then was one-paced in the lane. DEVILETTE pressed the winner in the three path and weakened in the lane. KUMANDRA saved ground
and failed to menace. CHIT CHAT BANG broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ROSA STAR raced in closest attendance to ALEXANDRA AM I early, met little resistance taking over outside that rival midway on the far turn, was roused
into the lane as challengers materialized to her outside, drifted out under left-hand pressure leaving the furlong grounds and held on. CHOOSE TO BE
HAPPY was strung out four wide into the first turn, put in a three-wide run taking closer order after six furlongs, loomed a threat between horses with a
furlong remaining, steadied outside the winner and shifted out coming to the sixteenth-pole, and could not get by. APPOINTED saved ground in the second
flight early, came under a ride on the far turn gradually moving out four wide, was forced out by CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY in deep stretch and made no
further gains. MORNING COLORS was in tight approaching the first turn in the three-path, moved inside soon after, advanced to contention approaching
the quarter-pole, was boxed in along the rail through upper stretch, and faded when clear. ANONYMOUS SOURCE raced two to three wide, and failed to
menace. ALEXANDRA AM I set a sharp pace to the far turn, and gave way readily before completing six furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY
AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY AGAINST ROSA STAR, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION
AND PLACED THIRD FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
ACTING LUCKY vied two wide early, drew clear around the turn, drifted out turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened while ridden
out. SWEET PENELOPE raced in range two wide between foes, tipped three wide to bid nearing the quarter pole, was floated out turning for home, could
not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and was clearly second best. HIGH GLORY saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide in upper stretch,
lacked the needed rally but gained the show. G T'S BLUE SQUALL bobbled at the start, raced off the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane
and never threatened. KIZZY vied inside of the winner and retreated nearing the lane. DEFENDANT had early speed three wide and faltered nearing the
lane. MISS YAYA played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BABY MO sped clear soon after the start, widened the advantage turning for home, stayed on her left lead and was kept to pressure. ROMANTIC TALE
pursued the winner three wide from the outset, stayed on her left lead unable to mount a serious challenge through the lane, and remained clearly second
best. BETTABE SWIFT got slammed by BREEHAZEL at the start, raced three wide around the turn, and finished evenly. VENTRILOQUIST moved off the
rail early on the turn, and made no headway in the two-path. BREEHAZEL broke in giving BETTABE SWIFT a solid bump, chased outside the winner to the
turn, moved to the rail and faded after three furlongs. SHE ROX MY SOCKS was outsprinted early, steadied inside VENTRILOQUIST at the top of the
stretch, and remained well back. BONNY BELL was always outrun. OH NO ITS T B lunged at the start, and never got close.

Footnotes
ROUGH ENTRY set a pressured pace two wide, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. PALADIO settled off the pace while racing three
wide, angled four wide nearing the lane and ran on to gain the place in the final strides. DARK TIMBER broke a bit slow but showed good speed inside of
the winner, dropped off the pace duel entering the turn, angled three wide leaving the three-eighths pole, re-bid three wide near the quarter pole, was no
match for the winner and lost second late. ENSIGN PARKER vied three wide to upper stretch, tired then steadied when DARK TIMBER drifted in in front of
him near the sixteenth pole. MAGIC ECLIPSE failed to menace while racing four wide. THINKABOUTIT chased the pace outside, angled in near the
three-eighths pole and retreated. THE RIDER OF ENSIGN PARKER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST DARK TIMBER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR
THE SIXTEENTH POLE BUT THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

FULMINATE hustled up to take s clear lead after a sixteenth of a mile or so, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, and was roused to remain well in
command. OPALINA was outsprinted early, shifted out four wide approaching the top of the stretch, and finished willingly to get up for second. FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO moved to the two-path to get by LLUVIA leaving the quarter-pole, went back inside through the furlong grounds and ran on evenly.
SATURDAY NITE GIRL pursued the pacesetter three wide to the stretch, and had no closing response. LLUVIA led briefly after the break, chased inside the
winner to the top of the stretch, and tired. NUMERIC was outsprinted throughout. ZEN (IRE) was outrun three to four wide. INES'S HATS was no factor
inside.

Footnotes
BIMINI was never far back, challenged for command outside REAL DOOZIE and LET'S BE HONEST after five furlongs, poked a head in front of the latter
with a quarter-mile remaining, and prevailed after a long, hard drive. LET'S BE HONEST pressed the pace between horses, reached a brief lead near the
five-sixteenths pole, battled inside BIMINI through the lane and stayed on stubbornly. NATIONALIST stumbled at the start, advanced after six furlongs
shifting out four wide, had aim outside the leaders through midstretch but was outfinished. PACIFIC PRINCESS brushed with REAL DOOZIE at the start,
raced in striking range near the inside early, steered to the far outside at the top of the stretch, stayed on with good courage but needed more.
RASPBERRY BALLET moved out four wide late on the turn, and could not make an impact. JOST SAYIN was widest up the backstretch at the rear, moved
in around the turn and remained outrun. REAL DOOZIE brushed with PACIFIC PRINCESS at the start, set a pressured early pace inside, yielded to the top
two before going six furlongs, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
TRACEABILITY settled off the pace inside, made progress down the backstretch, saved ground behind the leaders around much of the far turn, angled
three wide nearing the quarter pole, slowly gained outside and was up in deep stretch. REMENDADOR set a rated pace inside, kicked clear in upper stretch
and led until deep stretch. DIVINE CONTROL raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, made progress inside around the far turn, loomed in
midstretch and levelled off in the final furlong. DUEL FUEL prompted the pace two wide, vied two wide around the far turn but weakened in the lane. BLACK
LIMO failed to menace while racing two and three wide. THE CAPTURED STAR was bumped at the start, checked entering the first turn, raced two wide
and never threatened. DREAM OF ANFIELD broke out and bumped THE CAPTURED STAR, chased the pace three wide, lacked a response and was
vanned off. LIAMS STAR was up close while pulling and racing two wide and was through after a half. METRALLAZO was outrun while racing four wide.
