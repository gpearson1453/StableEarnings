Footnotes
IRISH SWING was off a step slow, rushed to contend, stalked the pace of PROUDTOBESICILIAN while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival in
mid-stretch, vied and proved best in a stiff drive. PROUDTOBESICILIAN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when
challenged by the winner with a furlong to run, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly late. MORE HONOR lacked early speed, saved ground through
the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. BERNIE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the
needed closing response. DOCTOR BRUCE S. was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TCHULA SUNSET showed
brief speed and weakened.

RAIDERETTE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. FORTUNE IN SILK broke
sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide throughout, failed to gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. GOLD SUPPLY was
forwardly placed from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. ROSIES BABY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. VERAAJ showed brief speed from the inside, steadied nearing the half-mile marker, moved
five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. SHE'S AN EAGLE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and
did not offer a bid.

AMERICAN BUDDHA was bumped at the break, pressed the pace of NORTHWEST RAIN while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a
furlong to run and drew off as a handy winner. MARCH ON LINCH chased the leaders while racing four-wide, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
was up for the place. NORTHWEST RAIN was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths
marker and gave way through the final furlong. HARBOR OUTLAW settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally.
SECLUDED HARBOR raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. OUR HY ROLLER lagged throughout.

LIBERTY'S FINALE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane
while being ridden out to be kept to task. HIGH SPEED CHASE chased the leaders while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. LITTLE BIG HOUSE lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly late. BEX was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. FIELD OF HOPE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
second turn and did not menace. TOUGH ROOSTER showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
JUSTALITTLEDREAMER veered in at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

JIMJIMMYJAMES pressed the pace of ROUGH RIDE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command inside the quarter and edged clear of that rival
through the closing yards. ROUGH RIDE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way to the winner in the drive. MISO
FAST raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished with good late energy. MONSTRODAMOUS pressed the pace of ROUGH RIDE
while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. AUTISM IMPACT was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and did not offer a bid. COLAVITO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a

handy winner. TUMAC MOUNTAIN lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. CREST
DRIVE broke in the air, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and rallied late. CODE CHARLIE set a pressured pace from the inside and
gave way through the final furlong. PURE PURSUIT was away alertly to press the pace of CODE CHARLIE while racing three-wide and weakened after
going a half. DUDLEY STUDLEY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. FUZZY DOLPHIN raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

CRIBBS sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased her margin into the stretch and drew off with little need of urging. GOLD
ROSE tracked the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. SKY'S THE LIMIT settled off the
leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. CHARMANT E was off slow and broke out, raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good courage. COVER TWO raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide
through the turn and lacked the needed late response. PRINCESS CAROLINE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and
weakened. LONSDALEITE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. LOVE ON THE FLY was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not reach contention.
