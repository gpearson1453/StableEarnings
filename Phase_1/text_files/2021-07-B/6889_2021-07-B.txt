R T C DERBY GIRL zoomed form outset and established a comfortable margin on the field in a quick manner, then steadily widened that margin on all rivals
for a well clear victory. EUROBOUTTOGETIT gave chase from an inside pose, latched into a stretch duel with FLY FENIX FLY and bested that rival for the
place. FLY FENIX FLY hustled from outset to lead the second flight from a two path stance then was outdueled in final furlong for the place honors.
TOCDIRTYTOME trailed the field along the backstretch and into upper stretch before passing a tiring rival in final strides. GINNY'S SONG was unhurried
and trekked the three path around the hook before tiring in the end.

Footnotes
COUSIN DARIO assumed command immediately after the break, established an inside track, and led every step of the way while inching away in
homestretch for a gate to wire score. VALID DECISION trekked three wide around the opening turn, led the second flight through every call, rated in the two
path at upper stretch and proved to be best of rest behind the gate to wire winner. BURTNJOE was unhurried in the early phases and trailed the field
through the first two calls before swinging widest at upper stretch and rallying in the late strides to earn the show. INTERNET EXPRESS settled into mid
pack along the inside, was in the pocket near the quarter pole, then was nipped at wire for show honors by rallying rival. EURAMASTER showed reserve
and gave chase from a two path pose, then lacked a closing kick to improve placing.

Footnotes
ORPHAN ANGIE motored from outset, established an inside position, and humbled all rivals by steadily widening the margin in a gate to wire romping.
WATERMELON KIZS stalked the early front runner around the first bend from a three wide stance, rated at front of second flight along the backstretch, then
won the duel for place honors but was no match for the tough gate to wire winner. PRAIRIE STAR broke sharply and contested the early command into and
around the opening turn but lacked a rally to run down the runaway winner. FLASHY LOOK settled along the inside, saved ground, and was never involved.
TAPPIN FOR TROUBLE failed to threaten after breaking tardily and giving chase from a back rated stance.

UNEXPECTED STORM came away alertly and established a two path stance into and through the opening turn, gained command at the top of the
backstretch and shook clear midway before finishing in hand for the clear score. WAY TOO CUTE tucked to rail shortly after start, saved ground throughout,
and finished full of run, but was no match for the winner in the end. JIM'S ANGEL trailed the field from outset through the first two calls, swung widest of all
at upper stretch and rallied to earn show honors. TIZ A SIGHT settled into second flight as the widest of three rivals, maintained that line into upper stretch,
but lacked a response to urging in final furlong. PASSION GAL saved ground to no avail. CRYSTAL CODE failed to menace while trekking the two path
early and rating three wide at upper stretch from a back rated stance. QUEEN LANA flashed early speed and led the field around the first bend before
eclipsing in the latter portion of contest.

OKIE BUCK rushed form outset and established a two path pose, just on the outside of STEPPIN SHEP, then matched strides with that rival around the
turn, locked into a stretch duel with that rival and won the nod at the wire for the honors. STEPPIN SHEP hustled away at the break and assumed a ground
saving stance, rated alongside OKIE BUCK through the bend and into the stretch, locked into a stretch duel with that rival, then was outnodded at the wire
and forced to settle for place. SWAY BACK WHEN hurried from the break and set the pace around the turn, led the field at deep stretch and was caught by
the rallying, dueling pair in the final sixteenth. ZANE GRAY came away behind rivals, trailed the field through the bend, and passed a wide rival in the final
furlong. GENTLE GEORGE chased rivals along the backstretch, then lost ground to front runners with an extra wide trip into upper stretch.

MUNI MUNI SLEW settled into a two path stance and stalked the pacesetters from second flight, maintained that line into the homestretch and dug in to
shake clear of rivals in the final eighth for the score. WOODS OF CONGAREE rallied for the place after showing reserve and settling along the inside early
before angling out around the closing bend and travelling widest of all at upper stretch. PAST VISIONS tucked behind early front runners to save ground,
rated in the second flight along the backstretch, trekked the three path at upper stretch, then lost momentum when crowded and lacking room near the
sixteenth pole. U S HERO loomed the pacesetters from an inside stance through the first tow calls, rated along the inside at upper stretch, was urged and
finished willingly but failed to fend off the rallying rivals in the final eighth. OKLAHOMA SWING came up empty and faded inthe final furlong after setting the
pace for the opening half. HEADEDTOTHESTARS trailed throughout.

LASTCALLFORALCOHOL assumed first command, saved ground throughout, and never relished command for a gate to wire score. KAY'S GRAY hustled
from outset and pressed the pace while rating close up in a two path pose, maintained that two path stance at upper stretch and was well within striking
distance but could not catch winner in final eighth. ROYALLY rallied for show after showing reserve in the opening half and travelling widest at upper stretch
while under urging. OKLAHOMA LINE lacked a rally after giving chase from second flight and trekking the three path throughout. T BRADY failed to menace
from a back rated pose. MAJESTIC THUNDER tucked to save ground and tired in the end.

EURO STEP settled into second flight shortly after the start, travelled widest of all around the opening bend, circled rivals along the backstretch, was on the
outside of frontrunner at upper stretch, then bested that rival in the stretch duel for the win. FINAL DESIGN trekked three wide through the first turn,
pressing the early pace, gained command midway along the backstretch, had a slight advantage at upper stretch while trekking the inside, but was
outdueled in the final eighth by EURO STEP. AMERICA'S DARLING trailed the field in the early strides, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch,
trekked the two path at upper stretch and proved to be best of rest in the end. FATEFULLY YOURS faded in the crucial stages after flashing foot and
leading the field through the first two calls while saving ground. BRIGHTEST gave good chase but was of mild menace in outcome. MIX AND MINGLE tired
in final strides after establishing a two path track and pressing the early pace.

TRISTANS JOURNEY loomed mid pack in the early strides, travelled widest of all around the first bend, gained command at upper stretch and finished
under a stiff drive for the score. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME pressed the early pace from a three wide pose through the opening turn, led at the conclusion of
backstretch, but was unable to match strides with eventual winner in final furlong. PICKLE SNAPPER tucked behind early front runners to save ground, was
given the cue along the backstretch, forced to check nearing the five sixteenths pole, then rallied on to earn the show. VISONARY STAR travelled widest of
all through both turns and finished willingly. ZIONITE lacked a response and tired in late strides after pressing the early pace from a two path stance.
BACKSTAGE BUD failed to threaten after giving chase from a back rated stance and tracking the four path at upper stretch. SAINT LEVI rushed from outset
and assumed early command, led the field along the backstretch, then stumbled and lost rider near the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SWEET SHELIA settled in patiently in the opening quarter, closed the gap on pacesetter along the backstretch, forced the issue from a two path stance
nearing the quarter pole, was given the cue around the closing turn and finished under a stiff drive to secure the win. JOLLYVILLE tucked behind the early
pacesetter to save ground, methodically closed the margin on the leaders along the backstretch, then maintained that inside pose in final furlong while
rallying to earn the place. LILLY BELLE settled into mid pack and travelled the three path around the bends before rallying for the show. YOLONDA was
unhurried in the opening half while trekking the two path, was roused for run along the backstretch, and improved placing in the late going while gaining on
the leaders at the finish. OKIE ZIPIT flashed early foot and led the field through the opening half from a ground saving stance, then rapidly faded in the
closing portion of contest. SATURDAY SERVICE showed reserve in early stages, travelled wide and lost ground to front runners, then lacked a closing rally.
MS. WILD ARGUMENT tucked behind the early front runners and saved ground, lost touch with front runners along the backstretch, and lacked a late bid.
CHEROKEE ROSE pressed the early pace froma two path pose before retreating steadily in the latter half. ARKANSAS INVASION failed to menace while
on a wide journey.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S OUTLAW showed patience in the early going and rated mid pack through the opening turn, then began a rally nearing the quarter pole, circled the
leaders four wide at upper stretch and finished under stiff drive for the victory. OKIE UNION loomed boldly along the inside around the first bend, maintained
that line along the backstretch, then angled out to three wide at upper stretch and earned the place with closing kick. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER came away
behind all rivals, trailed the field through the first turn, was given a cue at top of backstretch, made a strong mid move, and kept on rallying in final furlong to
earn the show. WHIP rushed from outset to exchange command with MITCHAPALOOZA through the opening half, but failed to sustain the bid in final
quarter. MITCHAPALOOZA hustled from the break and established an inside stance, set the pace in tandem with WHIP through the opening half, but could
not last in the closing strides and rapidly retreated in the homestretch. BOLD IMAGE settled into mid pack in early going, advanced to lead the second flight
along the backstretch, then backed out of contention inside the quarter pole. SMOOTH OPERATOR chased from a wide stance and failed to threaten.
AWESOME THUNDER was unhurried from outset and failed to menace. RAINBOWS TREASURE was never involved. BAD BLUE steadily faded after
making an early bid from between rivals.

CASINO QUEEN rushed form outset, established a ground saving stance, and led at every call for a gate to wire score. COUNTRY DAISY broke alertly and
rated close up into the first turn while travelling the widest of all, stalked the frontrunner along the backstretch, had an inside stance at upper stretch and was
within striking distance, but couldnt catch the leader in final strides. RUNAROUND ROSEY settled behind the leaders in the early going, was forced to check
near the half pole, then advanced position by angling out along the backstretch, and finished evenly. YAK ATTACK came up empty in the crucial stages
after stalking the pace from between rivals and travelling widest at upper stretch. DON'T TOUCH MY MAN showed reserve through the opening half, then
altered paths inward at top of stretch to no avail. SANDY SANGRIA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ROCKETRINGO rushed form outset and established a comfortable lead on all rivals, then held off the late charging foes for a gate to wire score. VICTORY
STRIPE stalked the leader from a two path stance, and responded well to urging in closing strides to ern the place and be gaining on leader at finish. L. A.
FREEWAY settled into mid pack, trekked the two path in the early going and closed the journey with a rail rally for the show honors. TIMELY REPLY was
unhurried early nd trailed the field through the opening half before splitting rivals at upper stretch nd finishing with strong late strides to improve placing.
MALIBU MO came up empty after travelling widest early and advancing position along the backstretch with a mid move. STACCATO gave chase while
showing reserve through the opening half, rated three wide at upper stretch and finished willingly. SLEWA RED tucked into second flight and saved ground
around the bends, but needed more rally in the late going to improve placing. KIPPER faded rapidly in the final furlong after pressing the early pace from a
three wide stance. PROUD MOMENTS rated back shortly after the start, trekked the inside around the bends, nd failed to threaten. TUDORS CHARGE
chased the front runners as the widest of all rivals and tired in the end.
