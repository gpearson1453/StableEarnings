Footnotes
TANKINATOR moved clear in the two path, was engaged from his inside on the turn, bumped with that rival near midstretch and continued gamely to finish
on even terms.. BURN AND TURN slipped through inside on the turn, bumped with outside opponent in midstretch and finished gamely to share the
decision. SINASHACK chased outside off the pace and lacked a rally. HARBOR CROSSING stalked the dueling leaders in the two path and weakened. E
T'S DEUCES WILD raced wide off the pace early, moved inside on the turn and faded. PAID THE PREACHER dropped back at the start and was always
outrun. SIR STEELE lacked speed and weakened steadily.

DR. DEVERA'S WAY broke slowest, rushed to the lead inside and remained safe driving. BIG CITY RALPH led early off the inside, pursued the winner,
willingly but was no match. CHAMPERS urged close up inside, angled out in the stretch and finished evenly. DEVINE DENTAL prompted the leaders three
wide and was finished after a half mile. BOB'S MY UNCLE dropped back wide down the backstretch and faded steadily. WILD HAVEN chased at the back
of the pack inside and trailed throughout.

PRETTY SPECTACULAR took control inside then widened throughout under mild urging. ELIANA'S MISSION came out at the start, advanced, was taken
up near the quarter pole, recovered and was up for the place. INTERVENE roughed at the start, dropped far back then rallied extremely wide. HILLTOP
HONEY lagged far behind then offered some late energy. DERALDINE urged close up inside then began faltering on the turn. BLAZING DIVA lacked speed
then passed fading rivals. LEFTATTHEALTAR saved ground well off the leaders, bid briefly closer on the turn then proved empty. SWEET SAVAGE stalked
the pacesetters outside for half a mile and stopped. MISBEHAVING LADY raced wide down the backstretch and gave way. NIKKIS KITTEN prompted the
winner briefly then stopped abruptly.

MADAME ROUGE eased back on the first turn, was rated back, rallied and wore down the pacesetters in the final furlong. SOLEMN OATH prompted the
pace outside, led a sixteenth out but nailed. A RING THING edged to the lead before half a mile, led to midstretch but tired. SWEET SAMURAI reserved
early, bid wide on the final turn then flattened out. HOPE TAKES OVER saved ground well behind, swung very wide into the stretch. TILSA lacked speed
between rivals and failed to rally. OUI MADAME dropped far behind and was never a threat. MEGALOMANIA urged close up inside briefly then faltered.
TALE OF KITTEN lagged far behind then closed a small gap along the inside. MAGICAL MESA earned a narrow advantage inside early then came up
empty in the stretch. RISQUE'S JEWEL chased in midpack and stopped abruptly. SHES EUPHORIC dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

UNIMPEACHABLE pinched back early, rallied inside, was bumped soundly bumped at the eighth pole, recovered and was up in time. FORE HARP quickly
sprinted clear, maintained his lead to the final yards but was nailed. JUDICIAL MANDATE pursued the pacesetter in the clear, bumped the winner and tired.
BODE O lagged far behind outside and was never a factor. GO LIME dropped well behind and was never in contention. ASH OF MY ENEMY lagged far
behind then passed a stopping rival. RUFFY raced within striking range early and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BRUSHING settled inside, rallied outside in the stretch, was bumped late but continued gamely to get up in time. DIAMOND PLAY reserved off the leaders
inside, rallied to the front near midstretch, bumped the winner and was outfinished. FED POLICY lacked speed, awaited room on the final turn then closed
well when clear. SUPERLING far behind early, advanced wide on the final turn then flattened out. SWEET LILLY FACTUM stalked the pace, took over
before half a mile, led to midstretch then tired. FRISKY FEELING dropped far back then passed rivals too late. WEST HORIZEN swung very wide into the
stretch and faltered. VERRAZANO VITTORIA led along the inside then began fading after half a mile. MORISSETTE was urged along the rail and gave way
readily. WINGS OF FURY raced just off the pace outside to the final turn and stopped. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in
the stretch was quickly dismissed.

ALWAYS SUNSHINE broke a step slowly, advanced inside, angled out stretch and wore down the pacesetter and outfinished late inside challenge.
MIDNIGHTCHARLY lagged far behind, moved wide on the turn, bid inside through the stretch and just missed. ADMIRAL ABE set a pressured pace inside,
moved clear to midstretch then weakened slightly. TRINGALE prompted the pace outside and continued willingly to the finish. THISCATCANJUMP chased
near the inside and lacked a solid rally. BORRACHO was well placed outside pair of leaders then flattened out in the stretch. WENTZ raced wide off the
pace and gave way readily. MIDTOWNCHARLYBROWN chased within range in the two path and stopped.
