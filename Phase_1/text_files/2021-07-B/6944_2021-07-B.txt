Footnotes
ABBAA broke alertly, but was quickly headed, chased on the turn, bid near the 1/4 pole, lost ground at the top of the stretch but dug in, had command mid
stretch and drove clear. THOR'S THUNDER led quickly and moved clear, set the pace, was engaged late turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was
headed mid stretch and had to settle for place. GIZMO FLASH settled off the pace, closed along the rail into the turn, gained steadily to the stretch and
chased to the end. TWO TIMING raced from off the pace, chased hard along the rail through the turn and finished under a determined drive. LENCHES
GIMME raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished evenly.

Footnotes
PROLIFERATE pressed the pace, forced the issue into the far turn, bid approaching the top of the stretch, drove clear upper stretch and held sway.
O'KRATOS led early, set a pressured pace, quickened on the far turn, was engaged near the top of the stretch, dueled, was headed upper stretch and
chased to the wire. THE MIGHTY JUDGE raced in mid pack, was hustled on the far turn then finished gamely in vain. COURT BATTLE stalked the pace,
chased from the rail on the far turn then evened out in the final 16th. ARTISTICO settled in mid pack, was hustled three to two-wide on the far turn, chased
into the stretch and showed some interest while unable to menace. DRENA'S BULLET got away a step slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled three to
five-wide through the far turn but never reached contention. HALLIE'S HERO raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide through the far turn but lacked a
closing response. BLOCKBUSTER settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out.

Footnotes
JUNGLE GODDESS led quickly, set a pressured pace from the rail, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a drive. COCOTARA broke inward,
stalked the pace from the rail, was hustled on the turn and finished gamely. QUEEN BEACH raced in mid pack, angled out from just past mid turn, chased
four-wide into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. BEARTHESTORM pressed the pace, forced the issue on the turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out in the late stages. BORN TO BE GOOD raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and posted a
belated rally. DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE pressed then forced the pace, chased into the stretch and tired. PAPA'S SILVER raced in mid pack, was
squeezed in tight quarters between foes past mid turn, chased into the stretch and flattened out. BELLA LALOU was away slowly and settled off the pace,
closed two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. A BIT OF SUNSHINE bumped with SPARKISHA at the outset, stalked early, dropped
back four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SPARKISHA bumped at the outset, was hustled four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
AMALFI SKY led along the rail while stalked and pressed by two rivals, shook her pace buddies off and opened up a clear lead in upper stretch but had to
win a fortuitous head bob on the wire to garner the victory. IN MY OPINION was three wide between rivals chasing the trio of early leaders, came four wide
late turn and split the tiring pace retreaters by the eighth pole, closing furiously on the winner but losing the head bob. BIG GINGER between rivals on the
front end throughout, stayed on the winner's flank into the stretch but couldn't match that one's energy, passed for place at the sixteenth pole but held the
show spot determinedly. BAHIA GIRL brushed the gate at the start and trailed the field, came inside on the turn and found her best stride late in the two
path to get up for a minor award. RAVEN ECHO settled inside three rivals chasing the top trio down the backside and around the turn, in range of the winner
turning for home but was outkicked in the final furlong. CHASING SHADOWS had her head in the air at the start and moved up four wide chasing the early
leaders, moved up five wide on the turn before dropping back at the quarter pole, re-rallying down the stretch but never menacing for a share. ZIA MO
stalked and pressed the lead while three wide throughout, began to tire and drop back late turn and down the stretch. OZAYA broke slow before rushing up
between foes to chase the lead trio, suffered an injury midway on the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ADMONISH raced from off the pace, saved ground on both turns, bumped trying to make a path upper stretch, altered course when a hole came open and
surged to the lead under a drive. FANCYSOUL, in range, was hustled two and three-wide o the far turn, cut to the rail upper stretch, had command a furlong
out but failed to contain the winner in the late stages. KNEW AS A BREEZE, in range, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, lodged a bid a furlong out
but did not draw even then was outkicked in the late stages. SKY OF DREAMS was away slowly and settled in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the
far turn then finished gamely. ENDORPHIN RUSH raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, bumped with ADMONISH upper stretch,
was lugging in through the stretch and evened out in the late stages. ELUSIVE SOCIETY stalked the early pace, lapped onto the leader and forced the
issue on the turn, bid approaching the stretch, led quickly but was passed upper stretch and gave way. JOCASSEE was off slowly, settled in mid pack,
closed along the rail late backstretch, was blocked on the turn then lacked a closing response. HOLLYWOOD RING showed speed, led into the first turn, set
a reserved pace but was pressured on the far turn, entertained a challenge approaching the stretch but was headed and gave way. RELENTLESS RUBY
got away a step slowly and settled well off the pace, saved ground on the far turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY sprinted to the lead and moved clear, set the pace, widened at the top of the stretch and held sway under light handling. SARARENDA
raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn, was lugging in through the stretch but was able to hold the place position. MERINO WOOL settled
in mid pack, came through the turn moving from two-wide to the rail then rallied willingly between foes. SOMEONE ELSE showed brief speed, was taken
back to stalk the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn, ran into a wall upper stretch, got to the outside and rallied gamely. GEA lost her path just out of
the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn and continued to rally through the stretch. SADIE IRENE stalked briefly then was
taken back to mid pack, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn but evened out in the stretch. ONEZY'S DREAM broke outward and bumped
DAISY JANE leaving the gate, settled in range, rode the rail on the turn and chased through the stretch. DAD'S MISSY had brief speed then stalked the
pace, chased three-wide on the turn but her rally stalled in the stretch and she evened out. MISGUIDED PASSION was away slowly and off the pace, was
hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. DAISY JANE was bumped at the outset, stalked the pace, was steadied in tight
late turn then flattened out in the stretch.
