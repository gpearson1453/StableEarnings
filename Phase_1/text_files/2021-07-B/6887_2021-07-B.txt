BODACIOUS BLEND steadied at the start, off pace inside, moved up inside, rallied outside of WINTERTHUR through a long stretch drive, gradually wore
down that rival and drew clear late. WINTERTHUR vied two wide for the early lead, then took over and moved to the rail, shook free on the far turn, dug in
gamely on the rail in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. CELESTIAL DIVA vied inside for the lead, then pressed the pace in the two path, chased on
the far turn and tired. HER JUSTICE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. THIRSTY BOOTS raced off the pace, dropped back quickly on the far
turn, was eased late and walked off. CROSS THE MERSEY tracked inside, gave way, was eased on the far turn, pulled up and walked off, bled.
