BEAUX TOX pressed the issue up the backstretch three wide, challenged between foes while remaining in the three path turn, dropped to the inside late in
the bend, long stretch duel closest to the rail, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion at the wire. MY KIKI also never far back outside, narrowly held
the advantage while four wide through the turn, dueled through the length of the stretch, outgamed late outside the winner. MEAN AMERICAN fell gradually
back to trail the opening quarter after breaking with the field, came three wide for the drive, widest through the stretch in rallying for the show, not a threat to
the top two. LUCKY PRIORITY vied early along the inside, fell back off the top pair late in the turn, moved off the inside for the drive, went evenly to the
wire, caught late for the show. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT last to leave, failed to menace. TYPHOON ZING broke on top, vied in the two path, stopped in the
turn, finished well back.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN last away, moved up quickly to be clear toward the inside first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, remained clear in the two
path turning for home, held the runner up at bay late under steady handling. SWEET MILAGROS forwardly placed off the inside early, dropped inside with
seven sixteenths remaining, chased the winner into the stretch while saving ground, shifted to the outside past the furlong marker, no mate gain, clear
second. SUPER LEGS away in good order, raced closest to the winner off the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the final turn, flattened out in the
drive to finish best of the rest. MADISON'S WILD ONE settled well off the early pace, continued in even fashion in lacking a closing response. COSTA
SUGAR broke alertly, fell back the opening quarter and failed to menace. BREEZIN BYE YOU trailed throughout in showing little, well back at the end as
she was jogged in. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

POWERSHOT stalked the dueling leaders off the inside, came three wide and under pressure when advancing into the stretch, challenged outside the two
leaders past the furlong marker under a right handed crop, powered by. THE FLUSH KING away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a
larger advantage nearing the furlong grounds when putting the other speed away, proved no match for the winner late, well clear of the others. DA'MONEY
ALARM broke on top, alternated up front with the runner up outside that one, weakened a bit, remained comfortably clear of the others. FREUD WIND broke
back, raced off the pace while saving ground into and through the turn, went one paced through the lane. TORTUGA BAY settled off the pace and the
inside, failed to rally when called on for the drive. FULLY PERSUADED off a step slow, raced outside, four wide through the turn in trailing, continued to be
outrun through the stretch.

IZEONPOINT in the second flight while racing three wide through the first turn, patiently handled in the run up the backstretch, closer midway on the final
turn, tipped out four wide with a quarter remaining for home, lodged an outside bid when straightened for home, drove well clear. CAUGHT HIS EYE dueled
up front in the two path, was beginning to put away the other speed when confronted by the winner entering the stretch, proved no match for that one the
final furlong, saved the show. THINKING OF HER unhurried in the early going, moved closer in the three path midway on the final turn, failed to sustain that
advance through the stretch. NINE LINE BIND dueled up front closest to the inside, faltered when the real running began turning into the stretch.
MALARTACH last to leave, raced in the second flight closet to the inside, was finished after four furlongs. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT
WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
LUNDI broke well, sprinted clear into the first turn, long lead while under light restraint in rating up the backstretch, continued to hold a large lead into the
lane, kept to task with a steady left handed crop to the wire. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY settled off the pace, split foes when moving closer late in the final
turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clear of the others. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT last to leave, raced four wide through the first turn when well off
the pace, continued outside, four wide again through the second bend, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST chased the
winner for seven furlongs, had little left late in weakening to lose a couple of positions. WHEELS TURNING raced back off the pace and was never
dangerous. PROUD REDEMPTION settled in mid pack off the inside, weakened while three wide exiting the final turn. PRIORITY POINTS raced behind the
two leaders for a half, stopped in the far turn. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
LIGHTHAWK within striking distance in the two path, asked for run midway on the final turn, came three wide for the drive, long run to the finish, just up
outside. THREE RUN HOMER prompted the pace from the outside, challenged three wide bid midway on the final turn, dueled into the lane, showed the
way past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the wire while between rivals. GENTRIFIED void of speed, moved closer in some traffic second turn, split
foes outside a tiring leader and the runner with a furlong remaining when challenging, not enough late while inside the top two at the wire.
OUTOFTHISGALAXY pressed the early leader off the inside, dueled the middle half in the two path, dueled into the lane inside the runner up and began to
weaken. GREELEY'S DEALER last away, void of speed, roused four wide into the lane, made little impact in the run to the wire. IN CHARGE HALO broke
on top, cleared to the inside, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way turning for home. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT
WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

NATE'S ATTACK settled off the early pace toward the inside early, moved out midway up the backstretch, came three wide out of the final turn when
beginning to rally, closed with good resolve to be up in time. GRAND LUWEGEE took command in the three path through the first turn, showed the way up
the backstretch, shook well clear in the second turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker while drifting slightly, faltered in the final
strides to be nailed by the winner. BIG BOY DAVE REX four wide through the first turn when with the second flight, chased the leader in the run up the
backstretch while continuing off the inside, three wide into the lane, roused right handed, drifted out a bit past the furlong marker then came in to shut
TREYS MIDNITE MOON off with a sixteenth remaining, finished up flatly. SHAKE SOME ACTION chased the runner up early, fell back and went one paced
up the backstretch, moved a bit closer toward the inside turning for home, also finished up empty to narrowly hold the fourth spot. TREYS MIDNITE MOON
void of any early foot, improved inside of some rivals turning for home, traffic a furlong out, angled in, shut off 1/16, continued interest late. MCFEELY raced
in mid pack early, was finished after a half, trailed home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH,
BIG BOY DAVE REX WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED FIFTH. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND
TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY SON forwardly placed early toward the inside, pulled, bit rank with four furlongs to run in falling back a bit, advanced along the inside turning
into the stretch, moved out, split foes past the furlong grounds, finished willingly to be up in time. WAYFARING STRANGER moved up after the start to duel
along the inside, continued to alternate up front through the turn, disposed of the other speed to be clear by midstretch, could not contain the winner while
remaining clear for the place. SOUTHPINE GIFT in the second flight along the inside, moved out to be three wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick.
CAJUN UP within striking distance while three wide, continued in good position through the turn, came up empty for the drive. PRAY IDE SING broke
alertly, dueled up front outside the running up, gradually weakened in the drive. CAEUS IN PASADENA remained always back. ROSE'S GALAXY off a step
slow, raced back and outside, four wide turning for home, lacked a closing rally. MR. NASTY TIME finished early, trailed home.
