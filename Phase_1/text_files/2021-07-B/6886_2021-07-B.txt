Footnotes
LYRICAL GANGSTER attended the pace along the inside, got through to make his bid entering the stretch, tacked out and around the drifting TIJUANA
BRASS inside the sixteenth pole and was up in the final yards. TIJUANA BRASS tracked to the outside of HIGHLY NOTED to the second turn, forged
command and opened clear, drifted in through the drive and was unable to resist the winner. UNCLE ARMANDO was allowed to settle, tucked in to save
ground, got through and finished willingly to earn the show. HERCULES HARBOR broke in the air and was away behind his field, ranged into contention on
the outside, continued on well through a prolonged drive. KNOCKHOLT was forwardly placed three deep to the stretch and weakened. HIGHLY NOTED
opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the second turn, relinquished the lead but stayed on to inside the furlong marker, was put in tight when
TIJUANA BRASS came in, steadied and retreated thereafter. CARK came away a bit slow, settled saving ground, checked in the seven-sixteenths pole,
shifted out and made a belated improvement. MINT GAME passed only the tiring ones. WATCHTHEBOURBON contended between rivals to the second
turn and dropped out. FEISTY KITTEN contended along the inside to the second turn and stopped. FORMAL TREASURE failed to respond. Times omitted
pending review.

Footnotes
TASTING THE STARS was allowed to settle through early stages, sat patiently around the far turn, launched an inside bid at the head of the lane and drew
clear. FIONNBHARR raced off the early pace, hustled up four wide around the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, moved up into striking range but could
not reach the winner. URBAN FAIRYTALE stalked the top pair, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole then sustained a steady bid through the lane.
SWEET SANDY rated inside through early stages, steadied along the rail late on the final turn, bid into the lane but needed more for serious impact.
PETRICHOR vied inside through the backstretch, held a slim lead around the far turn then gave way. PRINCESS ADIRA raced off the early pace, saved
ground around the far turn, angled out in the lane and lacked a rally. PINK PEARL vied outside of rival through early stages, could not maintain equal terms
around the far turn and steadily weakened. NOT MY MONEY tracked the early pace, roused four wide around the far turn then weakened in the lane.
WOLVERETTE raced two wide around the far turn and failed to move on. ASSUME tracked the pace through the backstretch then faded in the lane.

PASSION PLAY hustled to the lead, never headed, always clear. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY traveled in third, rallied, proved second best. POINT OF GRACE
went unhurried early, produced a mild rally to gain third. CHESS CHIEF was never a threat. AIR TOKEN stalked the lead horse till the top of the stretch,
then faded. THE POSER was no factor, tired and dropped back.

GRATEFUL BRED raced in range through early stages, roused three wide around the turn, took command at the head of the lane and finished clear. SKY'S
NOT FALLING raced between foes around the turn, lacked racing room in the upper stretch, got through along the inside and produced a solid finish.
FLANK SPEED raced in the back, tipped three wide at the head of the lane and closed with response. SO STREET hustled up around the turn, swung five
wide into the lane and improved. GALE WINDS held a slim lead through early stages, vied inside around the turn, fought back in the upper stretch then gave
way. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF tracked along the rail around the turn, raced two wide into the lane and chased one evenly. GREAT CAMANOE pressed the early
pace, vied around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. DISTANT THUNDER saved ground and lacked a needed rally. SKY MAGICIAN raced up
close and chased around the turn then tired in the drive. HYPOTHESIS raced three to four wide and weakened around the turn.

GOLD FOR KITTEN opened clear and angled in to dictate terms, was collared nearing the furlong marker, dug in to meet the bid and held stubbornly.
DECIDING VOTE settled in hand, made a sweeping move four wide, came to level terms a furlong out, fought on hard but was unable to best the
determined winner. TURNSTONE shadowed the leader three deep to the stretch, weakened but hand enough left to preserve the show. DANCE RECITAL
was allowed to settle toward the inside, angled out entering the stretch and was making up some ground. BETHABARA was unhurried into stride, finished
with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN passed only the tiring ones. GLOBAL AMBITION was close up three wide
through the second turn and tired. VIBRANCY attended the pace along the inside to the stretch and dropped out. SPUN EAZY was never a factor.

Footnotes
LITIGANT quickly cleared and crossed over to the inside after the start, held firm over pursuers around the turn, vied outside of FORTUNE'S FOOL in the
lane, dug in gamely from the outside and prevailed. FORTUNE'S FOOL raced in contention along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, advanced to duel
inside of LITIGANT in the lane, dug in gamey and just missed. KADRI chased in range through early stages and sustained a two to three wide bid through
the lane. TRASHTALKINYANKEE race four deep up close around the turn, swung five wide into the lane and chased on evenly. PALATIAL TIMES saved
ground around the turn, angled three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ERAWAN raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and had no
impact. AUGUSTA MELODY chased three wide around the turn then gaveway. TOOBADSOSAD hustled along three to four wide around the turn and had
no response in the lane.

MY SWEET STORY was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued unhurried through the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the far turn, kicked in
gear between foes in the upper stretch, surged to the wire and got up in time. SLIP SLIDING AWAY stalked the leader through the backstretch, took over
the lead around the far turn, continued clear on top at the eighth pole then got edged out in final strides. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) raced off the early pace,
picked up the pace four wide around the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained show. MO NORMAL raced in range
through early stages, hustled up five wide at the head of the lane, raced in close contention then yielded in late stages. LIBERTY ISLE tracked the pace
through the backstretch, launched a bid around the far turn, raced two wide in the upper stretch then flattened out. FLANIGAN'S COVE raced in range
through early stages, hustled up two wide into the lane then gave way. LIKEHAIL settled through early stages, shifted five wide in the upper stretch and
failed to threaten. MAYBE LATER tracked the early pace, raced up close three wide around the far turn then ailed to keep pace in the lane. MY
DESDEMONA raced three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace and failed to move into contenton. SUNDAR raced three wide around the first turn,
rated through early stages and had no response when called upon. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE saved ground and had no late response. MY PHAROAH LADY
set the pace through the backstretch, got collared around the far turn then faded. Due to a timer malfunction times have been omitted pending review.
