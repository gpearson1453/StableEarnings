Footnotes
DEBT MONGER tracked duo two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, took aim three wide at the top of the stretch and drove past rivals
under a drive. VASTLY DEEP dueled inside rival on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn, bumped by rival in upper stretch and overtaken late by
outside closing rival while saving second. NATHANSMIMSY dueled outside of rival on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, drifted in and
bumped rival in upper stretch, outgamed in the stretch to be edged for second. LUCKY ROMANO stalked rivals along the inside, entered turn along the
inside, entered stretch in the three path, lugged out mid stretch and finished up with a mild rally four wide. GREAT POWER broke in, settled off the pace
along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn and launched a mild bid in the lane. ROCKIN MY MOJO showed solid early quickness, led early and
overtaken at the five sixteenths pole and showed little after.
