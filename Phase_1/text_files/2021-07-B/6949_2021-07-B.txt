Footnotes
WE ALL AGREE had speed outside YOUR RINGER early, cleared that rival at the seven-sixteenths, showed the way two wide through the turn, put to
right-handed urging in the lane, was under threat from YOUR RINGER in the final sixteenth and held on. YOUR RINGER pressed from inside, checked at
the seven-sixteenths, chased three to four wide into the stretch, put in a late bid and missed. I'M A GIRAFFE sandwiched between rivals at the start,
traveled outside a pair of rivals from off the pace, exited the turn three wide and kept on for the show. JACRODRA'S DEVIL broke out and bumped rival,
raced along the inside into the turn, came off the rail a bit then angled back in at the three-sixteenths and improved position in the lane. SEVEN EXES
veered in and bumped rival at the start, angled out in upper stretch and could not rally. BLAME IT ON ROSE got sandwiched at the start, raced between
early then then three wide leaving the turn and failed to threaten. AREEB chased three then two wide on the turn and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY,
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SEVEN EXES FROM FIFTH TO SIXTH FOR VEERING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO I'M A GIRAFFE,
BLAME IT ON ROSE, AND JACRODRA'S DEVIL AT THE START. THERE WAS ALSO AN OWNER'S CLAIM OF FOUL PLACED BY THE OWNER OF
YOUR RINGER AGAINST WE ALL AGREE FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED
THE VIDEO FAILED TO SHOW THAT WE ALL AGREE WAS AT FAULT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
OPTIMISTIC VALOR settled at the back early off the rail, advanced up the backstretch and far turn, angled three wide and rallied between into the stretch,
cleared at the eighth pole and inched away. MAN FRIDAY traveled near the back of the pack, angled out into the stretch and closed well for the place.
VANTAGE POINT forwardly placed in the beginning, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, vied between in upper stretch, could not go on with the top pair but
won the battle for third. STONE'S RIVER sped clear to set the pace, met the challenge from VANTAGE POINT on the far turn, vied with rivals along the
inside into the stretch, weakened late and got edged for the show. MUAY THAI (IRE) went three wide around the first turn, gained ground around the far
turn, bid four deep into the stretch but faltered in the furlong grounds. CUMBERLAND AVENUE traveled along the inside, crept closer up the backstretch
and far turn, cut the corner in the stretch and weakened. ENOUGH NONSENSE stalked in the two path around the first turn, went three wide into the far
turn, took an awkward step nearing the quarter pole then steadied between late on the turn and weakened. CAPPER settled off the pace, dropped back into
the second bend and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HONORARY DEGREE hustled from the gate, moved clear and set the pace early, opened up around the turn, kept to task with the right-handed and won
easily. UNION BLISS was off alertly, dropped back to chase outside rivals, exited the turn two wide between foes and bested the rest. SIR FLATTER broke
slow and threw his head at the start, trailed the field to the turn, saved ground along the inside, tipped out at the top of the stretch and finished willingly to
earn the show. TEST DRIVE chased four to five wide around the bend, five deep into the stretch and lacked a bid. EIGHT MAKAR coaxed early but fell back
well off the pace, went two wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and improved position. LITTLE MISCHIEF stumbled leaving the gate, chased from
inside to the stretch and weakened. VAPORIZED forwardly placed behind the lone leader, took the turn three wide, entered the stretch three deep and
weakened. THE ROAN RANGER broke well then chased the pacesetter outside a rival, went four wide through the turn and faded. MAD CATTER stalked
off the rail, between rivals into the turn, dropped back and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ORDER AND LAW hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the inside, vied for command through the second bend, took a short lead in upper stretch
and edged away to prove best. TAISHAN stumbled leaving the gate, stalked three wide early, vied three deep around the far turn, held a short lead into the
lane, was overtaken in upper stretch but stayed on well for second. AZUL COAST stalked from outside, bid four deep at the quarter pole, could not keep up
with the top pair in the final furlong and kept on to earn the show honors. BOLD ENDEAVOR set the pace outside ORDER AND LAW, battled between rivals
on the far turn, bumped with TAISHAN entering the stretch and flattened out in the late stages. FAMILY BIZ tracked the speed from inside, came off the rail
and entered the stretch four to five wide and weakened. UNION DANCE stalked in the two path, came three wide into the drive and lacked a rally.
SHADRACK bobbled at the start, trailed the field on the inside to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ROOKIE YEAR was up close early outside the top pair, vied three deep on the second turn, took over past the quarter pole, drifted inward in upper stretch
and powered away. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES was fractious in the gate, broke out, pressed from inside, launched a bid at the seven-sixteenths, led into the
far turn, battled into the stretch, could not go on with the winner and held the place. LAUNCH PAD stumbled and bumped with inside rival at the start,
tracked from inside, coaxed through the far turn, saved ground into the lane and got up for the show. MOUNT PELLIAR traveled four wide on the first turn,
four to five wide around the second bend and got outkicked for the show. CHASING FAME stalked the pace in the two path, pulled at the five-eighths pole,
remained in the two path on the far turn while being ridden along and could not offer the needed response in the lane. MAN ON THE MOON broke out,
traveled six then five wide on the first turn, remained wide up the backstretch, stayed five to six wide on the second bend and failed to menace. LANGUAGE
BARRIER off a bit slow to begin, went four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, entered the stretch three wide and could not rally. TRIBAL NATION
bumped outside rival at the start, drifted out nearing the first turn, set the pace under pressure from inside, battled around the far turn, could not keep pace
into the stretch and tired. TWILIGHT RIDER went five wide into the first turn, angled down to the three path around the bend, navigated the second bend
two then three wide, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
LIEUTENANT DAN dueled for command from inside, maintained a short lead through the turn, shook free in upper stretch and remained clear to the wire.
THANKS MR. EIDSON stalked the leaders on the inside, saved ground into the drive, finished willingly and bested the rest. DISTANT VISTA (IRE) stalked
the top pair in the two path entering the turn, tipped three wide exiting the turn and finished evenly in the final furlong. COMMANDER (FR) raced off the
pace, angled from the two path to the four path on the turn, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. FIGHT ON trailed the field in the early
stages, came out into the stretch and improved position. CITRUS BURST tracked outside a rival early, angled to the rai on the turn and never threatened.
TILTED TOWERS was unprepared with his head turned to the left at the start, chased outside rivals then three wide around the turn and could not rally.
RAGER settled along the inside, checked earl on the turn, lacked room mid-stretch, gained a clear path but was too late. LOVE MY JIMMY dueled outside
the winner into and around the turn, lost contact in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
I'M SO ANNA broke in and bumped TEDDY'S BARINO at the start, dueled outside that rival into and around the turn, battled down the stretch and edged
away in the final sixteenth. TEDDY'S BARINO got bumped by I'M SO ANNA at the start, dueled inside that rival early, battled around the turn and through
the stretch but was outkicked in late stages. CLOSING REMARKS chased along the inside into the turn, exited two wide, brushed with rival in upper stretch,
kept to task and gained ground late. FI FI PHAROAH was off slow to begin, steered out early, went three then four wide on the turn, produced a mild rally
and earned a minor award. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stumbled leaving the gate, tracked outside rivals, traveled four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, brushed
with CLOSING REMARKS in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. RESPECTFULLY settled off the rail, angled in on the turn and failed to rally.
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE chased off the inside, went between foes at the five-sixteenths and also lacked a rally. JOYMAKER stalked the top pair off the
inside, traveled three deep at the five-sixteenths, checked approaching the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
WILDER THAN MOST showed early speed then had to check between rivals leaving the first turn, stalked between rivals up the backstretch, rallied inside
and gained command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. EAGLE IN THE SKY chased off the inside, came under coaxing on the far turn, got bumped
while five wide entering the stretch, bid outside the top pair and had the rider lose the whip at the sixteenth pole and continued willingly for the place.
DONNER LAKE went three or four wide around the first turn, went up for the lead three or four deep leaving the first turn, chased outside the leader to the
far turn, challenged into the lane, cleared briefly in upper stretch but got outkicked by the top pair. AUSPICIOUS STYLE stalked the leader on the inside to
the stretch and lacked the necessary bid. CLUB MESQUITE was off slow to begin, settled inside, steadied briefly past the three-eighths pole, kept inside to
the stretch and failed to rally. HARBOR SKY tracked between rivals then three wide into the stretch, came out and bumped rival at the sixteenth pole and
improved position. LARRY'S LEGEND sped to the front, vied with rivals leaving the first turn, cleared briefly at the nine-sixteenths before being pressured
again, was ridden along through the far turn, maintained a short lead into the stretch and weakened. TALKLESSWORKMORE was off slow to begin, sat off
the pace, angled five wide while advanced on the far turn but flattened out in the stretch. HENCHMAN hopped at the start to come away slowly, saved
ground into the stretch and was never a factor. TIGER'S ARROW was off slow to begin, angled to the inside early, exited the far turn two wide, lacked room
in upper stretch, angled out, got bumped by inner rival and checked at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out. NEW SOI PHET unhurried through the early
going, went two or three wide around the far turn and failed to menace. REALLY BIG NEWS came away a bit slow, went five wide around the first turn,
angled out and bumped rival entering the stretch, lost path in upper stretch and weakened.
