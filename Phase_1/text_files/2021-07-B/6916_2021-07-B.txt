DREAM TO WIN unhurried, closed willingly five wide into the stretch, dug in later and won under strong handling. NATIVE VALLEY trailed into the far turn,
slipped through along the inside to make the lead at the top of the stretch, shook clear then couldn't handle the winner. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE close up from
the start near the inside, altered course four wide entering the stretch then was outfinished. HOPES AND PRAYERS chased the pace into the far turn,
loomed boldly two wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. BATI BATI made the lead soon after the start, set the pace for six furlongs then
weakened. BIONIC ROSIE was through after a half.

three wide nearing the top of the stretch then leveled off. FRANCO trailed for a half, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. FLATTER ME PLEASE with the
