Footnotes
REEL EM IN stalked from outside going five then four wide on the turn, struck the lead late on that bend edging clear into upper stretch, held sway.
SMOOTH BLUES attended the early pace from inside, eased off the leaders leaving the backstretch, moved off the inside to go two wide on the turn, kept
on in the lane to secure the place. POOF HE'S GONE was bumped and slightly steadied at the start, switched out and rapidly advanced between foes
heading up the backstretch, contended for the lead four then three wide on the turn, flattened out in the lane. ANXIOUS INDIAN bumped the outer rival at
the start, raced just in behind the leaders to the turn going three wide into that bend and moving out five deep, carried on evenly. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER
vied between runners early, dropped back moving out from two to three wide on the turn and continued to weaken gradually. BOB'SALLWICKED bumped
the inside foe at the start, was up close in behind the leaders inside early, dropped back leaving the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the quarter
pole, and ran on. CINDYS CHIME vied between rivals early, went three wide into the turn, lost ground on the leaders and shifted in to the rail about the
five-sixteenths, came up empty. WILD FIREWATER had bumps on both sides at the break, raced well back going two to four wide on the turn before
swinging out eight deep turning for home, lugged out a further two paths in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CLABBERS WIN exchanged a bump at the
break, switched out up the backstretch, went three to five wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HENRY ON THE RUN settled outside the second flight, moved five then four wide on the turn, struck the lead at the eighth pole and was quickly clear, held
under steady handling. HOT CHARLIE stalked the early pace, advanced inside the pacesetter but off the fence to take the lead at the three-eighths, was
clear racing in the two path on the turn, overtaken at the head of the lane but kept on to save the place. RISKY REVENGE stalked mid-pack up the
backstretch, angled in at the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, angled out at the furlong marker within striking distance, missed the place.
ATTILA'S FLAG bumped the inside rival at the start, settled toward the back, went four wide on the turn, angled outside foes seven deep nearing the latter
part of that bend, gained late. ILIKEROLLIN settled outside toward the back early, began to pick it up five then six wide on the turn and continued to gain.
NO DOUBT was urged forward after breaking just a hair tardily, chased two to three wide, came up empty. PUB was bumped between rivals at the start,
went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. INDIAN DRAGON exchanged contact with the aforementioned at the start, went in the two path on the turn
and failed to threaten. KEY TO THE CITY set the pace from off the rail, went three wide on the turn, dropped back and faded. LOPIN JOE lacked early
speed, went in the four to five path on the turn, was not a factor. BENITO CHICO was forwardly-positioned tracking the leader, began to drop back four to
five wide on the turn, faded.

Footnotes
ZAMARA prompted from outside, went four wide on the turn, met the bid of an outside challenger in upper stretch, turned back that rival and held sway
while being kept to the task. FLYIN FALYNN settled off the leaders, advanced four to five wide on the turn making a brief and mild bid in upper stretch but
could not match strides. LITTLE SAMURAI tracked in behind going in the three path on the turn and coming four wide into the lane, kept on evenly.
AMEERAH B was bumped at the break, shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved ground inside then two wide on the turn and improved position. IZE A
CRAFTY GAL was close up racing off the inside early, contended between foes into the turn, weakened thereafter. PINK SKY bumped a rival then veered in
and steadied at the start, was encouraged forward inside to vie for the lead, dropped back and faded.

ONE MARK stalked early, commenced a bid three to four wide on the turn taking the lead outside the furlong marker, was soon clear and held sway under
just mild urging. RIGHT JAB settled mid-pack, advanced two wide on the turn, gained the place inside. B A CHAMPION raced outside the winner early, lost
some ground five wide on the turn but regained striking distance turning for home before evening out. MR. MCFEELY set the pace racing just off the rail,
went in the two path on the turn, was overtaken at the head of the lane and weakened. TAB ME OUT settled early, saved ground inside on the turn, came
out in upper stretch and ran on mildly. BAKERS CHOICE broke in and steadied at the start, raced well back two to three wide on the turn shifting in late on
that bend, gained mildly inside in the lane. SANDIA'S BEST was forwardly-placed in the early going, dropped back on the turn shifting in from five to three
wide and came up empty. BRIEF WHO was well back early, went in the four path on the turn and failed to rally. ALEXANDER WHO was mid-pack up the
backstretch into the turn, dropped back four wide on that bend and came up empty. U S N CADEN was outrun racing off the inside.
