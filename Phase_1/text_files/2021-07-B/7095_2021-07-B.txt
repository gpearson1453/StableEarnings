Footnotes
GET HAMMERED dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, took over while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch, and drew off down the lane, much the best. NIGHT THINGS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the
outside, began to improve position while racing wide around the turn, swung out to the five path entering the stretch and gained ground steadily on the
outside while proving to be no match for the winner. ITS MY BAG BABY raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
and made a mid gain of ground in late stretch. DARK NINJA chased the frontrunners up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path,
began a mild bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and was outkicked in the final sixteenth of a mile. LASTCHANCEATGLORY raced in the middle of the
pack in the opening stages, came around the turn in the three and four path, swung wide entering the stretch and weakened on the outside in the final
furlong. CHANGE DIRECTION dropped back to trail far behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never involved. DIVE
DEEP dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and tired entering the
stretch.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME set a well rated pace inside, increased his lead when hand ridden in upper stretch, went to a drive near the furlong pole, and held gamely
as CAN'T HIDE FROM ME descended late. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME settled between horses in the rear group through the clubhouse turn, raced at the rear
of the compact field down the backstretch, inched closer between horses around the far turn, was taken four wide in upper stretch and put to a drive, found
his best stride inside the furlong mark, rallied strongly but missed. CROCE D'ORO stalked the pace outside of ONE WAY HOME, put mild pressure on him
entering the backstretch, continued in close range through the backstretch and two wide on the far turn, was no match for that foe into the lane, could not
match the kick of CAN'T HIDE FROM ME into the final furlong but chased on best of the rest. CHRISTIAN C settled three wide in the rear group around the
first turn, continued outside of DEANO near the rear of a tight group down the backstretch, kept on three wide toward the rear around the far turn, was
driven three wide into the lane, chased ONE WAY HOME though lost ground on him as he cleared from upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong.
DEANO hopped at the start and was slow to leave the gate, settled at the inside of the rear group through the clubhouse turn, continued inside toward the
rear of a closely packed field down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, was driven inside into the lane and had no rally.

Footnotes
SEVEN SEVENTEEN raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began an inside bid nearing the
quarter pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and won going away under a drive. HOOSIER GOLD CASE chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up
to challenge from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled on the outside in upper stretch, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and
chased that rival home. CATNIP KITTEN trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the three path and gained
ground between horses in late stretch. TEMRIK broke quickly and showed early speed to open up on the field while racing up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while saving ground around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. ANGEL'S RUN raced off the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, improved position mildly in upper stretch and flattened out from there. CLOSE TO ME tracked the
leaders on the inside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path headed into the turn, flattened out entering the stretch and continued to
tire down the lane. REJOICE AN BE GLAD raced outside in the middle of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) tracked the leader, began to prompt outside of her past the five eighths, vied outside of her while racing in the three to four
path on the far turn, continued to dispute terms in the leading flight in upper stretch, was driven to the lead for good at the furlong mark and kept finding
enough to hold SLIME QUEEN at bay. SLIME QUEEN tracked the leading pair inside, saved ground while still just behind the leading pair through the
clubhouse turn, bid inside of CAROLINE'S STORY into upper stretch, kept on inside but could not get past ELKE DO JAGUARETE inside. COMMAND
POINT chased toward the rear, continued patiently down the backstretch and in the three path into the far turn, began to rally near the five sixteenths,
chased in range behind the leading line past midstretch, lacked the late kick to reel in the top two late but kept on evenly through the final furlong to prove
best of the rest. CAROLINE'S STORY cleared into the clubhouse turn, was prompted by ELKE DO JAGUARETE past the five eighths, vied inside that foe
while racing in the two to three path on the far turn, was confronted by SLIME QUEEN on the inside while continuing to vie on the pace in upper stretch, was
headed for good at the furlong mark and flattened out. INDICIA settled at the rear, continued at the rear in the four path around the far turn, was driven four
wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. CHROME ATTACK tracked the leading pair three wide through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the
leading pair outside of SLIME QUEEN down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, raced four wide into the lane, but came up empty.
GRAMERCY raced keenly into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair between horses around the clubhouse turn, settled behind the tracking flight into
the backstretch, began to lose ground compared to the leading flights while racing in the two path on the far turn, was driven inside into the lane and proved
empty. PRINCESS CORA settled in second last through the clubhouse turn, raced in the rear flight outside of INDICIA down the backstretch, continued in
the rear flight in the five path into the far turn, stopped at the five sixteenths, was eased down the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SAVAGE was reluctant to load, broke well and raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path,
swung wide entering the stretch to began an outside bid, and gained ground down the lane to pull clear in the final furlong. IGNITED chased the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, raced into traffic and was forced to check hard near the eighth pole, swung out to find racing
room, and came on again to gain ground to the wire. COCO BRAVADO hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late. AMANOFMYSTATURE raced off the pace on
the inside early, saved ground around the turn, raced into traffic and steadied slightly near the eighth pole and finished evenly from there. STORMIN EL
PRADO chased the frontrunners on the outside in the opening stages, launched an outside bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, raced in
contention in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. MEDAL OF FACT hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and improved position mildly in upper stretch while never threatening. UPBEAT MELODY dueled for the
lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and faded on the rail in the stretch. KOSHER COWBOY
dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and tired between horses in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HAWK OF WAR saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing
the three eighths pole, dueled between horses down the lane and gamely wore down his rivals to get up in late stretch. GATE CREW chased the leaders
from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up from the two path around the far turn, split horses with a bold move
entering the stretch, and dueled gamely down the lane while drifting out late to get caught near the wire. RELMBUNKUS SYR raced in the two path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, began to improve position while racing around the far turn, entered the stretch in the four path and
raced evenly in the stretch, getting outfinished in the final sixteenth of a mile. TEXAS GANO saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside
up the backstretch, swung wide while gaining ground around the far turn, entered the stretch in the five path, continued to improve position in upper stretch
and was outkicked late, the best of the rest. MCRAGS raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening. GROOM LAKE bore out slightly leaving the gate,
angled over to duel for the lead in the two path around the first turn, took a slight lead while racing on the outside up the backstretch, continued to duel from
the two path around the far turn and faded in the stretch. CREATIVE LETTERS dueled for the lead on the inside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued to battle from the rail around the far turn and tired entering the stretch.

outside of THREE AMIGOS to make a bid into the lane, drove to the lead at the furlong mark, and ran clear in the final sixteenth. NIP N TUCK chased inside
of LASTEN IMPRESSION early, continued patiently near the rear of the main pack in the three path on the turn, swung out eight wide to upper stretch,
responded with vigor when driven, gained outside horses all the way down the stretch and got up for place in the final jump. THREE AMIGOS (FR) led early,
was prompted by MOON FLASH into the turn, continued to take pressure from that one while setting the pace in the two path on the turn, was confronted by
MAJOR WAGER in upper stretch, was headed by that foe near the furlong mark. kept in close range until beginning to flatten out near the furlong mark, and
lost the place at the finish. MACHO CLASSIC tracked the leading flight outside of MAJOR WAGER, was pushed along to keep up and track the leading trio
while positioned three wide on the turn, swung out six wide under a drive in upper stretch, proved no match for the top three, but rerallied mildly to regain
fourth position late. TOUSSAINT was slow into stride, raced in the rear pair inside of CLEAR TO CLOSE early, continued toward the rear in the four to five
path on the turn, went to a drive into the lane, dropped toward the inside in upper stretch, improved position mildly two wide but was outkicked for fourth.
LASTEN IMPRESSION raced toward the rear early, improved to midpack into the turn, chased two wide around the bend, swung seven wide into upper
stretch, and passed tiring horses. CARSON RULES chased midpack inside, was driven inside into the lane, lacked the needed kick and weakened late.
MOON FLASH was forward outside early, prompted outside of THREE AMIGOS into the turn, pressed the pace in the three path around the bend, proved
no match for THREE AMIGOS into the lane, and weakened four to five wide. CLEAR TO CLOSE settled in the rear pair outside of TOUSSAINT early, was
outpaced in the two path on the far turn, was driven into the lane but offered no rally.
