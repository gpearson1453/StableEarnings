Footnotes
SOMEKINDAFUHRY skimmed the fence to stretch, angled out, split foes late to be up in time under a heady ride. NOPICKINONCHARLIE well placed, off
rail to far turn, short lead late, run down. EL MEZCALITO sprinted clear from outside into first turn, faltered from inside. TEQUILA FLATS unhurried early,
outside run past quarter pole, leveled off late. BELTON AVE very rank start, raced back with no response when needed. MY TICKET bobbled at the start,
trailed to far turn, came into stretch on the wrong lead and seemed to dislike the surface while never a factor. HOWIE'S ANGEL chased leader to far turn,
gave way readily in the stretch. STORMY TREASURE through after half.

GRIZABELLA saved ground perfect position, rally into the stretch up in the final stride under good handling. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER sharp to the front,
stayed clear to deep stretch, run down late. CALI DREAM lunged at the start, far back to the stretch, shifted out rally. TIZ WHAT pressed early on, chased
leader to far turn, weakened late. VALLEY OF MO'ARA unhurried early, ran on far turn with a rail run in the stretch. RIPROARING far back to five sixteenth
pole improved position with mild gain. CIRCUS RINGS raced evenly with no response when needed. DRILLIT good position outside to the stretch run,
wilted in the drive. WINE ME UP BABY reared at the start, lost best chance, rushed, used up, empty.

Footnotes
DANEFIELD loped along on the front end, well handled, challenged, rebroke in a game effort. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN raced off rail while close to leaders,
tried hard, stayed game. DIRECT DECEIT raced evenly from inside with no late kick in the stretch run. SAMMY DA BULL far back to the stretch, rallied
outside to improved position. FUNNEL CAKE raced evenly, failed to fire when called upon. MOBIL SOLUTION failed to menace. ROSCO P. COLTRANE
chased pace to far turn, gave way readily in the stretch run. INSPIRED TO ROCK never a real menace. PAT'S KARMA inside trip with little response when
needed. BLANDA always outrun.

Footnotes
LITTLE LUCERITO broke sharp, waited inside quarter pole, rallied up rail, all out to prevail. SONNET tracked to the turn, outside bid into stretch but gamely
outfinished while clearly second best. DING DING speed to the front, led to deep stretch, cleared, run down late. CHINKARA broke slow, far back to stretch,
rallied up rail to improve late. ALL FOR SHOW slow break, rushed to turn, emptied out in the stretch. WHAT'S SO FUNNY broke slow, never prominent
while widest into stretch. C J 'S CAT FIVE inside trip, saved ground to no avail. HAPPYPLACE no speed to turn, floated out wide with no rally in the stretch.
MARIPOSA RAPIDA broke a bit tardy from the gate, hustled along with no response.
