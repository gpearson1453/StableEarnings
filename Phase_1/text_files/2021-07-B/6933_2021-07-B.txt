Footnotes
SUPERSTAR DIVA showed early speed to win the early duel and lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and drew off under a drive. FIRST SQUADRON stumbled slightly leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the
turn and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. TINDERELLA chased the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, began a mild bid from
the two path passing the three eighths pole and weakened in the stretch. MOUNTAIN MELODIES dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch and
around the turn, raced in the two and three path from there, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. KENAI COOL stalked the leader on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the path and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
VARSITY FLYGIRL broke sharply to the lead, set the pace inside under a hold down the chute and the backstretch, continued to make the running while
saving ground through the turn, unperturbed as GODSGIFT loomed to her outside past the three eighths, opened up when pushed along into upper stretch,
raced under a drive from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth, and held well clear while hand ridden through the final sixteenth. GODSGIFT tracked the
leader outside of SPECIAL CONQUEST, was pushed along to stalk two wide around the bend, loomed outside of VARSITY FLYGIRL from the three eighths
to the quarter pole, proved no match for that one when driven in upper stretch, but kept on evenly late to prove second best. OXBOW'S RUBY settled at the
rear of a compact field down the chute, settled further back behind her three foes into the backstretch, continued at the rear in the three to four path on the
far turn, swung into the lane in the six path under a drive, and chased on past a tiring horse while drifting out in the lane. SPECIAL CONQUEST broke last,
advanced keenly early to join the tracking flight inside of GODSGIFT, raced in that tracking flight down the backstretch, did not join that foe taking closer
order with the leader into the turn, chased that pair along the rail on the turn while driven from near the three eighths, floated into the four to five path in
upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
KEARNY COUNTY trailed the field from the three path around the first turn, began to improve position while racing up the backstretch and around the far
turn, swung out to the four path entering the stretch, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. FORT RIDGE raced
in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole and chased the
winner home, the best of the rest. TALE OF THE NILE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, dueled on
the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. CALL THE COLONEL saved ground around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was outkicked from there. DRIVER DAN
dueled for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and tired entering
the stretch. ALLEGIANCE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced into traffic and steadied slightly entering the first turn, raced off pace
in the two path through the opening half mile, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and was eased down the lane.

RANK AND FILE settled toward the rear inside of JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL early, chased while saving ground around the turn, began a bid from near the five
sixteenths, angled two wide near the quarter, reeled in the leader under a drive in upper stretch, took the lead approaching the furlong pole, and held sway.
JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL bobbled in the opening strides, settled toward the rear outside of RANK AND FILE for the backstretch run, continued near the rear of
a compact field two wide on the turn, was driven between horses into the lane, offered a rally but ultimately proved second best. APOLLO U ANYWHERE
was hustled to the lead, set the pace while clear down the backstretch and while saving ground around the turn, could not hold off RANK AND FILE
approaching the furlong marker, tired late but salvaged the show under a drive. GO STORMIN GIRL was bumped between horses in the opening strides,
settled at the rear, saved ground around the turn and into the lane, passed tiring horses under a drive in upper stretch, continued to chase on while angling
two wide midstretch, and just missed the show. U. S. CURRENCY broke outward and bumped GO STORMIN GIRL in the opening strides, tracked the
leader down the backstretch, was pushed along two wide to keep the pacesetter in her sights around the turn, flattened three wide into the lane and came
up empty thereafter. WOKE UP TO ACES broke in and bumped GO STORMIN GIRL in the opening strides, tracked the pacesetter outside of U. S.
CURRENCY down the backstretch and while racing three wide on the turn, flattened out four wide into the lane and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
KING TITO led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held his margin to the wire
under a drive. FLASHY RICHIE was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing
in the two and three path around the turn and continued to gain ground between horses down the lane. BURL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked late.
GIVIN UP NONE settled on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the
final furlong. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY chased the leaders between horses early, raced in the two path around the turn and faded entering the stretch. BEE
HAPPY ATTACK pressed the pace on the outside early, dropped back to chase the leader approaching the half mile pole, began to loose ground while
racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
BATTLE CREEK settled toward the rear, took closer order past the eleven sixteenths and chased midfield, tracked the leading trio in the two path on the far
turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, took the lead four wide just past the furlong mark, and held RED FLAG ALERT at bay under a drive. RED
FLAG ALERT tracked the leader inside of WESTWARD LOOK through the first turn, tracked the leading pair past the three quarters, bid three wide into the
far turn, vied three wide outside the leading flight around that bend, swung six wide into the lane, into the lane, led briefly past the furlong mark but was
almost immediately headed by BATTLE CREEK to his inside, chased with continued interest but found himself outkicked. TOWN AGENDA settled at the
rear inside, took closer order down the backstretch inside of WAR LANCE, saved ground in the rear flight on the far turn, was driven inside into the lane,
angled three wide midstretch, sustained his rally, proved no match for the top two but outgamed WHITE MIST for the show. WHITE MIST chased midpack,
took closer order three wide approaching the half mile mark, tracked the leading flight in the four path on the far turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch,
kept on earnestly four wide but was outfinished for the place. WAR LANCE tossed his head at the break and came away slowly, settled near the rear though
the first turn, took closer order down the backstretch, raced in the three path outside of TOWN AGENDA around the far turn, was outkicked four wide in
upper stretch, and passed a pair of tiring foes late. WESTWARD LOOK tracked the pace outside of RED FLAG ALERT through the clubhouse turn, lightly
prompted FRONTIER CHARLIE down the backstretch, bid outside that foe into the far turn, vied between horses around that bend and into the lane, and
came up empty two wide just past the furlong mark. FRONTIER CHARLIE cleared into the clubhouse turn, continued to set the pace with mild prompting by
WESTWARD LOOK down the backstretch, was engaged in earnest by that foe and RED FLAG ALERT into the far turn, vied at the inside of the leading
flight around the far turn and into the lane, kept on in upper stretch under a drive, but emptied out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SMACK pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn, moved up to duel on the outside while racing up the backstretch and around the turn,
entered the stretch in the three path, and drew off down the lane under a drive. ZANDREA'S hopped up leaving the gate, raced into traffic and checked
headed into the first turn, raced inside through the next half mile, tracked the leaders from the two path around the far turn, and chased the winner down the
lane. WINDY CITY GIRL hopped up and was pinched back at the start, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back
of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and gained ground between horses late.
NORTHERN ALLIANCE raced into traffic and steadied slightly entering the first turn, continued to race in close quarters in the two path from there, settled
off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail nearing the three eighths pole, swung out to find room in the three path
entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside from there. APRIL'S GEM raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and finished evenly. EYE ON THE FINISH raced in
the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened
between horses in the stretch. WHITE LIES led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch,
began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there. SIMPLY FAST saved ground around the first turn, trailed the
field up the backstretch, made up some ground while racing in the two path around the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DRAFT CAPITAL tracked the leading pair through the first turn, stalked three wide just behind the leading pair down the backstretch, loomed three wide
approaching the half, bid to take the lead into that bend, led in the two path around the turn, was confronted by MR. UNIVERSE approaching the quarter,
shook that foe off when driven in upper stretch, and ran on well clear to the wire. MR. UNIVERSE was lightly bumped by JOE FRAZIER in the opening
strides, soon trailed, improved position past the three quarters to join outside of SMOKEY HARBOR toward the rear of the pack, continued to inch closer,
was three wide midfield by the half mile mark, continued to advance three wide into the turn, loomed outside of DRAFT CAPITAL approaching the quarter,
proved no match for that foe from upper stretch but chased on willingly to prove best of the rest. OH SAY (IRE) chased two wide through the clubhouse turn
and down the backstretch, continued three wide around the far turn, kept on two to three wide on the turn, and proved best of the rest while never seriously
threatening the top pair. HAPPY AMERICAN tracked the leading pair inside through the clubhouse turn, tracked in the pocket behind the leading trio down
the backstretch, was shuffled back into the far turn as other foes began to make bids outside, saved ground around the far turn, was driven inside in upper
stretch, and chased on mildly inside. JOE FRAZIER broke out and bumped MR. UNIVERSE lightly in the opening strides, settled near the rear through the
clubhouse turn, was relegated to the rear into the backstretch as MR. UNIVERSE commenced his rally, continued patiently in the two path on the far turn,
and passed tiring horses two wide in the lane. SMOKEY HARBOR chased inside around the clubhouse turn, raced toward the rear into the backstretch as
the front ranks compacted, continued two wide into the rear flight into the far turn, offered a mild bid four wide on the far turn, swung out toward the center of
the track for the stretch drive and lacked the needed finishing kick. NO QUE NO cleared into the clubhouse turn, took pressure from BOCA BOY into the
backstretch, was headed into the far turn, flattened out to midpack between horses around that bend, and continued to weaken between horses into the
lane. BOCA BOY tracked the leader around the clubhouse turn, advanced to press outside of NO QUE NO into the backstretch, took a momentary lead into
the far turn but was almost immediately overtaken by DRAFT CAPITAL, was urged to keep pace with that foe and MR. UNIVERSE while saving ground
around that bend, but flattened out between horses in the lane.
