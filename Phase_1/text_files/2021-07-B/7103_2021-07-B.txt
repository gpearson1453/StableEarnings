Footnotes
MISS LEARJET rated outside the early leader, was let out on the turn, bumped as REPEAL came out upper stretch, quickly moved past the latter and
opened up under a drive the last eighth. REPEAL was sent to a clear early lead well off the inside, saved ground taking the bend, began to gradually drift
out under left-handed pressure as she was challenged from outside, bumped MISS LEARJET, continued to slowly drift after the latter passed but was
clearly second best. MIKAYLA ATTACK trailed, had the inside on the bend, got through along the rail with two furlongs left, moved clear for third upper
stretch as she gained a striking position but leveled off in the late going and could only hold her position. HOMETOWN PROSPECT reluctant to load, was
away somewhat slowly once the race began, raced in contention from inside, did not keep up on the turn, angled out as MIKAYLA ATTACK came close at
the quarter pole and had no stretch bid.

Footnotes
COME ON DOVER was hustled to share the lead outside W W KAN DO, battled through the lane and edged ahead of the latter the last seventy yards.
GREAT GRET prominent from outside, was three wide taking the bend, drifted out some upper stretch, straightened with a furlong to go, all out in the late
going, lugged in some through the waning yards but got up to finish on even terms with COME ON DOVER. W W KAN DO was sent to dispute the pace
from inside, fought gamely through the stretch but began to get weary the last seventy yards. R H SMOAKEM rated well off the inside on the backstretch,
picked up his pace and was angled in on the bend, still threatened along the rail with a furlong to go but finished evenly.

LA GUERRERITA took the lead from outside with five furlongs to go, quickly moved clear, was roused leaving the turn, under a steady drive through the
lane and held on. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS forwardly placed from the beginning, took over second two wide on the bend, floated out some into the stretch
then gradually closed the gap on the leader as she fought to keep the place. BEZEL SET chased from outside, was just off the inside on the turn, fanned
widest for the stretch run, made a strong move the last furlong, came up short but caught UNEEKY for third. UNEEKY well placed inside from the start,
could only make up minor ground late. LILALEE failed to menace.

REND LAKE BABY broke on top and inward, was quickly clear of the others, in hand on the bend, roused leaving the turn, under mild urging in the lane and
proved much the best. HALO COUTURE chased while toward the outside, was three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, took over
second, was all out but could only pull away for the place. FILLY FROM ILLY raced closest to REND LAKE BABY from just off the inside for a half mile then
began to flatten out. MIKE'S LADY chased from outside, angled in on the bend and had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
LINE OF DENHAMS rated off the inside through the early going, picked up his pace just off the inside leaving the bend, angled out five wide upper stretch,
took the lead inside the last eighth then steadily drew away under a drive. BILLY NOT WILLIAM waited along the rail for a clear path on the backstretch,
was boxed in behind BOLD ATTACK on the turn, got through three wide into the lane, rallied to vie for the lead briefly, was no match for LINE OF
DENHAMS inside the final furlong but narrowly held onto second. TO THE BANK in contention from the beginning, was three wide on the bend, crowded
some as BILLY NOT WILLIAM tried to get a clear path leaving the turn, threatened four wide with a furlong left, was also no match for the eventual winner
but gained third. IT'S BELLAMY TIME pressed BOLD ATTACK from inside, took the lead leaving the turn, was challenged upper stretch, fought for second
the final sixteenth but did not have enough left. PICTURE PAINTED was not a factor in a ground-saving trip. BOLD ATTACK advanced from outside to gain
the advantage before finishing a quarter mile, stayed just off the inside taking the bend and gave way from between rivals in the lane.

Footnotes
MARYS LAST SONG stalked the early speed from outside, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, responded to one tap of the whip upper stretch,
took the lead then drew off while ridden out the final furlong. WAR COLORS chased from just off the inside, angled out through the turn, came five wide into
the stretch, was all out and caught PASSION'S IMAGE for second late. PASSION'S IMAGE prominent between rivals on the backstretch, was three then
four wide through the bend, gained second deep stretch, finished evenly and had to settle for the show. KALISPELL vied for the lead outside FOGGY
KITTEN, moved ahead on the turn and began to wear down just off the inside for the drive. SHEZAHOTMAMA soon trailed from inside, also angled out
through the bend, came widest into the stretch and had no late bid. FOGGY KITTEN displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing
four furlongs.

MIZ BLUE broke on top, showed the way inside, floated out some entering the lane, put to a drive upper stretch then steadily drew off while kept to task to
the wire. HAMMERED pressed MIZ BLUE from just outside, no match for that one when set down for the drive but held second under steady handling. I
LUV THIS BAR moved to the inside early on, gradually progressed from inside, gained third upper stretch and was closing in on HAMMERED late.
ORDAINED KISS forwardly placed from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run and slowly yielded. GHAALEB'S MAGIC
was a factor on the backstretch but began to fade two wide on the turn.
