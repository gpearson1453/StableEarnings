THIRSTY GAL stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch surging steadily outside the leader arriving in time. STRAIGHT UP SMARTY broke sharply setting
the pace on an easy lead through the far turn, digging in from the two path down the lane couldn't hold to outside pressure. VIOLET BLUE went evenly
through the far turn coming four wide in upper stretch having some late gain. MIDNIGHT LEAP unhurried early raced inside to upper stretch showing late
interest. SWEEPENO slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly on the rail. DESERT DOTTY played no factor. COURTLY KITTY was never
involved.
