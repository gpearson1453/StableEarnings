Footnotes
BY MOONLIGHT attended the pace four deep up the backstretch then outside the top pair into the turn, bid alongside with a quarter mile remaining, dueled
with GERLACH'S in the final furlong and edged the runner-up. GERLACH'S prompted the pace from outside, challenged between late on the turn, took over
in upper stretch, dueled with the winner through the final furlong and missed. WARRENS CANDY MAN was reserved in the early going, traveled a bit off the
rail into the lane, tipped out and closed well to be gaining on the top pair late. HEAD FOR BUSINESS stumbled, broke in and bumped inner rival repeatedly,
recovered to move up and take control, set the pace under pressure from outside, vied with rivals late on the turn, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened late. POSEIDON'S KID got bumped repeatedly by HEAD FOR BUSINESS at the start, went up to stalk the pace from inside and flattened out in
the drive. GONE SOMEWHERE stumbled leaving the gate, was in range two to three wide on the turn and faded. MIZZEN POWER raced up close three
deep early, steadied briefly at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the turn and weakened. JUST ASK ETHAN was off slow to begin, tracked
three to four wide around the turn and failed to respond in the lane.

Footnotes
WINHAPPY came away alertly and sped to the front, cleared and crossed over into the two path, showed the way unchallenged into the stretch, urged
right-handed in the final furlong and remained clear. HALF RIGHT raced in range off the inside then outside a rival, took aim three wide into the stretch but
could not find the needed late kick to threaten the winner. DIVA'S FINALE unhurried in the beginning, traveled outside a pair of rivals then angled out and
exited the bend five wide then rallied belatedly for the show. GOLDENEYED chased along the inside, eased out into the three path on the turn and kept on
to earn a minor award. RAGING WATERS had brief speed inside WINHAPPY early but could not keep pace, dropped back to chase inside a rival, traveled
a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. MUSICAL GEM settled in mid-pack early on, entered the stretch four wide and lacked a rally. FATHER
O'FLAHERTY raced between rivals at the back of the pack, went two then three wide around the turn and failed to menace. C'MON JENNA raced in
mid-pack early, took the turn two wide and weakened. ROCKTILLYOUDROP lacked early speed near the rail, traveled inside a pair of runners up the
backstretch, saved ground through the turn and failed to make an impact.

WHAT IN BLAZES stalked off the rail up the backstretch, quickly ranged up four wide on the turn, struck the front past the five-sixteenths, moved clear at
the top of the stretch and powered away under strong hand urging. BIG IMPACT pressed the pace from outside, vied between around the turn, could not
match strides with the winner in the lane but stayed on to secure the place. SIPPIN N KISSIN was off a bit slow at the start, went four then five wide around
the turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. FREEDOM'S GLORY stalked the top pair into the turn, bid three deep between around the bend and
faltered in the drive. EMPIRE'S FIRE traveled three then four wide around the turn and failed to threaten. AGADOR SPARTACUS navigated the turn five
then six wide and was never a factor. EREBUS set the pace under pressure while on the inside, vied with rivals on the turn, lost command past the
five-sixteenths and gave way. MOB BOSS came away to a slow beginning, tracked off the rail, took the turn five wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE closest in pursuit through the early stages, put in a bid near the quarter pole, kicked clear with a furlong remaining and lasted over the
late charge from the runner-up. ENGLAND'S ROSE reserved in the early going on the inside, angled out into the three path leaving the far turn, came back
in but lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path and closed fast on the winner to just miss. DEL MAR DRAMA tracked just out of range early, came
three wide into the stretch, bumped with rival on both sides in upper stretch and finished well to get up for third. ULTIMATE HY was off a bit slow from the
far outside, moved down to the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, got bumped in upper stretch and missed the show. CALIFORNIA KOOK was off
a bit slow at the start, trailed early on, advanced while angled out on the far turn, summoned a mild response and just missed a minor share. ELLERSLIE
LACE (FR) was rank early along the inside, moved out into the two path on the far turn, bumped with DEL MAR DRAMA in upper stretch and kept on
through the final furlong. NEW HEAT raced outside a rival near the back, came out into the stretch, traveled eight wide in upper stretch and continued to
show a mild response while widest. FANTAIL (GB) sped clear and steered over to the inside, coaxed leaving the far turn, overtaken in upper stretch and
weakened. CASSIE BELLE stalked the pace outside a rival, exited the far turn three wide and flattened. LALIC (FR) chased along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SMASH TICKET broke in at the start, got brushed soon after the start, dueled for the lead then cleared around the turn, roused in upper stretch, given a tap
from the left-hand and drew off. CENSORSHIP raced in range well off the rail, went five wide into the turn, angled in and took aim at the winner two wide
into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick but proved second best. DESERT DAWN got bumped two times at the start, traveled two to three
wide off the pace, was a bit green in the lane and bested the rest. HALF PAST TWELVE was off slow slow and lost path at the start, went up to chase
inside, angled out and came three wide into the stretch and got edged for the show. BABY STEPS broke out and bumped rival at the start, went six wide
into the turn, five wide into the stretch and could not produce the needed response. RUBY RAY shifted out soon after the start, dueled for the lead from
inside, could not keep pace with the winner on the turn and faded. LIAM'S DOVE fractious in the gate, brushed from inside early, had early speed outside
rivals, chased four wide around the turn and also faded. WETHERLY bumped and stumbled at the start, dropped back early, traveled three then two wide
on the turn and was never a factor. OUTLAW DAISY broke in and bumped rival twice at the start, traveled four wide into the turn, steered down to the two
path and failed to threaten.

(FR) raced three wide around the first turn, stalked outside a rival on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, tipped outside rival at the eighth pole,
rallied but got outclosed by the winner. FRENCH GETAWAY unhurried in the beginning, traveled outside rivals on the backstretch, advanced four to five
wide on the second bend, rallied but had the rider lose the whip mid-stretch and missed the place. LUCK OF THE DRAW raced between foes then outside a
rival on the backstretch, angled out and rallied six deep in the lane but was not enough. ANTARCTIC tracked the pace from inside, entered the lane a bit off
the rail, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path and finished well. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) raced two wide then moved inside, traveled a bit off the
rail into the lane, moved back inside and put in a bid along the rail but got outkicked in deep stretch. TIZONA pressed the pace from outside early on,
challenged around the far turn, led briefly mid-stretch and faltered late. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) tracked in the two path on both turns and lacked a bid.

the pace, traveled between runners then angled in upper stretch and was outrun. ON A SPREE settled inside and made no impact. PALACE PRINCE was

GINOBILI went four then three wide around the first turn, vied three deep on the backstretch, took over near the half-mile pole, cleared at the
seven-sixteenths, opened up around the far turn and widened in the stretch under left and right-handed urging. MR. IMPOSSIBLE sat off the pace early,
angled four to five wide on the far turn and bested the rest. DIVINE ARMOR traveled off the rail, advanced three wide on the second bend, angled out in
upper stretch and gained the show. ESTABLISHED stalked off the rail, moved into second around the far turn, entered the lane two wide and was
outfinished for the minor placings. BEYOND BRILLIANT angled out on the far turn, came three to four wide into the stretch and could not rally. ROYAL
INSIDER traveled along the inside, came out on the far turn and was never a factor. TIZHOTNDUSTY raced off the pace in the early going, entered the
stretch three wide and failed to menace. BRUTTO vied between rivals early, lost command nearing the four furlong mark, chased the winner two wide to the
stretch and tired. SILVER MOON ROAD vied for the lead from inside, chased the winner past the half-mile pole, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the
lane and walked off.

Footnotes
IPPODAMIA'S GIRL broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, reserved in the early going, swung five wide into the stretch, fought with BROOKE
through the final furlong and proved best late. BROOKE (CHI) threw her head and hopped slightly at the start, tracked off the rail, came four wide into the
stretch, grabbed the lead past the eight pole but got outkicked by the winner. TAPWATER pulled early off heels at the back, came off the rail leaving the far
turn, angled out further in the stretch and was gaining to the wire. SEDAMAR settled inside, tipped out into the lane but was crowded in upper stretch, found
a clear path and finished well to earn a minor award. SHE'S SO SPECIAL raced off the rail near the back of the pack, came five wide into the lane and
produced a mild rally. HEATHERS GREY stalked the pace from inside, lacked room and checked in upper stretch and could not rally after gaining a clear
path. DYNASTY OF HER OWN bumped both sides at the start, sped to the front, dueled for the lead outside of NASTY, lost contact with that rival then
re-bid at the three-eighths, challenged through the far turn then lost contact in upper stretch and weakened. NASTY away quickly and dueled from inside
with DYNASTY OF HER OWN, cleared that rival on the backstretch, challenged again at the three-eighths, held a short lead through the far turn, cleared
again in upper stretch but weakened in the late stages. CANDURA got bumped into rival at the start, stalked off the inside, went three wide into the drive
and faded.

EXPRESS TRAIN pressed the pace from outside, headed rival and dueled on the far turn, took the lead past the five-sixteenths pole and held gamely to the
wire. TRIPOLI tracked three deep early, exited the far turn four wide, rallied outside the winner but could not get by. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) stalked inside then
two wide on the first turn, moved back inside on the backstretch, moved out a bit on the far turn, angled to the rail and bid along the fence in the lane but
faltered late. MO MOSA raced up close outside the top pair, bid three deep with a quarter mile remaining and flattened out in the final furlong. MAGIC ON
TAP stumbled at the start, stalked between rivals, chased three wide into the drive and lacked a rally. RUSHIE set from inside while pressured, dueled
around the far turn, then weakened in the lane. SHERIFF BROWN stumbled at the start and was always outrun. KISS TODAY GOODBYE coaxed early
racing off the rail, went outside a trio of rivals near the half-mile, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.
