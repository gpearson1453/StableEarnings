NACHO VICTORY sat just off of the early pace, was three then four wide on the second turn, mounted a bid off of the turn to take the lead and drew clear in
the end while on the left lead. WHISPERING FLAME was away slowly and was unhurried in the early going, was three wide on the second turn and rallied
in the stretch to get the place but was not pressuring the winner in the end. MASTER DIAMOND prompted the pace through the second turn while saving
ground and was outfinished in the stretch run. FINE RED RESERVE set all of the pace through the second turn while three wide, was confronted by the
winner nearing the three-sixteenths marker and tired in the drive. TWO PUNCH CAT stalked the early fractions, was three wide on the second turn while
gaining a bit of ground and weakened in the stretch run.

DIMMI QUANDO sat just off of the early pace setters, gained ground while six wide on the turn, continued that run to rally in the stretch and surged to the
front to prevail. U S DEPUTY broke on top and set the pace while saving ground on the turn, was quickly confronted and passed by the winner inside of the
furlong marker but held on to save the place. KID STOLE A KISS bore out at the start, bumping SHARONA'S WILD BOY, settled toward the rear of the field,
saved ground on the turn in two path and rallied in the stretch, just missing for second while holding for third. SHARONA'S WILD BOY was bumped by KID
STOLE A KISS at the break then bumped NUESTRO ENGREIDO, pressed the pace by U S DEPUTY through the turn while three wide but weakened in the
stretch run. NUESTRO ENGREIDO stumbled leaving the gate, was bumped outward by SHARONA'S WILD BOY, clipped heels of VINNIEBOB, tracked the
leaders through the turn while three wide and tired in the stretch run. VINNIEBOB chased the pace through the turn while four wide and gave way in the
stretch run. AUTISM STRONG was away slowly, was slow into stride through the backstretch, was two wide on the turn and was not a factor. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION PLACED #3 KID STOLE A KISS 5TH FOR
INTERFERENCE ON #4 SHARONA'S WILD BOY AND #5 NUESTRO ENGREIDO.

UNION LEADER settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn, rallied off of that turn, confronted MY SUNSHINE and battled that
stubborn rival to the wire and won the nod to prevail. MY SUNSHINE set the contested pace through the second turn, was roused into the lane and was
confronted by the winner inside of the furlong marker, was stubborn in the late stages, battled with UNION LEADER and just missed for the win while a clear
second over the rest. PURR CAT settled in the midflight through the second turn while saving ground, improved position into the stretch but was outfinished
by the top two while a clear third over the rest. SUNNY SPOT sat just off of the early leaders, was four wide on the second turn, lost ground into the stretch
and did not offer a rally in the late going. UNPOSSIBLE contested the pace by MY SUNSHINE through the second turn and gave way in the stretch run.
MISS YOU MOM was away slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, was two wide on the second turn and trailed throughout.
