Footnotes
BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB moved up in the opening quarter and took control of the lead, dropped inside and saved ground into the lane, cleared on top,
shown the whip then finished ridden out. MILENITA broke on top then conceded position to the eventual winner, stayed in pursuit two wide and settled for
second best. FORTES raced off the early speed, hustled up along the inside in the lane, sustained a steady bid and prevailed for a share. MY CORALENA
raced two wide in pursuit of the early leader, hustled up four wide into the lane then ran on one paced. CUPCAKE raced three to four wide in range around
the turn then flattened two to three wide in the lane. KELLY GREEN lacked early speed, raced three to four wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
NOBLE MISCHIEF raced four wide around the first turn, was forwardly placed through the backstretch, went two wide and challenged TRANSIT for the lead
around the far turn, dueled into the lane, took on the challenge from CHINA BEACH, dug in gamely and prevailed. CHINA BEACH tracked the pace through
the backstretch, hustled up three wide late on the far turn, advanced to duel outside NOBLE MISCHIEF, dug in gamely and just missed. BIG EASY EMPIRE
settled near the inside through early stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, hustled along two to three wide, stayed on with steady response and
gained show. TRANSIT pressed the pace in early stages, dueled with rival through the backstretch, took on the winner around the far turn, battled on into
the lane then weakened in late stages. CRITICIZE rated near midpack through the backstretch, was ridden along two wide around the far turn, came out
wider in the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. ARE YOU HAPPY raced off the pace, went three to four wide into the lane and never
threatened. LEWANDOWSKI saved ground and had no response. FIXATION led the way around the first turn, dueled through the backstretch then
retreated.

Footnotes
SAIL ON ELLEN was forwardly placed and tracked the leader around the turn, launched a two wide bid heading into the lane, responded willingly and drew
clear under steady urging. RESPONSE TIME sped to the lead at the start, set the pace around the turn, saved ground into the lane, could not hold off the
winner in the final furlong but stayed on and finished clearly second best. TEA IN CHINA raced in contention between rivals around the turn, hustled along
three wide into the lane and churned on for a share. THINKING raced in range along the rail around the turn then gave way in the lane. PRETTY EDGY
raced in contention racing three deep in early stages then gave way late on the turn. THE RACE WAS RETIMED ELECTRONICALLY
