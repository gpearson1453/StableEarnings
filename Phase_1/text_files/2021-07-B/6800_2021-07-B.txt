KING OF LIGHT stalked the dueling trio into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead before the furlong marker and drew off under left handed urging.
DIVULGENCE dueled for the lead three then two wide until deep stretch and finished second best. RELEASED had a mild late rally in the four path. READY
MY WAY contested the lead two wide then along the inside until deep stretch then weakened. THE FALCON failed to menace. WINWITHJIMMY was no
factor. HUMBLE HANSEN was outrun. ALWAYS SPECIAL disputed the early pace along the inside and was through after a half.

JUDGE HEAD prompted the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under left handed
urging to win as much the best. IT'S A MANS WORLD broke in front, set the pace for five furlongs then was no match for the winner while well clear for
second. TAPAWAY trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals in the five path. SKYTOWN CAT well placed, failed to respond. CANT LOLLYGAG was
no factor. LETSGETITSEVENTEEN close up, was through after a half. TAPSHOT was never close, pulled up before the wire and was walked off.

MOVES LIKE ALI sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace while getting quick fractions, drifted through deep stretch and won under brisk
handling. CHARLEE'S MAGIC stalked the pace from the four path into the stretch, drifted out to the seven path and finished second best. BIG OHIO never
far back, finished determinedly in the five path. MAKE THE CALL had good position, and finished with good courage in the four path. LITTLE BLAKER
chased the winner into the stretch then faded. DEER CREEK ROAD was no factor. OFTEN ENOUGH was outrun. WEST LEONARD had brief speed.

Footnotes
ALTISSIMO dueled for the lead in the four path, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, was headed repeatedly and fought back gamely to prove best under
strong handling. BUCKEYE BULLET battled with the winner in the five path, was carried out a bit entering the stretch, dug in determinedly but finished
second best. CANDY EXCHANGE never far back, got through along the inside to make the lead near the furlong marker then was outfinished in the final
yards. LIBERATE stalked the early pace, loomed boldly four wide in upper stretch and finished with good courage. IT'S OFFICIAL went evenly. GOING
WITH STYLE failed to menace. PLAY BALL checked soon after the start and was no threat. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE trailed. THE RIDER OF BUCKEYE
BULLET LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ALTISSIMO FOR ELLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE FURLONG POLE,
AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DIAMOND STATE chased the pace through the turn, inherited the lead two wide then widened through deep stretch under mild urging to won going away.
STAY THIRSTY AMIGO close up, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then finished second best. CHACO SPIRIT settled mid pack, angled out to
the six path entering the stretch and finished determinedly. BREEZY MONEY drifted in soon after the start, stalked the pace and lacked the needed
response. AXIS failed to menace. GOTIGER SPECIAL was bumped then in tight soon after the start and failed to reach contention. EXONERATED PREZ
was forced inward soon after the start, in tight, checked and bumped a rival then never threatened. SKYLIME was no factor. OSBIN away alertly, set the
pace to the top of the stretch then stopped.
