MAIN COOL CAT was content to lag, began a run along the rail into the far turn, came out entering the stretch, lacked room behind the leaders leaving the
furlong grounds, angled to the outside in midstretch then quickly ran clear late. FINANCIAL FREEDOM made the early pace along the rail, was displaced in
early stretch, came again in midstretch but was little match. DENNIS' DIAMOND pressed two wide, moved to a short lead in early stretch then faltered.
RANDOM THOUGHTS moved closer along the inside in early stretch but hung. INDIGESTION edged closer three wide on the final turn then flattened out.
QUENCH MY THIRST stayed inside and failed to matter.

MIDNIGHT WHISKEY showed speed outside, moved two wide to command just before a half, drew clear leaving the turn and widened. MOTATAABEQ was
slow early, raced the two path around the turn, swung out entering the stretch and outfinished the others in an even finish. KING OF AMERICAN lagged to
the stretch then passed troubled ones while no threat. SUPPRESS had position two wide and was forced to steady sharply near the seventy yard pole.
TOMASCO was no factor. U ROCK IT showed speed inside and was forced to take up nearing the seventy yard pole. A MAIZE ZING RIP had position
inside, fell in distress nearing the seventy yard pole then got up and walked off. Race times updated after data review.
