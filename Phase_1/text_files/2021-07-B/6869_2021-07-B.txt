Footnotes
ANATOLIA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. ONLY DANIELLE chased the winner while racing
three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. SKEEMIN N DREAMIN settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and
failed to gain in the drive. SADIE THREE SOCKS showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY showed no
early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.

FRISCO FRILLS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. YOU GO GIRL was off a step slow, raced
unhurried early from off the rail and finished with a steady bid. ZIPPIN SEVENZ was away in good order to track the leaders from the inside, angled out into
the stretch and failed to gain late. COASTAL RUN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. FOR YOU
ONLY broke sharply to show brief speed from between foes and weakened.

authority. POPPY'S C NOTE was bumped at the break, stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, angled in and out in mid-stretch and was up for the
place. DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. TRIUNFADOR was
bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. KING CHARLIE was forwardly placed from

COBRA JET was away in good order to press the pace of FIREWALKER while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths
marker, quickly opened a clear margin and drew off through the lane as the handiest of winners. CHUMLY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. FIREWALKER broke sharply to set a pressured pace
from the inside and weakened after going a half. BAT MAN'S BULL was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. FIRING PIN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
STAY IN GRACE broke sharply to duel for the lead with SIGRID'S GOLD while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and was
ridden out. SIGRID'S GOLD disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival through the final furlong and held on for the place.
RED NOON RISING was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. LAKERBALL was off a
step slow, rushed to contend, reached a striking position into the stretch and was not urged late. IF YOU WANT IT was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RITA LORRAINE was pulled up after the opening quarter and vanned off.

Footnotes
SASSY EDIE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged clear.
URBAN DIVA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged in mid-stretch, vied and gave way grudgingly late.
RAELEE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late.
SMASHING SUCCESS chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened in the drive. BISHOPS OF COMPTON was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and weakened. LINCHPINS WAKE raced off the leaders from the inside
throughout and lacked the needed rally. SADIE SUE was off slow, showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not reach
contention.

SLACK TIDE broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and drew off. AKASI was away alertly to duel
for the early advantage from the inside, dropped back nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, remained inside for the drive and rallied late to gain the place.
SMILING SALSA disputed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way through the final furlong. CADILLAC MARGARITA settled off the leaders from the
inside, checked nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. TYCHE AWAITS YOU lagged early,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PONTIFFANY was hustled along to press the pace while racing four-wide, angled out in mid-stretch

Footnotes
I'M NOT GABBY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane while being ridden out. SENOR FABULOSO
raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. COASTAL BUZZ broke inward,
chased the winner while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. PROUD LION chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after
going a half. RAZACAT lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. ZANOS was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the
turn and was not a factor.
