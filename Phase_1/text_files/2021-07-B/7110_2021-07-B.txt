Footnotes
TALE OF TENSAS was well rated early towards the inside eased out leaving the half mile marker and made a four wide move when ready leaving the five
sixteenths pole, then moved to the inside when leaving the turn and clear and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. LOOKING HOT
pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. BRENDA'S DOLL was
void of early speed on the inside, angled out entering the stretch to be along for the show award. CYBER CITY set a pressured pace on the inside and gave
way in the drive. LITTLE GIRLS RULE was bumped at the start, then was reserved early swung out six wide for the drive and had no response.RACE WAS

SOCIAL AFLEET stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, then held on late winning the head bob
to prove best under a drive. SILVER GALAXY was well rated on the inside, then was boxed by the quarter pole, moved out forcing his way out for room
leaving the turn, closed gap fast to just miss losing the bob. BRITTS A CLOSER was five wide on the first turn, then chased the early pace five wide on the
backstretch, moved inside by the three eighths pole, then was between rivals by the quarter pole, then was bumped hard by the three sixteenths pole and
had no late gain while besting the rest. FREEDOMFI tracked the early pace three to four wide, then was roused on the far turn, bumped by the three
sixteenths pole and faded. BEAUREGARD stumbled at the start, then chased the pace four wide on the backstretch, then came widest into the drive and
was empty. MORRICONE set the early pace on the inside and gave way. THE JOCKEY ON FREEDOMFI CLAIMED FOUL VERSUS BRITTS A CLOSER

advanced and came six wide into the lane and had a late rally. HURRICANE FLORENCE was reserved early, made a mild bid four wide on the turn but
came up empty in the drive. SCRAPBOOK chased the early pace on the inside then weakened. KUDOS TO YOU lacked a rally. SUNNY'S PRAYER
