Footnotes
COOKIN ROSES shot to the front right out of the gate, opened up by a comfortable margin up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and was ridden out to the wire, much the best. AH LEAH tracked the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn,
and chased the eventual winner home while drifting out mildly in late stretch, the best of the rest. ZIP ATTACK BABY raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside in the early going, ran into traffic and was forced to steady slightly headed into the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and finished evenly.
DARE TO HOPE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked from there. IRINA'S
HERO trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
CHOPPER came out in the opening strides, was sent to the lead and soon clear, set the pace in the two path on the turn, increased his advantage when
shaken up into upper stretch, went to a drive for the final eighth and held safe while drifting out. IRISH TUFF bobbled in the opening strides and bumped
SYMBOLIST, settled at the rear outside of SYMBOLIST, raced in the three path on the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, swung four wide into
the lane, rallied, secured the place with a furlong to go, and chased on while proving second best. CACHACO was pushed for early pace early but
outsprinted to the lead, tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the two path around the turn, was driven two wide into the lane but proved no match
for CHOPPER, had no answer as IRISH TUFF got past for the place with a furlong to go, but held the show. SYMBOLIST was bumped by IRISH TUFF in
the opening strides, was hustled for speed inside but outsprinted by CHOPPER, settled back to the inside of the rear flight into the turn, saved ground
around the bend and into the lane, and had no rally under a drive. SKIP THE SMALLTALK chased four wide early, was pushed to join the stalking flight
outside of CACHACO around the turn, tracked in the three path, was hard urged from the three eighths and driven from the five sixteenths, came three wide
into the lane, and came up empty while drifting out.

Footnotes
GRAPEVINE veered in and bumped soundly with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and drew off down the stretch under a drive. TWELVE RED ROSES bumped significantly with the horses to either side of her leaving the gate,
tracked the frontrunners between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, and gained
ground mildly down the lane. MAMA LOU chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a mild bid approaching the five
sixteenths pole and was outkicked from there. RULER DAENERYS raced inside in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field from the two path up
the backstretch and around the turn, and made no bid. SECOND HAND ATTACK bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced outside up the
backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch. AN OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF
THE FOUR HORSE ON THE RIDER OF THE THREE HORSE, CONCERNING THE BUMPING AT THE START OF THE RACE. UPON REVIEW, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION, THERE IS NO HALF MILE TIME FOR THIS RACE.

ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, stalked outside her down the backstretch, encroached to her outside into the
far turn, took the lead two wide near the seven sixteenths, raced clear from the three eighths while still positioned two wide, opened up in the lane when
vigorously hand urged and shown the crop, and remained in command to the wire. JUDY'S WAY hopped at the start and came slowly away, settled at the
rear of a compact group, edged forward inside of GLITTERARY past the three quarters to track the leading pair, continued to track while positioned two
wide on the far turn, bid between horses just past the five sixteenths, proved no match for ELKE DO JAGUARETE from upper stretch but chased on with
continued interest a clear second best. NOFANSINTHESTANDS took the lead into the clubhouse turn, set a slow pace, was engaged by ELKE DO
JAGUARETE into the far turn and headed with seven sixteenths of a mile remaining, tracked that new leader while saving ground around the rest of the
turn, was driven into the stretch but could not match the leading pair in the lane. GLITTERARY chased the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, raced
two wide down the backstretch while continuing to track them, was pushed along into the far turn, continued in range three wide around the far turn, was
driven into the lane and came up empty.

SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE tracked the leaders in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began an outside bid
nearing the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and wore down his rival to get get up in time despite being carried out and bumped by
that foe near the wire. EASTER MUSIC dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, raced
gamely down the lane, drifted out in the final furlong and bumped with SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE and was caught in the final strides. CROCE D'ORO hit the
gate and was pinched back at the start, trailed the field on the inside early, began to improve position slightly while racing in the two path around the far turn
and finished evenly. YOUNG CORBETT veered in leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to drop back
while saving ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch. DOM THE BOMB dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to
battle from the two path around the turn, folded entering the stretch and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
SERENE chased inside of BELLS OF JOY through the clubhouse turn and the backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn to keep the leading pair in
her sights, tracked them while positioned three wide, rallied three wide into the lane under a drive, kicked past the leading pair inside the three sixteenths,
and drew off in the final furlong. MAID OF HONOR broke sharply, stalked outside of AWAY TO RETURN through the clubhouse turn, hounded outside that
foe down the backstretch and through the far turn, engaged on even terms from the five sixteenths, vied two wide, could not keep pace with SERENE as
she kicked past in upper stretch, but shook off AWAY TO RETURN midstretch to prove best of the rest. AWAY TO RETURN led inside into the clubhouse
turn, took increased pressure from MAID OF HONOR down the backstretch and while saving ground through the far turn, was driven into the lane on even
terms with MAID OF HONOR, had no answer when SERENE kicked past in upper stretch, and flattened out inside. ALL IN A DREAM settled at the rear,
continued to trail down the backstretch, raced in the two path in second last around the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and passed a tiring horse under
a continued drive. BELLS OF JOY broke inward, tracked the leading pair between horses while racing keenly around the first turn, continued in close range
between horses down the backstretch, chased under a drive in the three path on the far turn while not keeping pace with the leading trio, came into the lane
under a drive and weakened. MISS CHESS (IRE) was herded inward in the opening strides, proved hard to settle while chasing three wide on the
clubhouse turn, continued to chase three wide down the backstretch, began to lose ground approaching the nine sixteenths, was outpaced in the four to five
path on the far turn and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
RICHY tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began an outside bid approaching the quarter pole,
gained ground in upper stretch and drew off in the final furlong. TALKTOEACHOTHER led the field in the early going, dueled on the inside up what
remained of the backstretch and around the turn, and could not go with the winner in the stretch but finished evenly. BASEBALL POLITICS bumped with the
horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the turn and into the
stretch, was no match for the winner and weakened late. COWBOYS FEATHER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced between
horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. MYUDDERMAMASAPAINT raced outside in the
middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked. VIOLENZA
D'ORO raced between horses in the early going, dropped back to run at the back of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made
no bid. POQUITO MAN dwelt at the start, eventually left the gate a furlong behind the others, trailed the field around the oval, crossed the wire and was
walked off.

HALO HUNTER was sent for speed, dueled outside of DARK NINJA down the backstretch and into the turn, led for good approaching the seven sixteenths,
set a pressured pace two wide from there, began to edge clear approaching the five sixteenths, opened up in upper stretch while still in hand, got two strikes
of the crop midstretch and continued well clear in hand the rest of the way. HUEY ATTACK broke inward and bumped OLSON in the opening strides,
chased midpack early, settled back toward the rear while saving ground inside of CAN'T SAY NO around the turn, chased into the lane between horses,
moved inside past midstretch after clearing the tiring DIDDLEY, kept on under a drive and got the bob for place. FIRST MASAMUNE tracked the leading
pair down the backstretch and two wide on the turn, swung out and was driven in the five path into the stretch, chased on earnestly three deep while never
proving a threat to HALO HUNTER, and lost the place nod. DARK NINJA sent for speed, dueled inside of HALO HUNTER down the backstretch and into
the turn, pressed inside of that foe from the seven sixteenths, proved no match from the five sixteenths, came into the lane in the three path, chased
between FIRST MASAMUNE and HUEY ATTACK to the sixteenth and weakened late. DIDDLEY chased midpack early, inched forward to track the leading
pair inside of FIRST MASAMUNE into the turn, hugged the rail around the bend, was driven inside into the lane, chased to midstretch and emptied out.
OLSON acted fractious in the gate, was bumped by HUEY ATTACK in the opening strides and then bumped CAN'T SAY NO as a result, soon trailed, was
driven in the three path around the turn and into the lane, and offered no bid. CAN'T SAY NO was bumped by OLSON in the opening strides as part of the
chain reaction caused by HUEY ATTACK breaking inward, settled in second last early, continued toward the rear in the three to four path on the turn, was
urged in the six path into the lane, went to a protective hold near the furlong mark, was eased across the wire, pulled up shortly after the finish, and was
vanned off.
