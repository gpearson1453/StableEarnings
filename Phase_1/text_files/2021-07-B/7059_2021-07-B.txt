Footnotes
MAKING ME CRAZY trailed early, split horses two wide past mid turn while closing ground, altered course three wide before the furlong marker, took over in
deep stretch and finished full of run to win going away. ALWAYS SPECIAL broke in front then angled in, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match
for the winner. DIAMOND PATRIOT forced in at the five furlong marker, altered course outside the leader, pressured that one until deep stretch and was
outfinished. LONESOME PHIL away alertly, was squeezed between horses while just off the pace causing his rider to check at the five eighths pole and
dropped out of it. POWERFUL MOON was in tight along the rail causing his rider to steady at the five furlong marker, had speed into the stretch then faded.
GOD'S WILL BE DONE was no factor.
