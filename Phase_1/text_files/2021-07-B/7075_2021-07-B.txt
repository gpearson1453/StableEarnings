Footnotes
UGLY DUCKLING trouble first turn, settled in nicely, rallied to be along in time under strong handling. BUCKETS OF RAIN speed to the front, lead to deep
stretch collared late, wore down. WIMOWEH within striking distance throughout, no late punch, held show. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR wide into first turn, raced
evenly throughout with no response. MY PAL DAL raced back throughout, improving position only in the stretch. HEY GRIFF chased leader to far turn, gave
way into the stretch run readily. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN never menaced. COUNT YOUR PENNIES far back to quarter pole, split horses to move up late.
RAULITO never a menace. MONKEY ZONE checked along inside first turn, never threatened. HESITATION BLUES had a steady fade.
