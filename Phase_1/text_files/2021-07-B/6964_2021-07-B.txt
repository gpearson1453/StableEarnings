REDOUTE'S LIGHT raced in mid pack, circled five-wide late turn, rallied outside and was up late under a drive. SACRED OATH, in touch, closed three-wide
late turn, rallied between foes but lost the nod at the wire. STRIKE THE TOP raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, launched a
determined stretch drive but was outfinished. SEGUIMI, in range, was boxed in late turn, found a path upper stretch, surged to a clear lead but faltered in
the final yards. FRANCO'S HONOUR, in range, closed two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. TALLESTOFTHETALL
broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed a gap. UNO CHAMP settled in mid
pack, angled from the rail to three-wide through the turn, was in striking range upper stretch but evened out in the final furlong. PREACHER POWER forced
the pace, dueled into turn, was quickly headed, stalked to the stretch, failed with an all out bid and faded. GOTTOKNOWRIGHTNOW broke alertly, but
outward, set the pace, dueled into the turn, regained command quickly, held the lead to upper stretch and was passed. AWESOME WOK N ROLL settled
well off the pace and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BIRCHMOUNT RD settled in behind the two leaders heading into the backstretch, sat chilly on the far turn and gunned to the lead when the pace survivor
drifted off the fence turning for home, his margin of victory widening down the lane. PAPERBACK HERO off the pace along the rail through the first turn,
angled out from second last into the far turn and came four wide at the quarter pole, tipping out in the nine path turning for home and closed well down the
center of the course for the place. ST. PADDY'S DADDY trailed when three to two wide on the first turn, rallied two to five wide on the far turn and was out
in the six path at the top of the stretch, continuing to close in the final stages, outrunning a rival for show but failing to match the kick of the place finisher
while inside those two rivals. I HAVE HOPE was four to three wide and off the pace on the first turn, came two to five wide into contention on the far turn and
was in the seven path turning for home, continuing his rally late for a minor award. BREATHLESSNTHESAND set a strong pace while inside a stalking and
pressing rival, shook off that foe on the far turn but drifted off the rail nearing the stretch allowing the winner up the inside, held second to the eighth pole but
lost positions in the final sixteenth. VERRAZANO BRIDGE sat on the rail in midpack early, rallied along the fence taking the same path as the winner and
was third at the three sixteenths but stalled in the final sixteenth. UNDEFILED tracked the leaders five to three wide on the first turn, loomed into contention
four wide on the second turn but ran out of run in the final furlong. SAMUEL H stalked the leader through quick fractions, bid into the far turn but was out of
gas by the midpoint of the second bend and retreated from there. STRONG ATTITUDE chased the leaders three to two wide on the first turn, bid three wide
midway on the far turn but had nothing left for the stretch run. READY AT DAWN off the pace throughout and two to three wide on the turns with no bid at
any point.

Footnotes
SPITE STORE set the pace, drew away a little on the turn then held sway under a hand ride. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK showed brief speed then pressed
the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. CHUNKY MONKEY, bumped by LONG POND leaving the
gate, stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn then rallied gamely. JACKIE'S PRIDE drifted out at the start, stalked the pace, chased two and
three-wide on the turn then flattened out mid stretch. CORE raced in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention.
LONG POND broke outward and bumped CHUNKY MONKEY, settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. VIEW
FROM EGBERT raced from off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. RED MAVRIK raced off the pace and
