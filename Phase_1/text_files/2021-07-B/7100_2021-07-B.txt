the backstretch and the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch. TEMPLE CITY BLVD trailed around both turns, and improved without threatening.

Footnotes
TANGO CHARLIE vied for the lead outside of ESPIONAGE, drew clear entering the lane with BROTHER AARON in pursuit, then gamely fended that
rallying foe off through the late stages. BROTHER AARON stalked three wide, rallied outside of the clear TANGO CHARLIE through midstretch, cut the gap
a sixteenth out while sustaining his advance, but was denied. MAHOMES MONEY stalked inside, then two wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, but
only managed to chase the leaders through the lane without threatening them. WEST WARPATH failed to factor. ESPIONAGE rushed early on to vie for the
lead inside of TANGO CHARLIE, but weakened passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TOUCH OF CLASS was bumped at the start by an inner rival, stalked the pace two to three wide, rallied in upper stretch in pursuit of the clear MUSIC APP,
ranged up alongside that one a sixteenth out, and edged ahead late. MUSIC APP set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch when set
down, dug in while meeting TOUCH OF CLASS's bid inside the final furlong, but was worn down by that rival late. TROUBLE MAKING broke outwardly and
bumped a rival at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped two, then three, wide turning for home, rallied and chased from behind the leaders
through the late stages while holding show from an outer rival. BE LIKE WATER took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and stayed on well
outside of foes for a minor share. SHANIAH stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase the leaders through the lane, and failed to produce a bid.
TERRANOVA trailed outside of foes around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and improved past tiring foes. STONE TOWN broke well but was
outsprinted early on, settled far off of the pace along the inside into the turn, and failed to factor. SENTIMENTAL CROSS pressed the pace setter two wide,
but weakened in upper stretch. LEAN IN broke a step slowly, lied off of the pace in the three path into the turn, but faded turning for home and was done
early.

JUST A IRISH LAD settled off of the pace two wide, gained ground on the leading trio from the two path around the far turn, swung outside of those foes
entering the lane, then sustained his long rally to drive past the leader approaching the sixteenth pole, and drew clear thereafter. PRINCE OF MAYHEM
stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, ranged up outside of those foes at the quarter pole, swept past them entering the lane as JUST AN IRISH
LAD commenced an outside rally, but proved no match for that foe approaching the final sixteenth, then safely held place. EL FRANCO trailed into the far
turn, gained four to five wide around that bend, then stayed on through the lane for a minor share. DIRECTIONAL dueled for the lead two wide, but was
outkicked by a pair of outer foes entering the lane, and gave way. NO OBLIGATION dueled for the lead inside of DIRECTIONAL, but proved no match for
outer rallying foes entering the stretch, and tired. T J MUNNINGS saved ground off of the pace, but was done early.

PLAY ACTION PASS tracked along the inside, stalked from behind the leading trio around the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane grinded away
through midstretch to bid at the sixteenth pole, and forged an advantage strides from the wire. GINGRICH settled off of the pace three wide, steadily
advanced into and around the far turn to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, drew clear from inner foes in upper stretch with PLAY ACTION PASS in
pursuit, managed a clear margin into the final furlong, but was bested inside the final sixteenth. ROCKET ONE tracked two to three wide, then chased the
leading pair home well while progressing through the late stages. VIVAR saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, improved mildly three wide
around the far turn before swinging five wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes for a minor share. CRAZY GENIUS stalked along the inside,
shifted outside of the leader into the backstretch to attempt a bid, vied two wide into and around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer rivals entering the
lane, and yielded in upper stretch. BUCKY BIK COIN pulled clear into the first turn, showed the way while a bit keen and in the two path around that bend,
vied inside of a pair of foes down the backstretch and the far turn, but was headed turning for home, and faltered through the lane. CAUSE A STIR veered
inwards at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but steadied sharply when ZIP IT SCOTTY came into him passing the quarter pole, then failed to threaten
thereafter. VERSTAPPEN was never involved. LOONSHOT got caught four wide around both turns, floated to the six path turning for home, and failed to
make an impact. ZIP IT SCOTTY pressed the pace two to three wide, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole, shifted in from right handed
cropping at the quarter pole, caused CAUSE A STIR to steady in the process, then continued to fade thereafter. GLASSATO was done early.

LYKAN stalked three wide, prompted the pace into the turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole outside of MO'S MOJO, battled outside of that foe through
the lane, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and maintained that measured margin to the wire. MO'S MOJO vied two wide, then from between horses
around the turn, dispatched of his inner counterpart as LYKAN menaced at the quarter pole, dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane, clung to an
advantage approaching the sixteenth pole, but was bested at that marker, and failed to regain even terms. COLTONATOR set the pace along the inside, but
yielded to a pair of outer foes passing the quarter pole, shifted outside of those foes in upper stretch, and came again to chase those foes home while
grinding away at their advantage. BEST OF GREELEY stalked along the inside, shifted two wide to four wide entering the lane, but failed to produce a bid.
DIGITAL trailed early on, took the turn four wide, and failed to factor. FROLIC MORE took the turn three wide while off of the pace, faded through the lane,
and bled.

into the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, but offered little resistance to PERJURY TRAP's bid inside the final furlong. MILITARIST steadied back
between horses in the opening furlong, saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, shifted to the three path down the backstretch, but steadied when
put to tight quarters by an inner foe at the quarter pole, shifted six wide in upper stretch, and rallied well for a minor share. OPTIMUS KAT tracked from
midpack along the inside, rallied four wide around the far turn to be in striking range entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, and
chased thereafter. WENTRU stalked along the inside, then two wide into the far turn, but chased the leaders turning for home, and faded. QUANTUM LEAP
stalked three wide, vied around the far turn, but faltered entering the lane. EL AHIJADO set the pace along the inside, but weakened around the far turn.
ENRAGED took back to track from midpack two to three wide, but got floated seven wide turning for home, and faded.
