ROYAL THUNDER showed good early speed from the inside early on, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and held gamely to be
clear under steady handling. JOSEF IS REAL was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and was clearly
second best. SUBJECT TO CHANGE stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced along the inside around the far turn and had not enough in the drive.
PEPE AND HEYWOOD was sent along to vie for the early lead with Royal Thunder, raced three wide in the stretch run and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. LIFESPAN was unhurried in the early stages, raced three to four wide and had no late response. SHADOW BOAT dropped back early on, raced five

BUFF HELLO vied for the early lead from the inside, dug in inside the eighth pole and was well clear late under strong handling. HEAVENLY TRIP pressed
the early leader while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and was clearly second best. HUSBAND
MATERIAL was coaxed along to lay up close early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final bid in the drive. LOCKDOWN LARRY was
allowed to settle early, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no late rally. SUPREME BEING twice unseated his rider and
frolicked around during the post parade. He broke slowly, raced three deep around the far turn and never was a factor. CANDY COOL dropped back early,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. HARD TRAVELER dropped back early on, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.

TRIKKI NIKKI steadied nearing the turn, raced towards the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled four to five wide through the lane and got
up in her final stride under all out pressure. APRILNESS stalked the early pace, moved up three wide through the drive and just missed in a game effort.
GRAND SKYLARK showed good early speed from the outside, dug in late and gave way grudgingly in the final stages. CLAIRE'S DARLING showed good
speed, raced along the inside around far turn through the stretch and weakened a bit in the latter stages. LOOKIN FOR CANDY was hustled early, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. ABBY NORMAL dropped back early and failed to respond. SOLEA was hustled along, swung out
six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GLORY MARCH was off a step slow, raced towards the inside and trailed throughout.

the eighth pole and weakened a bit in the final stages. MISCHIEF AFOOT was unhurried in the early stages, raced four to five wide in the drive and had not
enough. FOREWARNED was slow early early on, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. TWO THIRTY FIVE raced in a bit tight early on, angled

Footnotes
MUCHO was forwardly placed early on, moved up two to three wide in the drive, dug in inside the eighth marker and was clear late under strong pressure.
LEBDA was hustled early, set all the pace along the inside and kept on to the wire. WHERESHETOLDMETOGO was allowed to settle in the early stages,
moved up four wide around the far turn and slowly closed in on the top pair late. LAKI stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not
enough in the drive. WHISKEY AND YOU dropped back early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no response.

RAPID RESPONSE settled off the early pace, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, surged late and got up under all out pressure. DEGAS showed
good early speed to set all the pace, was well clear inside the eighth pole and was caught late to just miss in a game effort. DIALING DIXIE stalked the early
going, raced three wide while racing between rivals in the lane and kept on to the wire. SPEIGHTSTER RED settled off the early pace, raced three to four
wide and and had not enough late. KICKSTARTER was off a step slow, stalked early on, raced near the rail and had no final winning bid. INK broke to the
outside, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive.
