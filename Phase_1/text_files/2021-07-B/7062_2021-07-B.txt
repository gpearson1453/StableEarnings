Footnotes
CAUSE I'M LEAVIN broke sharply, prompted the pace outside rivals in the opening stages, went clear racing into the turn while angling to the inside,
widened the advantage under steady pressure and was taken in hand in late stages once the issue was decided. HOYA PARANOYA hopped slightly while
getting away slowly, switched outside foes racing into the turn pursuing the leader and proved best of the others while never menacing the winner.
TURNSANDCONDITIONS broke inwards bumping BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY, shifted to the inside prompting the pace on the backstretch, and steadily faded
nearing the lane. BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY, bumped, then squeezed between foes at the start, settled last racing to the turn, then displayed some late
interest between foes to gain position in the closing stages. HURTS SO BAD tracked off the first flight in the opening stages, switched outside foes racing
into the turn but came up empty in the drive. EARS TO ME, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, gave way entering the turn.
KISSALOT, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled inside foes, switched outside rivals racing into the turn but proved no threat.

Footnotes
STAR OF THE NORTH, came through close quarters at the break to gain the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage under light rating in the
opening four and a half furlongs, then steadily widened the advantage racing into upper stretch while never being asked for her best in a ridden out effort.
THAT WOULD BE NICE broke inwards bumping TEMPLES MON CHERI, was righted to track the pacesetter outside a rival, then between foes racing into
the far turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others in the drive. ICYWILBURNYEH tracked off the second flight in the opening half,
made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. MAIDEN ROCK, bumped at the start, settled last to the far turn, then
made some belated progress racing four wide in the stretch. MINNESOTA NICE tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals racing to the far turn and
steadily faded nearing the lane. TEMPLES MON CHERI, bumped, then squeezed back at the start, dropped out early.

EL CENTENARIO ducked outwards at the start while being held up momentarily off rivals, gained position between foes to advance three wide racing into
the turn, continued with a steady bid in that path nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm left
handed pressure. BREXTON, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the turn past midstretch and
prevailed for the place honors while no match for the winner. BIG WHISKEY broke out bumping BIZ KID, was righted to gain a forward placing prompting
the pacesetter in early stages, pressed the issue between foes on the turn to upper stretch but weakened in late stages. BRASKA, off slowly, was urged to
gain a contending position between foes after the opening quarter but lacked the needed closing bid. BIZ KID, bumped at the start, was collected to make
brief pursuit of the leaders four wide racing to the turn but gave way early. INCRIMINATION angled to the inside early tracking just off the pacesetter but
steadily faded racing into the turn.

MAJESTIC ICE broke out bumping CRAZY GOOD, was quickly collected to track just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, switched
outside that foe entering the turn commencing a steady advance, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm
encouragement. DANZIG STAR, urged to the lead while angling to the inside in early stages, set the pace racing into the turn, proved no match when
confronted by the winner but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. BRAHMS IS WHO tracked off the second flight outside rivals in early
stages, prompted to advance three wide racing into the turn and continued evenly in that path while gaining a share. CRAZY GOOD, bumped at the start,
settled between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the turn and continued in that path to gain some position late. UPTOWN JERSEY
GIRL, off last, failed to menace. RABBIT TWENTY TWO was a brief factor outside foes tracking just off the pacesetter but steadily faded racing into the
turn. LAURA N LUKAS tracked off the second flight inside foes and steadily faded into the turn.

Footnotes
MISYNEEDSACOCKTAIL was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, shook clear nearing upper stretch while
shifting off the inside and widened the advantage under right handed pressure. LATIN NIKKITA vied for the lead three wide between foes, angled in racing
into upper stretch while losing terms with the pacesetter but prevailed for the place honors. GHOSTED GIRL, caught six wide in the opening stages while
being prompted to terms with the first flight, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter four wide on the turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
CIRCLE BACK GIRL settled outside foes in early stages, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued to improve position. LIPSTICK LADY
broke sharply, made pursuit of the leaders five wide between foes to the turn and faded between foes into the lane. HEART ON THE RUN, urged between
foes prompting the pace, angled to the inside entering the turn and steadily faded. ROLLIN BLACKOUT, shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters in the opening
stages, never gained contention. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL, urged four wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter on the backstretch, gave way early.
BECAUSE was rated just off the first flight nearest the inside racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

dueled inside foes into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner late while edging a rival for second. TOP DOG tracked just off the first flight between foes
racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide to bid for command between foes on the far turn but couldn't match the winner late and just missed for
second. OUT RUN'M settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled five in upper stretch and made some belated progress. HEAVENLY GAZEBO
tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half and continued evenly into the stretch. GABRIEL'S LEGEND, caught five wide racing into the
first turn, tracked off the first flight outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance making brief progress five wide into the far turn but soon
flattened out. J J'S WILDCAT was urged to the lead between foes while angling inwards racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin for a half,
dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into the lane. SAHM TEQUILA tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch but gave

WILDLY DRAMATIC tracked just off the first flight three deep between foes racing through the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path to challenge
for command in upper stretch, then took over late and went clear under firm encouragement. INCLUDEANATTITUDE, hopped, then was held up out of tight

time. SHEDIALED BURREAUX sprinted to the lead, set the pace along the inside through the turn to upper stretch but yielded in late stages. HADDY UP, in

in early stages, shifted inwards on the turn and gave way. PAYTIENCE PAYS tracked off the first flight between foes and retreated early.

inwards entering the turn impeding several rivals, was urged to challenge nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. WEE MS. BURNZIE hopped at
the start losing position at the break, was prompted to make brief progress outside foes racing four wide into the turn but had no final kick.
SOULANDGRACE tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight, was shuffled out of tight quarters entering the turn and continued evenly
to late stages. ORTS DREAM settled last, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but made no impact. LUCKY MAC tracked the leader four
