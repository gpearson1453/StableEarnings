RUN LOLA RUN steadied off heels leaving the first turn while stalking the leader from along the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to run down ARIKARA in deep stretch to prove best. ARIKARA away
alertly and tracked the leader through the first turn while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn and quickly assumed command,
was unable to fend off RUN LOLA RUN late while proving easily second best. COUNTESS CAT away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken soon after entering the final turn, and while no match for the top pair, proved
clearly best of the rest. CHEERS unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, bided her time at the back of the pack while racing
three out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make
a serious impact. ONE FLEET PRINCESS broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, held a striking
position in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

PRINCESS SOIREE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail through the second
turn and into the backstretch, was collared by NO TAN LINES entering the final turn, turned back that rival entering the lane, and held HUMBOLDSTRONG
safely at bay late to prevail. HUMBOLDTSTRONG unhurried early while dropping back to trail, steadied from along the rail midway down the backstretch,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. LADY SHIRA broke sharply and
stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the
inside in the drive to get up for a share. NO TAN LINES tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, collared the
pacesetter while launching her bid two wide entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with PRINCESS SOIREE entering the lane, and was
outfinished late. WILD WOMAN away alertly and pressed the pace two wide through the first turn, continued to force the issue through the second turn, was
unable to keep pace her pace rival in the run down the backstretch, and had little to offer late.

JOHNNY stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and assumed command leaving the turn, and held UPTOWN FUNKY CAT safely at bay late to prove best.
UPTOWN FUNKY CAT away alertly, but was taken in hand and eased off the leaders into a stalking trip from along the inside entering the lane the first
time, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn while awaiting racing room, shifted five wide leaving
the turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove second best. NORTHERN KID away well and pressed the leader through the stretch the first
time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive
to prove best of the rest. ACCEPT NO OTHER settled at the back of the field while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two
wide through the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the stretch drive. TUXEDO broke sharply, but was taken in hand and settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail the field in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the
final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. DEBATABLE set a pressured pace from along the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to
battle for the lead into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished determinedly two wide in the drive to hold the place. APPELLANT settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss the place.

AS REQUIRED away well and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide through the final turn,
tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to be up in the closing strides. WHO'S THAT broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out

continued to battled with that rival through the lane, and just failed to last. GOLD POST away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of WHO'S THAT in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and continued a stretch run

early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in
the drive. BLUEBERRY HONEY missed the start to get away poorly, rushed up from along the inside through the first turn to grab a stalking trip entering the
backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing two wide in the drive. MANDY MAGIC unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, began to lose touch with the field in the run down the backstretch, and failed to make an impact.
