Footnotes
STRONG FIBER was hustled along to set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and dug in
under steady encouragement to hold off the late challenge of TALKING TEDDY, who chased the earlier pace inside, angled three wide for racing room at
the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage through the turn then dug in to gain on the winner through later yards. SUGAR LIPS chased
inside, raced near the rail on the turn then dug in through the lane to take third the final strides. BLUE N GOLD pressured the early pace three wide,
contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn, but dropped back leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride late.
SAYYESTOTHELADY chased, rounded the turn in the two and three paths and ran evenly in the lane. ROCKING TO HOME gave chase, raced at the rail
on the turn and showed little further. TIMETOGETUP chased through the backstretch, came through the turn in the three and four paths and showed little
more.

angled to the five path approaching the top of the stretch, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear nearing the wire. DAZZLE ME saved
ground through the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled five wide on the far turn and dug in to take second the final yards. SKI BUNNY

flattened later yards. BIRD TRAFFIC raced off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn
but flattened the final sixteenth. EARNED THE SHOT raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn, eased out with a bid from the seven sixteenths pole,

LOOKOUT saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled three wide into the stretch, dug in to
take a slim brief lead just inside the sixteenth pole but was caught in the final yards. PROTA stalked the pace two deep then challenged leaving the three
eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths and contested the edge through the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened later yards. HOBE

four wide on the far turn and finished evenly. FIRE DOWN BELOW settled off the pace toward the inside, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced
at the rail on the far turn, then finished evenly. WON DOZEN BANKS rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught
past the five sixteenths, continued at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. ROSAS WAY saved ground
and showed little response. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside, ran off the rail on the far turn and

turn, eased to the five path leaving the turn, took the lead mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to take the nod through the final yards. NIGHT TRAIN
WAYNE took over at the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, dug in under

three path on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran six wide on the far turn and finished well. SPUNMAN stalked the earlier pace in the three
and four paths, left the first turn outside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. NEVER
COMPROMISE stalked the pace from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage still in the three
path of the far turn, then weakened inside the eighth pole. REATA'S CASTLE rated close inside through the front stretch, raced boxed at the rail on the
opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. RIP THORN raced off the pace about the four

Footnotes
NOT FOR GOLD angled in leaving the three quarter pole and settled off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths, took the lead two deep
past the five sixteenths, drew clear toward the far turn and widened through the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted.
GATTOLOTTACHARM saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, lost momentum at the inside flank of Singing
Harmony on the far turn, recovered stride midway through the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and was gaining steadily on the winner.
MASTERDANCER settled well off the early pace while racing off the rail, eased out to give chase into the backstretch and ran four wide on the far turn,
raced evenly to late stretch then flattened stride. MISS MORGANTOWN was brushed lightly into the first turn and raced in the four path through the turn,
picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and passed rivals outside. STERLINGS MORENA saved
ground well back and was not a factor. BELLA FEMMINA came out to make light contact with Miss Morgantown into the first turn and settled off the pace
leaving the turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the three path of the far turn. SINGING HARMONY angled to the
inside to rate a long early lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths and faded near the rail on the far
turn. SHESAUPTOWNGIRL ran out into the first turn, was eased and walked off. Hollywood Brown became fractious in the gate and unseated her rider, and
was a late Stewards scratch as a result.
