K W CAPTAIN HOOK sat in the prime spot to the turn, responded kindly in the stretch run and drew off under pressure. CORNBREAD HILL bobbled at the
break, trailed to the turn, angled in late for the place spot. LOVER BOY bounced around start, rushed to duel for a half weakened from inside through the
stretch and held the show spot. SHIPPINGPORT bounced around the start, hustled along to the stretch but leveled off with no late gain. FRONTIER MESA
had an awkward start, went up rail run to duel for a half but gave way readily in the stretch run.

CATTALEYA RONITH never far back, rallied stretch, split horses to be up in final strides. ANOTATION very reluctant to load and broke awkward, rushed to
the front but could not last and run down at the wire. AUNT IRENE sharp speed to the lead, dueled to deep stretch but faltered late. IRISH FAIRY broke
slow with mild improvement in the stretch run outside. XINGFU no speed to the turn, swung widest into stretch while no real threat. HERE AND VOW
through early from outside. THAT'S GREAT tried hard from off rail throughout, faltered in the late going. BONNIE BONNET never a menace.
