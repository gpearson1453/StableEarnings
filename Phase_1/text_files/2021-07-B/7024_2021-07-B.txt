STARSHIP EMPIRE allowed to settle, angled out into the second turn, gained position four wide, bid on that path into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off
and was kept to the task. GOLD CZAR allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, was blocked into the stretch, steadied
slightly, angled out and closed well for the place. GAGE HAS A GRAY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then weakened late and held the show. CONCEALED CARRIER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out and could not gain in the lane. SMILES OF JOY well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. ALL REVVED UP stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane and had no
rally.

DARCY MAE rated on a clear lead, held sway to the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. REDEEM MY HEART tracked the pace, held position
on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest. WILDCAT
CARTRIDGE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had a mild gain. TROLLEY RIDE never
far back, held position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out. THISAINTJUMPSTREET ran evenly for three
quarters, then had no stretch rally. MARMALADE allowed to settle, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane
and faded.

Footnotes
EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, then made
a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, shook clear, then was outfinished. TRI TRY COLORS mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady
gain and missed. EL DUQUE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and improved position.
SOUPER BOOM tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
SPLIT MY BRITCHES broke a step slowly from the gate and was no factor. CALIFORNIA MARTINI showed little.
