Footnotes
NORMA JEAN B. tracked three wide then outside a rival, applied pressured at the half-mile pole, headed rival and vied between leaving the turn, cleared
approaching the eighth pole and held safely. BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) sat off the pace, advanced through the second bend, swung five wide into the
stretch and finished well for the place. RHYTHM AND GRACE traveled along the inside then moved out while rated on the backstretch, came three wide
into the stretch and finished evenly. RED DIAMOND tracked off the rail, put in a mild bid three deep at the quarter pole but faltered in the lane.
TMORROWISALONGTIME stalked in the two path to the stretch, lacked room near the inside with a furlong to go, tipped out mid-stretch and kept to task in
the final furlong. POP POP'S DREAM off slow to begin, trailed early on, angled four wide leaving the far turn and was never a factor. HIGH CON sped to the
front and crossed over, gained company near the halfway mark, vied with rivals late on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. SWEET
WORKOUT settled inside, saved ground to the stretch and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
OUTLAW stalked the top quartet up the backstretch, angled four wide entering the stretch, rallied outside the top trio while drifting in mid-stretch and was up
late. TAKE ME FOR A SPIN dueled for the lead from inside, vied with rivals through the turn and into the stretch, battled back in deep stretch and went
gamely to the wire. AWHITESPORTSCOAT attended the pace three deep, vied three deep around the bend, gained command leaving the turn, drifted
inward in the lane and got outkicked between late. SATCHEL DE RITCHES stumbled leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from outside, vied between
around the turn and into the stretch, checked between foes nearing the sixteenth pole and was ridden out to the wire. PRINCE RICKY shifted out soon after
the start, went five to six wide around the turn and never made an impact. TERRIBLE TED hustled away from the gate, raced up close four deep, chased
the top trio four to five wide on the turn and faded. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL PLACED BY THE RIDER ABOARD SATCHEL DE RITCHES
AGAINST OUTLAW, AWHITESPORTSCOAT, AND TAKE ME FOR A SPIN FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE. THERE WAS
ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH SATCHEL DE
RITCHES DID STEADY NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE, THE INCIDENT DID NOT ALTER THE OUTCOME OF THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH
AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

SEA DREAMER established the front quickly, set the pace on the inside, saved ground into the lane, then widened while drifting out under mild urging.
SOCIALLY SMART broke well to be forwardly placed three deep, navigated the turn three wide and bested the rest. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY chased on
the inside to the turn, eased out into the three path around the bend, steered out further in the stretch and gained the show. LIL TOWN SIS raced up close
early outside the leader, chased in the two path through the turn and weakened. VELVET SLIPPERS fractious in the gate, tracked the leader from outside,
dropped back on the turn and weakened. BONBON hopped at the start, went outside rivals on the turn, exited the bend four wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DICEY MO CHARA (GB) settled inside, saved ground then tipped three wide in the lane, surged late and overhauled the runner-up. BARBWIRE was
closest in pursuit in early going, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, dueled into the stretch, grabbed the lead in upper stretch, drifted in a bit near the sixteenth
pole and got caught late. LONE SCOUT stalked the pace on the inside, two to three wide on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and got up for third.
TULSA TORNADO tracked in range outside a rival, exited the far turn three wide and got outkicked in deep stretch. OFFLEE NAUGHTY hopped at the start,
went two then three wide around the first turn, traveled two wide into the drive, angled out in the stretch and produced a mild late bid.
HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR stalked the pace from inside, tipped out in the stretch, steadied between at the sixteenth pole and flattened. TRAINER PLEASE
sped clear and angled to the inside, met challenger on the far turn, dueled into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened late. A. P. PHAROAH
tracked three wide around both turns and never responded to urging. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH fractious in the gate, reserved in the early going, saved
ground around the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DANCE TO THE MUSIC was off alertly to begin, set the pace up the backstretch, led two wide into the lane and drew off in the final furlong. BICAMERAL
forwardly placed in the early going, traveled three to four wide into the stretch and held the place. MIRASOL chased inside then two wide leaving the turn
and got outkicked for the place. MITIGATION tracked four wide into the turn, four to five wide into the stretch and weakened. PEANUT BUTTER CUP
brushed the inside part of the gate then got bothered from inside at the start, traveled well off the pace, went three wide into the lane and failed to menace.
HONOR IT was off slow and lost path at the start, angled in and saved ground on the turn and never made an impact. BRIMAGE broke out, traveled along
the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch and was never a factor. SOUL OF A WARRIOR broke out, chased from outside, went four wide through the
turn and faded.

Footnotes
UNITED in range early in the two path, traveled between runners on the far turn, entered the lane three wide, dug in late outside SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT
and drove past. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT was closest in pursuit early on, drew alongside past the three-eighths, headed rival at the quarter pole, took over
leaving that turn, cleared rival in upper stretch, led into deep stretch but could fend off the winner in the final sixteenth. COUNT AGAIN settled at the back,
saved ground through the turns, steered out in the stretch and gained ground late. VINTAGE PRINT stalked the pacesetter on the inside, angled to the two
path on the far turn, chased between rivals in upper stretch and could not find the needed late kick. AWARD WINNER sped to the front and moved to the
inside, felt pressure at the five-sixteenths, held a narrow lead with a quarter mile remaining, surrendered the lead late on the far turn and weakened along
the inside in the stretch. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE stalked three wide outside rivals, entered the stretch four wide and lacked a rally. SAY THE WORD
raced off the pace in the two path early, shifted to the three path leaving the final turn and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
MADONE unhurried in the early stages in the two path, angled five wide leaving the second bend, closed well while drifting in and edged the runner-up.
GOING GLOBAL (IRE) settled along the inside, waited briefly for room around the far turn, bumped with rival in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole and
could not hold off the winner. TETRAGONAL (IRE) tracked in the two path, moved inside on the backstretch, shifted out at the quarter pole, bumped with
GOING GLOBAL in upper stretch, bid between with a furlong to go but could not find the needed late kick. KARAKATSIE brushed leaving the gate, sat well
off the pace outside a rival, steadied behind TETRAGONAL at the quarter pole, lacked room in upper stretch, moved to a clear path and finished willingly.
JIBBER JABBER (IRE) came away step slow, tucked inside early, saved ground into the stretch, tipped to the two path in the lane and summoned a mild
rally. DRAMATIZER raced at the back of the pack, swung five wide into the stretch and kept on to advance. FREEDOM FLYER tracked in the two path,
angled four wide into the lane, bid between at the eighth pole but weakened. PIZZAZZ stalked the pace on the inside, bid outside and took over late on the
far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch but weakened in the late stages. NIMBOSTRATUS (FR) brushed with inner rival at the start, dueled around the first
turn then cleared into the backstretch, challenged around the far turn, lost the lead entering the stretch, was crowded in upper stretch and weakened.
EQUILOVE (IRE) dueled for the lead around the first turn from inside, ceded command and switch off the rail on the backstretch, ridden along on the far turn
and faded in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING TETRAGONAL AND KARAKATSIE, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH
TETRAGONAL SHIFTED OUT SLIGHTLY AT THE QUARTER POLE IT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
SWEET SOULMATE sped to the front and angled to the two path, inched away on the turn, padded the lead in upper stretch, led clear into the final
sixteenth and was able to hold on. PASITO unhurried in the beginning, went six wide into the turn, advanced outside rivals while drifting further out, entered
the stretch eight wide, rallied steadily through the final furlong and just missed. BIG PASSION chased outside a trio of rivals up the backstretch, exited the
turn five wide and gained the show. TRAFFIC STOPPER raced up close outside the leader, chased three wide through the turn, failed to find a late bid and
got edged for the show honors. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD bumped with inside rival at the start, tracked four to five wide on the turn and moved up in the lane.
ANGEL'S ADVOCATE took an awkward step along the inside early, chased the leader from the rail to the turn, saved ground into the lane and weakened.
DARING CAT broke well then dropped back to stalk five deep, came six wide into the stretch and flattened out. PLUM WILD stalked three deep early,
between into the turn, two wide into the stretch and could not rally. HEART RIVER bumped with outside rival at the start, took the turn two then three wide
and failed to menace. QUEEN VERRAZANO traveled along the inside, came out into the stretch and was never a factor. SEASON TO REMEMBER lacked
room between rivals behind the leader early, moved to the inside on the turn and had little left for the stretch run.
