Footnotes
ROCKET COLONY chased outside, raced in the four path of the turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole then drew away the final sixteenth. NOBLE EL
SID cleared the field and angled to the inside to set the pace, was pressured at the rail through the turn, caught past the eighth pole, though, held on for
second. ROCKET BLUE chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly. GHOST MINE chased toward the inside, raced in the three path
of the turn and finished evenly. SUN AND SALT lacked room and was kept in check most of the opening three sixteenths of a mile, came through the turn
about the four path, drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little in the lane. WE GOT THE MONEY was steadied early and never factored.
CLASSY SMITTY came away well but was taken steadily back from contention, bore out into the turn, eased at the mid point of the turn and walked off post
race.

most of the turn, drifted nearing the top of the lane but dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. TRIPLE BAD chased through the
backstretch and improved steadily near the rail on the turn, dug in for second mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. BLACK CANDY bobbled at
the break then picked up the chase three wide, challenged leaving the five sixteenths pole, was carried to the four path approaching the head of the lane
then flattened the final sixteenth. ROCKET APPEAL chased, raced in the three path of the turn then flattened. BARNSTORM raced well back and outside
early, rounded the turn about the three path, angled back to the outside in the upper stretch and passed a fading rival. STRONG SAFETY raced with the

Footnotes
MOONLIT NIGHT stalked two deep and took the lead approaching the three eighths pole, was headed at the five sixteenths pole and contested near even
terms at the rail on the far turn, dug in to recover the advantage past the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged to hold on. JEFFERY SCOTT settled just
off the pace about the three path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still
in the three path and dug in to take second the final yards. BLACK STEEL rounded the first turn in the four path and settled close three wide into the
backstretch, challenged from the three eighths pole and took the nod approaching the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep on the far turn but gave
up the nod past the eighth pole and relented later yards. J J WEDGIT MAN raced in the three path the first turn and settled back outside leaving the turn, bid
toward the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, angled to the five path into the lane and passed a rival. UNLEASH ME set the early pace
inside, was caught approaching the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn. LUNAR IMAGE rated close inside the
opening turn then faded through the backstretch. KICKIN' KIRBY was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROCKIN ANNA ROLLIN rated the pace inside, was pressured into the turn and raced at the rail through the turn then steadily handled in the stretch.
SUPER WILDCAT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, dueled to turn back Lavello from the head of the lane and held on for
second. URKILLINGMEBETH chased toward mid track, rounded the turn about the four path, dug in through the lane to take third the final yards and was
gaining on the runner-up. LAVELLO was bumped off stride at the break then picked up the chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn
then flattened the final furlong. MISS OREILEY gave chase toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn then flattened in the lane. SINGLE MOM
gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and never factored. LINEAGE broke out to make solid contact with Lavello leaving the gate, gave chase toward the
outside and raced in the six path of the turn. DOMS LADY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened.
