Footnotes
GREEK GEEK sat in striking position from the three path, moved up alongside REGAL MIX to challenge the lead nearing the quarter pole, drifted in leaving
the final turn gaining a slim lead, was kept under steady handling through the stretch and held safely. REGAL MAX saved ground while showing the way
through the backstretch, was confronted into the final turn by GREEK GEEK, lost path along the rail then checked, angled out quickly and applied pressure
to the end. ALL UNDER CONTROL allowed to settle early racing three wide and was unable to improve position through the stretch. ZICATELA tracked
inside and lacked a response when called upon. SHIMSHINE never reached contention. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of REGAL
MAX against the rider of GREEK GEEK alleging interference in the stretch run was upheld. GREEK GEEK was disqualified and placed second for
interference to REGAL MAX.

Footnotes
FINALLY GOTTCHA vied for the early lead under a snug hold, dueled through the final turn inside of IMPOSING CAT, responded to encouragement into the
stretch drive and edged away. IMPOSING CAT broke alertly outside, contested the lead in the far turn, gained a short advantage then rider lost crop after
the quarter pole, was kept under a strong hand rider through the stretch but was unable to fend of the winner in the final stages. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT
squeezed out leaving, chased outside leaving the backstretch, rallied evenly through the stretch and held well for show. GEM ALTA bumped hard away,
saved ground through the backstretch, shifted out to the four path at the quarter pole and bid belatedly. JOVIAL DESTINY bumped leaving the gate,
reserved off the pacesetters and lacked rally needed. MY LUCKY MARK sandwiched leaving, chased outside and failed to threaten. GOTTCHA COWBOY
broke out into JOVIAL DESTINY, chased inside and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
LIA'S ON TUNE took command quickly, showed the way through the backstretch from the three path, held good margins into the lane and went uncovered
late. MARYAM sat in striking distance outside, angled in to the three path into the far turn and was no match for the winner. MADE FOR MORE tracked
inside from the two path, rallied through stretch inside of MARAM and weakened. FLASHY SISTER lagged early and lodged a late mild bid. KENSINGTON
MARKET allowed to settle from the four path and lacked a kick under urging. ENTITLED STAR saved from rail and showed a mild interest late under
encouragement. INSTANT WYN sat mid pack outside and faded early. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY stalked the pace from the five path, went in pursuit of the
lead into the final turn and wilted. TIMER MALFUNCTION- Hand timed due to timer malfunction.

RED CHOCOLATE brushed leaving then trailed, advanced quickly along the rail in the far turn, angled out to the three path and won going away. WEDGE
POND broke outward, set a pressured pace inside, was under attack at the three sixteenth marker and held place. DOUGS PAL attended the pace from five
path, came under heaving urging but was unable to improve position through the stretch. NEVVARE lagged early and rallied belatedly. TORCHLIGHT
bumped leaving, chased the early pacesetters, lugged out leaving the final turn and flattened out in stretch. COASTING GHOST raced in close quarters
from along the rail early and failed to threaten. RISING REVOLUTION chased pacesetters leaving the backstretch, was carried out in the final turn and gave
way. HERE COMES BARNEY hustled between early, was unable to move on with foes and stopped.

AWESOME GIGI sat just off the pace in traffic leaving the backstretch, shifted out to the two path in the final turn, swept the lead then responded to
challenge from CAPA BELLA and refused to relinquish control. CAPA BELLA attended the pace while four wide, raced three wide through the far turn, was
set down for a drive into the stretch rallied determinedly outside and just missed. TOP DEMON away slow, took closer order into the final turn, bid steadily
through stretch and earned show honors. SMILE MARY settled off the early pacesetters, rallied through stretch and missed. DEVIL'S STRIKE pressed three
to four wide, was unable to move on with rivals after the quarter pole and weakened. MARACOCA'S DREAM tracked inside, raced in close quarters then
was shuffled back into the opening turn and gave way. DYNAMITE DIVA showed little. SANDY BEACH set the pace from just off the rail, was quickly
overtaken at the quarter pole and stopped. SMOKEDYA reluctant to load and was never involved.

Footnotes
FLORIST raced in second flight under a snug hold in the early stages, waited patiently for running room nearing the quarter pole, swung out five wide then
continued to improve outside, continued her rally and held gamely under steady pressure. A RING 'N A ROSE sat in striking distance in the four path,
circled the field into the lane, rallied steadily outside under steady urging and missed. NICE BROWN GIRL tracked five wide through the backstretch, fanned
four wide through the turn, came under heavy urging through the stretch and was edged out late. IRISH LUNA emerged the leader leaving the chute,
contested the pace from the two path and flattened through the stretch. CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT pressed while four wide, fanned three wide into the far
turn and left little in reserve for the drive. PORT PROTECTION lagged behind early and passed tiring. EDGE OF OKOTOKS prompted the pace from the
two path and yielded with a furlong remaining.

Footnotes
STONE CARVER took command quickly then continued to show the way through the backstretch while three to four wide, responded to looming threat after
the quarter pole and race clear. EXPLODE secured a rail position leaving the chute, tracked inside, drove between at the quarter pole, chased through the
stretch but was unable to reach the winner and finished second best. GO AWAY raced wide leaving the chute, sat in range through the backstretch, angled
in to the three path through the far turn and ran down rival late. DEUCES ARE WILD sat just off the pace outside, went in pursuit from the five sixteenth
marker and weakened through the stretch. TROOPER JOHN was never far back outside, raced three wide leaving the backstretch and was unable to
improve position through the drive. RAIL HUGGER raced near the back of the pack while three wide, lodged a rail bid and evened out. PARKING PERMIT
trailed the field and passed tiring. WHISKEY BOUND broke well and was outrun throughout.

BUCK WEST emerged the leader leaving the chute, dueled inside of RAILWAY leaving the backstretch, gained the advantage at the quarter pole then
widened when asked. DOC COPE lagged, shifted outside into the final turn, closed steadily outside and was along late for place. PULL THE PIN broke
alertly, chased wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide through the far turn, rallied outside and was caught late. MARANGO allowed to settle early,
cut the corner, lodged a rail bid and weakened late. LITTLE CHICAGO raced greenly leaving the chute and lacked a serious bid. CLASSY BUCK rallied
belatedly. RAILWAY vied outside of BUCK WEST, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and faded steadily soon after. ICE BOX INDY raced
wide early, raced four wide in the turn and faded. FIRST PRINCE hurried early and dropped back.
