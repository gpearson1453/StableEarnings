Footnotes
IRONIT sprinted clear soon after the start along the inside, extended that advantage through the lane, continued to hold a comfortable advantage past the
furlong marker, held the runner up safe late while being kept to task. SERAPE chased the winner off the inside, roused for the drive, slowly getting to that
rival late. CUPIE CUTIE went evenly paced throughout in proving no match to the top two. ST JOSEPHINE broke with the field then veered out soon after,
fell far back when sluggish, never close.

Footnotes
LITTLE TOE broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, long, extended drive, edged away late under steady handling. WARRIORS GEM moved up
inside to duel with the winner, continued to alternate for the lead into and through the turn, continued on equal terms past the furlong marker, could not
match strides late, narrowly gained the nod to hold the place. I'LL RAISE YOU last away, moved up to race in mid pack up the backstretch while saving
ground, moved out and came three wide for the drive, mild rally while remaining out in the strip to miss the second spot. STORMATION away in good order,
fell back soon after, improved toward the inside turn, flattened out a bit in the drive to finish up evenly. GENERAL TONE within striking distance while three
wide up the backstretch, fell back three wide through the turn and failed to menace in the drive. TEN SILVER PINS trailed most of the way and was never a
threat. TENSAS TALK tired after racing four wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
STAR FASHION broke in to bother inner rivals and be last away, raced unhurried the opening half, moved closer along the inside late backstretch, steered
out when continuing that rally midway on the final turn, came three out to four wide into the straight, closed with good resolve to be up in time. NIN TO WIN
settled off the early pace, second flight between horses onto the backstretch, asked along and advanced into the lane, challenged between horses and
inside the winner late, outkicked for the win, prevailed for the second spot. PRISSY JADEN pinched at the start, quickly recovered to clear into the first turn,
showed the way up the backstretch, shook well clear past the furlong marker, caved in late to be caught by the top two. SHOP AROUND broke out to help
tighten up a couple of outer rivals, raced back, improved position without posing a threat to the top three. ARMED MISSILE raced closest to the leader for
seven furlongs, had little left the final furlong. TOSHITA FOREVER pinched at the start, recovered to race within striking distance four a half, weakened.
DOBBY SUE five vied into the first turn, remained back. CAUSEWAYCAT stopped after a half, finished far back while jogging in. FRACTIONAL TIMES
UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
INVASORS WIND in mid pack early off the inside, asked along in the three path second turn, rallied into the stretch, drifted a bit nearing the furlong
grounds, then continued willingly to the wire to be in time. HONOR MY SPEED away best of all, vied up front for a half between horses, shook clear far turn,
continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, well clear of the others. LIAM SKYE raced behind the first flight
early off the inside, moved closer to the runner up far turn, chased that one through upper stretch, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly. TAKEN
BACK last to leave, raced five wide into the first turn, continued outside, five wide again through much of the second turn when improving a bit late in that
bend, lacked a further advance stretch. EASTSIDE BOY lacked early foot in trailing early, continued lacked speed in the run up the backstretch, in some
traffic late in the second bend, improved position through the stretch without posing a serious threat. SUPER FACTOR four wide into the first turn,raced in
mid pack up the backstretch, four wide again through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch in failing to muster a closing response. SILENT
FORCE broke back, lacked speed, improved somewhat the middle half then flattened out in the drive. MIDNIGHT REVOLT vied up front early along the
inside, gave way after a half. CARRIER PIGEON with the pace while three wide for a half, also backed up. ICE CRUSH finished early, five wide when
beginning to be eased turning for home, walked in. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SARAH ADRIANA asked a bit early to keep up with the leader, chased that one into and through the turn, took over nearing the furlong grounds, kicked
clear under pressure. CANDY'S PARADE raced toward the front off the inside, set down for the drive, finished up willingly to be clear for the place, no match
for the winner. SAKURA ALEXA last away, lacked early speed, improved while saving ground to the lane, steered out, lugged in badly late under a repeated
right handed crop to bother a tiring MAGIC APRIORITY, clear of that one at the wire. MAGIC APRIORITY broke in good order, cleared toward the inside,
showed the way into and through the turn, appeared to be tiring in upper stretch when she struck a good with three sixteenths remaining, continued to
weaken when bothered by a lugging SAKURA ALEXA late. VALERIE LOUISE broke back, void of early foot, saved ground turn, staged a mild rally to
improve position, not a serious threat. SHANGHAI HETTY in mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked a closing kick. AMIRITE broke back, raced four
wide most of the way, failed to muster a rally. PHANTOM POINT was never involved. TENACIOUS FAITH in the second flight early, faded through the
stretch. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MAGIC APRIORITY AGAINST SAKURA ALEXA FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
THIRSTY WIND last away, trailed out of the chute, moved out when continuing to lack speed into the turn, came four wide into the lane, outside bid, wore
down the two leaders late under firm handling. SPECIAL STORM with the pace while between foes up the backstretch and into the turn, dueled stretch,
gave ground grudgingly late while once again between horses. HOPE FOR CHANGE moved up inside to contest the issue out of the chute, dueled inside
the runner up into and through upper stretch, also proved stubborn to the end. MARVINS GOLD broke back when a bit rank, settled in mid pack, failed to
mount a serious closing response in the drive while slowly getting to the first flight at the wire. UNBRIDLED PULPIT remained back in failing to menace.
BEAUX VICTORY with the pace for a half while three wide, gave way midway on the turn. MARKS SAINT chased the first flight early, backed up through
the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGERBEACH closest to leader off the inside, continued to pursue that one into the far turn, advanced and engaged that same rival entering the straight, put
that same foe away inside the sixteenth pole, enough left to hold off the runner up late. MUCH CLASS settled off the pace and the inside, rallied from
between foes into the lane, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late while outside that one. EBRIO broke on top, set a somewhat relaxed pace while
alone on the lead for a half, picked up the tempo into the far turn, responded when challenged by the winner nearing midstraight, proved stubborn to the
end. FREEDOM FACTOR settled off the pace, advanced closer three wide second turn, flattened out a bit in the late going to lack a winning punch.
CHAOSMOS forwardly placed while off the inside, remained in a striking position turning for home, came up empty the final furlong to also be lacking at the
end. PINCH ASSAULT remained back in failing to mount a rally. I'M D'CAT in mid pack in the early going, had little left for the stretch run. OLD SOT
remained back in failing to threaten. FULL OF RUN last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
OOPS WEDIDITAGAIN fell well back soon after the start, continued to lag into the turn, saved ground into the lane, rallied up the rail to be in time. SAILING
JETT settled off the pace, improved in the two path out of the turn, engaged the early leader from the outside with a sixteenth remaining, put that foe away
in the final strides but could not contain the winner. FONZIE SCHEME broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, clear into the stretch, drifted out with
a furlong remaining, weakened to be caught by the top two late. WESTERN STAR settled off the pace, came four wide out of the turn, found lacking the final
furlong while remaining widest in the run to the wire. SCHEMER prompted the pace for five furlongs off the inside, four wide and between foes into the lane,
had little for the drive. BOORNAZIAN pressed the issue for five furlongs off the inside, faltered in the drive. EL WARD fell back soon after the start and
trailed throughout to be always outrun.
