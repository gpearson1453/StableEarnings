Footnotes
LEFT COAST DREAMS rated off the early pace, went for the lead two wide on the second bend, was brushed several times while battling outside LEE'S
LUCK through the lane but edged ahead the final sixteenth. LEE'S LUCK broke on top, was sent to a clear lead and the inside, allowed to relax through the
first turn and backstretch, roused when challenged on the second bend, was drifting out some and brushed several times with LEFT COAST DREAMS as
he fought that one to keep the advantage in the stretch but had to settle for second best. VENKMAN settled at the back and along the rail, picked up his
pace on the second turn, swung out widest for the stretch run, closed well but was too late. MCHENRY rated just outside LEFT COAST DREAMS through
the early going, also bid for the lead on the second bend but began to yield into the lane. Due to a malfunction, the half mile fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
BOWS N LACE rated from outside, commenced her bid three wide on the second bend, was carried out some entering the lane, jostled by EFFLORESCE
as those two vied for the lead upper stretch, lugged in some inside the final furlong, jostled several times with the latter and edged ahead. EFFLORESCE
crowded briefly at the start, soon shared the lead between rivals, took over two wide on the second turn, drifted out some into the lane, drifted out into
BOWS N LACE upper stretch, jostling with that one, was angled back in, jostled by the latter a couple times and forced inward inside the last eighth, did not
relent but had to settle for second best. BETTER ANGELS was kept close from inside, came off the rail approaching the final two furlongs, threatened two
wide midstretch, lacked the needed late kick and had to alter out when her path was taken in the waning yards. FANCY EMPRESS bore out at the start,
bumping solidly with MAGNITUDE TEN, she and her rider quickly recovered to set a pressured pace from inside, did not keep up on the second turn, closed
the gap some upper stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going and was checked when her path narrowed leaving the seventy yard marker.
MAGNITUDE TEN was bumped solidly and forced out some at the break, raced in contention between rivals for a half mile then began to fade. The rider of
FANCY EMPRESS lodged an objection alleging interference from BETTER ANGELS deep stretch. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim
of foul. Due to a malfunction, the half mild fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
BUBBA CABALLO rated on the outside, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, took over inside the last furlong then drew off with little asking the final
sixteenth. TAZ ATTACK moved clear on the backstretch, took the rail into the bend, was challenged upper stretch, no match for BUBBA CABALLO the final
eighth but proved clearly second best. MAC PANDOWDY pressed from inside on the backstretch, backed up some from just off the rail on the turn, was no
match for the top pair when set down for the drive but lasted for the show. AWESOME SKIPPY forwardly placed from inside, did not keep up on the bend,
swung to the outside leaving the turn and failed to have a significant stretch response. BRIANS WAY reluctant to load, broke somewhat slowly, was also an
early factor, faded from just off the inside on the turn, was forced to the outside to stay clear of AWESOME SKIPPY leaving the bend, angled in midstretch
and continued to yield. DROOP'S M D B failed to menace.

A BOLD RYDE rated on the front end in tight quarters along the rail, moved clear when asked on the second turn, drifted out to the middle of the track as he
was put to a drive leaving the quarter pole then continued to open up while kept to task to the wire. LONESOME DREAM brushed several times with A
BOLD RYDE as he contested the pace on the backstretch, did not keep up on the second bend, drifted out some upper stretch, was corrected and held his
position. B'S TURNING POINT was steadied behind LONESOME DREAM when he lost his path going to the first turn, chased from outside, angled in on
the second bend and had no late bid.

SUMMER'S WINNER was hustled briefly from the start, set a pressured pace from inside, moved clear on the bend, opened up under a drive in the lane
and was kept to urging to the wire. KIPPER DOODLE vied for the lead outside SUMMER'S WINNER, did not keep up on the bend, drifted out to path four
entering the lane then could only hold her position in the late going. TIZ HOPPIN progressed from outside to gain third and have a striking position three
wide on the turn, lost ground staying outside KIPPER DOODLE into the stretch, lacked a significant bid but was unchallenged for the show. AFOOLER
moved to the inside early on and failed to have a late bid. TAPALONG was an early factor but faded between rivals on the bend.

Footnotes
LOUIE P rated off the early speed, picked up her pace three wide on the turn, rallied in the lane to gain the advantage nearing the last sixteenth, moved
clear then was wrapped up the last seventy yards under confident handling. TOTALLY DOVISH was hustled to a clear lead and the inside, challenged
approaching the end of the first quarter mile, moved clear again when urged upper stretch but did not have enough left inside the final eighth. SEE GRACE
FLY BY broke alertly, positioned herself behind TOTALLY DOVISH on the backstretch, came off the inside some on the turn and failed to have a serious
stretch bid. GO LITTLE GERT GO advanced from outside to vie for the lead nearing the half mile marker then gradually wore down between rivals for the
drive.

Footnotes
HIDDEN FIGURE altered off the inside early on, was put to urging three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, engaged PRINCESS
MANDII nearing the last sixteenth and edged ahead in the waning yards. PRINCESS MANDII was kept close between horses, commenced her bid two wide
on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, gained the lead upper stretch, challenged approaching the final sixteenth, fought gamely, lacked the extra
needed but was easily best of the others. NEXT TIME YOU WIN without early speed, was two wide on the bend, fanned out behind PRINCESS MANDII for
the stretch run and steadily progressed between horses to gain third nearing the wire. ABBMAR steadily angled in as she vied for the early lead, moved
clear nearing the half mile pole but flattened out for the drive. PRETTY GITA steadily angled in trying to keep a clear path inside ABBMAR the first furlong
and a half, did not keep up just off the inside through the bend and gave way the last quarter mile. NO LETTIN GO was an early factor but gave way from
inside before finishing three furlongs. SOUTHERN ATTACK raced in contention from outside on the backstretch but faded widest on the turn.
