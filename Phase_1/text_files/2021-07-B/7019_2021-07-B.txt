Footnotes
PLAY UP chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and drove
past and finished clear at the wire. AFLEETING IDEA vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, shook clear after mid-turn, widened into the lane, was
joined by the winner near the eighth pole then yielded to that one while staying on for the place spot. RED LIAISON vied for the early lead two wide into the
turn, settled back to chase the pace through the turn while moving closer to the inside, shifted from the rail to the three path outside the eighth pole then
could only manage a mild gain. SKY LIBERTY was in the four path through the turn and never factored. GO RODNEY raced in the three to the two path
through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) set the pace through the turn while in the two path, came into the lane from the three path with a clear lead, maintained the
advantage in mid-stretch, drifted from the three to the six path through the final eighth and just lasted. STRONG ODOR was four wide and in the five path
through the turn, came into the with momentum and in the seven path then finished full of run to be closing in to the wire. FOREIGN EXCHANGE chased
the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was gaining to the end. PICANTE CALIENTE chased the winner
through the turn and into the lane while in the four path, had aim inside the eighth pole, was not gaining on the top one when path closed, steadied and was
done. KYNANCE (IRE) was never a factor while in the two path into the lane. PURRFECTLY CLAIRE was along the inside into the lane and tired. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #5 PICANTE CALIENTE AGAINST THE RIDER OF #4 THREATLEVELMIDNITE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
METALLIC MAN chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane while in the three path, caught the leader outside the eighth pole
and edged clear. SPINEL pressed the pacesetter two wide through the turn, moved clear in late turn, dueled with the winner after straightening in the lane,
yielded to that one near the eighth pole then kept on well be be clear for the place spot. HUMBLE WARRIOR was along the inside through the turn, came
into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. CORNER TAP was near the rail through the turn, angled into the seven path for the drive, gained
momentum inside the eighth pole and finished well. VENICE BEACH was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and lacked
the needed response. ON THE RAYDAR set the pace until after mid-turn then gave way once headed nearing the five-sixteenths pole. PABLO'S SUN was
bothered and forced in at the start, raced in the three path through the turn then improved position through the lane. MOTION TO ADJOURN was never a
threat while racing near the rail through the turn and into the lane. JUST PHIL was never a factor while in the two path. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE raced in the
three path through the turn and steadily faded. FIRING RANGE was bumped at the start, raced in the five path through the turn when near the back and
never factored. TRAVELINJUSTICE made little impact while saving ground.
