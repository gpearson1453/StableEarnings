Footnotes
CRAIGVILLE BEACH away well, set the fractions along the rail, responded when asked and then wrapped up late for the win. JUST GOT HITCHED broke
slow, tracked along the rail, continued inside on the last turn, appeared to be blocked by the winner nearing the quarter pole, waited, swung out, asked but
the winner was gone. SIMMA CUM LAUDE unhurried along the two path, took the rail on the last turn, angled out and made a mild gain. DUCK POND
ROAD tracked along the two path to the top of the lane, chased and weakened. GUERRERON broke slow, in hand along the three path, angled out and
weakened. ECONOMIC POLICY broke slow, four wide on the turns and tired.

Footnotes
FULLFAITHANDCREDIT contested the lead from between along the three path to the top of the lane, battled with the advantage leaving the furlong marker
and then outran LOVER'S LEAP to the wire. LOVER'S LEAP well placed along the rail into the turn, waited for room leaving the five-sixteenths pole, angled
out when clear, asked, gained but it was too late. DEAN VERDILE broke two lengths slow, five wide early, four wide on the turn, angled wide and rallied.
ROCKY RIVER fractious in the gate, contested the lead along the two path nearest the rail, battled inside in the lane and faded. STONE HEART well placed
along the two path into the turn, angled four wide entering the lane and failed to rally. BOBCAT contested the lead four across early, three across four wide
nearing the top of the lane and weakened. ROLL WITH MY POSSE in hand along the two path early, took the rail on the turn with one beat, angled widest
of all and failed to take part. ONE SUMMER NITE two path on the turn and tired. FORECASTER five wide early, four wide on the turn and finished wide.
