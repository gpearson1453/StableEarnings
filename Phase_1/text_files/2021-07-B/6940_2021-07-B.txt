SHO U RIGHT chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path then steadily improved to get up the final yards. WHO'S YOUR DADDY closed along
the rail to take the lead at the five sixteenths pole, widened through the turn, came under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught in the final
yards. U R THE LUCKY ONE chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane. SWEET PIPER chased
inside and finished evenly at the rail. ERICA JANE chased, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened the final furlong. SPEEDING TICKET gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path, though, showed little further. BRONX PRINCESS set the pace most of the opening quarter
mile, was caught at the five sixteenths pole, continued in close chase to the quarter pole, then faded at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
HARDSCRATCH broke in to make sharp contact with Chopra then angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met toward the nine sixteenths pole and meted
her speed to regain the edge past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then drew off under steady encouragement through the stretch.
MY WAY OR ELSE was pinched back leaving the gate and settled back toward the inside the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
improved in the three path of the far turn, then dug in through the lane to take second later yards. SHARP'S MISSION stalked the earlier pace then took the
lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, was caught past the three eighths but remained a close factor two deep on the far turn, then flattened the final
sixteenth. MOLLY BOLTS rounded the opening turn about the three path and raced well back leaving the turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, came between horses into the stretch and improved her position. SARAH BELLUM accelerated to
contention to stalk the pace in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the three path of the far turn. I'M EXCEE saved
early ground, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, though weakened in the four path of the far turn. CHOPRA broke outward to make solid contact with
Hardscratch and raced boxed in through the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. MOONLIGHT
MISS stumbled leaving the gate and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened into the far turn. The
Stewards posted the inquiry to review the start of this race, though, made no change. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
ANNA ROCKS took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure at the seven sixteenths pole and contested the advantage nearest the rail on
the far turn, then dug in under determined stretch handling to inch clear of KINKY FROLIC, who stalked the pace and challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage two deep, remained a factor through the upper stretch then, grudgingly, relented the final
sixteenth. MISS BEE HIVING came away slowly and saved ground the first turn, bid past the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran
evenly in the lane. MIDNIGHT FLING stalked three wide then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter
pole then weakened in the stretch. CHOSEN MISS rounded the opening turn about the three path, raced well off the pace into the backstretch and showed
little response. FORT ZANNA rated back inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. VOLNAY raced four
wide the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened in the four path of the far turn. BOTTLE COURAGE showed little response.
CROOKED WAYS ran in the four path the first turn and never factored. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED RUBY angled in to stalk the runner-up then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage
while two deep, took the nod approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear inside the sixteenth pole and widened later yards. LADY MACHO rated a short
lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the far turn near the rail, gave up the advantage toward the head of the lane, but
dueled close in the upper stretch before relenting the final sixteenth. PARCHED GHOST stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, faded at the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. POLISHED COPPER settled back in the two and three paths on the first turn,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little further. FONDA ROMANA rated off the pace inside the first turn,
bid toward the three eighths pole then weakened leaving the far turn. WEDDING DAY KITTEN was not a factor and OLIVE'S BUMPA, was also not a factor.

UNDENIABLE TOUCH pressured the early pace three wide then took the lead two deep leaving the quarter pole, dueled clear in the upper stretch and was
steadily encouraged to hold on. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION pressured the pace and raced a close factor in the three path of the turn, took over second past
the eighth pole and was gaining on the winner. GARY DOING BIZ chased and rounded the turn just off the rail, got up for third nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished evenly. ADDY'S LOVE gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the four path of the turn, angled six wide into the lane and finished evenly.
SUPER MALIBU lacked early speed and rounded the turn about the five path, raced outside into the lane and was closing well late. WOLF CREEK PASS
contested the pace with a slim advantage but was caught past the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. BREWSTER FLATS chased and rounded the
turn about the five path, then flattened. K K CAN pressured the early pace inside, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
turn and weakened.

BUBBA GRUMP took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn, drew clear into the lane and held on well with steady handling. BROTHER CORBIN rated off the pace inside the first turn then eased outward
into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then angled to the four path into the lane and dug in to take second
later yards. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the
far turn, was carried out into the lane but finished well to take third the final yards. SOCIAL CHIC contested the early pace then stalked into the first turn,
challenged leaving the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. MOSS BOSS rounded the opening
turn in the four and five paths, raced well back from the half mile pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths, improved in the five path of the far turn then
passed rivals outside. MACY'S BOY raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
then weakened. OUT OF CENTS came through the first turn about the four path then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, though, flattened in the three path of the far turn. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE saved ground. HARBOUR TOWN stalked the earlier pace in the three path,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, but checked off the heels of Macy's Boy nearing the quarter pole, and gave way.

HE'S NOT CURLY saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and
took the lead while lugging in a path at the eighth pole, then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR saved early
ground then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining
on the winner. THE IRON BANK settled back off the rail the first turn, eased slightly out with a bid into the backtretch and improved at the rail on the far turn,
angled to the three path into the lane then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. ROSAS WAY came through the first turn in the four path, bid into the
backstretch and ran in the three path of the far turn, eased to the five path into the lane and finished well. KATMAN QUICK set the early pace inside, was
caught nearing the nine sixteenths pole and engaged in close chase from that point, but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and weakened the final
furlong. FLY E DUBAI stalked the early pace off the rail, took the lead approaching the nine sixteenths pole and contested the advantage nearest the rail on
the far turn, was checked off the inside flank of He's Not Curley while giving up the lead at the eighth pole, and gave way. GOODBYESEEULATER rated
close to the early pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the five path of the far turn.
CABO HEADACHE ran in the five path the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. CATONSVILLE rounded the first turn in
the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. This race was hand timed.
