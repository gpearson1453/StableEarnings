the lane and offered a mild gain while never a threat to the top two. RUN RUDY RUN chased the pace from the three path through the turn then tired after
entering the lane. PUNCTUATION was in the two path while chasing the pace through the far turn and tired. VICTOR'S MAJESTY chased the pace from the

DANCE MONEY set the pace from the outset while in the two path, cleared in mid-turn, continued to be clear with an eighth to go and was all out to the wire
to last. LIEUTENANT KITTY unhurried while along the inside through the turn and into the lane, rallied from the two path, was closing in with every stride
and just missed. STRONG ILLUSION stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn, was well placed into the lane then lacked the needed closing
response. FORBIDDEN FRUIT chased the pace from the two path then the three path through the far turn and weakened in the drive. STARLET EXPRESS
stumbled at the start, settled to the back while off the inside, moved through the four or five path through the far turn and was done before entering the lane.

Footnotes
SHADOW OF JUSTICE settled off the early duel into the turn, bid four wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, swung into the lane with the lead, cleared
outside the eighth pole then was under strong handling to the end to hold. TWOBIRDSONESTONE stumbled at the start, settled back down the backstretch,
began moving up through the turn, swung into the lane from the six path with momentum and rallied the last eighth while drifting in a path or two. COMPLEX
JUSTICE vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, was on near even terms with the winner into the lane then could not keep up. SUNDAY DRIVE
raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, angled into the six path and never was a serious threat. CORBIN moved off
the rail approaching the lane, came into the stretch in the seven path and never was a factor. BRAVO EXPRESS chased the pace from along the inside
through the turn then faded through the lane. WYMAN vied for the lead two wide, was put in tight in late turn, checked near the quarter pole and dropped
back.

INDIGO RICH was clear early, vied outside of a foe, then gave way in the stretch. RILEY RICH stalked the early pace in the five path, rallied at the
three-quarter pole, went clear, then vied inside of a foe before giving way in the stretch. STAND AND SERVE was jostled at the start, raced inside and
