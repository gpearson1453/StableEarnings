Footnotes
SUTTON'S PASS prompted EXPLOSIVE SKIES from along the outside, took the lead from that one leaving the eighth pole and maintained a safe
advantage. PRETTY HEART was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. EXPLOSIVE SKIES saved
ground setting the pace to the eighth pole but lacked the needed late response. IMA N H LADY CAT saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out
to come three-wide into the stretch and went evenly. EVIL MATTERS was unhurried early, moved forward between horses on the backstretch, offered a
mild bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out. GET STORM AWAY was reserved off the early pace while racing four-wide and was not a threat.
EMPIRE DANCER dropped back while saving ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPEEDY DELIVERY dueled with CHANISA for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off entering the stretch to open a clear lead and maintained a
safe advantage. CHANISA dueled for the lead from the inside to the stretch, dropped back slightly, then responded to pressure to be gaining on the winner
at the wire in a game effort. EXPLICATE was bumped at the start by DAME JOVIALE, then dropped back early, rallied-wide into the stretch, angled out
slightly nearing the sixteenth pole and finished fast. MY MY MUNNY was prominently placed early while racing three-wide, angled out to be four-wide
entering the stretch but lacked a rally. PUNCHY GIRL saved ground while being allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and weakened late.
SEACHROME saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously threaten. DAME JOVIALE broke in to bump EXPLICATE, then settled in the
middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

ROCK STAR PARKING stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up nearing the quarter pole, took the lead approaching the eighth pole and was
ridden out to increase her advantage. ALBERTA SUN set the pressured pace while racing two-wide into the stretch, was unable to resist the winner but held
on fairly well for second. FAST AND FEMININE was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive
and finished in a mild rally. PRINCESS ELIN saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late.
VOW rushed up to vie for the lead from along the inside for three furlongs and weakened. FABRICATE was forward placed while racing four-wide, came
six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

MYSTERY IMPACT was prominently placed while racing three-wide, responded when asked to duel with NINE POINTER during the drive and prevailed
under strong handling. NINE POINTER was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly while four-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead
approaching the eighth pole while dueling with MYSTERY IMPACT from that point but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. BIG CITY HEAT
prompted the issue while racing two-wide, was no match for the top two but held on well for the show. EPIC THE LEGEND was close up early while racing
between horses, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. REITERATION saved ground while being forwardly placed but had no response when
asked. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE was unhurried early, moved up between horses on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position.
YOSHIDA'S IMPACT dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SCREAMIN PADDY saved ground while being allowed to
settle and was not a serious factor. PHILIP SNOW saved ground setting the pace to near the stretch and tired. RUNAWAY IMAGE raced five-wide and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
MOMMY JUICE vied with PATIENCE WORTH for the early lead from along the inside, dropped back after the opening quarter mile to stalk that one, slipped
through during the drive and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. PATIENCE WORTH vied for the early lead while two-wide, opened clear on the
the turn, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and was unable to resist the winner late. MISCHIEF LILY was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the
stretch and finished strongly. VERSIFY was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. STAGE BELL settled in
the middle of the field, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole in tight, dropped back, came five-wide into the stretch, drifted further out during the drive
and finished willingly. BIRDIE ROSE settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and lacked a rally. GRAY VIXEN was prominently placed while
racing two-wide for a half mile and weakened. LA CREMA saved ground while being allowed to settle, steadied off horses heels nearing the five-sixteenths
pole and was unable to recover in time. ROYAL DIAMOND was unhurried early while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a
factor. WICKED BEAUTIFUL dropped back while saving ground and failed to threaten.
