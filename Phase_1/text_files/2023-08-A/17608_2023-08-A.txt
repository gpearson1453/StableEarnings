CALYPSO PRINCESS was unhurried early, rallied four-wide the final quarter and finished fast to be up in the final strides. DAREDEVIL PRINCESS broke
out to bump SHERSECRETWEAPON, then prompted the early pace while two-wide, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear lead and
then just failed to last. LUVAHAPPYENDING was bump at the start then all to settle, rallied five-wide the final quarter and closed strongly.
SHESRSECRETWEAPON was bumped at the start, then was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide and finished in a mild rally. LONSDALEITE
settled in stride early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole but failed to threaten. A LITTLE GRACE quickly opened a clear lead, set the pace for
three furlongs and gave way. THE TRAINER OF SHERSCRETWEAPON LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAIN DAREDEVIL PRINCESS BUT AFTER
VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH..

HEART RIVER was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. MO CONNELLY was forwardly
placed from the start, moved up three-wide on the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly. SHESAHEATWAVE prompted
SQUARE FOOTAGE while two-wide, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held on well
during the drive for third. SQUARE FOOTAGE saved ground setting the early pace and weakened during the drive. KERRALIA was prominently placed
while racing along the inside but lacked a rally. DODROPIN was closed up early racing from between horses, gave way before going a half mile and was
eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
BEL RAGAZZO hopped in the air at the start, then was unhurried, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out three-wide leaving the three-sixteenths
pole, took the lead at the eighth pole and won drawing clear. RAAJIN RIBBON prompted BENNY THE JET from along the outside, gained a slight lead in
the stretch, was unable to resist the winner but continued on gamely for the place. BENNY THE JET saved ground setting the pressured pace into the
stretch and held on fairly well late for third. SOCAL RED was reserved off the early pace, angled out to be three-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a
rally. FREESTONE hopped at the start then was allowed to settle, came two-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. PROUD LION saved
ground while being allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and then weakened during the drive. PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE settled
in the middle of the field early while racing two-wide and was not a factor. THIRSTY KISS dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to
menace.

along the inside, responded during the drive and held on gamely to lose a tough decision. BAILS HIM OUT brushed at the start with PIRATE RED, vied for
the early lead from between horses, dropped back to stalk before going three furlongs, could not stay with the top two but held on well for the show. PEDAL
TO THE METAL was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch, ducked in nearing the eighth pole causing interference and finished willingly.
FOLLOWING A STEWARD INQUIRY PEDAL TO THE METAL WAS FROM FOURTH AND PLACED TENTH. PIRATE RED was brushed at the start, then
settled in the middle of the field, came three-wide into the stretch, was bumped nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly when clear. RAFIKKI was
prominent while racing three-wide on the turn, was bumped and carried in by PEDAL TO THE METAL and weakened. CINDER ZEE hopped at the start to
get away behind the field, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. TIGER TOO was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and

Footnotes
DUSALUT was prominently placed while racing three-wide, gained the lead at the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. PRINCE OF LUCK was
allowed to settle in stride, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. BOB'S SNIPER saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the
drive and closed strongly. LOCHNESS was forwardly placed while saving ground early, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late.
FAMOUS ROCK STAR dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and improved his position. CODE CHARLIE dueled for the lead with
ZACCHEUS while two-wide into the stretch and weakened. ZACCHEUS dueled with CODE CHARLIE from along the inside to the stretch and tired.
