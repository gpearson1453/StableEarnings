Footnotes
FREEBRITNEY set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, shook off TAKING CHARGE DESI entering the stretch and was ridden out to increase her
advantage. O'BABE was prominent early while racing along the inside, dropped back slightly on the turn, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. TAKING CHARGE DESI broke in to bump with ARTISTIC VISION, then prompted FREEBRITNEY from along the inside to the
stretch and weakened slightly late. ARTISTIC VISION broke out to bump with TAKE CHARGE DESI, then was forwardly placed, moved up three-wide to
offer her bid nearing the quarter pole and then faltered during the drive.

POLITICAL RIOT was allowed to settle early, moved up along the outside to take the lead after three furlongs, opened a clear advantage and maintained if
from there to the wire. JOKER MATT quickly opened a clear lead, set the pace for three furlongs, then stalked POLITICAL RIOT from that point and while
unable to reach him continued on gamely for the place. RELEASE THE BEAST was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild
rally. GHOST STALKER was allowed to settle while between horses but lacked a rally. CHEST CANDY was forwardly place early while racing three-wide
and weakened during the drive. PUSH THROUGH chased the pace from along the inside for a half mile and gave way.

DREAMING BIZ was prominent from the outset while racing three-wide, caught MIZZANNA nearing the eighth pole, dueled with that one to the wire and
prevailed under strong handling. MIZZANNA set the pace racing slightly removed from the rail, responded when challenged, came in slightly and held on
gamely during the drive. IMMINENT THREAT saved ground stalking the pace, moved closer along the inside entering the stretch, then checked nearing the
eighth pole in tight, angled out three-wide and finished willingly. SHES GOT THE POWER saved ground while being allowed to settle, came four-wide into
the stretch but lacked a rally. ROYAL BONUS was unhurried early, raced three-wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MARTINI BLU saved ground setting the pressure pace, opened a clear lead entering the stretch and gradually increased his advantage. DON'T BOX ME IN
prompted the early pace while racing four-wide on the backstretch, angled in entering the turn, could not stay with the winner during the drive but held on
well for the place. ZOFFA was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. SEEKING SPLENDOR
dropped back early while saving ground, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. BLACK LIMO was unhurried early, came five-wide into
the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. RUN LEA RUN saved ground while being reserved off the pace and failed to menace. SMOOTH SCAT saved
ground stalking the pace but lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) was prominently placed while racing three-wide, was bumped by COASTAL WATERS entering the stretch and carried out
five-wide, responded when clear and finished strongly to be in the final strides. MENDELSSOHN JOY vied for the lead while two-wide racing between
horses and held on gamely during the drive. COASTAL WATERS settled in the middle of the field while two-wide, came out for room entering the stretch
bumping MODERN SCIENCE, then offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole but wasn't quite good enough. COFFEE CALIENTE saved ground stalking the
pace, lacked room from the quarter pole into the stretch, angled out and finished willingly. MARK IN GREELEY was unhurried early, rallied 3-wide into the
stretch, angled in and then steadied nearing the eighth pole running up on horses, angled out and finished fairly well when clear. BOARD CERTIFIED
prompted the pace while three-wide and weakened during the drive. FUTURE PERFECT vied for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and tired.
