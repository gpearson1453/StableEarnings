Footnotes
FIGHTERTOWN set the pace early on, raced in the two path into the lane, repelled foe and drew away late in the stretch under a steady drive. TRICOLOUR
raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was up for place in the final stages. ROUNDBALL ROCK tracked the pace
early on, moved to near the rail down the backstretch, made a bid from the inside nearing the lane, was altered out in the stretch but weakened late and lost
place in the final stages. ORESTES was a tad slow at the start, chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run.
MO MOVES pressed the pace early while two wide, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. CAMBIASO trailed the field while
far back early on, raced in the three path into the lane and improved position. GOOD NEWS ROCKET stalked the pace early on while three wide, was in the
five path into the lane and empty late in the stretch. VALUABLE CARGO was bumped at the start and along the first turn while through after a half.
REPREHEND was a bit slow at the start and never a factor.

Footnotes
OUR DOTSIE settled off of the pace in the three path, launched a rally between horses turning for home, fanned to the six path entering the lane, offered a
steady grinding charge in pursuit of the leaders through the final furlong, ranged up to them to offer a late bid and forged an advantage at the wire. SCATLIE
stalked behind the top pair and from the three path, took aim outside of them and from the four path at the quarter pole, but lacked a strong kick in the five
path in upper stretch, produced a bid with a grinding charge nearing the final sixteenth, wrestled a margin approaching the wire but was outfinished by an
outer bidder at the wire. FANCY CABER NEIGH vied two wide, led in the three path in midstretch but was bested by a pair of outer foes late and saved
show. SNOW PRINCESS broke outwardly at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, swung out to the eight path entering the lane, but wandered
about greenly while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds and offered a strong belated kick to miss reaching show.
HAPPY AM I prompted the pace three wide early on, tracked into the turn, but chased while getting out to the five path around the bend, yielded at the
quarter pole, yet kept on mildly among foes to hold a minor reward. CALM COOL lacked speed in the two to three path, then moved up in the five path and
between horses late. FIRST HILL tracked while hung in the six path around the turn, lacked a bid after being floated to the seven path entering the lane and
tired in the final furlong. CARIBBEAN BEAUTY bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside while a path off the inner rail
and lacked a bid. CANDY BAR was hustled to the fore, set the pace from an outer vying rival around the turn, but got headed at the furlong pole and gave
way. WILD IRIS bumped with an inner rival while off a step slow at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. MIDNIGHT SONATA
hopped slightly while off slow, lagged behind around the turn and got outrun. FANCY PRANCE broke multiple lengths behind the field and got outrun along
the inside.

GETTYSBURG ADDRESS stalked behind the top pair and from the two path, took aim outside of them and from the three path at the quarter pole as an
outer rival ranged up alongside, chased the leader through upper stretch, inched closer leaving midstretch and drove past in the final sixteenth.
HANDSOME HERB dueled for the lead two wide, led around the turn, inched clear leaving the quarter pole, held sway from an outer chaser through
midstretch, but was collared and worn down in the final sixteenth. HEDGE THE RISK broke a step slow before taking contact from an inner rival at the start,
advanced from off of the pace inside of rivals down the backstretch, shifted out to the three path while tracking into the turn, ranged up four wide and outside
of the eventual winner at the quarter pole, but flattened out in upper stretch, lugged inwardly at the furlong grounds, yet ran on to secure show. SHAKIN
LOOSE bumped the outer part of the gate upon leaving it, pursued from midpack in the four path and ran on willingly. REMEMBER THE FEAR bumped an
outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead with an outer foe into the turn but yielded nearing the lane. FARM TEAM laid off of the pace in the four path and
failed to menace. UNCLE HAPPY saved ground far off of the pace and moved up inside of rivals. TIFAREEH fidgeted just before the gates opened and
broke a step slow, then made little impact in the five path. STRASSE broke a step slow, trailed in the four path and never got involved. BEKHAMBOY was
keen to place behind foes at the five furlong pole, raced off of the pace two wide, checked behind a faltering foe at the seven sixteenths pole, pursued under
urging around the turn and weakened between horses. TIME MUSE chased in the three path briefly and weakened between horses into the turn.

Footnotes
ALTERED SHOT dueled for the lead inside of rivals into the turn, spun into the lane a path off of the inner rail, sustained a long battle with an outer
FASHION RAGE through the final furlong and prevailed. FASHION RAGE sparred for the lead two wide and between horses, clung to an advantage from
an inner rival while entering the lane in the three path, battled neck and neck through the final furlong as the war with that one persisted but was outgamed
late. LOVE OF MY HEART eased back from between horses to trail the short field approaching the five furlong pole, pursued from the two path around the
bend, then rallied along the rail to gain show at the sixteenth pole. SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM prompted the pace three wide and between horses, but failed
to keep pace with an inner pair while in the four path in upper stretch, yielded and lost show to an inner foe with a sixteenth to go. MY KENTUCKY GIRL
stalked five wide and outside of rivals, but gave way to inner foes entering the lane before getting rank while changing leads at the furlong grounds. JAG
WARRIOR raced forwardly four wide and between horse, chased turning for home and faded.

Footnotes
ONE TIMER vied for the lead outside of a rival while taking the turn in the three path, sparred in hand in the five path in upper stretch, came under right
handed rousing entering the final furlong, struck the front approaching the final sixteenth and inched away. LET MY PEOPLE GO was urged along in
midpack in the two path into the turn, inched closer in the three path nearing the lane, rallied while aiming inside of the leaders in the final furlong, attempted
a bid entering the final sixteenth, but was turned away and held place. BAD BEAT BRIAN tracked two wide, shifted outside of the leaders to take aim in the
six path entering the lane, but only managed to chase evenly through the final furlong, needed more to sustain a bid and saved show from an inner bidder at
the wire. OCEANIC bumped an outer foe soon after the start causing his own hind end to be knocked from underneath him, laid off of the pace in the two
path, picked up stride while spinning for home in the five path, and stayed on between rivals in the late stages but missed reaching show. CHARCOAL
broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked from midpack in the four path, got floated to the seven path entering the lane and lacked a bid.
EXCESS MAGIC was jostled between rivals while before being squeezed back soon after the start, lacked speed in the four path, fanned to the eight path
entering the lane and stayed on willingly to improve position. JUST MIGHT set the pace inside of a vying foe while in the two path around the turn, sparred
with that one while shifting to the three path entering the lane, but succumbed in the final furlong and faltered between horses at the sixteenth pole. PURE
PANIC prompted outside of the leading pair early on, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, pursued from the inside before chasing in the two path
nearing the lane, but lacked a bid and yielded. BAKERS BAY took contact from an outer foe before being pinched back among foes soon after the start,
saved ground while trailing, but lacked rail racing room and steadied slightly at the furlong grounds before making little impact. MAILMAN MONEY laid off of
the pace in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and faded.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S EVE lacked speed three wide, steadied among foes at the three quarter pole, shifted out four wide entering the backstretch, pursued into the
far turn, launched a rally by splitting foes four wide at the quarter pole, fanned to the six path entering the lane, advanced outside of foes with a steady
charge in the final furlong and drove past in the late stages. FOR THE FLAG set the pace along the inside, spun for home in the two path, leaned outwardly
a touch while holding sway in midstretch, but drifted out multiple paths entering the final sixteenth, was caught by an outer bidder soon after and fended off
outer foes for place while continuing to lug out. SINFILTRE stalked outside of the top pair and in the four path, pressed from the three path around the far
turn, attempted a bid turning for home before getting floated back to the four path in upper stretch, brushed with an inner rival while changing leads at the
furlong grounds, ran on between horses soon after but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, sustained her bid for place, but shied
from an inner drifting rival and brushed an outer foe approaching the wire while denied place. QUEROBIN DOURADA tracked in the five to three path
around the first turn, pursued between horses into the far turn before tucking two wide, swung back to the five path entering the lane, sustained a grinding
charge along with an outer foe in the final furlong, got outkicked by that one at the sixteenth pole, kept on in hopes of bidding for show, but took mild contact
from an inner rival nearing the wire while missing that position. GLENALL (IRE) stalked along the inside, then chased through the lane while lacking a rail
kick. HENRIETTA TOPHAM broke a step slow, settled off of the pace along the inside, got shuffled back behind traffic turning for home to trail at the quarter
pole, remained blocked behind foes while off of the rail in midstretch, tipped in and stayed on late. FANCY MARTINI tracked along the inside, tipped to the
two path entering the backstretch, but got keen into the far turn, saved ground off of the pace around that bend and made little impact. ARM CANDY broke a
beat slow, trailed in the three to five path around the first turn, then raced towards the rear four wide around the far turn before fanning to the seven path
entering the lane and moved up. SWEET DANI GIRL pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, then in the three path and between horses in upper stretch,
but was herded out by an inner foe causing contact with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and weakened between horses. LADY HIDEAWAY laid off of
the pace in the four to three path, shuffled towards the rear entering the far turn, was held up behind foes nearing the lane, shifted out and failed to menace.
PRINCESS THEOREM lacked speed in the four path, lacked a response to urging in the three path and between horses around the far turn and failed to
factor. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE steadied from tight quarters among foes entering the first turn, raced off of the pace in the three to four path, gained in the
five path entering the far turn, but only managed to chase before getting floated and weakening five to seven wide entering the lane. THE RIDER OF
QUEROBIN DOURADA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST FOR THE FLAG FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

SAFEEN pressed three deep while in the four to five path around the first turn, prompted from the three path around the far turn, chased a leading BLING in
upper stretch after that horse spurted away, yet sustained pursuit on her left lead, closed in leaving the furlong grounds and drove past in the final sixteenth.
BLING vied with a pair of outer rivals, shook free in the two path entering the lane, but met an outer counterpart's rebid in the final furlong and could not
hold. FREYDIS THE RED (FR) trailed in the three to two path around the first turn, bided time three wide into the far turn, swung to the five path nearing the
lane and rallied willingly. HANG THE MOON bumped an outer rival soon after the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, cut the corner to
gain show leaving the three sixteenths pole, but lost that position to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. LILY POO bumped an inner rival in the early stages,
tracked in the five path around the first turn, then in the three to four path around the far turn, but gave way through the lane. FRONTAL ATTACK vied for
the lead two wide and between horses, tugged firmly in the three to four path around the first turn, sustained sparring position between the eventual top pair
around the far turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. CHAMPAGNE CALLING laid off of the pace along the inside, chased two wide turning for home,
shifted out in upper stretch and failed to factor. WONDERFULL LADY (FR) was bumped by rivals on both sides soon after the start, chased along the inside
and faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
ME AND MR. C settled far back along the inside, gained ground in the four path around the far turn, rallied between horses in midstretch, sustained a
charge to bid in the final sixteenth and got up at the wire. CELLIST pressed the leader from the three path, pursued in earnest through midstretch, vied
entering the final sixteenth, led late but was caught at the wire. SIEGE OF BOSTON pursued from midpack along the inside, crept closer between horses
approaching the far turn, tracked from the three to four path around that bend while taking aim outside of the leaders, but failed to keep pace while drifting
out slightly at the furlong grounds, ran on along with an inner rival in the final sixteenth but needed more late. GET SMOKIN set the pace in the two path,
held sway from an outer presser through midstretch, but was caught by that one in the final sixteenth and weakened. WAR CAMPAIGN tracked along the
inside and chased evenly through the lane. MCLOVIN took contact from an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, then along the inside, and
chased in the three path while one paced. CAMP HOPE pursued from midpack two wide, chased in the three path around the far turn and lacked a bid.
MOUNT RUNDLE laid unhurried two wide and made little impact. SPOOKY CHANNEL broke a beat slow, trailed and never got involved. KITODAN bumped
an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and faded. KING CAUSE was kept wide leaving the opening hook causing outer rivals to be
hung wider, tracked three wide, but faded while bearing outwardly turning for home.
