Footnotes
BOLD CHOICE broke well then tracked out of range early, gained three then four wide around the turn, challenged three deep in the final furlong, drifted in
and brushed SAND TO SEA late and edged that rival in the final jumps. SAND TO SEA chased off the rail then three deep early, bid three deep with a
quarter mile remaining, put a nose in front at the sixteenth pole, got brushed by BOLD CHOICE late and was overtaken. SCARY FAST RIDE broke a step
slow, stalked between leaving the backstretch then moved to the rail, commenced a bid inside the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, took over at the quarter
pole, fought with outer rival into deep stretch and yielded late. HEY DEMPS settled off the pace, closed in four then five wide on the turn and flattened out in
the final furlong. SEAHAWK MARY sped clear quickly, led two wide into the turn, lost command at the quarter pole, fought between rivals to the top of the
stretch and weakened. WORK N FLIRT stumbled leaving the gate, trailed on the inside into the turn, two wide leaving the bend, moved out at the top of the
lane and was not a factor. ELTONSINGSANOTHER chased from inside then got put in tight by outer rival into the turn, remained along the fence to the
stretch and could not rally.

Footnotes
PRESIDENT Z chased six deep at the back leaving the backstretch, moved into the four path while starting to rally, tipped five wide leaving the turn, drew
alongside STAN FROM MALIBU with a sixteenth to go and edged that rival in the closing moments. STAN FROM MALIBU showed the way up the
backstretch, led two wide into the turn, met the bid from TOO MUCH INFO at the quarter pole, put that rival away at the top of the stretch, responded when
challenged by WORTH LOOKING at the eighth pole, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth now battling with rivals on both sides and yielded grudgingly
near the wire. WORTH LOOKING broke a step slow, stalked two wide between rivals, waited for room behind the leader on the turn and while moving
inside, launched a rail bid with a furlong remaining, fought along the fence through deep stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. STAY IN THE GAME
threw his head at the start to spot the field a few lengths, moved up to chase inside rivals, got put in tight at the three-eighths pole and lost ground, tipped
two wide at the quarter pole, came out in upper stretch and kept on to earn a minor award. TOO MUCH INFO stalked four deep into the turn, bid from
outside at the quarter pole, fought three wide into the lane and weakened. MENTIROSA tracked five deep into the turn, asked four wide into the lane and
failed to menace. STAFFORD TO KUPP got bumped twice from inside leaving the gate, stalked three deep between foes, started to weaken around the
turn, came four wide into the drive and faded.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF MONACO bumped with MUTH at the start, settled outside a rival early at the back, was on the move three wide through the turn, drew
alongside MUTH entering the stretch, took over at the eighth pole, asked once left handed midstretch and kicked clear to win going away. MUTH bumped
with PRINCE OF MONACO in the beginning, went up to prompt the pace from outside, moved up on even terms into the turn, took over then cleared at the
quarter pole, roused when challenged by PRINCE OF MONACO leaving the turn, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and churned on for the
place honors. RAGING TORRENT stalked the top pair up the backstretch, chased two wide around the bend and lacked bid in the drive but finished a clear
third. TRANCHE set the pace under pressure from MUTH, dueled with that rival into the turn, lost command around the bend and failed to keep up
approaching the quarter pole, then tired in the stretch run. WHO IS PAVEL hit the gate to come away a bit slow, trailed two wide into the turn, moved further
out around the bend, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DR. NO NO stalked three deep into the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off while drifting to the
inside on the wrong lead. LAST CALL PAUL chased off the rail then lost his path early and dropped back off the pace, went two to three wide around the
turn, finished determinedly through the drive without making any headway on the winner but best the others. STAY ON THE FENCE became fractious in the
gate, sat off the pace in the early going, went two wide into the turn, eased out around the bend and came five wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally
and gained the show honors. IMMELMANN chased off the rail, coaxed two wide around the turn, lost some ground leaving the bend, kept on through the
lane and got edged for the show. BEE EYE GEE was off slow to start, raced three deep into the turn, four deep into the stretch and could not rally.
WESTERN GRIT bumped leaving the gate, hustled clear from inside, showed the way from inside through the turn, challenged into the stretch, lost
command in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. WHISKEY RYE chased near the back early, raced along the inside in mid-pack into the turn,
moved out and exited the bend two to three wide and was not a factor. CHROMEFLASH broke in and bumped, tracked from inside, ridden along around the
bend and tired in the stretch run. SIR LUCAS dwelt at the start, trailed on the inside through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DEVIL BE ME forwardly placed three wide into the clubhouse turn then moved up to press the pace from outside, gained the advantage nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared inner rival at the quarter pole, met the challenge from STAMP MY PASSPORT entering the stretch, turned that foe away and
padded the margin late. STAMP MY PASSPORT stalked four wide on the first turn and got put in tight quarters late on the bend between rivals, chased two
wide leaving the backstretch, moved out and bid three to four wide into the stretch but was repelled by the winner. LOVE CANDY settled in the two path,
gained two then three wide on the far turn, moved inward in the stretch and flattened out. MY RANSOM bobbled leaving the gate then tucked inside, angled
out on the far turn and entered the lane five wide, showed a mild response and rounded out the superfecta. GYPSY TEARS got crowded early then became
rank into and around the first turn while four to five wide, lacked room in traffic at the seven-sixteenths pole, asked three wide around the far turn and lacked
a rally. IN VRONSKY STYLE stumbled leaving the gate then got put in a bit tight between foes shortly after, traveled in the three path near the back early,
moved into range up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and weakened. WORKDAY led a bit off the rail around the first turn then set the
pace under pressure from the winner, lost command near the five-sixteenths pole and gave way. COWBOY MIKE stalked five wide through the clubhouse
turn, chased three deep leaving the backstretch, eased on the far turn and down the stretch, then walked off.

Footnotes
LEGISLATOR tracked between rivals then moved inside, went between foes again on the backstretch, lacked room behind rivals early on the far turn,
altered to the inside, started to make progress up the fence, shifted out and bumped into the lane, bid three deep and bested REIQUIST in the late stages.
REIQUIST stalked outside a rival early, moved out on the far turn and took aim at the leader four wide leaving the bend, got bumped from inside entering
the stretch, bid five deep in the lane and got outkicked by the winner. SMART CODE sat off the pace in the two path, moved closer into and around the far
turn, altered inward racing behind trouble into the stretch, altered out from behind traffic in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show honors. FOR A
LAUGH (IRE) was off a step slow then paused briefly behind a rival shortly after, raced between foes then outside a rival out of range, remained two wide
into the lane, found traffic in the stretch, angled in and churned on for a minor award. DEL MAR JERRY was off a bit slow, pulled near the back early,
steadied at the three-sixteenths pole and again in upper stretch, kept to task in the final furlong and improved. X J RASCAL (IRE) rated along the inside
early, tipped three wide around the far turn, got knocked into outer rival entering the lane, bid four deep and faltered. ZE'BUL tracked three then two wide
early, continued off the rail on the far turn, altered six wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BEAR MOUNTAIN unhurried on the inside, angled out on the far
turn and came five wide into the stretch, lost his path at the eighth pole and could not rally after. SEVENTEEN BLACK settled inside, saved ground to the
lane, lacked room from upper to midstretch and was ridden out once gaining a clear path. BOLT SUPREMACY raced up close into the first turn then went
up to press the pace up the backstretch, dueled into and around the far turn, fought to upper stretch, bothered by LEGISLATOR at the eighth pole and
weakened. ALMOST SNOW took control early from inside, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, battled through the far turn, got put in tight at
the eight pole and gave way. THEMAINPROTAGONIST (IRE) was off slow to begin, trailed on the inside and was not a factor. THERE WAS A RIDER'S
OBJECTION PLACED BY THE RIDER OF X J RASCAL (IRE) AGAINST LEGISLATOR FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH.
FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED LEGISLATOR FROM FIRST TO SIXTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AND BUMPING X J RASCAL
(IRE) INTO REIQUIST, COSTING X J RASCAL (IRE) A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
I'M A RISQUE GIRL bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace early, gained four to five wide around the bend, swept by and kicked clear in upper stretch,
drifted to the inside and drew away. ROSIE ANN RULES tracked off the rail then between foes, swung six wide into the lane and bested the rest.
HOLLYWOOD RUMOR showed early speed three deep then had to pause when TURQUOISE BIKINI crossed in front, chased three deep into the lane and
held the show. TURQUOISE BIKINI cleared from outside, crossed over and showed the way two wide through the turn, lost command in upper stretch and
flattened to fourth. JUST IS tracked along the inside then moved to the two path around the bend, steered out in the drive and improved position. C HER
BEAUTY raced near the back on the inside into the turn, angled out and came three wide into the stretch and improved position. OCEAN OF LIES bumped
with the winner at the start, stalked the lone leader outside a rival into the turn, chased within striking range entering the drive but weakened down the lane.
HEY BARMAID stalked from inside into and around the turn and weakened in the drive. MISS COMMANDER was off slow and had her path taken leaving
the gate, trailed into the turn, five wide into the lane and could not make an impact. TWIN SOUL hit the gate, raced near the back off the rial, went four to
five wide around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
NATIONAL ROAD settled in the two path, saved ground through the far turn before tipped two wide into the lane, moved out into the clear to launch a rally
four deep and drove past to prove best. GOLDENEYE vied for the lead from inside into the first turn then got put tight by VAGABOND SHOES around the
bend, stalked up the backstretch, waited for room through the far turn, gained a clear path at the top of the lane, challenged from inside and took over at the
sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner. CARDIFF CRACK vied between rivals then became rank into the first turn, chased two wide still fighting the
rider then steadied off heels late on that bend, moved up to press the pace in the the middle stages, stayed alongside through the far turn, took over in
upper stretch and got outfinished in the final sixteenth. GREENBOW broke a step slow, trailed early, went three deep around the far turn then angled into
the two path nearing the stretch and produced a mild rally. DEVELOPING THE WAY broke a step slow, settled inside towards the rear, cut the corner into
the lane and improved position. VAGABOND SHOES vied three deep into the first turn then cleared and moved into the two path, steered over to the inside
up the backstretch then gained company to the outside, maintained a short lead through the far turn and into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened in late stages. CHIEFS BLANKET pulled early chasing on the inside, moved off the fence on the backstretch, tipped out into the lane and lacked
a late bid. TALLIS stalked the pace outside a pair of rivals, asked right handed at the top of the stretch and flattened out. GIOVINAZZO steadied into the first
turn, tracked off the rail then between rivals into and around the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RICH GOLD traveled two
wide early, moved closer three deep on the backstretch, spun five wide into the lane and was not a factor. CALARI BLUECAT raced three then two wide
near the back early, trailed past the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty.
