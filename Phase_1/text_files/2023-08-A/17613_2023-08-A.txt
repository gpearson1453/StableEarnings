Footnotes
CHARITABLE WINDSOR took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail and was steadily handled through the stretch. HARPERSGONEFISHING bobbled at the break then stalked off the rail, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well to close the gap. COMEONTURNMELOOSE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dueled through later yards for third. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM
bore out into the first turn then corrected course and stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened on the far turn.
HILLBILLY ROCK settled back two deep on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, closed to the heels of Lastwalktofreedom nearing the
eighth pole and showed nothing further.

Footnotes
HIS ROYAL G stalked the early pace inside, drifted a path into the first turn then settled back into stride along the rail, picked up the chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, closed to the heels of TUSKEGEE CAT leaving the far turn but dug in from the eighth pole to match strides inside the sixteenth pole
and dueled determinedly to take the nod under the wire. The latter veered out at the start then stalked the early pace, was forced outward and roughed off
the heels of Bliss This into the first turn then settled in the three path through the turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on
the far turn, dueled for the nod mid-stretch but missed the nod under the wire. SCOOTSCOOT moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under
pressure nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and weakened the final sixteenth. BLISS THIS was forced
outward leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, but,
weakened in the stretch. DANCIN IN DUBAI saved ground on the first turn, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the
far turn, eased outward leaving the turn and showed little further. DINNER BELL was forced outward leaving the gate, raced well back in the four path on
the first turn and never factored. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR raced well back and never factored. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
His Royal for interference into the first turn, lodged by the rider of Tuskegee Cat, but took no action.

Footnotes
SIENTE LA BRISA was reluctant to load then stalked the pace, challenged toward the five sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, dueled to
the lead nearing mid-stretch, drew clear later yards and held on well. BLUE MOUNTAIN chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail then eased to the
three path into the stretch, dueled for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. DIXIE YODELER gave distant early chase, raced near the rail on
the turn then came between horses mid-stretch and was gaining on the top two. SING A LULLABYE became anxious in the gate but took a quick early lead
and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the rail on the turn but was met nearing
mid-stretch and flattened stride. WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. DIVA ROSE chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, left the turn widest and showed little in the lane.

SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY was forced out leaving the gate then tapered in and stalked in the four path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole,
took the nod two deep approaching the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to hold on. CEDARS BULLS EYE rated close inside, bid approaching the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished well to take second later yards. TIZBIT stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the
half mile pole, dueled for the nod approaching the seven sixteenths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met nearing the head of the lane
and weakened the final sixteenth. LOOKING FOR FLARE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the half mile pole, was met toward the
seven sixteenths and gave close chase from that point, steadied at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened in the lane. TAPPING SOUTH saved
ground on the opening turn then raced in the five path the second turn, picked up the chase passing the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened in the three
path on the far turn. FORT ZANNA raced off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. LADY WHISTLEDOWN veered out leaving the gate
and raced in the five path on the opening turn, but was through after a half mile.

ceded the nod past the sixteenth pole. BASHDAFLASH was forced out leaving the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about

SHES SO SPEIGHTSY stalked the early leader two deep then took the nod approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure
leaving the five sixteenths pole, drew clear midway on the far turn, drifted into the lane but drew off when steadily handled. MARIA FROM MIAMI rated close
inside on the opening turn, gave chase three wide nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and dueled through the
stretch for second. MIDNIGHT REGRET rated close off the rail on the first turn, bid four wide approaching the three eighths pole, raced close in the three
and four paths on the far turn but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. BIZZY GAL rated the early pace inside, was met toward the nine sixteenths
pole and stalked from that point, gave chase nearing the three eighths but dropped back at the rail at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. SISTER
SPIRIT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then weakened in the lane.
DALLAS raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and showed little
more. HOVEL raced well back in the two and three paths and never factored. I B NASTY saved ground. WATERLOO ROSE rounded the opening turn
about the three path and showed little response through the backtretch.

leaving the turn, lugged in later yards but inched clear nearing the wire. XCELLENT START chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and
finished well to take second the final strides. GEORGE was hustled to the front and set a pressured pace, contested even terms at the rail on the turn,
relented later yards and just lasted for third. LA MADDALENA gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in past the eighth
pole, but steadied off the inside of Hardly Ever Better through later yards. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then flattened
inside the sixteenth pole. DONNIE B chased the early pace then faded past the five sixteenths pole. GOLDEN ARROW was not a factor.

Footnotes
AUBURN MILL became a bit anxious in the gate then stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide
leaving the far turn then dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game challenge of ROYAL THUNDER, who rated close off the rail and gave chase
leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage near the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to the wire. INDIANA RED rounded the
first turn in the three path then edged closer through the backstretch, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn,
eased out leaving the turn and came along for third later yards. SCOTTSDALE took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under
pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but was met into the lane and weakened. SUPERHIGHWAY rounded the opening
turn in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. FORT
FORTITUDE came away awkwardly then raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path on the
far turn. KRACHENWAGEN raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and showed little in the lane. ANOTHER VICTORY
saved ground. BUCKED TOOTH saved ground on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch then weakened at the rail on the far turn. SPRING THE
BEAST raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.
