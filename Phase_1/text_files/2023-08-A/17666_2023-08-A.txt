Footnotes
LUCKY SMILE sprinted away from the field quickly, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. YARDMAN rated
outside the leader, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then was no threat to the winner, while clearly best of the
rest. SHARP PLAY BOY allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the
show. PITON tracked the pace, lost some ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and weakened. DON'T FLINCH unhurried, saved
ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved his position. TRUCKIN TOMMY rushed up in the early going and
faded through the turn, then was vanned off. CHAMPAGNE FOR ALL was a brief factor.

Footnotes
I'M HEADING EAST allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked, steadied along waiting,
then got through inside the leader late and edged up in the final strides. RIO DEL ARMOUR set the pace on the inside, stayed on and held sway when
challenged into the stretch, then moved out slightly late, allowing the winner through and was outfinished by that one. ZORA unhurried, looped to position
three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. HIGH DOLLAR DATE tracked the pace,
held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, was blocked, split foes late and edged for the show. UPTOWN CHARLOTTE
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened late. SAINT FOXY
well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened.

DISASTER RECOVERY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, held sway to the final yards, weakened and
held the show. SPY TOWN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share.

TWELVETWO mid pack, angled in and moved up through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and edged
up in the final strides. KENJI'S EMPIRE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the stretch, then held off a rival to the
final strides and was outfinished. CHANGE THE HOUR well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
flattened and held the show. YANKEE TEA PARTY unhurried, looped up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a
share. COMMANDING well placed and off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. COYOTE
RUNNER was no factor. FRETENSIS was hard to load and was never involved.

ARGYLL well placed, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up late and held. KNIGHT LEGEND well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the
stretch, lugged in slightly, was blocked, angled out and lacked the needed kick under left had urging. SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted to a clear lead soon after
the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late and held the show. GOVERNOR ATWOOD never far back, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, and had a mild late gain. VOORHEES improved his position, inside. EDUARD ran
evenly for a half and had no rally. SALTY SNAPPER was never involved.

Footnotes
SAMURAI LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, then lasted under steady pressure. GREAT BLAKE chased the
pace, moved up inside through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late
kick. WAPITI WAY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and missed the
place. CHAMPION BY DESIGN allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, angled in mid way of the turn and came through inside into the
stretch, then made a steady gain and got up for a share. BOOMIN GOOSE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch had a mild gain and passed tiring rivals. ANOTHER BREEZE well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and evened out. EXTRA MEDIUM allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved
position. HE'S ON THE FLY ran evenly. BLUE SKY'S ABOVE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded. CATHMOR was no factor.
