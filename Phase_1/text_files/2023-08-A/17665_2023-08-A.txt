GRAB THE GOLD stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn to vie for command by the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear
after a long drive to prevail. CASH IN A FLASH showed good speed and set the pace two wide, then came out under left handed crop leaving the turn, then
dueled for command on the inside by the furlong marker but was out-kicked late after a long drive. BRIT'S CANDYMAN showed good speed early on the
inside, then relented and rated back, made a three wide bid between rivals leaving the turn, then was shut off nearing the three sixteenths, angled out for
racing room and closed well but too late. GONE INZANE chased the pace three wide on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker but had no kick.
STANHOPE chased the pace towards the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was settled early, came five wide into the
lane and had no rally. The rider on BRIT'S CANDYMAN claimed foul against THE RIDER ON CASH IN A FLASH for interference leaving the turn, after the
STEWARDS reviewed the replay the OBJECTION was not allowed and the race left as is.

Footnotes
RUNNINGFORHOME was reserved early while three to four wide, advanced on the turn five wide, closed full of run to get up in time to prove best, driving.
C C'S WARRIOR prompted the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to draw clear, then widened the margin by the furlong marker but was caught
late, second best. ABUELO NUNO was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but
weakened in the drive, bested rest. DIGGERS DIAMOND passed the tiring rivals. INNUENDO broke outwardly at the start, five wide into the first turn,
settled early and was four wide on the far turn and had no rally. SPIN CYCLE tracked the pace on the inside and tired. OUCH OUCH OUCH set a pressured
pace on the inside and gave way.
