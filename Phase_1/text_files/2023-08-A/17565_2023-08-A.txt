Footnotes
DARK VINTAGE (IRE) was nudged from the gate and gained a tracking position towards the rail, was shoved on momentarily then had to pause before
easing out to advance past the quarter pole, bumped with SHARPAZANO when collaring that one in upper stretch, moved to command with a furlong
remaining, kicked clear under left handed asks and held firm. MURPHY BOY hopped at the break then steadied soon after, regrouped and advanced while
saving ground into the turn, continued progress past the five sixteenths, came out for the drive and closed nicely between rivals to nab the place in the final
yards. OSAGE CREEK , away alertly, prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, shifted wider with hard pursuit into the lane and kept on with effort.
SHARPAZANO sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, drifted out a bit when engaged in upper stretch and bumped with the winner, corrected to
battle past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. RASTAMAN VIBE , forced in at the break, recovered and raced in the clear early,
advanced four wide approaching the stretch, shifted out a bit but came up empty late. CRONE ZONE , keyed up pre race and ran off with his rider a bit,
bore out at the break, dropped off the pace, saved ground nearing the lane and failed to menace'. ZISKEY (IRE) broke slowly, lagged off the pace saving
ground and was outrun. EISENHOWER veered in at the break bothering foes, raced a bit green while off the rail into the turn, chased between rivals nearing
the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET , urged from the gate, took command inside rivals leaving the four and a half furlong marker, handled outside pressure from three foes,
spurted clear approaching the stretch, widened under solid handling in mid stretch, wandered outward a bit leaving the sixteenth pole, was soon
straightened and held sway while kept alert. SANGER leaned in at the break and bumped with AUSTONIAN, crept up and bid three wide between foes
heading to the turn, continued three wide and between runners pressing the pace mid turn, saw the winner get away soon into the lane but dug in and
stayed on well to be clear for the place. COACH CRONIN broke slowly, recovered and gained towards the rail in the opening three sixteenths, dropped back
as the leading quartet widen from him leaving the far turn, swung out six wide for the drive and came back on to nip FORDY G for the show. FORDY G ,
with the pace four wide, disputed the issue four deep exiting the far turn, remained four wide with pursuit into the stretch, stayed willingly past the sixteenth
pole then faded late. AUSTONIAN broke outward and bumped with SANGER, moved up and bid two wide between runners, vied around the turn, failed to
keep pace heading to the stretch and retreated. MY MAN FLEURY , brushed early, was rated back from between runners in the opening furlong, dropped
off the pace and failed to respond.

on gamely. STORMY VICTORY , forced in at the break by the riderless OVERRULE, was brushed soon after, rated back and guided towards the rail, came
out near the three eighths, pursued between runners past the five sixteenths, shifted out wider for the drive and closed steadily. BROTHER REID , bumped

Footnotes
TIZZY TWISTER rated forwardly while saving ground, responded when roused and bid to take over inside a pair of foes with a quarter to go, was guided off
the rail when clear soon into the lane, kicked away leaving mid stretch and won under a mild drive. ELEUTHERA stumbled at break, quickly recovered and
moved up to attend the pace four wide outside a rival, forced the issue three deep near the quarter pole, failed to quicken with the winner in upper stretch
but continued on with effort to be clearly second best. MADIHA , rank vying between runners heading to the first turn, took over and cleared leaving the
seven eighths, set the pace well off the rail while taking pressure, was pushed along battling between runners near the quarter pole then weakened through
the final furlong. BIG NOVEL stumbled at the break, raced in range behind rivals while off the rail past the five eighths, angled four wide to chase leaving the
far turn but failed to kick on in the drive. DON'T GET PICKLED , three wide between foes into the first turn, stalked off the rail, saw the leaders get away
past the five sixteenths and weakened. DENDERA , off the rail, was outrun.

Footnotes
M IS FOR MAGIC , urged along pursuing a contested pace into the turn, remained in touch as the leader cleared approaching the stretch, leveled off to her
best stride soon past the furlong grounds, surged under some right handed asks to take command with about sixty yards remaining then steadily edged
away. DENIM IN GOLD was hard sent inside and joined the pace fray after a furlong, sparred to the inside of ITZEL into the turn, took command soon after
then shook clear with a quarter to go, was guided just off the inside while widening under a drive, could not resist the winner's charge past the sixteenth
marker, gave way grudgingly and maintained the place. HAYLEY LEVADE , off the pace while saving ground, angled out near the quarter pole while
gathering some steam, swung out to about the seven path nearing mid stretch and finished well. MIAMI GIRL (IRE) had speed between foes then rated
back off the leaders leaving the half mile pole, dropped in to stalk, gained towards the rail past mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain. NU PI LAMBDA
saved ground while under a light hold early on, angled three wide approaching the stretch, gained past mid stretch then hung late. LINDA'S GIFT , taken to
rate early on, saved ground mid turn, angled out to be about five wide in mid stretch then went evenly. AMERICAN HEIGHTS broke a bit flat footed, raced
off the pace, angled in past the three sixteenths and lacked a bid. ITZEL had speed to lead early, disputed the pace outside DENIM IN GOLD from the half
to to far turn, gave hard chase past the quarter pole then began a retreat near mid stretch.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI SUNRISE , with the pace four wide between rivals and under rating early on, dropped in to the two path after gaining a short lead into the far
turn, was nicely rated handling outside pressure around the turn, responded when shaken up nearing the lane, spurted clear under a strong drive and held
firm through the final furlong. YOUTEYOURHONOR led early while five wide outside runners, was guided down to about the three path and emerged in a
battle outside the winner leaving the three eighths, forced the issue into the lane and stayed on well while narrowly saving the place. A NEW PEACE , close
up two wide to the inside of the leaders, steadied when in close near the three eighths, angled out after recovering and commenced a five wide run past the
five sixteenths, straightened away and finished well while just missing second. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN vied three wide between horses early, rated back
off the leaders leaving the half, chased two wide mid turn, gained between horses leaving mid stretch then flattened out. CHARLOTTE HARBOR saved
ground and lacked a bid. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL , off the pace and saving some ground, angled out under pressure into the lane and had a mild kick.
SPOILED ROTTEN stumbled at the break, edged up four wide nearing the half, had aim three wide pursuing past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in
upper stretch and weakened. STELLAR GRACE broke slowly, was pulled up before leaving the chute then was vanned off.

Footnotes
EASTERN OCEAN prompted three wide outside the leader while under rating, moved to the attack past the five sixteenths, dueled into the lane, took
command while switching over to his left lead in mid stretch, kept on under left handed asking, switched back to his left lead soon past the sixteenth marker,
edged clear then switched leads two more times when a bit erratic heading to the line. BURNIN TURF pulled his way to the front then cleared, set a rated
pace off the rail, dug in and was put to pressure when collared nearing the lane, battled inside the winner to about the sixteenth marker, kept on nicely and
held down the place. TIZ PLUS , in tight between runners early while forwardly placed, took closer order around the final turn, gave hard chase of the
embattled leaders in mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. DANCING RINCA , four wide outside rivals, angled five wide for the drive and closed willingly.
TAISHAN saved ground, eased out and moved up between foes nearing the lane, pursued and churned on. FLY THE SKY , off the pace while saving
ground, lacked room and steadied along from the far turn to about the quarter pole, eased out to edged up between runners, dropped back in and kept on
with effort. SOULMATE , between horses a long way, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. SUBSIDIZE lagged back, swung wide in upper stretch
and had a slight kick. JACK SIXPACK , four wide and in range, was called upon leaving the far turn, pursued to upper stretch and faded. RED ROAD pulled
a bit early from inside, saved ground stalking the pace, was under a ride past the three eighths, steadied briefly at the quarter pole then tired.

Footnotes
LT'S CHOICE angled out around the first turn and tracked the leader, bid three wide near the quarter pole, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch and held
sway. VULIN , brushed and forced out by MISS JOANNIE nearing the first turn, regrouped and settled four wide while in range, circled four wide under a
hustling ride into the stretch and closed steadily. ELECTRIC GLIDE steadied off heels approaching the first turn, recovered and dropped in to stalk the pace,
was pushed along past the five sixteenths, shifted out but lacked the needed finish. CHERRY CHAOS , four wide to command heading to the seven eighths,
dropped in and moved clear, set a rated pace two wide, appeared to want to get out a bit when collared near the quarter pole, stayed on willingly to about
the sixteenth marker then weakened. SHAMBALA GIRL saved ground in mid pack, angled out entering the stretch but lacked a serious run. PRINCESS
TENKO was steadied when put in close near the seven furlong pole, lost ground four to five wide and had a belated response. VIOLET CROWN , five wide
nearing the first turn, angled in some then raced between runners heading to the half, dropped in to pursue leaving the far turn but came up empty.
PERFECT THREAT broke a bit slowly, got put in a bit tight between runners nearing the first turn, lagged off the pace, went two wide into the far turn, four
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. MISS JOANNIE got out bothering a rival nearing the first turn, righted and stalked racing about three wide past
the five eighths, failed to go on under pressure around the final turn and tired. ROCKIN TO THE BOSS stumbled at the break and was outrun.
