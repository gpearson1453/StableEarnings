Footnotes
SHASTA STAR stalked the top pair early on down the backstretch, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled five wide through the stretch and
finished strongly to surge up under strong handling. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) tracked Claire's Darling early on racing just off the inside, took aim into
the upper stretch, led near the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off Shasta Star late in a game effort. VIKING QUEEN raced mid pack early on, ridden along
through the far turn, moved up from the inside into the upper stretch, angled and showed good late interest. CLAIRE'S DARLING was sent along from the
outside to cross over an set the early pace, was clear near the three sixteenths pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FLAVA'S DREAM stumbled at
the break, raced off the early pace after the poor start, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a rally. POLISHED GAL
stalked the pace early on, moved up three to four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. EVANGELINE ALLONS dropped back early on,
raced five deep into the upper stretch to race outside of foes and lacked a bid. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL was off a step slow, void of early speed and trailed.

Footnotes
BATTLEBUS dueled early on between rivals, had a clear lead nearing the eighth pole, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling. PYRON stalked the
pace from the outside of foes early on, moved up four wide around the far turn, surged up five wide between rivals late and just missed in a game effort.
LOVE YOU MUCH coaxed along early, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, angled widest in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire.
AESTHETICALLY dueled early on with Battlebus, angled through the upper stretch to race off the inside and finished willingly to the wire. REMEMBERING
WILBUR raced off the early pace, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and gained ground late in a willing effort. BOURBON AND ICE dropped back
early on, raced three to two wide in the drivve and had no final winning bid. ONE MORE FACTOR was off a step slow, rushed up from the outside of rivals
and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
BOSSYNESS rated along early to race under a snug hold, moved up three wide through the far turn to challenge, drifted a bit through the stretch to race
well off the inside and drew off under steady handling. THUNDER BOSS was off a step slow, sent up from the inside to set the early pace, met rivals near
the three eighths pole midway on the turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. DONNA'S COURAGE raced off the early going, was three wide around
the far turn, angled to race from the far turn outside in the stretch and moved up to improve position. INCONTROVERTIBLE settled off the early going, hard
ridden through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and had no rally. MISS ANTIETAM stalked the early going, raced along the inside
around the far turn, drifted through the stretch to race wide and weakened. MAGNIFICENT PEARL dropped back early to race at the back of the pack saved
ground through the far turn while losing ground and was eased up on in the stretch.

CALL ME VIVIAN settled off the early going, was near the inside past the three eighths pole, continued its rail run to slip through along the inside into the
upper stretch held safe to prove best under strong handling. PEACE FIRE was bumped at the start, stalked the early going, raced three wide around the
turn, angled in late and finished gamely from the inside in the drive. STAGE CALL was squeezed back at the start, raced with the second flight after the poor
start, raced five wide into the upper lane and kept on gamely to the wire. TRES MARIA'S DREAM was bumped hard at the start, settled back after the poor
beginning, made an early three wide bid near the three eighths, took control but was empty in the drive. LA SANTA CLARA raced mid pack early on, ran up
heels near the half mile pole, was four to three wide in the stretch run and raced evenly late. WINE IN THE DARK prompt the early from the inside on a fast
early pace, checked near the half mile pole and weakened. JUMP A FOX was bumped hard both sides break, trailed early on while racing near the inside
and never threatened. SCARLETT STRONG rushed from the outside to set a fast early pace, raced in bit tight while giving way near the three eighths pole
and tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
PROUD MARY showed good early foot to cross over an set the early pace and held gamely to be clear late under steady pressure. NEGRA GATA stalked
the top pair early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, was four to two wide in the stretch run and got up for the place position. BOSSY DIVA prompt
the early leader from the outside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. LITTLE BABY GIRL settled off the early going, raced along the inside into the
upper stretch, shifted out four wide and raced evenly late with no closing run. FILLY PHANATIC void of early speed, raced near the inside around the far
turn and lacked a rally. PUNKIN was off slowly, coaxed along early and faded in the drive racing five wide. ROCKET RUTHIE was off slowly, raced with the
second flight early and never was a factor while racing five deep in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SELF ISOLATION dueled for the early lead from near the rail, drifted a bit through the stretch and drew off to be clear under strong encouragement.
BENEATH THE STARS was off the dueling pair down the backstretch, made a good rail bid in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. STREET LUTE
prompt the early pace from the outside of rivals three deep, dug in through the stretch and kept on to secure the show placing. MOODY WOMAN dropped
back off the early going, raced four wide past the quarter pole and moved up to improve position while racing from the outside. DECO STRONG settled off
the early pace, raced near the approaching the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. SWEET GRACIE rated off the early duel, raced four wide around
the far turn and weakened in the drive. DANCER'S MELODY was bumped at the start, raced with the second flight, was five deep near the three sixteenths
pole and never threatened. NOBLE BID dueled outside of foe and tired readily.

Footnotes
DUCKPINS quick to begin to set the early pace, dueled through the far turn with Mataro, battled from the inside of rival in a long drive, dug in and proved
best under strong pressure. MATARO was forwardly placed early on, asked entering the far turn, dueled with rival two deep from the outside and kept on
gamely to the wire. MISTER MITCH dropped back off the early pace, raced near the rail around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. WIND EVENT
settled off the early going to race near the back of the pack early, raced near the rail in the stretch and moved up to improve position. FOR HONOR AND
LUCK was off slowly, raced near the inside nearing the quarter pole and had no response. THE BIG ENCHILADA stalked the pace three deep, drifted
through the upper stretch, tired and was eased.
