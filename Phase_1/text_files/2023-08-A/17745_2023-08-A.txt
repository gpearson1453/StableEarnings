Footnotes
CALIFORNIA SWING was unhurried around the first turn and continued in the back through the backstretch, picked up the pace and edged closer racing in
the four path late on the far turn, roused forward to challenge for the late lead, dug in gamely three deep and got a nose up on the wire. AUTOPILOT
secured inside position around the first turn and settled off the clear top pair up the backstretch, edged closer racing three wide late on the turn, given cue at
the head of the lane, vied between rivals in deep stretch, dug in gamely and got nipped for the win. CLASSIC BET was forwardly placed around the first turn
and stalked the leader to the far turn, moved up to challenge GRAND DESIGN for the lead nearing the quarter pole, shook free at the head of the lane, took
on the challenge from outside duo in late stages, fought back gamely from the inside, exchanged head bobs and got edged in final stride. GRAND DESIGN
led the way around the first turn and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge from CLASSIC BET nearing the quarter pole,
fought back briefly then failed to move on with rival and steadily weakened. NASTY EXAGGERATOR raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and had
no response.

REINA DEL SUR came away last at the start and continued unhurried in the back, edged closer along the inside late on the turn, came two wide into upper
stretch then shifted back to the rail, rallied gamely up the inside and got up late. JAZZ BRUNCH tracked the embattled pair up the backstretch, launched a
three wide bid and took over the lead with three furlongs left to run, quickly widened to a clear advantage, remained clear with a furlong left to run then got
denied in deep stretch. CHAMPAGNE BLING rated off the top trio in the opening quarter, moved up closer along the outside late on the turn, swung four
paths wide into the lane, was no late match for the to pair but sustained bid and cleared the rest. JACK'S PARTY GIRL raced off the clear top trio in the
opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane and faded. TRIP TO FREEDOM dueled outside of GOLD MAKERR up the
backstretch, got overtaken by JAZZ BRUNCH with three furlongs left to run and steadily retreated. GOLD MAKER vied inside of TRIP TO FREEDOM up the
backstretch, got overtaken by JAZZ BRUNCH around the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MINECRAFT MANIAC was rated under slight restraint to settle off the early pace, continued unhurried up the backstretch then let out a notch midway
around the far turn, moved up four wide turning for home, came in a couple paths, took over the lead from TIME GOES ON near the furlong marker,
remained confidently handled and finished going away while ridden out. TIME GOES ON was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pace up
the backstretch, made a bid for command late on the far turn, took over the lead, got collared by the winner at the eighth pole and had to settle for second
best. SIR WALLY WALLY raced off the top trio through up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane and
stayed on for a share. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND settled and saved ground through early stages, tipped two wide around the far turn, hustled along into the
lane and needed more for late impact. WARREN L raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo midway around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane
and lacked a needed rally. C R INSTA GATOR stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, weakened along the inside midway around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive. LAWLESS JOHN led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared for the lead at the quarter
pole and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SARAH'S BOY BLUE took over the lead soon after the start and set the pace with LETS ROCK N ROLL not far behind, edged away to a clearer lead racing
in hand around the turn, saved ground and given cue turning for home, responded willingly and drew off to an easy score. QUARTERNIGHT veered out at
the start and raced in the back in the opening quarter, was ridden along four wide around the turn, sustained an outside bid and gained second best. DEER
RUN raced near midpack up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and secured a share. LET'S ROCK N
ROLL applied pace pressure to SARAH BLUE BOY in the opening quarter, stayed up close and chased rival around the turn then tired in the drive.
CYTOKINE STORM saved ground and settled through early stages, was ridden along the inside around the turn, briefly gained position along the rail a
furlong out then gave way. MR. PRIME TIME raced off the clear top pair in the opening quarter, weakened around the turn, came two to three wide into
upper stretch and retreated.
