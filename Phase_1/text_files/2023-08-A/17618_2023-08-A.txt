pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and closed belatedly inside. BOSS LADY KIM tracked the pacesetter, chased between rivals on the far turn, rallied
into the lane and weakened. PEARLS AND HEELS tracked on the inside, moved up inside on the far turn, waited for room at the quarter pole, then had no
rally. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX raced three wide early, then four wide into the first turn, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. QUEEN
CADENCE set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled on the far turn and faded. MINING CHROME was off a bit slow and outrun. TIZ HER WAY raced
four wide early, then five wide entering the clubhouse turn, settled off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
FUN AT THE FORT stalked early on, chased on the turn, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, led into the stretch, drew clear and held well under urging.
MARVELOUSMOONDANCE raced off the pace inside, moved up at the quarter pole, rallied on the rail, finished well but second best. POLISH UP dueled
inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dropped back turning for home, angled out and came again for the show spot. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER stumbled at
the start, dueled three wide early, then dueled two wide, dug in between rivals passing the quarter pole and gave way in the final sixteenth. IT'S BIRDIE
BIRDIE raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide and failed to threaten. AL'S FROSTED dueled between rivals for the early lead, then chased and faded.
