Footnotes
PUT PUT PUT raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then moved out to four wide at the top of the stretch an ran down the leader to be up in the
final jumps. JAKE ON DAKAN rushed to a clear early lead then was headed at the quarter pole but came again, couldn't fend off the late closer and gave
way grudgingly in the stretch. CHROMESIDSATION was allowed to settle at the back down the backstretch, made a rail bid around the turn then made a
late surge on the rail for a late gain. RUNNIN BUFFALO was off the pace in the two path to the three furlong marked and slowly faded. OLD FASHION TIME
settled in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then moved up from three wide at the three furlong marker but lacked the late response. GUTFIELD
prompted the pace from the two path, moved up to engage the leader at the five sixteenths and fought gamely in early stretch but tired late. SILENCE'S
NATION was not a threat.

Footnotes
PRINCESS JAYLEEN was roused to the front to take the lead at the half mile marker then inched away around the turn and won going away. MISS IZZY
BEE hopped leaving the gate and spotted the field several lengths, moved up between horses at the seven sixteenths pole and made a rail bid around the
turn but started to tire at the top of the stretch but kept on to be second best. DAHLIA'S DANCER had good early speed but was over taken at the half mile
marker, prompted the pace around the turn and weakened. BREAKFAST BALL tracked the leaders but was not a factor. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK was off
the early pace and slowly dropped back.

SHE'S SMART ENOUGH was hustled away from the gate to set all the pace, pulled away to prove best. LADY PHYLLIS was off the pace on the inside to
the turn, matched strides with LIL MISS DE BUY to the wire but was no match for the winner. LIL MISS DE BUY stalked the pace from between horses to
the turn then dueled with LADY PHYLLIS to the wire and was outfinished. REMARKABLE CHARM raced near the back down the backstretch then saved
ground around the turn to improve her position in the stretch. PROMPTLY DONE was forwardly placed from three wide to the three furlong marker then
dropped back. EVIE had no speed and was not a threat.

Footnotes
FLO TIME was roused to the front to set the pace, edged away into the stretch and proved best. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY settled in the middle of the pack,
moved up from three wide around the turn and tipped out to five wide in upper stretch, was gaining late and was clearly second best. COLD AS YOU stalked
the pace from the inside, moved up the rail around the turn then angled out to two wide in the stretch but lacked the late response needed. DIVA'S DIVA
raced near the back then steadily advance up the rail to improve her position. SHE'S MY RIDE trailed through the turn and passed tiring rivals. LA ROSA
DRIVE tracked the leaders in the early stages then moved up from four wide at the half mile marker and prompted the pace around the turn then weakened.
AMERICAN REALITY prompted the early pace to the half mile marker then gave way.
