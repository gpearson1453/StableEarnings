Footnotes
MOORE'S LAW settled just off the inside at the tail of the field through the first turn and down the backstretch, was in behind a trio of rivals stacked across
the track into the far turn remaining just off the inside until coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, tipped out three wide nudging BREES to the four
path and advanced, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to collar the embattled top pair forty yards from the finish and prevailed edging
away at the end. MOUNT CRAIG coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through the first turn and down
the backstretch coming under some pressure from HERO'S MEDAL midway, came under light coaxing tipped to the two path half a mile from home and had
HERO'S MEDAL intensify the pressure advancing to engage in head to head combat three furlongs from home, widened away as a pair from the rest of the
field and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in stubbornly clinging to command trading light bumps and brushes through to the sixteenth marker,
got caught in tandem with his main rival with forty yards to the finish, fought on to preserve the place honors. HERO'S MEDAL stumbled at the start, raced
just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before advancing to latch on outside that rival with nine-sixteenths to go, went three wide through the far turn
advancing to duel with MOUNT CRAIG to his inside, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling through to the finish getting overtaken in concert
with his main foe forty yards from the finish, battled on but was ultimately bested for the place honors while well clear of the rest. GAME KEEPER stumbled
at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing half a mile from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
BRAGGADOCIOUS four then three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. BREES coaxed from the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
TIMELY CONQUEST went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then
drifted further out while moving clear, responded well after switching to the proper lead outside the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging.
MISSING FORTUNE broke out at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leaders leaving the backstretch, vied in the four path on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch then lost touch with the winner, chased outside into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place.
TOSCONOVA BEAUTY showed early speed, pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied between foes in the three path on the turn, passed the
five-sixteenths pole under extra left-rein pressure, spun five wide into the stretch, chased while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong and
weakened but held the show. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch under the
crop and lacked the needed response. CHASING DAYLIGHT moved up to establish a good position just off the pace, dropped back under urging while
along the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and also lacked the needed response. RANTING broke a step slow then was taken up,
settled outside at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground while roused early on the turn then angled to the four path, continued four wide
into the stretch and failed to rally. LAVON was taken in hand early then dropped back between horses while rated, went three wide under urging early on the
turn, dropped to the rail late on that bend and came up empty. BIG HAZEL was sent hard from the start then ridden along off the pace, rounded the turn in
the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) was placed to a light hold past the stands the initial time settling at the tail of the field while just off the inside through the first
turn and down the backstretch, tipped three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch,
closed well outside through the final furlong to collar her barn mate in the final strides to the finish. ROCKY SKY (IRE) established the front and showed the
way under a rating hold along the inside, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in and was caught in the late stages while clear for the place honors. POCA MUCHA tossed her head and lunged at the gate at the start
getting away last but conceding only a length or so, tracked the front while rated along the inside and was patiently handled until placed to light coaxing at
the three-eighths after being very briefly taken in hand inside of CANISY, got called upon in earnest taking the inside route into upper stretch, kept on to the
finish. CANISY tracked just off the inside under a rating hold, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened.

GRANNYS CONNECTION broke in then was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two then three path,
spun four wide into the stretch, remained clear under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and
held under steady urging. KANT HURRY LOVE showed speed then chased the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner under a drive in into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the place. BANK ON ANNA chased the pace on the outside, went four
then five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. VALLELUJAH dropped back under
urging while showing no speed, went around the turn in the three path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. TEMPERMENTAL was
urged along while dropping well off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

GAL IN A RUSH chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from
home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied with a rush to overhaul the leader a furlong from home, then edged clear to the finish kept to task.
LADY MILAGRO established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out
swinging three wide into upper stretch, drifted in straightened away and came under a left handed crop coming back out to the two path and forcing
BREEZE EASY to alter inwards when overthrown by the top one at the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors on the wire. BOWL OF CHERRIES
chased just off the inside, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in and was in tight briefly between foes a furlong out as LADY MILAGRO
came out under a left handed crop, ran on but was ultimately bested for the place honors. BREEZE EASY (GB) got away to an awkward start conceding two
lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to
go, swung three wide into upper stretch before drifting slightly in to the two path straightened away, got taken in hand briefly and altered in briefly when
LADY MILAGRO came out from along the inside under a left handed crop, then altered out in the late stages while weakening to the finish.

the turn, took the advantage inside the three-eighths, inched clear in upper stretch, responded well under a drive in the final furlong and held under strong
urging. COLONEL BOWMAN bumped with a foe at the start and was last to commence then hustled, was taken in hand briefly near the eleven-sixteenths
then came back under urging, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch, rallied while still on his inside lead into the final
furlong, moved out while gaining at the sixteenth-pole and closed well to get the place. PROVOCATEUR pressed the pace on the outside of the leader,
chased in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and lost the place while
clear for the show. NIGHT TIME broke near the back of the field, was urged along off the pace, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and improved position but lacked the needed response. TODAY'S FLAVOR stumbled at the start then was hustled to the lead, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-eighths, dropped back in upper stretch and
tired. ROTKNEE chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. CLEM LABINE was ridden along towards the rear on the far outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and

TRUST FUND got bumped askew at the start by INONIT due to pressure from CATALINA CRUSH, who veered inwards, vied three to four paths off the
inside briefly with a pair before emerging to duel three wide with PERLIANO to his inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. CANIGETALOAN chased early on with a pair to the outside while along
the rail, then chased through the turn along the fence coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to
secure the place honors tussling through to the finish with CATALINA CRUSH. CATALINA CRUSH veered in at the start bumping INONIT into the rear of
TRUST FUND, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting in
requiring correction a sixteenth out, ran on to be just bested for the place honors while clear for the show. VETTRIANO chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing and offering a bid with five-sixteenths remaining, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PERLIANO
hustled from the gate, vied briefly between foes from the two path before emerging to duel from the two path through the turn under coaxing three furlongs
from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BLUE EIGHTY FIVE broke in at the start getting corrected and
taken in hand before making contact with PERLIANO, chased three wide coaxed along from the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and made
no headway. INONIT got bumped solidly by CATALINA CRUSH into the rear end of TRUST FUND and got squeezed out and back between foes, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no response. DRINKING SOLO hustled from the start,
chased along the inside coaxed along from the get go in range early on, began to retreat into the turn and tipped to the two path through that bend,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MAD BANKER broke on top in the initial jumps from the gate and then backtracked to the rear of
the field six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into upper

Footnotes
CARL SPACKLER (IRE) brushed with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the
two path, was roused five wide into the stretch, brushed with an opponent near the three-sixteenths, rallied outside while drifting in twice in the stretch,
closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. APPRAISE (IRE) went to the front, traveled around the
opening bend in the two path, set a joint pace on the inside of a rival, was eased back outside the half-mile pole, ranged up in the two path to make a bid
again now outside the leader near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished
while just able to get the place. MORE THAN LOOKS broke out then brushed the gate and was slowest into stride, came out behind eager foes while pulling
on the bit nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled outside on the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the
stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. OCEAN VISION (IRE) played up during the
warm-up, brushed with a foe at the start, was taken up while keen early then dropped back under tight restraint, rounded the first turn in the two path, was
reserved off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, moved into a good striking position before the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in
the two path, chased on his left-lead into the final furlong, came between foes while still on the incorrect lead at the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked.
BEHIND ENEMY LINES (GB) brushed with opponents at the start, was keen under snug restraint into the first turn, saved ground while rated off the pace,
ranged up on the far turn, was asked with a clear inside opening at the quarter-pole, made a bid inside a foe into upper stretch, had the hole tighten as that
foe leaned in, brushed the hedge while pausing in tight quarters inside the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and weakened. MISCHIEVOUS
ANGEL went around the opening bend in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went three then two wide on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch,
raced between rivals near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. MYSTERIOUS NIGHT (IRE) was taken up off heels at the start, dragged
his way forward between foes under a tight hold, went three wide on the first turn, set a joint pace on the outside, moved clear with a half-mile to run,
dropped from the two path to the rail on the far turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, leaned in under extra right-rein pressure inside the
three-sixteenths and gave way. BAT FLIP was caught five wide on the first turn, settled outside towards the front, was given his cue in the three path on the
far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GENERAL JIM raced in the four path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked
in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe while dropping back near the three-sixteenths and came up empty.

Footnotes
DR ARDITO two to three wide in pursuit, floated out three to four wide with nine-sixteenths to go before tucking back to the three path placed to coaxing half
a mile from home, made steady progress through the far turn and went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was herded out five paths by
the drifting out AMERICANREVOLUTION to the eighth pole, got directed in two paths inside that station issuing a challenge to take command seventy yards
from the finish and edged away in the late going to score. SHERIFF BIANCO established the front after the start nearing the backstretch and showed the
way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch
roused for the drive, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught with seventy yards to the finish while clear for the place honors.
BANKIT forwardly placed along the inside, got forced to steady and alter to the three path when BARESE tucked directly in front with five and a half furlongs
to run, then got forced four wide by that same rival soon after, tucked back to the two path into the far turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
angled three wide into upper stretch, followed the pair in front of him outwards five paths to the furlong grounds before coming again mildly to secure the
show honors. AMERICANREVOLUTION stumbled at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride at the tail of the field
early on, went three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and was carried out slightly with five and a half furlongs to run when BANKIT altered
out from BARESE and then had the same foe tip out running more interference, tucked three wide into the far turn and advanced on the front tucking to the
two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths and forcing BARESE to the inside, swung three wide into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out five paths
straightened away to the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. BARESE forwardly placed just off the inside in the early stages, tucked inside directly in
front of BANKIT forcing that foe to steady and alter off the rail to the three path with five and a half furlongs to run, tipped out to the three path forcing all but
the leader to alter out, tucked to chase just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got nudged inside with
five-sixteenths to go and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
MAGNILOQUENT broke fast then rocketed clear of the rest of the field, opened up a sizable advantage in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch, maintained a very large advantage with the rider motionless in the saddle into the final furlong, was shaken up for a few strides shortly thereafter
then put back to a very mild hand ride to win handily. LINARITE stumbled at the start and was off slow, angled in at the rear near the nine-sixteenths,
dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, angled out near the three-sixteenths and safely secured the place
while no match for the winner. DIAMOND COLLECTOR was urged along off the pace, moved in leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two
path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. QUICK POWER NAP broke out and bumped with
a rival, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and also lacked the needed response then missed the show. SERENADE SOLDIER was
hustled from the gate, chased the solo leader from second, traveled around the turn in the four path and tired. THREE UNIONS broke awkwardly then
bumped with foes on both sides and was taken up while in tight between horses, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
KREESA LA WROTE bumped with a rival after the start, was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch
and came up empty.

tucked to the two path into the far turn advancing on the leader to take over command seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under challenge to the outside, swung two to three wide into upper stretch displaced from the front, came again to take command nearing the
eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. SWEETEST PRINCESS three wide through the opening bend, chased five paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking three wide into the far turn advanced on the front coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over the front and swung
five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared nearing the eighth pole ran on to chase the aforementioned foe home clear of the rest for
the place honors. GHOSTLY GIRL established the front midway on the first turn when HUNTRESS MOON was taken hold of and eased off, showed the
way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside half a mile from home, got displaced from the front with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ANILEATE just off the inside through the first bend, raced six
to seven paths off the inside into the backstretch before tucking to the two path carrying HUNTRESS MOON inside of her to near the rail before clearing that
rival five furlongs from home, came under coaxing two to three wide at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. HUNTRESS
MOON stumbled at the start and broke on top despite it, was taken hold and throttled back off the front midway on the first turn along the rail conceding the
spot to GHOSTLY GIRL, tipped out five to six paths off the inside into the backstretch, got carried in by the aforementioned foe to nearly the rail near the five
furlong marker before being cleared by that rival, went four wide into and through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch and tired.
