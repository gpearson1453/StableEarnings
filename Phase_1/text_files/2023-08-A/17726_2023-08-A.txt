Footnotes
THUNDERS ROCKNROLL gained command immediately after the start, had a ground saving journey, and shook clear in the homestretch for a gate to wire
score. CUPIDS CRUSH broke alertly and trekked the two path while pressing the pacesetter through the opening half, was on the heels of leader at upper
stretch from a three path position, veered out near the eighth pole, and finished a clear second but was no contest for tough runaway winner. LOVER GIRL
settled into mid pack and took a three wide journey through the opening half, chased the pacesetting duo while maintaining the three path route, and proved
best of rest behind that top pair. CHECKCASHINGCONNIE travelled widest of all through the opening bend, gave chase from mid pack along the
backstretch, and steadily lost ground to front runners in closing half. ANA tucked to the inside to save ground shortly after the start, trekked the inside along
the backstretch, and steadily faded in closing strides.

Footnotes
XTREME SMOKE SHOW stalked the early pacesetter from a three wide pose, trekked three wide around the turn, had a slight advantage at upper stretch,
drifted in near the eighth pole, and just held off the rallying rival for the score. TAPITURE'S LADY showed reserve in early strides, took an inside track
around the bend, then rallied superbly in homestretch to just miss the victory. SHY SHY pressed the early pace from a two path pose, was on even terms for
lead between rivals at upper stretch, was forced to change lane nearing the eighth pole, then was nipped at wire for place honors by rallying foe.
CRESSONS LIL CHARM hustled from the start and gained first command, had a slight advantage as the inner rival of three abreast at conclusion of
backstretch, was headed nearing the quarter pole, then angled out inside the three sixteenths pole and weakened in the final furlong. MISS SILVER settled
into mid pack along the backstretch and through the bend, swung wide at upper stretch, and lacked a needed rally. SWEET GETAWAY was unhurried,
trailed the field from outset and failed to menace.

GOING AT IT hustled from outset and gained first command, took a two path journey through the opening half, tucked to inside around the closing bend,
and shook clear in final furlong for a gate to wire score. CLASS COMPOUNDS pressed the pacesetter through the opening half from an inside stance, was
within striking distance at upper stretch, and finished a clear second but was no match for winner in final furlong. CHARISMO settled into second flight, lost
ground to front runners along backstretch, swung widest at upper stretch and finished willingly to earn the show. JUST BECAUSE came away alertly,
trekked three wide through the opening bend, led the second flight along the backstretch, and weakened in crucial stages of contest. HE'S CONNECTED
established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, settled into a back rated position and failed to factor. FOREVER INDIAN rated four wide around
the opening bend, trailed the field along the backstretch, tucked to save ground late, and was no factor.

SHE'S MY WARRIOR rushed from outset to lead the field at first call, travelled the inside line throughout, and never relished command for a wire to wire
victory. IT'S HER TIME hustled from outset and forced the pace issue from a two path stance all the way, but was outdueled in final furlong and had to settle
for place honors. MOLLY'S ANGEL showed reserve in early strides, advanced to second flight along the backstretch, rated two wide from a three path pose
at upper stretch, engaged in a stretch duel behind the lead duo, and bested that rival to secure the show. CHARLIE'S PENNY trekked three wide through
the opening bend, gave chase from second flight along the backstretch, saved ground at upper stretch, then was outdueled in final furlong for the show
honors. GYPSY REWARD established an inside stance shortly after the start, rated back, nd failed to menace. START SINGING steadily faded in closing
stages after settling in between rivals in the early going and losing ground to front runners at the midway point.

Footnotes
ROYALS' LIL DIVA lunged at the break, rushed up to two wide through the opening turn, gained command near the five sixteenths pole, shook off all
challengers near the eighth pole, and held on for the score. JEWEL AZUL showed reserve through the opening half, advanced on the front runner with a
three wide move around the closing bend, rated widest of all at upper stretch, and rallied mildly to procure the place but could not catch the winner in the
end. A THOUSAND DREAMS trekked two wide early, made mid move to close gap along the backstretch, rated between rivals at upper stretch, and
finished willingly for the show. EXPECT THE BOSS tucked behind early speedster to save ground around opening bend, was the lone rival in second flight
at the half pole, maintained an inside line through the closing turn, and steadily weakened thereafter. CURIOUS INJI flashed early foot and led the field into
the closing bend from an inside position before eclipsing in the crucial portion of contest. LADY CLARE tucked to inside shortly after the start, saved ground
throughout, and faded in closing stages.

Footnotes
THEALLIGATORHUNTER rushed from outset to establish a ground saving pose, led the field at first step, and refused to relish command for a gate to wire
score. XAVEY DAVE saved ground through the opening bend behind pacesetter, was the lone rival in the second flight along the backstretch, angled out to
the two path at upper stretch, and couldnt catch the winner in the end but finished well clear of the rest. DEVIL VISION showed reserve in early strides and
tucked behind rivals to save ground, maintained that line into stretch before floating out near the three sixteenths pole and secured the show but was no
match for top duo in final furlong. COUSVINNYSACANUCK was unhurried around the first turn, lacked room nearing the half pole, split foes at upper stretch
and improved placing in homestretch; just missing the show. BAYOU BENNY finished evenly after settling into mid pack and rating three wide at upper
stretch. OUT RUN'M travelled widest of all in the opening turn, closed the gap on the front runners along the backstretch, trekked wide at upper stretch, and
failed to threaten the front runners.

JOHNNY UP led the second flight along the backstretch, gained command near the quarter pole, and shook clear in final sixteenth for the victory. SUMMER
ALL YEAR settled in behind the pacesetter, trekked the three path through the bend, was the lone rival in second flight at upper stretch, then rallied strongly
to earn the place in the final stride. DIRECT ACTION flashed early speed and led the field at the conclusion of backstretch, was headed near the quarter
pole, couldnt fend off the rally of rival in closing strides and was forced to settle for the show. RISKY SITUATION broke alertly and in concert with all rivals,
rated mid pack going into the bend, trekked the two path at upper stretch, and tired in final furlong. WEST BAY failed to threaten and lacked a closing bid to
end a ground saving journey. HEAVENLY GAZEBO travelled widest of all and lost ground to front runners.

Footnotes
ROSES BY LIAM awaited options through the opening half by trekking the two path and looming just off the pace, swung to three wide at upper stretch, then
finished with best stride of all in final furlong to kick clear in the end. JOSE PATIO flashed early speed and led the field through opening half, was on even
terms near the quarter pole, then failed to fend off rivals in closing stages. IT'S BOBS BUSINESS pressed the early pace three wide, angled to four wide
and was close up at upper stretch, but was outfinished in final strides. WIN OVER WYATT lacked a serious bid after settling into mid pack and travelling an
inside route. SIR STERLING hurried from outset and loomed two wide around the opening turn, forced the pace along the backstretch, was on even terms
near the quarter pole, led the field briefly at upper stretch, then rapidly faded in final furlong. RAMBLINGAMBLINMAN passed tiring foes in late going after
being unhurried from outset. REJECTION HURTS lacked a serious bid after showing reserve through the opening half. WEST ISLAND settled into the
second flight through opening turn, lost ground to frontrunners along the backstretch, and tired in latter portion of contest.
