PEACH STREET steadily advanced up the inside in opening stages and challenged SINGING EMMA for the early lead, dueled up the backstretch and
around the turn, shook free turning for home, continued clear a furlong out then came back under attack from SINGING EMMA in deep stretch, dug in
gamely and nipped rival for the win. SINGING EMMA led the way out of the gate then took on the inside challenge from PEACH STREET and vied up the
backstretch, failed to maintain equal terms leaving the turn but remained in contention, found more in reserve in deep stretch, moved back up to challenge
PEACH STREET for the late lead, dueled heads apart, dug in gamely and got nipped for the win. RELIANT was allowed to settle just off the pace in the
opening quarter, hustled up to pick up the pace late on the turn, came three wide into the lane, drifted out wider, sustained bid and edged closer but failed to
reach the top pair. ADMIRAL'S GARNET tracked the top pair three to four wide up the backstretch, failed to advance around the turn then retreated in the
lane.

ONCE UPON A DREAM was nicely rated sitting just off the early pace, edged up closer on the rail late on the turn then given cue entering the lane, quickly
cleared command, widened advantage under pressure then finished ridden out. SHUT UP MAN was forwardly placed through the early going then tracked
the embattled pair around the turn, launched an outside bid heading into the lane, was no match for the winner but stayed on with response and finished
clearly second best. HOPPIN JOHN was off slow at the start and raced in the back, cut the corner entering the lane and churned on for a share. ROBUST
raced up close through early stages then moved up late on the backstretch, dueled outside of EXPLOSIVE PRIDE around the turn, got overtaken by the
winner at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. UNREAL raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the turn and failed to move into
contention. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE held a slim lead in the opening quarter, dueled inside of ROBUST around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

MAHOMES set a pressured pace up the backstretch and held a slim lead around the turn, continued to lead the way by a slim margin over outside pair into
the final sixteenth, dug in gamely nearing the wire and refused to be denied. SECRET BLARNEY was well placed sitting just off the top pair into the turn,
launched a three wide bid in upper stretch, dug in under firm handling, inched up to MAHOMES nearing the wire and failed to get by. SNAP'N TAP applied
pace pressure to MAHOMES up the backstretch and around the turn, stayed on gamely between foes into the final sixteenth then weakened late. SAILOR
CHOW raced off the top trio into the turn, coaxed four paths wide turning for home but failed to kick on.

furlong marker and finished going away. NATIVE HELLRAISER was allowed to settle through early stages, edged closer and was ridden along the inside
into upper stretch, angled a couple paths wider, finished with response and gained place. GONE WITH THE FINN quickly cleared the lead and angled in
after the start, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, got collared by the winner past the furlong marker, weakened and
got vanned off after the race. TAP THE BRAKES raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.
TEMPLE CITY RUN stumbled hard at the start and raced in the back, chased three to four wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. I LOVE
ROCKNSTROLL was forwardly placed up the backstretch, sustained bid around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
AMERICAN POSSE was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, moved up closer along the rail mid-way around the turn, cut the corner
then tipped two wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and nipped rival for the win. DOT COM DREAMIN tracked the pace along the inside up the
backstretch, waited briefly mid-way around the turn then got through just past the five sixteenths pole, took over the lead, ran on two wide through the lane
and got nipped on the wire. ANNUAL BUDGET raced in range in the opening quarter, was ridden along three paths wide around the turn, came four wide
into the lane, sustained bid and secured a share. SAY IT NICELY set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued to hold a narrow lead into the turn, got
collared by inside running DOT COM DREAMIN past the mid-way point on the turn, ran on into the lane then flattened late. TALONS TIME pressed the pace
up the backstretch, continued up close then weakened late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive. KOBE'S CAUSE was not far back in the opening
quarter, had no response when called upon around the turn, ran on along the inside through the lane and failed to threaten. LEADING THE CAUSE raced in
the back throughout.
