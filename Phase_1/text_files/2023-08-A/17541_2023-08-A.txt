Footnotes
JERSEY JET was hustled clear and to the inside approaching the bend then steadily opened up in the lane while kept to urging until the final seventy yards.
TIGGER ATTACK reluctant to load, progressed two wide on the turn, fanned out to path five for the stretch run, altered outside WILDISH inside the final
eighth, closed well and caught the latter for second at the wire. WILDISH broke alertly but soon retreated from inside, angled out through the bend, took
over second inside the last eighth, drifted out some approaching the final sixteenth, kept a straight path in the waning yards but was outfinished for the
place. JILL ATTACK also reluctant to load into the gate, pressed JERSEY JET from just outside, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and
flattened out the final eighth. BEST MAN SPEECH was reluctant to load as well, chased from outside, was steadied and altered out when TIGGER ATTACK
came into his path nearing the sixteenth marker and had no late bid. COOGAN chased from between horses and was never a factor. MOCOWBELL saved
ground and had little to offer for the stretch run. IT'S ON hesitated then broke inward, was three wide taking the bend and empty for the drive.

Footnotes
LIMA ZULU bumped from the rear at the break, moved clear of the rest after the first sixteenth, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was put to a drive
midstretch, lugged in some with a sixteenth to go and kept WINDIGO SPIRIT at bay. WINDIGO SPIRIT gradually angled to the inside on the backstretch,
moved clear for second on the bend, still loomed a threat with a furlong left, did not have enough late but was clearly second best. MARY'S BOY was
hustled along between rivals in the early going, came four wide into the lane, gained third deep stretch then could only hold his position late. BRASKA was
soon well back and well off the inside, lost ground widest through the turn but showed a willingness to run the final furlong. HE'S A FINE MAN broke inward,
bumping LIMA ZULU then failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. LORD SHAFTESBURY pressed from outside on the backstretch, began to retreat three
wide on the bend, swung out to path five for the drive, lugged in upper stretch and continued to fade.

OKLAHOMA HEAT settled just off the inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, came into contention two wide on the second turn, lugged in some as he
took a slight advantage inside the furlong marker and gradually edged ahead as he drifted out in the waning yards. SAFE shared the early lead just off the
rail while in hand, moved ahead on the second bend, floated out some for the stretch run, began to gradually drift out inside the last eighth, lost the lead,
held a straight path the final sixteenth but had to settle for second best. THACKER FROMM rated from inside, went for the lead along the rail after four
furlongs, took over third on the second turn, threatened midstretch. angled out for a clear path inside the final eighth then continued to drift as he flattened
out late. BLEEDING BLUE displayed early speed outside SAFE but flattened out for the drive. WAVE THE GOLD was a brief contender but gradually
yielded from just off the inside before finishing a half mile. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS did not settle into a racing stride into the first bend, showed no speed
once he regained a better stride leaving the first turn, was urged along but never really responded.

the wire. I LUV THIS BAR was caught in tight quarters as she vied for the early lead, shuffled back midway on the backstretch, altered out, was four wide
through the turn, took over second inside the last eighth then could only hold her position late. THINK BLUE forwardly placed from outside, lost ground
widest through the bend, lacked a significant stretch bid but gained third in the waning yards. BETHY in contention from inside, rallied to threaten along the
rail midstretch but leveled off the final eighth. MY MORNING GAL displayed early speed from outside but began to yield three wide before finishing a half

COMFORT ME NOW rated off the early speed, found himself boxed in on the second bend, moved to the rail entering the stretch, rallied inside the last
furlong, floated out some in the waning yards but gained the advantage nearing the wire. IRISH DECLARATION boxed in early, gained a clear path three
wide midway on the backstretch, closed the gap two wide on the second turn, fanned outside TROY OUNCE entering the lane, also rallied deep stretch and
edged ahead for second in the final strides. TROY OUNCE vied for the lead from inside, moved clear on the backstretch, floated out some leaving the
second bend, drifted out under right-handed pressure after entering the last eighth, was corrected, gradually wore down between rivals in the late going but
was easily best of the rest in a game effort. IMPERIAL MOMENT raced in contention from outside for more than five furlongs then began to yield from path
three. FLASHY RICHIE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. ORBITAL STARR showed little running widest of all most his trip.

COMISKEY PARK was encouraged to share the early lead from inside then allowed to relax, let out leaving the bend and steadily drew off under urging in
the lane. W W CRAZY hesitated at the break, was hustled up while toward the outside, five wide into the turn, moved to the rail approaching the end of a
half mile, moved clear for second upper stretch, still had an easy striking position with a furlong to go but could only hold his position late. ONE PUTT
RICHIE prominent not far off the inside on the backstretch, lost ground four to six wide through the bend, gained third inside the last eighth, was all out but
could only close the gap on W W CRAZY in the waning yards. DIAMOND MAXIMUS chased running widest, was six wide into the turn, moved in some
midway on the bend, lodged a mild bid from path three in the lane and was getting to ONE PUTT RICHIE nearing the wire. BASEBALL POLITICS shared
the lead from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up three wide on the turn and gave way the last two furlongs. UPBEAT MELODY displayed early
speed between horses, floated out to path four entering the lane and also gave way.

WARM BEAUTY rated running widest on the backstretch, was roused five wide on the bend, lost further ground fanning to path seven entering the stretch,
rallied under steady urging and got up in time under a well-judged ride. TEMPLUNA was hustled to stay close just off the inside, moved to the rail on the
turn, drew clear upper stretch, began to gradually drift out after entering the last furlong and was outfinished. LOUIE P without early speed, though urged
along leaving the gate, came into contention four wide on the bend, fanned out further for the drive, threatened with a furlong to go but leveled off in the
waning yards. SWEET JUSTICE fractious in the gate before the break, was prominent between rivals from the start, took the turn three wide, floated out
some into the lane and gradually yielded deep stretch. BAILESTON LASSIE shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead and stayed just off the inside
on the bend but flattened out for the stretch run. TWO MORE TIMES broke alertly but was soon outrun, moved to the inside into the turn, came off the rail
some nearing the end of a half mile, swung five wide into the stretch and made up minor ground the final furlong. SUPERTRIX void of speed, though urged
along from the early going, was just off the inside on the bend, lost considerable ground fanning to the middle of the track entering the lane and showed
belated interest the last eighth. DEAUVILLE MIST disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch but began to fade before finishing three furlongs.
