Footnotes
UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) pressed the issue inside in the beginning, was then content to track the pacesetter on the turn, angled out three wide
gaining momentum for the drive with two furlongs remaining, found his best stride at the eighth pole and went on by the frontrunner to draw away in deep
stretch. VIDEO VIDA took command narrowly early on, opened up on horses through the turn, began to get leg weary in mid stretch still not switching leads,
offered little resistance to the winner at the sixteenth pole and held on for the place share at the wire. IT'S ME MARIO broke inwards to start, was on hold
inside behind the chasing pack throughout the turn, rallied when a seam opened up four wide at the quarter marker, posed a threat four wide outside
runners in upper stretch but could no match strides with the winner late. IGNITE THE STORM broke slow seeing field inside in the early going, was under a
tight hold between rivals entering the turn, roused with five sixteenths to go and passed tired runners inside through the lane. SING DIXIE settled near the
rear three deep in the beginning, put in a mild run outside three wide starting at the half mile marker, was in contention at the three eighths pole, angled six
wide for the drive but had little to give to the finish. TORY'S HOLIDAY was in a good spot early tracking the top pair down the back straight, was ridden
trying to keep position behind the frontrunner with rivals on either side, offered little response by the quarter pole and gave way in upper stretch.
PRETZLICK stumbled shortly after the break, co-trailed outside down the backside, could not get interested running on the turn and was not a factor
finishing on the fence down the lane.

Footnotes
GATLING GUN was well-placed inside foes briefly with the early lead, continued to track as a rival cleared from outside and moved in, was blocked late on
the turn in behind that foe, attempted to get through inside in upper stretch but again lacked room, was guided out five wide, followed MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN
then shifted inside that one, rallied strongly to get up in time. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN settled into stride dropping back to the rear and switching off the rail,
went in the two to three path on the turn, swung out five wide turning for home, bid between runners and taking the lead in mid-stretch, was outfinished while
drifting out just a bit. SILENT RISK stalked from between runners two to three wide on the turn, got the nod for show. WHERE'S NEAL broke a half-step
slowly and was in just a bit tight dropping back to the rear, switched outside foes, went four to five wide on the turn, advanced to within range in upper- to
mid-stretch, could not kick on, missed show. SILVER SMOKE broke a step slowly, was guided out and urged forward rapidly passing the field and moving
clear, shifted in to dictate terms on the turn, gave way late. HARDWARE GAP stalked from outside three to four wide, weakened in the stretch. WILD
CONVERSATION raced at the back three to four wide and between runners through the turn, had no rally.

Footnotes
THE GREAT OZ hopped up at the break, was content tracking the front duo in the beginning, rated kindly outside down the backside keeping a close eye on
the leaders, moved midpoint on the turn, quickly took control at the top of the stretch and drew off at the furlong marker cruising home at the wire.
CADAMOSTO (IRE) broke quickly to be in front in the early going, was hounded outside down the back straight, put away the early pace rival with five
sixteenths remaining, braced for the outside charge at the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner at the top of the lane and comfortably bested
the rest crossing the wire. BOSSY HOLIDAY trailed this compact field leaving the chute, moved up a position inside at the half mile marker, rallied on the
fence midturn, could not pose a threat to the top two turning for home and finished up a clear third at the line. SUGAR RAY prompted outside leaving the
chute, continued to press the issue down the backstretch forcing an honest pace, was ridden for more at the quarter marker between foes, offered little gain
and faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
JAMIESTA raced inside early on the turn off the leaders, moved out three wide turning into the stretch, led outside the sixteenth pole and edged past. MR
NARCISSISTIC attended from inside early, moved to a narrow lead by the nine-sixteenths, dueled into the turn, moved clear turning for home while coming
off the fence, was outfinished late. MIA AND ME steadied on heels about the nine-sixteenths, shifted in, saved ground inside on the turn, ran on in the
stretch. SMART COVERAGE got away well and had a small early lead through the opening three-sixteenths racing three wide, continued to press a foe
about a neck back through the turn, weakened in the stretch. BOSS HOLIDAY raced mid-pack outside going three wide on the turn, was one-paced and did
not threaten. SNOOKERED raced at the back, swung six wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. GIVE ME MY MONEY was not a threat racing off the
inside. MENDELJOHN (IRE) had brief early speed attending the pace from between runners, dropped back, tired.

Footnotes
IT'S A FLUKE quickly took control while in hand down the backstretch, was left alone unchallenged setting a soft pace throughout the turn, rider took a look
back in upper stretch looking for rivals, found none and was hand ridden to the wire for the easy win. JACK settled three deep outside in the early going,
took closer order to the winner rallying four wide midway on the turn, looked to be the only one who could threaten in the six path at the top of the stretch but
the winner was lone gone and had to settle for second best on this day. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA tracked with rivals on either side down the backside,
chased the pacesetting winner on the turn, battled on in upper stretch for second, faded for that at the sixteenth pole and held on for the show award at the
wire. MOON OVER EGBERT settled in the third flight between runners, made little headway on the turn, could see the field in the five path straightening out
for the drive, continued to keep an even pace in mid stretch and got up for a small share late. HYGGE stalked on the rail in the third flight down the back
straight, saved ground throughout the turn making little impact, split foes at the eighth pole and showed good late energy to the wire to be involved for the
minors. CLIVE CROSS chased the frontrunner on the rail down the backstretch, was shuffled back on the fence losing a few positions on the turn, was
scrubbed on inside two furlongs from the finish to be in the mix for a small share and could not find more and stalled in the final furlong on the rail. LITTLE
DOMI was allowed to settle trailing the field in the beginning, caught up to the field running in hand three wide with three eighths to go, angled out seven
wide for the stretch drive and made little impression to the finish. HEY LUIGI tracked three deep outside down the backside, was nudged on the keep pace
between others with five sixteenths to go, offered little turn of foot five wide at the quarter pole and retreated in mid stretch.

Footnotes
JUMBOTRON exchanged repeated bumps at the start, moved up outside four wide on the turn, challenged the leader at the top of the stretch, took a narrow
advantage, dueled with that one and got the nod. COUNTRY LIVING was forwardly-positioned stalking, bid three wide taking the lead outside the quarter
pole, was headed in upper stretch, fought on dueling late inside but just missed. BUCK'S FIZZ tracked in behind just off the rail, went two wide on the turn
moving between runners to the top of the stretch, moved in a bit at that juncture after the rider looked back and to the left, was guided out near the sixteenth
pole and closed the gap on the top pair. BRAVE DANCER exchanged repeated bumps at the start, settled at the rear, swung nine wide into upper stretch,
kicked on well but too late. ZIPPY GIZMO broke a step slowly, lacked early speed despite urging, raced inside on or just off the rail, kept on late. SIESTA
BEACH was in range three to four wide through the turn, ran on evenly. ALWAYS A WAY raced in the back half of the field, moved out from three to five
wide turning for home, needed more. BEARING DOWN was bounced around between runners at the start, went four then five wide on the turn fanning out a
bit further at the top of the stretch and having advanced mildly, was in a bit tight near the furlong marker, ran on. IF YOU INSIST was hard-ridden from the
start, moved to the lead, was pressured by an inside rival, dueled that one to the turn and regained the lead, was overtaken late on the bend and began to
weaken, steadied just slightly at the top of the stretch, drifted in and appeared to brush the rail in upper stretch, came up empty. ASHUKA moved forward
attending the pace from inside, dueled briefly, steadied slightly at the five-sixteenths, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CONMAN tracked the top pair four wide on the first turn, had a perfect set up watching the front two duel down the back straight, collared the softened up
frontrunner in upper stretch, went on by at the eighth pole and was drawing away nicely at the finish. LIFETIME OF CHANCE broke out at the start, angled
inside saving ground on the first turn to stalk the leaders, rated near the back in no hurry down the backstretch, began to quicken around runners midpoint
on the turn in a bold move, shifted out six wide for the drive and determinedly ran on but could not gain on the winner and settled for second best. EYES ON
THE KING brushed inside rival at the start, prompted the leader four wide into the first turn, forced the pace outside under lively fractions down the backside,
appeared to be giving way between foes at the quarter pole five wide and resurged at the furlong marker to be involved for the place share at the wire.
MEHLEK trailed on the fence in the early going, still could see the field running at the half, began to pick up horses two wide outside at the quarter pole,
shifted out in the four path at the top of the lane, shifted inside at the furlong marker and closed late to get up for a minor share at the finish line. SIR
LANCELOT was brushed at the start, took the field three wide entering the first turn, was hounded outside throughout the backstretch, opened up on the
early pace rival midway on the final turn, was collared by the closing winner outside in mid stretch, could not find another gear to repel the challenge and
tired in the last sixteenth. KEEN FLATTER stalked five wide outside foes into the first turn, was content near the back of the pack down the backside, was
roused with three furlongs to keep up to the front pack, could not offer a rally and was empty for the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
RAPID TEST brushed a rival lightly at the start, took closer order up the backstretch racing inside, saved ground on the turn, came out three to four wide,
took aim, was flying late to drive past seventy yards from home. LA BELLEZA NEGRA had forward position along the inside early but off the leader,
switched off the rail stalking from outside, moved to that one heading to the top of the stretch, bid at the three-sixteenths, put that one away after dueling
and began to edge clear but was outkicked by another foe. HE'S FULLY LOADED broke outwardly, set the early pace racing very wide, shifted in after
clearing the gap, was challenged turning for home, dueled inside in upper- to mid-stretch, yielded grudgingly. LESLIE CHOW was brushed lightly at the
start, switched out, went four wide on the turn racing off the leaders, came out more turning for home, ran on. HILARIOUS AFFAIR raced near but off the rail
and went evenly making no bid. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI dropped back on the turn racing three wide, failed to rally. BILL NEEDLE failed to menace while
racing just off the rail.

QUITE READY tracked in the second flight on the fence, was on hold behind the front duo throughout the turn, was looking for running room in the three
path in upper stretch, finally found a seam bursting through splitting rivals at the furlong marker and surged right at the wire to get up in the last jump for the
victory in a well timed stretch rally. WOODBINE WAY tracked in the second flight outside, rallied to offer a bid three wide at the five sixteenths pole, swung
out five wide turning for home having clear running room, had a slim lead with a sixteenth remaining but could not find another gear late and lost the nod at
the wire for the win. GALVASTON prompted outside in the early stages, hounded the pace while running comfortably outside throughout the turn, bid four
wide at the quarter pole, poked his head in front with three sixteenths remaining, began to weaken a touch between foes at the sixteenth but still finished
late to hold for show in the end. FOUR ACES HIGH was checked on the rail soon after the start to trail the compact field down the backside, regrouped to
be with the field running in hand at the hand, was looking for running room behind horses turning for home, lost its path four wide at the furlong marker,
shifted out losing momentum with a sixteenth to go and could not recover in time to pose a threat at the finish. KAWACATOOSE was hustled to lead this
field down the backstretch, continued up front having a slim advantage inside on the turn, was collared outside straightening out for the drive, fought on
stubbornly until the eighth pole and gave way in deep stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 FOUR ACES HIGH AGAINST #2

Footnotes
SPEEDY RIVER went straight to the front, dictated terms while shifting in, widened on the turn and into upper stretch, held safe. GAV'S DREAM GIRL
bumped and was in tight and pinched back at the start, was then in tight and steadied slightly early, settled at the back, fanned six wide into upper stretch,
gained the place but was too late to reach the winner. STRIKE THE POSE was fractious in the gate, settled outside mid-pack four to five wide, was
outfinished for second. TIPSY MOON chased three to four wide, ran on evenly late. DIXIE MORNING settled off the pace, moved out from three wide early
on the turn to fan seven wide into upper stretch, kept on well late. GOLDEN TRAIN was hard to load, chased the leader shifting in early, pursued that one
two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. STOLE THE RING raced off the pace, moved out from two to four wide on the turn coming six deep into
upper stretch, evened out late. HOT OMELET was bumped into a rival racing between foes just off the pace at the five-eighths, continued to chase up close
near but off the inside, weakened. NORTHERN PASSAGE was in tight early and guided out to avoid issues in front, raced off the inside in about the three
path into the turn, swung nine wide into the stretch, failed to menace. KATCHY NAME was forced into a rival at the five-eighths exchanging bumps, chased
mid-pack about three deep, faded. SO BREANNA broke out just a bit, chased inside, was bumped and checked at the five-eighths, failed to threaten
thereafter. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY GOLDEN TRAIN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH AND PLACED LAST BEHIND SO BREANNA FOR
CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION THAT INTERFERED WITH THAT ONE
