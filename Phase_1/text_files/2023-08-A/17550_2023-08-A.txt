Footnotes
CAT'S CAVE was well rated early, saved ground on the turn, eased out and came three wide into the lane, made a bid to edged clear late to prove best
under a drive. BUBBLING UP vied for the lead between rivals, made a two wide bid leaving the turn and then dug in to try to hold off the winner but could
not hold that rival off late, second best. STEAMPUNK was settled back early, came five wide off the turn and showed late interest to be along for the show
award. THIRSTY ACCOUNTANT vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. SPIRITUAL LADY vied for the lead three wide and weakened.
TEARDROP TIARA was slow into stride then passed the tiring rivals. NICE AS PIE chased the early pace and made a mild bid between rivals nearing the
quarter pole, then was empty. OSO was reserved early, inside on the turn and had no rally. OUTFACTORED was off slowly and not a factor. LIGHTNIN
QUEEN stalked the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
JUBILEE BRIDGE unhurried in the early going, steadily closed ground down the backside, saved ground rallying along the fence in the final bend, angled
out four wide in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. TRAFFIC SONG sped to the lead into the first turn, dueled on the pace down the backstretch,
pulled clear of the pace presser turning for home but failed to hold off the winner down the lane. UNRULY JULIE raced up the fence into the first turn,
steadied along the rail when JOIN THE DANCE dropped to the rail on the pace, tracked the leaders to the upper stretch and finished willingly while drifting
out down the lane. CHACALOSA trailed most of the way and lacked a closing response. JOIN THE DANCE moved up in the two path down the lane the first
time, dropped to the rail in the turn causing rival to steady, pressed the pace from the rail to top of the lane and weakened down the stretch.

CORINNA was settled early two wide, came three wide off the turn and made a bid, then drew clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving. JOYA DEL
SUR sent to the lead to set a uncontested pace on the inside, was headed leaving the furlong marker and could not go with the winner, stayed on to be
clearly second best. BEASTIE GIRL was reserved early, two wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and had no late gain while besting the rest. AMUNET
was reserved early and then had a belated rally on the inside. MOONSHINING tracked the pace two wide and weakened. STORMIN' AMANDA chased the
pace two to three wide and weakened. KATIE GOT LUCKY was settled back early, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and was not a
threat. CAPTURE MY DREAMS was void of early speed, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. BEDTIMEBOURBON was settled on the inside

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT KISSES stalked the pace through the first turn, made a middle move up the backside splitting rivals to duel on the lead, took command into the
turn and finished well to hold the closers safe. QUARANTINI raced three wide through for the first half mile tracking the pace, dropped to the fence saving
ground while rallying through the turn, angled out for the drive and finished willingly. WICKED KITTEN rated in mid pack along the rail into the far turn and
closed belatedly to be up for the show. GATHER THE FACTS raced two wide to the far turn, circled three wide to loom in upper stretch and finished evenly.
MIDNIGHT IN PRAGUE showed speed into the first turn to take the lead along the rail, responded when challenged by the winner down the backside and
weakened in the lane. JAYLEE unhurried early to be near the rear of the field most of the way and showed late interest making up ground in the stretch.
THE MONSTER IRUS slow away from the gate to trail to the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. HERECOMESPUDD never menaced and showed late
interest in the lane. EXAGGERATED HUMOR well placed for the first three quarters and lacked a closing response. BRAIZER was never a threat. LAVERN
prominent for the first half mile and came up empty. GLACIE INHERITANCE showed speed for a half mile while racing wide the entire way and was eased
in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
AMORE MOON was well rated on th e inside, waited for room leaving the turn, then made a bid between rivals leaving the three sixteenths to vie for
command between rivals by the furlong marker, then edged clear to prove best under a drive. CONFER was settled back early, made a five wide move on
the turn, then continued that move off the turn to vie for command by the furlong marker outside a trio but was outkicked by the winner. BRAVO REGINA
was reserved early and was four wide on the turn, shifted out in the lane and finished well on the outside. FEMINISTA was allowed to settle early, made a
middle move to be in contention on the turn, between rivals leaving the quarter pole, then had no kick in the drive and needed more. CASH ON FIRST vied
for the lead on the inside and weakened the final furlong. SATISFIED was settled two wide, then lacked room and checked hard around the three eighths
marker, then shifted out in the lane and had a belated rally. MORETHANASTORM was allowed to settle early, made a move on the turn and came five wide
off the turn but flattened out. EARLEY ROSE was reserved early and three wide and lacked a rally. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY chased the early pace three
to two wide, then was on the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. LILY'S LEAD was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. LUCIDITY vied for
the lead three wide and gave way. There was a general STEWARDS INQUIRY into the running on the turn but the race was left as is.

Footnotes
TIZ A TALE tracked the pace from the fence through the turn and rallied determinedly to be up in deep stretch. DISCREET DEVIL broke alertly to be in front
leaving the gate, settled back to prompt the pace into the turn, took command in upper stretch and was out-finished by the winner in a good effort.
DISPUTED CLAIM reserved to race mid-pack to upper stretch, angled four wide and rallied belatedly to be gaining fast at the wire. HIT THE JACKPOT
saved ground while dropping in from his wide post and closed late in the drive. GIANTSBANE slow early to be at the rear of the field, swung five wide
turning for home and made a mild bid. EL BAILADOR sped off to a clear lead shortly away from the gate, maintained that advantage to upper stretch and
weakened down the lane. PERFECT MOON raced near the rear of the pack and showed mild late interest. MUNNIS PRETTY tracked the leaders from two
wide into the turn and failed to respond when called upon. BLAME B B trailed most of the trip and passed tired rivals in the stretch. HEART OF JOY tracked
the pace for the first half mile and tired. MO TOWN BLUES was never a factor.

leaving the turn and making a bid, then finished willingly to be second best. VINDICATO was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the inside and finished
well on the inside. DRUM AND DRUMMER hit the gate coming out at the start, then dueled for the lead on the inside and then weakened the final furlong.
BOURBON BROWN chased the pace three wide and weakened. THANK YA PETE dueled for the lead two wide and weakened. J T'S MY BOY was settled

Footnotes
PALIO tracked the leaders to the far turn from a clear pocket along the fence, angled out turning for home and pulled clear in a convincing drive.
CARRONADE slow early to trail for the first half, rallied into the turn making up ground, split rivals in upper stretch and closed well. WHO'S COUNTING
reserved in mid-pack to the far turn, rallied at the head of the lane while angling to the fence and finished willingly. GUARANTEED SPECK raced in the back
third of the field, dropped back on the turn to trail in upper stretch, was taken around the field in the lane closed late. ROMP stalked the pace while well
positioned to the far turn and lacked a response when called upon drive. ADMIRAL'S WAVE well placed for the first three quarters, rallied in the turn while
caught seven wide and flattened out in the lane. BASSANIO (GB) reserved off the early pace near the rear, called upon into the far turn and lacked a rally.
DIABLO DADDY took command down the lane the first time, continued to prompt the pace down the backstretch and gradually faded coming home.
SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) broke alertly and pressed the early pace, took control down the backstretch opening a clear advantage and stopped at the head of
the lane. ROUTE RUNNER squeezed at the start to be forced to the back, made a middle move down the backside, and gave way into the far turn.
