REDNECKERTHANYOU sped to the lead at the start, set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch then
angled inside and kept clear. JAYSKER tracked the top pair along the inside, had to wait for a clear path around the turn and continued to lack room in
upper stretch, tipped two wide near the furlong marker, launched a bid for the winner but had to settle for second best. AXTON raced in contention in the
opening quarter then launched a three wide bid around the turn, sustained response through the lane and secured a share. WESTONS WILDCAT was
forwardly placed racing behind the leader up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane then gave way in the final
furlong. ALLO ENRY got bumped at the start and raced just off the early pace, swung four to five paths wide entering the lane and lacked a needed rally.
WESTERN TOURIST tracked the pace between foes going by the half mile marker, hustled along two to three wide around the turn then gave way in the
lane.

sustained outside bid through the lane and gained second best. GARBO SPEAKS raced up close then took over the lead near the half mile marker, briefly
led the way then got collared by the winner mid-way around the turn, stayed on three wide into the lane, drifted out wider and secured a share. GAME TO

Footnotes
SPANISH KISS sped to the lead at the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, continued to hold firm over oncoming
pursuers late on the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, drifted out wider, came under right handed pressure, moved back in, came out again late but
remained clear. COUNTY JAIL was forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, stalked the pace up the backstretch, remained in contention along the
inside late on the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, shifted out wider to go outside of drifting out SPANISH KISS, produced a solid bid but had to settle
for second best. EDGY LOVER was well reserved racing in the back through early stages, urged to pick up the pace around the far turn, swung five wide
into the lane, gained a share and cleared the rest. GLOME raced five paths wide heading into the first turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, launched a
three wide bid around the far turn, raced up close at the quarter pole then failed to keep pace and faded in the lane. LETS ROCK N STROLL was forwardly
placed through early stages, moved up two wide to race in striking distance at the quarter pole then came up empty in the lane. TACTICAL REBEL raced in
contention around the first turn, came up empty after the half and steadily retreated.

GOLD TAPPER rated of the pace in early stages, moved up closer along the outside late on the turn, swung five paths wide into the lane, cleared the lead
near the furlong marker and finished going away. MACHO FORTY FIVE sat near midpack in the opening quarter then let out a notch and circled up four
wide at the quarter pole, could not move on with the winner past upper stretch and settled for clearly second best. SANGRIA SKY dueled for the lead with
TAP ON BY and NINETEEN HUNDRED up the backstretch, continued to battle around the turn, could not move on with the top two leaders in upper stretch,
stayed on and prevailed for a share. WILY WADE raced near midpack in early stages, angled in and saved ground around the turn, shifted out in upper
stretch and needed more for late impact. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST was forwardly placed racing just off the embattled pair up the backstretch, hustled along
three wide around the turn then gave way in the lane. TAP ON BY vied inside of SANGRIA SKY up the backstretch, continued to battle around the turn then
tired in the drive. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG was off slow at the start and failed to move into contention. NINETEEN HUNDRED vied for the lead between
rivals up the backstretch then came up empty around the turn.
