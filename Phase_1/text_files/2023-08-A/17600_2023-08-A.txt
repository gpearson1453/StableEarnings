LAUGH A LOT squeezed startf, rallied in hand far turn, cleared off in in the stretch in sharp fashion under confident handling to the wire as much the best. P
K WOOD unhurried to far turn, split horses to run on through traffic in the late stretch for place spot. TIGER PAW (IRE) chased leader to far turn, could not
keep up faded to third in the stretch run. METATRON'S MUSE raced an inside trip to far turn with no late kick when needed in the stretch run.
MOONSTRIKE (GB) sat in good position off rail to far turn, ran between horses stretch and tired. HASTY STRIKE unhurried early with a wide run to far turn
with no late kick in the stretch. FAST FELIX tried to keep inside into first turn, gave way readily thereafter. DIAL HIM UP never threatened throughput.
CROONER speed to the front, led to far turn with nothing left and gave in readily. DESERT HIGHWAY always trailed while far back.
