Footnotes
HINDOSTAIN FALLS dueled outside of a foe, lugged out at the eighth pole, bid late for a short lead and held sway under mild urging. NORTHWIND pressed
the pace in the four path, was steadied at the eighth pole but couldn't close late. BREAKOUT STAR was bumped at the start, stalked the pace inside, then
had no late bid. SMALL SAILOR dueled inside of the winner in the two path, then yielded late. TAKE A DIP saved ground to no avail. GJALLARHORN was
squeezed back at the start, trailed early, then was no factor. SUPER LIAISON and FREAKY FRESH were not factors.

Footnotes
SUNSIGN was allowed to settle behind the field while two wide, then saved ground down the backstretch, circled four wide on the far turn then found the
best stride in the late stretch to surge to the wire and be up just in time. BUCKLE UP tracked the pace in the middle of the pack while four wide, then kicked
it in gear and was gaining ground on the far turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch and held on gamely to the last sixteenth before getting caught at the
wire by SUNSIGN. HITCHPIN settled along the inside throughout the first half and into the turn, then rallied and passed tired rivals in the stretch and was
best for the show prize. PAIGE PERFECT vied early into the first turn, then stalked the pace while three wide under a steady drive, then continued to bid in
close to the leaders on the far turn before giving away in the stretch. LOONY vied for the lead between rivals, then inched away in late backstretch to gain
the lead briefly on the far turn then gave it away to an outer rival in the stretch. MAS ORO battled for the lead from the inside down the backstretch, was in a
hard drive entering the far turn, was used up and gave way before the home stretch. REVS MEDAL was in tight early and shuffled back in the first turn, then
rebid down the backstretch but was to no success in the end.

MR CHAOS chased in close behind the vying leaders down the backstretch while three wide, then slowly crept up along the inside on the turn to battle with
NEW YEAR'S FEVER down the stretch and was up at the wire to prove best. NEW YEAR'S FEVER vied for the lead while two wide down the early
furlongs, then continued to menace on the turn with inner rivals, cleared one rival then dueled grudgingly down the lane with MR.CHAOS and hung in the
end. MOWINS was rated while chasing the pace while four wide down the backstretch, then came out to the five path to close belatedly in the stretch and
be up for the show prize. MANUELITO was brushed at the start, then raced at a moderate pace from the inside into the turn, came out three wide and
bumped rival at the top of the stretch then continued to bid gamely down the lane just missing the show prize in the end. CIBOLO was in a steady drive
along the inside throughout the first three quarters then rallied in the stretch and needed more in the end. A FEW TOO MANY settled behind the field down
the backstretch and throughout the turn then bid in the stretch and was no threat. WILL TAKE CASH vied for the lead early while three deep then dropped
back along the inside throughout the turn, came out four wide at the top stretch, was bumped by an inner foe then flattened out. PATTON'S WAR was
brushed at the start then vied for the lead from the inside and with outer foes down the backstretch and into the turn, was extinguished in the early stretch
and weakened in the end. PER RULING FROM HIWU, MOWINS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

JOYFUL APPLAUSE was clear early inside and drew off, before jumping over an object at the sixteenth pole, then won under a strong hand ride. STAR
WISHER was rank into the first turn, saved ground, angled three wide in the stretch, rallied, jumped over an object past the sixteenth pole and was no threat
to the winner. TALL GIRL saved ground, angled three wide, then gained the show late. HARVEY'S PRINCESS was steadied into the first turn, then had a
mild late bid outside. SANDRA D pressed the pace outside of the winner before giving way in the stretch. MIZZTIFY DOLL was unrushed, then had her best
stride late outside. BLAME NELLIE pressed the early pace in the five path before giving way after a half. CHELSEA'S STRENGTH bore out into the first
turn, then faded. LILLY LANE clipped heels going into the first turn. The Stewards declined to take action following an inquiry into the first turn.

Footnotes
INDY BIZ moved up the backstretch to race in the middle of the field while four wide, then menaced on far turn to battle for the lead in the early stretch,
kicked clear of those rivals in the final furlong and was up at the wire to prevail. TAKECHARGEJUSTICE raced with the back group while two wide down the
backstretch, then dug in gamely on the far turn to rally in the stretch and closed belatedly and was up for second place. PABLO'S SUN chased the pace
while two wide in the early furlongs, was steadily urging on the far turn then found more in the stretch to close gamely for the show prize just missing second
place. BRENTSPENCE raced along the inside with rivals at the back of the field, then rallied on the far turn while two wide to close well in the stretch but it
was not enough. COG set the pace into the first turn to lead the way down the backstretch, then was met with contention from outer foes on the far turn,
continued to menace gamely but could not keep the lead and faltered in the stretch. DO YA WANNA DANCE chased the pace along the inside down the
backstretch, was in a strong drive throughout the turn and into the stretch but needed more in the end. EVEN MONEY was unhurried early, then made a mid
on the inside throughout the far bend and was no threat. MISTER MACHO stalked the pace while two wide, was in a long drive heading into the far turn,
then vied between rivals, emerged as leader for a brief second, was used up then tired in the late stretch. ALMIGHTYJUSTICE raced toward the back of the
pack while four wide, then made a mild bid on the far turn and was no menace. GOODTIMEJUSTICE settled along the inside throughout and failed to rally.

Footnotes
ITZFOREVER was well rated while two wide on the backstretch, was urging on the far turn and into the stretch, then cruised passed the tiring rivals at the
eighth marker then continued to draw away to win in the end. AMAZINGNESS moved up along the inside on the first turn, then was reserved on the inside
down the backstretch and into the far turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch then closed grudgingly to be up for the place prize. UNBRIDLED TALENT
prompted the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then gained command leaving the far turn but could not retain bid in the stretch and gave way in
the end missing the place prize. TIZZY JOJO set the pace into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn then faltered in the
stretch. CLEVER KATE trailed behind the field throughout the first half of the course then bid three wide on the far turn and into the stretch and was no
threat. LIEUTENANT KITTY settled in the two path and failed to rally. PASSIONFORJUSTICE pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, then
was thru after the far turn and had no final bid in the stretch.
