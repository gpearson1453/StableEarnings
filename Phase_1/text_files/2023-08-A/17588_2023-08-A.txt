TEXAS LEGACY away well and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering
the final turn, and finished determinedly four wide in the drive to prove best. LILSISTERLEE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, maintained her advantage into the stretch, but was no match for TEXAS LEGACY in the
lane, but battled gamely to preserve the place. SHE'S ON FIRE tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched
her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to just miss the place. BETTER WITH TIME broke sharply and tracked the leader in
the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. SWEET AS
HONEY was bumped solidly at the start and forced to take up, raced into a stalking trip while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering

MAJESTIC STREET away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the leader two wide entering the
final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was all out to fend out a late surge from ROAD CLOSURE late. ROAD CLOSURE unhurried early while
trailing the field into the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished full of run while being carried five wide in deep stretch to
just miss. MONTE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, battled
through the final turn from the inside of MAJESTIC STREET, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and was outfinished late.
KLIMTOGLORY away well and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued
to save ground entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. DYNAMITER settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in
the run down the backside, raced two wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
MAGIC ROAD tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, overtook the leader while racing two wide into the final turn, and
held BARBERRY BANDIT safely at bay late to prove best. BARBERRY BANDIT broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly while drifting four wide in deep stretch while gaining late. SOMTHING ELUSIVE
away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, and finished determinedly while being carried out five wide in deep stretch. PETERSON LANDING away well and stalked the early pace while racing
two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. HE'S GOLDEN
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
and finished two out from the rail in the drive. MAX BOOSTER rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace into the
backstretch, was overtaken entering the final turn, and faded in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ANOTHERSUNNYDAY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch,
rallied from just off the rail while holding a narrow advantage into the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, but battled determinedly one out from the
rail in the drive to reclaim the lead in the final strides. RICHARDS COMMAND settled mid pack while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
advanced from along the rail midway down the backside to take up the chase entering the final turn, overtook the pacesetter from along the rail entering the
lane, but wasn't able to fend off the determined pacesetter who battled back to reclaim the lead in the final strides. LIZZIES GIRL away alertly and tracked
the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly three out from the rail in the drive to
garner a share. WALKINTHEWALK settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, commenced his bid from along
the rail entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. BAKZONE settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact in the drive. BAKFIRE BABY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied two wide into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. STORM CRUISER trailed the field throughout, and was never a
factor.

CALAMAZEUS broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two wide entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. RING OF KERRY away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of
YOU DON'T OWN ME entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the
lane, but was unable to fend off CALAMAZEUS in the final strides. YOU DON'T OWN ME away alertly and vied for the lead while in tight quarters at the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival
leaving the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. PADDY D'ORO stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact in an even effort. ANOTHER GUINNESS tracked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, began to drop back midway to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
