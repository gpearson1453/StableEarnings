handed crop to remain clear. FILLMORE EAST was settled early two wide, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, then finished well to be clearly second
best. GIRL'S ON FIRE was well placed early on the inside, made a three wide move on the turn but flattened out, bested rest. SASSY MARTINI was

two wide bid on the turn but weakened. BONITA LASSIE pressed the pace two wide and weakened. KENTUCKY PRIDE was reserved three wide and failed

MS. BUCCHERO set a pressured pace on the inside, drew clear on the turn and then widened the margin in the drive to prove much the best while being
kept to mild pressure. FLASHING DIAMOND pressed the winner two wide early, then chased the rival on the turn and ran on the hold the place award.
KILIMANJARA was settled early three wide, advanced on the turn and dropped to the inside by the quarter pole, but lacked the needed stretch bid while
besting the rest. CARTOUCHE prompted the pace between rivals and three wide, then weakened. R FUNNY BIZNESS prompted the pace on the outside
and was four wide on the turn and weakened. TAPIT'S GIRL was settled on the inside and was two wide on the turn, angled out in the drive and had no
rally. STAND BY YOU was settled back, three wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and was not a threat.

OVER AND THUNDER set the pace along the inside, then was headed off the turn while three wide into the lane, then came again in the final furlong to
draw clear to prove best, driving. AMUSING MISCHIEF stalked the pace two wide, made a three to four wide bid off the turn to go on even terms for the
lead, gained a short advantage by the furlong marker but flattened out, held place award. JUMP FOR THE WIN was allowed to settle early, advanced four
wide by the quarter pole and then was slowly gaining late to just miss the place award. MITROPANOS chased the pace three wide, then dropped to the
inside in the lane and had n o kick and needed more. MACHO HONCHO chased the pace on the inside and tired. UPSTATE AND BACK was reserved
early and lacked a rally. CIRCLE ME MADDEN was off a step slow and showed no speed despite being motivated by the rider, trailed.

VAIL OF HONOR was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and closed full of run to win going away late. SAL N
LOUIE was rated early, made a four wide move on the turn and was clear off the turn but proved to be no match for the winner late, second best. ALTA FOX
prompted the pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, but weakened in the drive, held show award. CATTY'S UNCLE set the
pace on the inside and weakened. LUCKY RUNNING CAT tracked the pace three wide and tired. OMERTA CODE was void of early speed and never
factored. PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH chased the pace on the inside and then tired on the turn and fell, vanned off.

MILLBANK MAN was away alertly, rated off the front runners, made a three wide move leaving the quarter pole, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to
prove best while being ridden out. BANJO set a pressured pace on the inside, made a two wide bid to draw clear on the turn, then was headed by the
furlong marker and proved to be no match for the winner, second best. BULLET BREEZE was reserved early on the inside, advanced thr ee wide on the
turn, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to best the rest. SYLVIA I AM was bumped at the start, settled four wide, advanced on the turn and
came five wide into the lane and had no rally. TYRANT REGIME chased the early pace and saved ground on the turn and weakened. ICY COLD pressed
the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SANTO set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the nine sixteenths marker, then drew out leaving the turn and remained clear to the wire to
prove best, driving. MERCURY TEN pressed the winner two wide and ran on willingly to be second best. MR BOLDACIOUS was rated early, advanced on
the inside nearing the quarter pole, but had no late kick. SWEEPIN HARD chased the pace two wide early, three wide on the turn and weakened.
TUCKERTON BAY was off very slowly, moved up four wide and tired. SUPER REIGN was four wide into the first turn and was through early.
