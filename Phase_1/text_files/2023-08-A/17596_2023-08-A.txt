Footnotes
DINOS DIXIE was sent leaving the start and showed speed while dictating terms in the early going, drew to a clear lead while well handled along the turn,
was kept to task while in hand to mid-stretch and pulled away in the final sixteenth while under mild late urging. JAIME'S COMMITMENT lacked early speed
while a bit green in the early stages, saved ground along the turn, closed well in the stretch run, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but continued
his late gain and was up in the final strides to secure the place. WEE BEASTIE chased the decent pace from the inside, tipped two wide for the drive and
made a mild gain at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished for the place in the final strides, while
holding clearly in the end for the show. BOBBED N LURED broke in the air and was off slowly, chased outside of rivals into the turn, was coaxed along four
wide into the stretch and did not threaten. NICKEY BIRD was prominent in the early stages and stalked the decent pace into the turn, lost position while two
wide along the bend, was coaxed along three wide into the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
DICK BEST was sent to establish a forward position in the early running, pressed the solid pace into the turn then dueled with LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH
along the bend while setting solid fractions to the quarter marker, continued to duel with LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH into the drive, took a narrow lead into the
final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch to prevail. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH was hustled to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace into the
turn, dueled along the bend with DICK BEST while carving solid fractions, continued that battle into the lane, grudgingly gave way in the final furlong and
just held for the place. MIGHTY MATT stalked the solid early pace, gained ground while two wide along the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the
stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, was outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for the place, while clear of the rest for the show. SASQUATCH RIDE
was allowed to settle, raced two wide into the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and could not muster a final
response. FULLY LOADED chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost position on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SAREEHA (IRE) assumed command at the start and dictated terms into the first turn, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run,
drew to a clear lead along the far turn, was given a reminder tap in upper stretch and drew off approaching the furlong pole, was kept to task to the final
sixteenth and was geared down in the late stages as much the best at the finish. TIZ MY PRINCESS was crowded at the start and was away a bit slowly,
settled along the rail into the first turn then was coaxed along two wide into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile marker, gave
chase while two wide along the far turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive but stayed on to best the rest and galloped out nicely past the wire.
PRESTIGIOUS settled in mid-pack while saving ground in the early running, saved all of the ground to the far turn, could not impact the top two in the
stretch run but stayed on in the final stages and outfinished SOUTHERN BLESSING to secure the show. SOUTHERN BLESSING broke in a bit at the start
and crowded TIZ MY PRINCESS leaving the break, was prominent into the first turn and attended to the moderate pace into the backstretch run, lost ground
heading to the far turn, could not keep pace with SAREEHA in upper stretch, gave way in the final stages and was outfinished for the show. JACQUELINE
COCHRAN settled three wide into the first turn, travelled inside of an outer rival through the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn
and did not offer a late response in the stretch. VALENTINE CRASHER paused at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early stages and
settled outside of rivals into the first turn, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch run and came three wide into the far turn, slipped to the rail in
upper stretch and did not threaten in the drive. I'M GONNA SHINE crowded a neighboring rival at the start, was forwardly placed into the first turn and
stalked the moderate pace while three wide into the backstretch run, lost position along the far turn, chased to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.
FRESNO CHILE was crowded leaving the start by a neighboring rival and was off a bit slowly, recovered to stalk the early pace while widest into the first
turn, maintained a four wide trip through the backstretch run while chasing the pacesetter, continued to race widest while into the far turn, lost position into
the drive and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
LISA'S VALENTINE broke alertly and showed good early speed leaving the start, contested the decent pace into the turn, dueled with MALASADA along
the bend while inside of that rival, was confronted by VALERIE in upper stretch and held a narrow lead over that rival to the furlong marker, shook free into
deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages in a good debut. VALERIE was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the decent pace while
outside of rivals, maintained a three wide path to the quarter marker, was roused into the lane and confronted LISA'S VALENTINE in upper stretch, battled
with that foe to the furlong marker, could not match strides heading to the final sixteenth and just held for the place at the finish. PLEASANT WARNING
chased the decent early pace from mid-pack, ran in pursuit while two wide along the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, raced evenly to the
furlong marker, lacked a final response in deep stretch but ran on and just missed for the place, while just holding for the show. BLAZIN BAE away slowly
from the gate, chased outside of rivals in the early going, came three wide to the quarter marker and was asked for run four wide into the stretch, made a
mild gain at the furlong marker, was gaining in deep stretch and just missed for the minor awards. ALL HALLOWS was bumped by an outer rival at the start
and was off slowly, lacked early speed and trailed into the turn, improved position while two wide along the bend then was coaxed along three wide into the
stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker and improved position in the final sixteenth. HAUGHTY KITTY chased from towards the rear in the early
running, was steered two wide into the turn and dropped back along the bend, raced three wide into the stretch drive, was able to offer a mild late rally but
did not threaten. ROUSING STAR chased the decent early pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker and gave way in
the late stages. MOHAYHAYTHEBOLD chased the decent pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch. MALASADA was prominent in the early
running and disputed the decent pace with LISA'S VALENTINE, raced on even terms with that rival into the turn, pressed the pace while between rivals
nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the drive and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
STRETCH RUN was prominent in the early running and disputed the pace with DAD BOD into the turn, shook free along the bend and led into upper
stretch, bumped and made contact with REFI NOW at the three-sixteenths marker, held a safe lead to the furlong pole, kept to task under steady late urging
and prevailed in a drive at the finish. REFI NOW settled off of the early pace, chased from the second flight while between runners heading to the turn,
saved ground along the bend and advanced to come within aim nearing the top of the stretch, bumped with STRETCH RUN in upper stretch, chased to the
furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and was clear of the rest for the place. TEAGANS ATM chased from the second flight while
between runners early on, exchanged bumps with AMANOFMYSTATURE nearing the turn and gave chase while outside of an inner rival along the bend,
ran evenly to the furlong grounds, lacked the needed response in deep stretch but kept on and won the nod for the show on the wire. EXTRA INNINGS
chased the quick early pace from the inside, gained a bit of ground along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster a late response in deep
stretch and just missed for the show. AMANOFMYSTATURE chased the fast early pace while between rivals, checked while in tight quarters approaching
the turn and trailed into the bend, saved ground to to the quarter marker, was steered four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the late going.
DAD BOD broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a contested pace into the turn, lost position and chased STRETCH RUN to the quarter marker,
ran in pursuit to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. NAZARE chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, lost position while three wide nearing
the quarter marker, was coaxed along five wide into the stretch and gave way. THE RIDER OF REFI NOW LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE
RIDER OF STRETCH RUN, AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE OBJECTION WOULD BE DISALLOWED. PER
RULING FROM HIWU, STRETCH RUN WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

stretch, felt late pressure from HOMER WELLS and held off the runner-up in the final strides to prevail. HOMER WELLS broke in at the start and bothered a
neighboring rival, was forwardly placed in the early running and tracked the leaders into the turn, gave chase while two wide along the bend, angled four
wide into the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, pressured the winner in the final stages but could not get by

wide along the turn, came under a ride nearing the top of the lane and lost ground to AUTSIM PUZZLE into upper stretch, chased to the furlong pole,
weakened in deep stretch and held safely in the end for the show. RIGHT HAND RYDER broke in at the start and was away slowly, chased the solid early

furlong pole, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and passed a tiring rival in the final stages. M K BIRTHDAY chased the solid early pace from the
inside, stalked the top pair while saving ground to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground heading to mid-stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. SIR

Footnotes
CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN broke inward after the break and veered in front of DO IT FOR DAVE, then got a good position on the inside and settled near the
head of the tracking pack, started a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole but had to steady briefly in traffic, gathered up and angled to the two path for clear
run, responded to vigorous handling down the stretch and got up just in time. ZOOKEEPER broke well, and went straight to the lead without much
prompting, opened up on the field setting reasonable fractions to the stretch, repelled a bid by CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS at the top of the stretch then was
challenged by CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN to the outside, held well but was outfinished in the shadow of the wire in a solid effort. LOVE OF THE SPORT was
not asked for speed in the early going, stayed to the inside but behind the tracking pack, got a clean run to the top of the stretch, tipped out to the three path
and ran on well down the stretch to gain the third spot. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS got away well and raced close up in the two path through the first turn,
tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, attempted to go after the leader under heavy pressure from the quarter pole but flattened in the stretch and was
passed for a minor award. MUCHO MACHISMO came a way from the gate looking for forward position, allowed ZOOKEEPER to establish the early pace
and tracked close behind, remained in contention to the far turn then was unable to keep up when the pace quickened from the quarter pole and chased the
leaders to the wire. DO IT FOR DAVE broke a step slow and then had to steady as CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN took his path after the break, hurdled some
rough patches in the grass passing the finish for the first time, launched a tepid rally from the half-mile marker and stayed to the inside, improved position
somewhat but was not making an impression in the late stages. RULER OF ANGELS was taken in hand from the break, settled near the rear of the pack
through the early stages while racing in the two to three path, was last going into the far turn but started to rally while wide, turned into the stretch five wide
then finished up evenly, unable to make an impact. PORT O' CALL a little slow into stride then got hung four wide on the first turn, made some forward
progress under handling down the backstretch, held position while racing wide on the far turn then ran out of steam at the top of the stretch and had little to
offer from that point. COOPERKLIMT was a little keen and raced three wide into the first turn, became boxed in for the whole of the backstretch run, was
unable to quicken with the pace of the race in the far turn and finished up one-paced at the tail of the field.
