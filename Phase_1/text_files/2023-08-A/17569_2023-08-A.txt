raced at even terms from that point, contested the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to inch clear nearing mid-stretch. S S SPARTAN ENERGY
rated just off the pace about the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms two deep on the turn, but dropped back
approaching mid-stretch and had to settle for second. GET OFF MY CLOUD rated close inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn then dug in and took the nod for third under the wire. IN JUBALATION saved ground on
the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range in the three path on the far turn but drifted
toward the head of the lane, left the turn outside and flattened late yards. AIR MEDAL raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the stretch. SIENTE EL AMOR came away awkwardly and made contact
with Blue N Gold, raced with the early pace inside, was met toward the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase into the backstretch, but faded leaving the five

Footnotes
ROCKY DICE rated close inside, bid into the backstretch and took the nod two deep midway on the far turn, then dug in determinedly to just last. SULEMAN
saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take second in the
final yards and just missed. STRONG HEART rated close to the early pace about the four path, closed to the front approaching the three quarter pole and
rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch.
ADARA broke traction at the start then saved some early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran
evenly in the stretch. STAVANGER rated off the rail early, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and
showed little in the lane. ANVIL rated a slim early lead, was met nearing the three quarter pole and gave chase into the backstretch, but faded past the three
eighths pole. RIGHTEOUS MAN raced in the five path the first turn, was well off the pace into the second turn and showed little response. POWER (BRZ)
was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOXY SISTA raced well off the pace inside, crept closer leaving the half mile pole and took over toward the quarter, drew off through the far turn and
appeared much the best. FRENCHIES GOLD rounded the opening turn about the five path then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
improved steadily, raced at the rail on the far turn but was no match in the lane. LAUGHINTOTHEBANK rounded the first turn in the four path, bid past the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and got up for third nearing mid-stretch. MISS LAUREN raced well back inside, picked up the
chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. REVEIRS MINUTE took over soon after the start and
drew off to a long early lead, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, was met toward the quarter pole and faded at the rail on the far turn.
UNUSUALLY LUCKY dwelt at the start. CASTLE OF CAYLEE raced well off the pace and off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded on
the far turn.

Footnotes
COASTAL MISSION moved to the inside and rated a slim lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, edged clear toward the quarter, raced
at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. CLASSIER ducked out and exchanged contact with SOCIAL CHIC then rated close
inside, started his bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, was eased off the rail midway on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second. The latter
exchanged contact with Classier leaving the gate then saved ground, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, but
was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NO CHANGE saved ground well off the early pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. OUTLIER stalked two deep, challenged leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back toward
the quarter and weakened approaching the head of the lane. DONTMESAWITHME stalked the earlier pace three wide, gave chase toward the three eighths
pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. EASTERN BAY settled off the rail on the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn.

COMIDA COMIDA gave chase inside and took the lead leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and held well under steady stretch
handling. TAKE CHARGE LISA chased and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in through the stretch, flattened late but held on for second. GREAT
DEVOTION chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out past the eighth pole and was gaining on the waning runner-up. WICKED
WISDOM chased the leaders through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. AMERICAS WOMAN gave
chase, raced in the three and four paths on the turn, left the turn outside and passed some rivals. MIDNIGHT PASS gave chase, rounded the turn about the
five path and weakened in the lane. QUEEN OF KANTHAROS came away sharply with the early lead but was met leaving the three eighths pole and faded
toward the head of the lane.
