TROUBLE MAKING no speed to the turn with a late rush to edge clear late. MORNIN' BOSS went up to duel leader to the turn, edged clear stretch run
down. HARTFUL HOPE saved ground to the stretch, roused on to close the gap late. ONE MORE NIGHT awkward start from gate, eventful trip to stretch
finished well. MY HEAD HURTS raced along evenly from outside with no late kick when needed. FAST TRANSIT close up to turn with tough navigating in
stretch and took a, bad step while changing leads at the eighth pole with no late gain. MOTOWN MISCHIEF speed to the front, battled to the quarter pole,
gave in readily.
