Footnotes
MISSION BEACH sped to the early lead then ceded to NEXT LEVEL past the five eighths, prompted three wide outside that rival into and around the turn,
was put to right handed asks soon into the lane, dueled past mid stretch, wrested command a sixteenth out then edged clear late while kept alert. NEXT
LEVEL rushed up to the inside of MISSION BEACH and took command heading to the four and half furlong marker, set a pressured pace in the two path,
drifted in towards the rail while racing on his left lead past the three sixteenths, held a tenuous advantage battling past the furlong grounds, switched over to
his correct lead in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. STAY HOT rated forwardly behind the top two past the five eighths, dropped in nearing the turn
and stalked, came out three wide for room into the stretch and brushed with DAGGER RANCH, corrected to chase to the inside of that one, was bumped
nearing the sixteenth pole, continued with some contact with DAGGER RANCH heading to the wire and kept on with interest. DAGGER RANCH stalked
three wide, shifted four wide with pursuit and was brushed soon into the lane, came in after right handed asking and bumped with STAY HOT approaching
the sixteenth marker, kept on with some brushing through the final seventy yards and hung a bit late. BIGREDSANDRIBEYES ducked in nearing the end of
the chute and steadied sharply, was taken wide early then angled down towards the rail, gained to the inside of a rival when hustled along nearing the lane,
chased to mid stretch then flattened out. AMBIGUOUS drifted out a bit at the break and bumped with OCALA KID, corrected to chase two wide and faded.
OCALA KID broke inward and bumped with AMBIGUOUS, gave early pursuit three wide outside a rival, circled four wide into the land and weakened. There
was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run of STAY HOT and DAGGER RANCH. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
TEEN DRAMA drafted back off the leaders after an alert start, rated kindly outside a rival, crept closer approaching the stretch, swung out to be about five
wide nearing mid stretch, responded to right handed encouragement, closed sharply to take over in deep stretch then drew clear. DANCING SOUL
accelerated to the inside of rivals soon after the start and moved out to a clear lead, set the pace off the inside, drifted out under left handed urging inside
the furlong grounds, was corrected inside the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. GYPSY LYNN stalked the leader three wide, was pushed along
chasing in upper stretch, could not kick on with the leaders past mid stretch but kept on with effort to hold down the show. RAKASSAH (IRE) , a bit rank at
the break, edged up between runners early and gained a forward position, dropped in to pursue around the turn, gained towards the rail past the three
sixteenths then lacked a serious final response. KEYCHAIN GIRL bobbled at the start, saved ground around the turn, eased out in the drive and churned
on. CANAM GAL drifted out a bit at the break, was taken to rate soon after, came under pressure around the turn, shifted out in the drive and had a mild
gain. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) broke a step slow, raced well back while outside a foe mid turn, worked outward in the lane and closed belatedly. BELLA D
saved ground off the pace, eased out in the drive but failed to menace.

Footnotes
JENSCO broke a step slow, regrouped and advanced under a firm hold while saving ground near the half mile marker, awaited room into the turn, slipped
through to challenge the leaders soon after, poked a head in front mid turn, spurted clear approaching the stretch, responded when roused and guided off
the inside then held firm while steadily hand ridden the final furlong. POETICA , in close attendance four wide outside rivals, came under a ride past the five
sixteenths, drifted in briefly with pursuit soon into the lane, corrected and continued gamely while well clear of the rest. ANACARO , taken to rate early,
edged up between foes near the half, secured the inside around the turn, chased into the lane but came up empty in the final furlong. COLETTE'S JOY
drifted out at the break, straightened and moved up four wide to be in range after a quarter mile, circled four wide into the stretch and offered a mild
response. BETTY'S SONG took over early and set a pressured pace two wide, battled between foes leaving the three eighths, was under pressure to keep
pace into the lane, failed to kick on and faded. DUCHESSOFBAYRIDGE broke on top despite a stumble, disputed the pace three wide outside BETTY'S
SONG, came under a ride vying three deep mid turn, could not keep up soon after and gave way.

Footnotes
YUKI (CHI) sped to the early lead and secured the inside, was headed near the three quarter pole, stayed on under patient handling to attend the pace,
reclaimed the lead near the five sixteenths, moved clear soon after, wandered outward under a drive and on her left lead passing the furlong grounds, dug in
when confronted from her outside by PRACTICA CAT (CHI), switched over to her correct lead late and proved resolute to the wire. PRACTICA CAT (CHI)
saved ground early then angled out three wide near the five eighths, took closer order under asking past the quarter pole, drifted out briefly soon into the
lane, ranged up boldly to engage the winner in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH , off the pace while saving ground,
worked outward near mid stretch and finished with good energy. JUSTIQUE settled off the pace, gained between runners leaving the far turn, angled four
wide into the lane, moved up past the sixteenth marker, shifted in some and was out kicked. KRISTI'S TIGER had a shoe repair in the paddock, stalked the
dueling leaders, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths, shifted in for the drive but lacked the needed finish. LUCKY FOR YOU moved up three wide to
take over from YUKI(CHI) with six furlongs remaining, maintained a slim advantage dueling past the three eighths, ceded soon after, stayed willingly past
mid stretch then faded very late. ANGEL NADESHIKO lost ground four to five wide and failed to respond in the drive. DOINITTHEHARDWAY broke
outward, raced four wide into the first turn, remained well wide trying to advance under pressure leaving the far turn, failed to go on entering the lane,
dropped back and was was eased late.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S LAST had speed to the inside then rated back off the leader nearing the first turn, appeared to want to get out a bit near the three quarter pole but
was taken firmly in hand to hold position, remained under a strong hold into the far turn, rolled up three wide into the lane, forged to command with a furlong
to go, kicked clear under some right handed asks then was merely shown the whip in the final seventy yards. CHROME TO RICHES saved ground under
early rating, edged up into the far turn, eased out advancing with the winner approaching the stretch, shifted back in near mid stretch and finished gamely to
just nab the place. MAXVILLE broke a step slow, settled off the pace and off the inside, advanced three wide outside foes nearing the quarter pole and
continued with good energy to gain. INFINITEEXPERIENCE saved ground, awaited room leaving the three eighths, eased out to move between runners
nearing the lane, altered out and kept on willingly. JOHNNY PAYCHECK sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, drifted out in upper stretch and
weakened. AVIATOR NATION step slow, saved ground, was pushed along chasing into the lane but lacked a solid bid. CENTRE CIRCLE , between
runners leaving the far turn, angled out but came up empty. SURE PROSPECT failed to menace. DEFENSOR FORTIS broke in the air, shied from the rail
nearing the first turn and failed to make an impact. SEATTLE SURF, three wide early, stalked the pace two wide into the far turn, failed to kick on entering
the lane and faltered

Footnotes
LA PALOMA BLANCA rated kindly two to three wide stalking the leader, cruised up to take closer order past the five sixteenths, bold bid four wide in upper
stretch, forged to command nearing the eighth pole and eagerly widened under a drive. QUEEN P , bumped at the break, sped clear early and set the pace
towards the rail, drifted out soon into the stretch, failed to contain the winner's bid, faded through the final sixteenth but managed to save the place.
COPPER BO TEN , bumped at the break, raced forwardly early on while saving ground, saw the leaders get away around the turn, stayed inside for the
drive and had a mild late response. MIMSY drifted out at the break to lose a step, corrected and raced off the inside, advanced between runners past the
quarter pole but failed to seriously sustain. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ lagged back, raced two wide into the lane and failed to menace. PRETTY RENA edged
up outside foes nearing the half to stalk the pace, wandered outward a bit leaving the far turn and gave way. EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE stumbled inward at the
break and bumped with a rival, saved ground and lacked a response.

Footnotes
SAWASDEE was nudged up between foes to take command near the half, went clear approaching the turn, set a rated pace two wide around the turn,
spurted away when asked in upper stretch, was kept alert with left handed rousing past mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden through the final seventy
yards. GEEZER , in the clear early on chasing the pace, raced three wide into the lane, shifted in near mid stretch and finished with good energy to earn the
place. GYPSY TEARS , in mid pack saving ground, was under urging mid turn, angled four wide for the drive and rallied. BILLY'S BET prompted the pace
while saving ground, raced in closest pursuit around the turn, came out soon into the lane, switched over to his left lead and faded. HIJO GALANTE ,
bumped at the break, saved ground off the pace, came out for the drive, advanced past mid stretch then flattened out. MEESH drifted in at the break,
corrected and raced off the pace while three deep, came five wide into the lane, altered out wider past mid stretch and churned on. ROY HOBBS , in a bit
tight at the break, saved ground while well back leaving the far turn, worked outward in the lane but failed to make an impact with belated action. I'M DR. O ,
bumped at the start, raced between runners past the three eighths and failed to menace. LET'S ACCLIMATE had speed outside rivals, drifted out to about
the five path mid turn and gave way. MY MAN BAGS , three wide mid turn, faded.

Footnotes
GOT THUNDER broke a bit slow then was gunned up five wide outside rivals, moved clear nearing the seven eighths and dropped in, rated kindly off the
rail through the backstretch run, moved away past the five sixteenths, responded to some right handed asks near mid stretch then powered away while
hand ridden the final sixteenth. KEEN TO GO dropped in nearing the seven eighths and was taken in hand, angled back out soon into the backstretch,
moved up in hand approaching the far turn, continued progress four wide past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from there, flattened out in the final
sixteenth but had enough left to remain clear for the place. CARPE BELLUM came off the rail nearing the first turn and bumped with SIPPIN N KISSIN,
guided back in to stalk, dropped back some under a ride leaving the far turn, came off the rail nearing the lane, moved between runners mid stretch, altered
out late and finished with interest. SIPPIN N KISSIN , away in good order, was bumped near the seven furlong marker, stalked four then three wide, was
under heavy pressure to the inside of rival past the quarter pole and faded. KO SAMUI (IRE) , brushed at the break, raced five wide past the half and failed
to generate a rally. TAKE CHARGE CURLY broke inward brushing a foe, raced four wide into the first turn, remained wide for the backstretch run and came
up empty. HULK had speed to the inside of the winner, stalked three wide to the far turn, dropped in, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and gave way.
DE LA LUNA steadied off the heels of KEEN TO GO approaching the first turn, swung wide for the drive and tired.

Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN , taken to rate off the pace and outside a rival, steadied lacking some room near the five sixteenths, worked through a seam soon after
then altered out four wide for a clear run, closed sharply under right handed encouragement, reeled in the leader with a sixteenth to go then was edging
away with good energy at the wire. KINGS RIVER KNIGHT rated forwardly, saved ground into the far turn, came out advancing past the quarter pole,
moved up to take command inside the three sixteenths, briefly cleared under a drive past mid stretch, dug in when confronted a sixteenth out and finished
gamely. NONE ABOVE THE LAW settled off the early pace while saving ground, angled out past the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane,
straightened away to advance in mid stretch, switched over to his left lead and continued on with interest. ROYAL 'N RANDO , off the early pace two wide,
raced between foes nearing the five sixteenths, swung five to six wide in upper stretch and churned on. JIMMY BLUE JEANS cleared into the first turn, set
the pace towards the inside, was collared in upper stretch, ceded command soon after then weakened through the final seventy yards. BALLY'S CHARM
stalked the pace three wide, was pushed along nearing the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded. INDIAN PEAK was guided towards the rail soon
after the break and settled, awaited room near the quarter pole, came out for the drive and lacked a solid run. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK , off the pace, raced
wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace. LARRY'S LEGEND , taken to rate early, raced four wide chasing past the five eighths, failed to kick on past
the five sixteenths and weakened. HACKING IT UP , well placed inside, gave way through the lane.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR moved up between runners early then shadowed the leader three wide through the backstretch run, was put to a solid ride pursuing past
the five sixteenths, closed in under repeated left handed asks, took over from ELM DRIVE near the sixteenth marker, edged clear late and held sway.
DESERT DAWN drafted back off the early pace while removed from the inside, took closer order into the far turn, split rivals approaching the stretch,
straightened to be about four wide and closed steadily to bridge the gap. ELM DRIVE briefly lost her footing after breaking outward and brushing FUN TO
DREAM, corrected and cleared, set the pace off the rail, came under coaxing leaving the three eighths, grimly maintained the advantage under a drive past
the furlong grounds, ceded the lead a sixteenth out and faded very late. KIRSTENBOSCH , fractious in the gate, broke a bit slow, recovered and moved up
wide to contention, stalked four wide through the backstretch run, came under pressure past the three eighths and failed to seriously kick on. FUN TO
DREAM bobbled at the break then was brushed soon after, regrouped and stalked the pace while saving ground, gained into the far turn, was under
pressure chasing past the five sixteenths, failed to go on in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
IRISH PATSY , between rivals early, gained off the inside then between runners into the stretch, altered out five wide leaving the three sixteenths, closed
strongly outside rivals and under right handed asks, took over with about seventy yards remaining and eagerly kicked away. IN YOUR FACE , under a snug
hold towards the inside and within range of the leader, sat patiently past the three eighths, was guided four wide and put to asking into the lane, drifted out a
bit when challenging outside foes leaving mid stretch, drifted in slightly dueling on near even terms between runners a sixteenth out, corrected and kept on
gamely. PRECOCIOUS TIMES bobbled inward and brushed with a rival at the start, rated off the pace while saving ground, angled out advancing into the
stretch, moved up behind rivals then had to steady and wait leaving mid stretch, shifted in soon after in search of a seam, checked lacking room leaving the
sixteenth pole, recovered and finished strong. TIERGARTEN stalked three wide outside a foe, took closer order into the lane, bid between foes past the
furlong grounds, dueled then was out finished. TICKLE MY FANCY cleared early and set the pace two wide, held the advantage to mid stretch, was taken
on by multiple foes to her outside soon after and weakened late. DE JORIA , off the pace, angled five wide for the drive and had a belated response.
NORAH'S PRINCESS saved ground while not far back, gained along the rail in upper stretch then lacked some room inside the sixteenth pole. R SWIRVIN
GIRVIN , brushed at the break, raced three wide chasing past the five sixteenths and gave way. PICTURE OF A LADY broke outward, corrected and pulled
her way forward to stalk the leader, was urged along to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths, failed to go on in mid stretch and weakened. PRECIOUS
