Footnotes
MAYHEMINTHEPALACE set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear under a drive. SANPIRODU tracked the pace in
the two path, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole, shied from the whip repeatedly in the stretch and finished well under a hand ride late. NO PROBLEM
JOE stalked the pace from the rail, could not reel in the winner but stayed on to save the show. FLIGHT CATCHER raced in range four wide and was
one-paced through the lane. AWESOME FOR SURE was sluggish at the start, trailed inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and improved position
in the stretch. FIRST COAST STORM stalked the pace three wide and faded in the drive. VENEZUELAN FEELING was outrun inside. IT'S A HOT ONE
played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SHES A GIFT stalked inside, was stymied along the rail rounding the turn, got through inside as the leader floated out into the stretch, and quickly kicked
clear under a drive. LIL ANNIE ROSE bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated inside and was coaxed into the turn, fanned out to the eight path turning
into the lane, and chased on for place. KATZ THAT GAL got bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was roused early around the turn,
got carried out to the six path in upper stretch, and was along for show. VALIANT MISS bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path,
tipped in slightly rounding the turn, was roused passing the quarter, floated out to the four path into the lane, and faded. SHEA D SECRET broke out and
bumped an outer foe, prompted the pace in the three path but backed up between foes rounding the turn. SHE KNOWS IT ALL ducked in at the gap, hit the
fence and always trailed.

Footnotes
GRAND MO THE FIRST hit the starting gate, advanced inside down the backstretch angled three wide early on the turn, moved to the front in upper stretch,
lugged in midstretch and drew clear under left-handed urging. CATCH A TIGER pressed the pace two wide, took over entering the turn, briefly cleared
midway around the turn, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, was herded in a bit by that foe nearing the eighth pole and stayed on to be clearly
second best. IMPROPTUDE set the early pace along the rail, checked while briefly racing erratically entering the turn, chased inside around the bend,
tipped out in upper stretch and kept on to hold the show. RED ABARRIO raced off the pace two wide and improved position in the lane. JUST TAKE
NOTES chased the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. MAGICSHADOW was shut off at the start, raced two wide and
never threatened. MY GREAT ILLUSION played no factor while racing three wide. BIGLY DEAL was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
STAR OF SATURN prompted the leading duo between in the two path into the turn, swung out to the seven path under a drive into the stretch, rallied
between foes, and was up just after the sixteenth pole. NEXT ON STAGE stalked in the three path, was floated out to the eight path turning into the lane,
and ran on for place. HEPBURN steadied at the start and was behind in the three path, circled inner foes from the seven path rounding the turn, fanned out
to the ten path into the stretch, and kept on for show. ALE'S GIFT vied for the lead inside, took a narrow advantage while tipping out to the three path into
the lane, but was caught by an outer trio late. ROSE OF TRALEE dueled for the lead in the four path but faded in the final furlong. SINGING SANDRA was
hustled along in range from the five path, but flattened down the lane. LAILA BELLA GIRL chased in the two path but made no impact. FIELD OF
BLOSSOMS raced off the pace in the four path but never threatened. MYSTIC LAKE was wellback in the five path and never menaced.

Footnotes
HAY HAY PAULA was shuffled back at the start, trailed outside, circled five wide around the turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drew off
under a drive. SOLAIR raced off the early pace, made progress four wide between foes around the far turn, was unable to match strides with the winner in
the lane but stayed on well to gain the place late. DRINKS ON ME stalked the pace four wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to midstretch and was
outfinished for the place. SHE'S OUTTA HERE chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. SHALL RETURN raced off the early pace, made
progress at the rail around the turn, bid in upper stretch but tired through the final furlong. OAXACA led early, chased three wide around the turn and
faltered in the lane. CHECK THE GRADE set the pace in the three path and retreated through the stretch.

THE SOLDIER stalked the pace three wide, reached even terms near the five-sixteenths marker, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but stayed on
to be a clear second. AMBUSHED raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. NORTH CAROLINA set
the pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. PLUMA ROJA failed to menace while racing four and five wide. BLUTO'S CANDY played no factor while
racing two and three wide. PAPA KATZ was outrun while racing two and three wide. ON JET HEIR veered out at the start, advanced five wide around the
first turn, tracked four wide down the backstretch and faltered late on the turn.

Footnotes
HARD BELLE vied for the lead in the five path, tipped into the three path rounding the turn, floated back out to the five path turning into the lane, and inched
away in the final furlong. ROYAL KITTEN prompted the pace in the six path, was ridden between foes in the four path rounding the turn, under urging while
back in the six path entering the stretch, and ran on to be up for place. JOE DI BAGGIO dueled for the lead in the two path, tipped out to the three path into
the lane, but faded late to show. SARAWAT tracked in the three path, was coaxed from the two path early around the turn, mildly stayed on between foes
down the stretch, and just missed getting up for show. ALEX'S STRIKE stalked in the seven path but flattened down the lane. SIR KAHN pressed inside but
backed up rounding the turn. FEDERAL EXCHANGE always trailed from the seven to five paths.

Footnotes
ALA TURKA settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer between foes rounding the turn, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, closed
outside and was up late. NOBLE DREAMER stalked the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, took over not long after, drew
clear in upper stretch, drifted out through the lane and yielded late. DEMURELY prompted the pace three and four wide, could not keep pace in upper
stretch but battled on between foes to save the show. ISLAND MAGIC was off slowly, saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch, continued on
the left lead in the lane and just missed third. FOR EVER OURS chased the pace four and five wide and was one-paced in the lane. DOMINEERING was
rank at the start, raced five wide and never threatened. SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the pace in the two path and tired in the stretch. TEMERITY played no factor
while racing two wide.
