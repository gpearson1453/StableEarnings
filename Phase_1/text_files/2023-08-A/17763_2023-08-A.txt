CRYPTO MUNNY unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, launched his
bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to get up in deep stretch to prevail. GROOVIN' IS BAK
away alertly and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn,
slipped through along the rail entering the lead while overhauling the pacesetter, but was unable to fend off CRYPTO MONEY in deep stretch while proving
clearly second best. EARS TO US rushed to a clear lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, drifted five wide entering the lane, and was outfinished late. THREE DAY BENDER broke sharply and stalked
the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, continued three wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
LOGICAL AL stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, pulled himself into a tracking trip in he run down the
backside, battled for the lead from the inside of ENGLISH BAY TEDDY through the final turn, got the better of that rival leaving the turn and quickly drew
clear as much the best. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, ducked out slightly entering the
backstretch and battled for the lead two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was no match for the winner in the late stages, but closed
two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. BETTER TONE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch
the first time, advanced into a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to
garner a share. SELF SERVING settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, trailed the field in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, saved ground through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. REMEMBERTHEALAMO broke
sharply and tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, checked briefly entering the backstretch when
ENGLISH BAY TEDDY appeared to shy away from something and duck out, lost his momentum at that point, and steadily dropped back. Following the
running of this race there was a jockey's' inquiry. The rider of REMEMBERTHEALAMO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of ENGLISH BAY TEDDY, for
alleged interference entering the backstretch. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
JERSEYS IMAGE broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the taxing early pace while racing out from the rail through the stretch the first time, set sail
after the pacesetter three wide midway down the backside and collared the leader entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and was
never threatened late. SILARONE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, held a stalking trip in the run
down the backside, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to get up for the place. TUXEDO away well and
was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, raced into a stalking trip into the backstretch, rallied
from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly two wide in the drive to just miss the place. JOCK TALK lagged well off the quick early pace
while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late
while finishing five wide in the drive. ASKMENOQUESTIONS away alertly and sprinted to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear
advantage through the stretch the first time, was quickly collared entering the final turn, fought gamely through the turn from the inside of JERSEY'S IMAGE,
was no match for that rival entering the lane, and weakened late. EH TEE EM unhurried early while settling at the back of the pack entering the stretch the
first time, continued to trail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and failed to make a late impact.
