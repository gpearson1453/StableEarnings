Footnotes
RENAISSANCE (IRE) raced inside early, split horses to the turn, chased into stretch, took over and cleared off under good handling to the wire. MISS
FOXANN unhurried between horses to turn, angled out and came on late for the place spot while no match. LANALIKESCHOOCHOOS sharp outside to
lead, stayed to deep stretch, stayed for show. HAPPYKIYAY no speed to the stretch improved position late stretch run. OPTIMIZME tried to keep between
horses to the turn but gave way in the stretch. WANNAGOCAMPING slow start, failed to menace throughout with a wide trip. INNER HARBOR good
position never far back to the turn with nothing left. SLENDER BETSY inside trip while chasing early on with a steady fade from the turn.
