Footnotes
SAGANAKI raced outside, rallied into the turn, bid seven wide, closed fast, got up late and won going away. STAY BY THE BEACH set the pace, responded
to pressure on the turn, drew clear, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. SUSPICIOUS BEAUTY broke out, pressed the pace,
challenged two across on the turn, fell back, leveled off and settled for show. BLUE COWGIRL broke out, stalked the pace, was within range and lacked the
needed late rally. ANDREABANANAS raced close to the pace along the inside, bid along the rail on the turn and hung late. BEVERLY WHO broke out, was
crowded and steadied in the chute, dropped inside and offered a mild bid only to improve position. BLAME THE TEQUILA raced mid pack, angled out on
the turn, went six wide entering the stretch, was not urged and lacked a bid. GONE KAT had brief speed only. ICY REBEL was outrun and not urged in the
stretch. BULL COUNTRY raced wide early, trailed and was not urged late.

MARK IT DOWN was sent to the front, vied inside, inched clear on the turn and held well. MAKE UP A STORY was unhurried early, rallied five wide on the
turn, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and finished second best. MARK THE WINNER vied between horses to the turn, fell back, went evenly late and
held for show. PAYINGOFFMYMARKER veered out at the start, vied three across to the turn, fell back, weakened and faded through the stretch. CHIPZ
stalked the pace, dropped inside, bid along the rail on the turn and had nothing left for the drive. NOT TO FANCY hesitated at the start to be off slowly, was
taken outside on the backstretch and lacked a bid. STORM IN THE VALLE got away well, stalked the pace to the turn, bid and came up empty. TAX FREE
TEXAS put in an even effort in an outside trip and was not a factor. JUST KEEP LAUGHIN had brief speed only and was outrun in an inside trip.
