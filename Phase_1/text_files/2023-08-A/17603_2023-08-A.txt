Footnotes
KEEPMEINPOWER trailed the field early, angled inside at the head of the stretch, drove three-wide taking over, and edged clear. SMOKIN JOY chased the
early pacesetters from a rail position, shifted out to the four path leaving the backstretch, rallied five wide midstretch, and was along in time for second.
GOLDIE SOCKS quickly went to the front, set a pressured pace in the three path, dueled outside of STARLIGHT LANE in the final turn, gained a slim
advantage in the stretch but was caught late. DARLA'S FURY was fractious in the gate dismounting the rider, was reserved off the dueling pacesetters,
rallied belatedly and finished in a dead heat alongside STARLIGHT LANE. STARLIGHT LANE pressed the pace from the two path, contested the lead into
the final turn then continued to battle on inside through the stretch and weakened midstretch finishing on the wire at the same time as DARLA'S FURY.
WICKED WIZZY saved ground inside and failed to threaten.

RAILWAY saved ground while setting the pace, responded to a looming threat from KYSTONE near the three-sixteenth pole, was kept under steady
handling while under pressure late and held firm. KYSTONE sat in striking position along the rail, moved up menacingly after the quarter pole, and kept on
determinedly but was unable to reach the winner. BARE BACK JACK sat just off the pace from the three path, hustled four wide off the final turn, and
finished evenly. PARKING PERMIT was never far back but failed to threaten. MACHINE offered a mild bid.

ASYOUBELIEVE showed the way from the two path, remained unchallenged at the head of the lane, extended his advantage under a confident hand ride
and was wrapped up late. ITSMYDAY lagged leaving, gained closer order in the far turn, met traffic near the quarter pole, and was gaining late but no real
threat to the winner. PADDYS ROCKET sat just off the pace while five wide, chased through the stretch and evened out for show. AMUSING WAY found
himself in the middle of the track entering the backstretch, remained wide then angled to the five path into the far turn, and came up empty for the drive.
KISS ME HELLO was under a snug hold when leaving the chute then settled inside, and was unable to make an impact late.

SILKSTONE hurried away, gave chased inside, took over at the head of the stretch, and won driving. BIRDY'S ON FIRE vied inside, emerged the leader
leaving the backstretch, rallied between but was overtaken and just held for second. SKIPPER'S PRIDE broke outward, gained closer order then uncorked a
late bid just missing out on place. ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO sent for speed, moved up alongside BIRDY'S ON FIRE leaving the backstretch, drove three
wide into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. DARE TO COMPARE broke in sharply then started bucking racing greenly in the backstretch, and
faded. EL CORRECAMINOS offered a late mild bid. E PAY ALL THE WAY was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
BIG HUG took back leaving the chute, tracked three wide, moved up into striking position nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead then drifted out then dug
in, in the final strides to take the nod. JELLI lagged early, gained ground quickly near the five-sixteenth pole, closed outside under left-handed
encouragement, then ducked inside, and was out-finished. SKIP'S ROCK settled in stride away from the gate then was soon joined to contend the early
lead by BOOTIFUL ROSE, departed from rival nearing the quarter pole but had no response when challenged into the stretch and evened out. SHAMRA
saved ground and lacked the kick needed. STEVIE WONDER GIRL tracked the dueling pacesetters and faded steadily inside. BOOTIFUL ROSE contested
the early pace, was unable to move on with her rival, and yielded. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run of the
race but made no change. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of JELLI against the rider of BIG HUG alleging interference in the stretch
run was not allowed after review by the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
CAPA BELLA prompted along from a rail position, gained an advantage nearing the quarter pole, turned back a challenge from TALA, and drew clear. TALA
tracked the early pacesetters while five wide, found seam at the quarter pole then moved up menacingly but was unable to get by and finished with good
energy for second. SAVYSKYE away well then set a pressured pace from the five path, fanned three wide into the far turn, tipped out five wide at the head
of the lane and stayed on for show. AMBER PRINCESS unhurried early, and bid belatedly. LETS GO ALL THEWAY rated off the pace from a rail position,
and faded. CUVEE TEE broke awkwardly then hurried up between foes, and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.

THUNDER ROARS raced five wide into the opening turn, closed steadily outside, overtook the lead, and won going away. TIPSY TALES brushed leaving,
contested the lead from between foes in the far turn, rallied inside of ITSALLGOODMAN at the head of the lane, inched clear, and held for second.
ITSALLGOODMAN stumbled from the gate brushing inside foe, fanned three-wide in the far turn, was urged on outside TIPSY TALES and weakened deep
stretch. GRATED COCONUT gave chased inside, went five to six wide out of the final turn but was unable to make an impact late. HE LIKES WINNING
lacked the early speed needed, and lodged a late mild bid. PATRIOTIC FREEDOM trailed early, and passed tiring foes. JAKOBS ROCKET BOY vied hard
outside then crossed over to the two path leaving the backstretch, was overtaken and faded gradually. DOUG'S HERO hurried away, chased and gave way.
