Footnotes
CHARM ALARM prompted the pace from the inside then fell back on the turn and angled out to three wide in upper stretch to make a late run and drew
clear late. OUR UPTOWN GIRL vied for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker then moved to take the lead in mid turn and drew clear but was
caught late in the drive. TOURING MARYANNE stalked the pace from three wide then made a mild bid on the turn and flattened out. JEZEBEL JADE trailed
the field through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch but was too late. ARUMA was close up on the pace down the backstretch but never made a bid.
ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE was hustled along on the backstretch from five wide but failed to menace. BOWTOTHEQUEEN went to the front to a pressured
lead to mid turn and gave way.

LIVE FIRE shared the command and battled down the stretch but was able to edge way late. CHEERS FOR KITTEN rushed up to share the command and
battled down the stretch but was outkicked late. STARLITE WALKER had no early speed but gained momentum around the turn from three wide to make a
late rally and missed the place. GONE INZANE tracked the leaders through the turn then lacked room in early stretch and shifted out to four wide at the
eighth pole and showed late run to improve. SPIKES SHIRL stalked the pace from three wide to mid stretch and faded. NAUTICAL NATURE was off the
pace, made a mild bid on the turn but was outfinished. WHERE YOU WAS raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. BEACH WARRIOR was
slow into stride but saved ground to no avail. COLBALOAF was always back. JUST A THOUGHT trailed and was out run.

HOT FUDGE WARRIOR bobbled leaving the gate then went to the front to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch to prove best. NAIL POLISH chased
the leader to the wire but was not match and was a clear second. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN was within striking distance from three wide and was along for
the show. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY had no early speed through the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch but only passed tired on.
KEYSTONE WARRIOR tracked the leader from the inside, made a mild bid on the turn and weakened.

flight to mid turn and edged away to chase the leader home. STASSI was in the second flight on the inside to mid turn then made a late gain on the winner.
PHILLIES DIAMOND raced three wide in the second flight to mid turn then weakened and finished evenly. OLIVIA DEE raced in the middle of the pack but
failed to menace. CITY OF LONDON raced near the back while saving ground to no avail. LUCKY FLUSH raced two wide in the second flight to the half
mile marker then retreated. OBJET D'ART was restless in the starting gate then had an awkward start and trailed. ANGEL OF HARLEM dwelt at the start
then pulled up shortly after leaving the gate and walked off.

Footnotes
BIG JOHN stalked the pace from three wide then ran down the leader in the stretch to be up in the final jumps. ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS was off the pace in
the two path, when asked at the three furlong marker he engaged the leader nearing the quarter pole and took the lead at the top of the stretch but was
collared in the final yards. TRIPLE TITOS had no speed through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch and slipped through in the final sixteenth to be
up for the show. THREEPETE raced near the back while saving ground through the turn then angled out to four wide at the eighth pole but was empty.
GIUSEPPE shot away from the gate to take a clear lead but was headed at the quarter pole and fought gamely down the stretch and gave way grudgingly.
PUTTHEPASTBEHIND raced in the middle of the pack, went three wide around the turn but didn't make a bid.
