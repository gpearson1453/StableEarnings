Footnotes
DERIVATIVE was in the second flight two deep down the back straight tracking the front two, comfortably stalked near the rear unhurried running on the
turn, shifted out from behind runners to loom four wide in upper stretch, battled outside for the lead at the furlong marker and was edging away for the
victory nearing the wire. TOWN'S WARRIOR had a good position on the turn alone watching the contesting top pair for the lead, pounced three wide outside
to bid straightening out for the drive, assumed the front with three sixteenths to go, braced for the challenge from the outside with a furlong remaining and
could not find another gear late to hold off the late charge by the winner. ROYAL QUALITY pressed the issue two wide down the back straight, hounded the
leader outside running on the turn, briefly took control when collared outside turning for home and gave way to the top two settling for a non threatening third
at the finish. MAKES NO CENTS had a slim lead inside down the backstretch, continued setting the pace by a narrow margin on the turn, was headed at the
top of the lane outside and yielded to runners in upper stretch holding for a minor share. HARD RELOAD hesitated at the start to trail down the backside,
ran greenly inside entering the turn, could not keep up with others at the half mile marker and was not involved in the drive to the wire lugging in through the
stretch.

Footnotes
HALO STYLE took command from the start, continued setting the fractions while pressed outside on the turn, opened up mildly at the top of the lane and
held safe at the wire by a diminishing margin for the win. NADIABIZNIZ prompted the pace down the back straight and throughout the turn, could not keep
up with the frontrunning winner four wide turning for home, resurged at the furlong marker and was gaining slowly on the winner crossing the line.
GORMLEY GIRL tracked outside in the second flight in the beginning, was roused three wide midway on the turn making little headway on the front duo,
shifted five wide for the drive and showed good late energy outside to get and capture third money in deep stretch. ABSOLUTE JEWEL tracked on the rail in
the early going, shifted just off the fence with three furlongs to go, was had ridden on the turn making no gain on the leaders straightening out for the drive
and stalled late losing third nearing the wire. LITTLE FIRE co-trailed outside in the third flight down the backside, was asked to go midpoint on the turn,
showed little and was one paced between runners through the stretch making little impact. WAKE UP MAGGIE was fractious in the stall just before the gate
opened, broke with the field, co-trailed on the rail down the backstretch, was urged for more inside through the turn, offered little response and never could
involved on the fence down the lane. COURTINGCOURTNEY dwelt at the break spotting the field considerably leaving the chute, was pulled up down the
backstretch and walked off.

WANNA PLAY seized control outside entering the backstretch, opened up on the chasing rival throughout the turn and gamely finished up prevailing in a
stretch battle to the wire. ROOKIE COURT broke out at the start, lead this field leaving the chute, chased the winner inside down the backstretch, was
checked mildly into the turn on the fence, shifted outside to pose the only threat at the quarter pole and was gaining slowly with every stride but could not
get there in the end losing in a photo. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH was pinched at the break, tracked inside in the second flight down the back straight, was
shuffled some when ridden on the rail at the three furlong pole and closed in down the stretch on the fence to capture third money in the final sixteenth.
SANDY GRACE tracked three deep outside horses watching the front pair down the backside, put in a brief rally outside from the half mile marker to the
midpoint on the turn, faded to the leaders at the quarter pole and drifted out in the final furlong holding for a minor role in the end. LEADING FORCE was
allowed to settle trailing the field down the backstretch, was roused seeing the field with three eighths remaining, angled outside in the five path driving to
the wire and passed a straggler in mid stretch. SMART IRENE tracked the top duo two deep between runners at the half, offered a mild run outside at the
three furlong marker and came up empty with runners on either side turning for home. TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #2 ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH

Footnotes
PLUIE D'AVRIL stalked in midpack inside on hold behind horses, was unhurried rating kindly though the turn, looked for a seam two wide at the top of the
lane, shifted out to the four path to finally have clear running room at the sixteenth pole and surged when clear to get up for the win in the final strides.
SPEEDY LYNN took this field up front down the backstretch, surrendered the lead inside at the five eighths marker, was shuffled on the fence two furlongs
from home and re-rallied on the rail in the final seventy yards to best the rest at the finish. LADY MAEVE (IRE) was nestled on the rail behind the top two
early on, offered a strong move outside at the half mile marker to bid three wide straightening out for the drive, stubbornly battled on to poke her head in
front briefly at the furlong pole but was outfinished late and settled for third money in a game effort. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD prompted the pace outside in the
beginning, assumed command at the five furlong marker, was clinging to the lead at the top of the stretch, collared between runners at the furlong marker
and needed more late to pose a threat for the top three at the wire holding for a minor share in the end. WICKED MIAH stalked near the rear down the
backside and throughout the turn, angled four wide driving to the wire, shifted inwards to the rail under right handed urging at the eighth pole and never gave
up showing good late energy closing in the late stages to be in the mix at the finish. AIRY FAIRY tracked two wide down the backstretch, had a good
position three wide outside on the turn if good enough, angled four wide for the stretch drive to be in the mix of things in upper stretch and stalled in the final
eighth. OHEAVENS leapt up at the start spotting the field lengths, trailing down the backside, made little advance on horses on the turn, swung six wide for
the drive outside but could not over come the poor break to pose a threat in the stretch. STORMY SUZIE stalked near the rear in the beginning, could not
get interested on the turn, made little presence down the stretch but did pass a weary runner in the final furlong. PINO IN A PURSE settled three deep in
midpack down the backstretch, made little impression running four wide through the turn, retreated on the rail shifting in at the eighth pole and galloped to
the wire.

Footnotes
MACHISIMA pressed inside under the wire for the first time, took control on the rail into the back straight, dictated the pace on the final turn, was headed
outside briefly at the top of the stretch and found more when roused at the furlong marker to draw away for the victory. CHEEKY PINT tracked inside just off
the fence into the first turn, watched the pacesetter on the rail at the half, took up the running splitting horses at the quarter pole, headed the front running
winner mildly at the top of the lane and could only chased the winner in vain through the stretch. ERASMO'S GIRL trailed the field unhurried entering the
backstretch, was given a few left hand reminders to get interested with seven sixteenths to go, rallied up the fence in upper stretch and closed with interest
to win the show battle at the finish. TEXT ME UP tracked three wide into the first turn, continued outside three deep down the backside keeping a close eye
on the top duo, made no advance three wide on the final turn, shifted inwards for the stretch run and finished up evenly between foes for a small share in
the end. FORESTERS PRINCESS had a slim lead two wide entering the first turn, was relegated to the chaser outside down the backstretch, could not gain
on the frontrunner when nudged on for more midpoint on the far turn, shifted outside five wide for the drive and retreated outside in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MILAGRE DO SOL was content to sit behind the pacesetter in the beginning stages, began to slowly reel in the front runner midway on the far turn in hand,
pounced to the lead outside turning for home, slowly wore down the leader in mid stretch to extend her lead and was going away at the wire for the win.
FANORE (IRE) assumed the lead on the first turn, opened up on the field down the backside, was collared outside by the winner straightening out for the
drive, determinedly battled inside until the eighth pole giving way to the winner and cruised home to be a clear second at the line. PAINTED GLORY had a
good spot watching the top pair down the backstretch, could not match strides when the top pair quickened throughout the final turn but had enough left late
down the stretch to hold off rivals besting the rest for third at the wire. EXUDE stalked two wide outside on the first turn near the rear, travelled three deep
outside horses down the backstretch still near the back of the pack, was scrubbed on for more run three wide at the half, angled out in the five path for the
stretch drive and was one paced down the lane to settle for a small share in the end. BIG SHOOTER trailed in the early going, could still see the field
running down the back straight, offered a mild turn of foot bursting between rivals midway on the final turn, was in range four wide between foes at the top of
the stretch fighting for a small share of the prize and levelled off in the last furlong. VINCENZINO stalked near the rear on the rail in a strung out field down
the backside, offered a mild run inside to be involved in the show share of the prize on the far turn, backed away inside at the three furlong marker and could
not a factor to the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
TURF AND SURF was all alone keeping a close eye on the frontrunner at the half, surged to take control outside midpoint on the far turn,, opened up on her
rivals straightening out for the drive and comfortably cruised home for the win at the finish. FOREST VIXEN travelled three wide in midpack in the early
going, was in a good spot watching the front duo outside down the back straight, followed the path set by the winner on the final turn, chased but to no avail
throughout the stretch and was second best on this day. FAVORITE CHANNEL trailed the field on the rail entering the first turn, settled in midfield just off
the fence down the backside, advanced three wide with five sixteenths to go and determinedly chased the top two to the wire to be a non threatening third at
the finish line. KEY STROKE tracked the top two on the rail down the backside, was roused inside with five sixteenths remaining trying to keep position and
finished up evenly down the stretch for a minor role in the end. CASTLETON bore out on the first turn, trailed on the outside fence down the backside,
recovered to start picking up rivals at the seven sixteenths pole and showed some grit to pass runners down the stretch for a small share in the end in an
eventful trip. GENTLE SEAS was carried out on the first turn, regrouped to stalk near the back of the pack at the half, could not get involved on the far turn
due to the poor early start but showed some interest to pass weary runners in the stretch. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE cleared to the rail taking this field into the
first turn, dictated the pace down the backstretch, was collared outside by the winner midway on the far turn, offered no resistance and backed through the
field on the fence in mid stretch. SAY GRACE was steadied in the seven path entering the first turn, stalked near the rear down the back straight, was hard
ridden with three furlongs to go but could not keep up to the pack on the far turn and stopped in upper stretch.
