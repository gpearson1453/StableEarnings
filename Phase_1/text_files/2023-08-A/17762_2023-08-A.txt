the winner but stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. MISS ATHLETIC set the pace along the rail, was collared leaving the quarter pole and held on
for the show. CANT STOP DREAMING raced off the pace five wide and had a mild belated rally. LOVEYS EMBRACE was no threat while racing two wide.
BABY SASSICAIA played no factor while racing four wide. FAST MOTION hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little impact. TOURIST STYLE
trailed outside.

Footnotes
PESKY got bumped by an outer foe into an in inner foe at the start, raced in range while under a nudge from the four path, bid midway around the turn,
swept past the inner pacesetter just before the quarter pole, opened up from the four path into the lane, and held sway under a drive. KINGY was prompted
along while close to the pace inside, tipped outward midway around the turn, was driven from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. GALIPAN
got bumped by an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, was roused from the four path midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the
lane, and kept on for show. LETS GO KOKO broke in and bumped an inner foe hard at the start, raced off the pace in the five path, tipped into the three
path into the turn, angled out to the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. THE HONEYMAN trailed in the three path early and made no impact from
along the inside down the stretch. AWESOME FRIEND hopped at the start, chased in the five path, tipped out to the eight path in upper stretch, but did not
threaten. DUDEWITHANAME set the pace in the two path, was overtaken by the eventual winner midway around the turn, and gaveway into the lane.

Footnotes
ANATOMY tracked the pace in the two path, angled in leaving the quarter pole, cut the corner into the lane, seized command inside of the pacesetter in
upper stretch and drew off under a drive. SADIE BEAR stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner in
the lane but stayed on to gain the place in the final strides. MINXY set a pressured pace inside, drifted slightly turning for home, was no match for the winner
in the final furlong and lost second best. BLACK ICE failed to menace while racing two wide. IDEAL BREEZE dueled between foes, could not match strides
turning for home, steadied while in tight in upper stretch, angled out in midstretch and continued to retreated. ESOTERIC reared as the gates opened, broke
far behind the field and trailed in three path. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE START, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ESOTERIC DID NOT
RECIEVE A FAIR START AND DECLARED HIM A NON-STARTER FOR BETTING PURPOSES.

Footnotes
GREEN MILLENNIUM raced prominently outside the pacesetter in the four path, bid from the three path early into the far turn, took command midway
around that far turn, opened up from the two path into the stretch, and held sway under a drive. EMERGENCY RESPONSE stalked in the four path, was
ridden along early around the far turn, tipped inwards to the three path at the top of the lane, and kept on for place. RULE IT settled in midpack around the
five path, received a right handed cued while still in the five path entering the stretch, and chased on for show. TRAVEL GUIDE tracked in the two path, was
coaxed into the far turn, swung out to the six path for the stretch, but evened out. NETWORKING was held up between foes in the three path, shifted out to
the seven path turning into the lane, but made no impact. BROOKLYN DREAMS raced off the pace in the five path, fanned out to the eight path turning into
the stretch, and did not factor. DECISIVE PRIDE laid in midfield along the inside early, but dropped back around the five-eighths point, went wide into the
stretch, and did not threaten. MIRO set the pace in the two path, was challenged by the eventual winner going into the far turn, and yielded going into the
stretch. DONTONIO was unhurried from the two path, moved up early into the backstretch, but was empty turning into the lane. SKY KATZ was wellback in
the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
R ROSE' ALL DAY was in a bit tight after the start, raced off the early pace three wide, advanced between foes down the backstretch, bid five wide around
the far turn, seized command near the eighth pole, drove clear and held clear while geared down in the final strides. HARLAN'S LEGACY was bumped after
the start, raced off the pace four wide, edged closer still four wide around the far turn, bid between foes in midstretch, could not match strides with the
winner in the final furlong but won the battle for the place. SHEWILLGHOSTU raced well back two and three wide, swung five wide turning for home, closed
outside and just missed second. NO WASABI FOR ME saved ground in midpack, angled to the three path around the far turn and improved position
between foes in the lane. DOMO ARIGATOU was bumped after the start, raced three wide in midpack, angled to the rail midway around the far turn, bid in
upper stretch and flattened out soon after. SIENA LADY set the pace in the two path and tired in midstretch. GRATIA broke outwardly and never threatened
while racing four and five wide. WICKLOW GAL hit the starting gate, prompted the pace three wide and faltered around the far turn. MADEFORSUMMER
was in range two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
COOL MEMORY set the pace inside, was put to a ride when challenged by an outer foe into the turn, put away that challenger while in the two path at the
top of the lane, dug in to hold off another outer foe in upper stretch, bumped with that foe just after the eighth pole, and drew clear late. BUFFALO SPIRIT
stalked in the four path, ranged up under right hand encouragement rounding the turn, bid from the three path into the stretch, bumped with the inner
pacesetter just past the eighth pole, and was repelled to place. UNCAPTURED TIGER tracked in the two path, floated out to the eight path turning into the
lane, and was along for show. KOHAKU prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a nudge into the turn, but faded from the five path into the stretch.
ARTE DE GUERRA trailed in the two path early and did not factor. LAS OLAS bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the five path but did not
threaten. OLORUN bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two path but was eased turning into the lane.

Footnotes
LET THEM WATCH broke in and bumped and inner foe, raced prominently outside the leader in the four path, took command midway around the turn,
opened up passing the quarter, was cued from the three path into the lane, held safe, and was wrapped up late. KISS chased from the six path into the turn,
swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for place. EPONA'S HOPE broke out and bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path,
was ridden between foes in the four path rounding the turn, floated out to the six path into the lane, and stayed on between for show. FLORINDIA tracked
from the rail, cut the corner under a drive turning into the stretch, but flattened. AVELLINO set the pace in the two path, lost the lead while along the rail
early around the turn, shifted out to the four path turning into the stretch, and faded. SHE HAS CLASS got bumped on both sides at the start, trailed in the
two path and was no menace from out in the seven path down the stretch. KITTY'S PRETTY raced off the pace in the three path but was empty entering the
stretch.
