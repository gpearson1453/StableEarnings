Footnotes
SLITHER staled the front runner while racing in the three path, was encouraged through the turn to draw closer to the lead horse, was still chasing in the
upper stretch, was driven and hand ridden, continued to close, finally passed the tiring front runner at the eighth pole and drew away for the win.
LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG vied for the lead, set the pace while racing along the rail, led all the way to the eighth pole, began to tire and relinquished the
lead to a closing rival but had done enough early to hold on for second place money. CARLOS PUNCH raced from mid pack in the three path and
maintained that position through out. MORRICONE broke out just a bit, trailed the field through out while racing in the three path.

Footnotes
PINCH ME A PENNY stalked the pace from the five path, launched a bid at the three eights pole, hooked the front runners at the five sixteenth pole, shook
one, battled with the other early leader until the three sixteenth pole, shook that foe and drew off down the stretch for the impressive win. SALUTE NOW
was off a step slow, trailed the field while finding his stride, bid at the half mile pole, circled the field in the turn racing in the five path, closed with conviction,
drifted in a bit down the lane but continued to gain ground and close with each stride, could not get to the winner but was better than the rest getting up for a
game second. JIMMIE'S HALO was off a bit slow, improved position down the back side, raced in the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths and
gained ground as he raced in between foes through the turn, was asked to close in the stretch but struggled to switch leads, started to loose ground, then
finally switched but it was too late. JOEY'S GAME was off in mid pack, raced on the rail, traveled at his own pace as he saved ground, shuffled back a bit
entering the turn, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, shifted out into the five path as he circled the field through the turn, then was asked to close but
struggled to switch his lead and finished flat. BIG ACE stalked the pace from the three path, drew beside the early leader and set the next set of fractions as
a set, was joined by a fast closing outside challenger at the five sixteenth pole, matched strides and battled into the stretch then BIG ACE gave way in the
stretch. CHROMPTON vied for the lead, led while racing in the two path, was joined by another rival and set the next fractions as a set, then tired at the five
sixteenth pole. PINK HIGGINS was off in the middle of the field, raced in between foes in the three path, maintained position through out, running an even
race. BIG SCULLY was off mid pack, raced wide through out. DOUBLE PRIORITY showed little.

Footnotes
LOUDERMILK used natural speed to take the lead, raced on the rail and went wire to wire uncontested for a game win. GHOSTLY TIME chased the leader
while racing on the rail, was no match for the winner but was second best today. AWESOME RUTA raced from mid pack, raced three wide and closed down
the lane finding his best stride late. BANDERA BLING raced from the middle of the field in the two path, shifted out into the four path in the upper stretch
and finished even. HOLUS BOLUS was off mid pack, raced on the rail, saved ground through out but had no kick. MAKE IT SPEND IT was off in the middle
of the field, raced four wide, was best late. MAX IS G MONEY broke sharp, then raced mid pack after early positioning, raced between foes and maintained
position and pace through out. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS off slow, trailed, mild gain. YES JACK off pace raced wide through out. HEXCEL showed little.
WINONESOON mid pack, steadily faded. DICEY WAGER trailed.
