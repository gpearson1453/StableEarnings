Footnotes
ONE MORE SCOOP trailed the field early then made a four wide bid on the turn to engage the leader at the top of the stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole
but stayed on and drew clear late. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT sprinted away to a clear lead around the turn then was collared at the three sixteenths pole
but kept on and proved second best. DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN rushed up to vie for the lead from the inside then fell back on the turn but made a rebid
to be best of the rest. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY was off the pace from between horses to the quarter pole, drifted out at the top of the stretch and tired.
PICTOR was hustled along to be close to the pace from three wide but never made a bid and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN WARRIOR prompted the pace down the backstretch then engaged the leader midway through the final turn and took over to draw clear in the
stretch. JO JO KATZ was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late rally to be up for the place. MINE TO
HOLD stalked the pace to the final turn then moved up but lacked the late kick to fend of the later closer and was outfinished. CRAZY KATER tracked the
leaders through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch but was outkicked. MR. EINSTEIN raced in the middle of the pack and finished evenly.
SAMARONTI raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn but was empty. DEVOTED KITTEN raced near the
back and was not a factor. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE went to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was collared midway through the final turn and gave
way. PANADERO raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. MY FRIEND FRANK was outrun and galloped in.

CALLIN MY NAME went to a challenged lead, floated out into the stretch but kept on and kept to the task. LORD ON HYGH was reluctant to load, then
sprinted to the front to press the pace from the two path and proved second best. SISYPHUS dueled from the inside in the second flight and shook loose in
mid turn to make a late run but was too late. OUR ANDREW B dueled from the two path in the second flight and was a game third. MUSIC BOX DANCER
bumped with outside rival at the start then raced three wide in the second flight around the turn and weakened. REBEL WARRIOR was last away, chased
the field around the turn and was not involved. FREEDOM LIVES bumped with inside rival then raced four wide in the second flight to mid turn and dropped
back.

TIZ SPEEDY was off the pace on the inside through the turn then moved out to two wide at the top of the stretch to run down the leader and edge away
late. WARRIOR'S PAYOFF went to the front to a pressured lead through the turn then drifted out in the stretch but couldn't fend off the outside rival and was
a clear second. CERTAIN JUSTICE lost footing leaving the starting gate then chased the field down the backstretch, made a four wide bid around the turn
then moved out to five wide in upper stretch but was no match for the top two and held on for the show. BOOK RUNNER tracked the leaders down the
backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn, moved out to four wide at the top of the stretch for a late run and was outnodded. NORTHERN

HAPPY TAPPY TIM stalked the pace from the inside through the turn the split horses at the top of the stretch and won going away. SURCHARGE raced
near the back down the backstretch then moved up around the turn, went four wide into upper stretch to make a late rally but was no match for the winner.
BOUND BY TRUTH went to a challenged early lead then edged away on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and fought gamely in early stretch
but was empty. PRAIRIE TALES tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three furlong marker to engage the leader at the
top of the stretch and weakened. HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH raced then the back, saved ground around the turn to improve position. JUSTICE OR
APPEAL rushed up to press the pace to the five sixteenths pole and tired. SELENA SING was off the pace on the inside to the three furlong marker and
retreated. BLEZNIATKA broke well and dropped back shortly after the start.

Footnotes
DURANTE stumbled at the start, then moved up to be in contention entering the turn and kept on moving between horses around the turn, engaged the
leader at the top of the stretch and cruised on by to draw off. LANSDOWNE sprinted away to vie for the lead from three wide into the turn then took
command at the three furlong marker but was eclipsed at the top of the stretch and fought gamely to hold the place. CRYO was close off the pace to the
turn then made a three wide bid matching strides with DURANTE around the turn and engaged the leader at the top of the stretch but had nothing left for the
drive. MAGIC SPIN rushed up to take a pressured lead for the first quarter then was over taken at the seven sixteenths pole and weakened. NOBLE JON
hustled up to press the pace from the inside to the seven sixteenths pole and gave way. DATHOSS was close up on the pace from the inside but was
shuffled back at the three furlong marker, angled out to four wide in upper stretch but never made a bid.
