Footnotes
A KISS FOR KHOZAN set the pace inside, was confidently handled rounding the turn, cued approaching the quarter and opened up into the lane, drifted out
passing the sixteenth pole, but was clear. FOREVER UNCAPTURED got rank as the gate opened and bumped with an outer foe, stalked in the two path,
tipped out early around the turn and ranged up from the four path passing the quarter, was cued from the three path into the stretch, and chased on for
place. GLAZED GINGER bumped with an inner foe then an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, attempted to bid under coaxing early
around the turn, flattened while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, but held show. MO RISSA broke in and brushed with an inner foe at the start,
raced off the pace in the two path and made no impact. HIDDEN ROAD chased in the four path but did not threaten. FAR ABOVE always trailed around the
three path.

Footnotes
STRIDE rated in the four path, ranged up under coaxing around the far turn, took aim from the six path at the top of the lane, and rallied past the inner
pacesetter in the final sixteenth. WALL STREET TRADER set the pace in the two path, opened from the three path into the stretch, and stayed on but was
caught in the final sixteenth to place. A ROSE FOR RAVEN stalked in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn, angled out to the seven path into the
lane, and finished evenly to show. COMPETITIVE SAINT tracked inside, cut the corner under a drive turning into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong
to miss minor placings. HUNTER trailed in the three path early and never threatened down the lane. DENYING raced off the pace inside, received multiple
right handed cues while shifting outwards around the far turn, but failed to menace from the seven path in the stretch.

NO MORE DEBT broke a bit awkwardly, sped forward between foes down the backstretch, vied two wide around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and
widened under a drive. ANTILLEAN broke awkwardly, raced in range inside, angled out in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead leaving the eighth
pole and ran on for the pace. COMMANDER BIZ set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and kept on for the show.
HANDSOME TODD raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. NORFIE prompted the pace three wide and
weakened in the stretch. GRANTED SUCCESS was off slow, saved ground and never threatened. CORPORATE AFFAIR chased the pace three wide and
came up empty in the lane. ADIOS YOUR HONOR failed to menace while racing three wide. ARTE DE GUERRA played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
RARE JEWEL bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, got stymied between foes in the two path rounding the turn, was floated out to
the five path then angled in to the three path at the top of the lane, and rallied past an outer foe passing the sixteenth pole. MAJOR KING prompted the
leading duo from the six path into the turn, bit turning into the stretch, kept on and took the lead into the final furlong, but was caught by an inner foe passing
the sixteenth pole to place. MOPED DENNIS rated from the seven path into the turn, moved into range while in the five path around the turn, fanned back
out to the seven path entering the lane, and got up for show. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) vied for the lead in the five path into the turn, took a short advantage
while in the three path rounding the turn, but yielded between rivals nearing the eighth pole. NATURE BOY bumped with an outer foe at the start, dueled for
the lead in the two path but gaveway turning into the stretch. RUNAWAY TOM chased in the six path but made no impact. EUPHORIA STAR had a slow
start and always trailed from the five to three paths.

TO THYSELF B TRUE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command near the eighth pole and
inched ahead of a stubborn foe in the final furlong. KARA AND COLLEEN pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, led to
midstretch and battled on gamely inside of the winner. MYSTIC SUNRISE saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, loomed
outside of the winner in upper stretch but was one-paced through the final furlong. RED TIARA set the pace along the inside, gave way near the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened. ETNA'S NAPPER stalked the pace from the rail, was shuffled back nearing the quarter pole, was on heels again in
midstretch, angled out near the sixteenth pole and improved position. GREY PRINCESS chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. APPLAUSE
was a bit rank while racing four wide early, launched a three wide bid around the far turn but came up empty in the lane.

CALL ME SPICY prompted the pace in the three path, bid while floating out to the five path into the stretch, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and
inched clear. LOVIN MAKES CENTS rated in the two path, was roused from the rail nearing the quarter, angled out to the six path into the stretch, and ran
on for place. HEIR TO THE ROAR had a slow start and trailed in the three path, passed a tired pair late around the turn and fanned out to the nine path into
the lane, and kept on for show. GITANA had her head turned at the start and got squeezed slightly, chased in the three path, floated out to the seven path
under a drive into the stretch, and finished evenly. PRINCESS BLAKELY set the pace while tipping to the rail into the turn, was coaxed passing the quarter,
but faded from the two path in the stretch. SHEZA SPITFIRE tracked in the five path but did not threaten. GIRVIN GIRL stalked in the four path but backed
up between foes early around the turn.

Footnotes
CHAPALU set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out and just lasted. URANIUM raced in range two wide, angled four wide in upper
stretch, closed outside and ran out of ground. ATTENTIVE trailed in the three and four paths for three furlongs then rallied outside to gain the show. HE'S IN
CHARGE prompted the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. FRENCHMEN STREET went evenly inside. SOVEREIGN OF
SPEED failed to menace while racing four and five wide. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR pressed the pace two wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the
lane and tired.
