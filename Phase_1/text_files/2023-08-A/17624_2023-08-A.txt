Footnotes
TRADE IMBALANCE came in a few paths after the start then was corrected by the rider, was caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
roused in the four path on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop, closed well to get the lead outside the furlong marker, shook
clear outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted out under a left-handed crop, was straightened about forty yards from the finish and just out-nodded the
runner-up on the line. AGATE ROAD was fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, took an awkward stride
shortly after the start, saved ground while well behind the vanguard going around the opening bend, was urged well off the pace, went two then three wide
under strong encouragement early on the far turn then angled five wide, gained six wide into the stretch, pursed the winner on the outside while still on his
inside lead, drifted in while closing on that foe into the final sixteenth, took a narrow advantage while head-bobbing with the winner late and was denied
while clear for the place. LE GRIS broke in then was corrected by the rider, prompted the pace outside of the leader in the two path while loosely between
foes, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but just earned the
show. ASPENITE went to the front, showed the way on the inside while inside of foes, vied along the rail while inside of one opponent on the far turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and weakened then just missed the
show. DRILLING FOR GOLD broke a bit in the air and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, was urged in the two path on the first turn, settled at
the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was no factor. FALFURRIAS was fractious in the gate, veered in at the
start then bumped very hard with a foe, went four wide while between horses on the first turn, moved in early on the backstretch, was well placed on the
inside, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and retreated. ALLIED ATTACK was bumped very hard at the start, showed speed in the three path
while between horses on the first turn, tracked outside on the backstretch, was urged along passing the eleven-sixteenths, came up empty while three then
two wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
JUST STEEL coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of OZONE from the outside three wide, tucked to the two path advancing on the leader to duel with
that rival coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over command narrowly and got brushed and traded a light
bump nearing the eighth pole with BE YOU, got headed by that rival a furlong out, dug in to the inside of that rival getting nudged inwards a path or two to
the finish and took back the front gamely seventy yards from home before prevailing at the end. BE YOU settled chasing along the inside just off the duel up
front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and began to tip out culminating in swinging six wide into upper stretch, came in on the wrong lead and
brushed and traded a bump with JUST STEEL nearing the eighth pole, grabbed narrow command at that station, dug in coming inwards and floating in the
aforementioned foe a path or two to the finish getting headed seventy yards from home, fought game but was ultimately bested at the end. LOCKED got
forced to steady at the start when DOMESTIC PRODUCT veered in and conceded five to six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to close in and
secure the show honors unable to threaten the top pair while well clear of the rest. OZONE hustled from the gate, showed the way just off the inside lightly
coaxed down the backstretch under some pressure from JUST STEEL before having that rival advance outside, dueled through the turn, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch under threat, yielded straightened away and weakened to the finish. DOMESTIC PRODUCT veered in at the start taking over the
lane of LOCKED and forcing that rival to steady out, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. HAMILTON'S WAY broke in a step at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. PENTATHLON chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. UNO MAS BOURBON chased just off the duel four paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper
stretch and tired. BADLANDS RULER hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and floated out three
then four wide through the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and folded. CREEK chased five then four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled six wide into upper stretch, never got involved.

Footnotes
VICTORIOUS WAVE showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path at the three-eighths pole, was roused at the
quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. BEACHWALKER was urged along off the pace, moved closer with five
furlongs to run, continued to advance late on the backstretch, made a rail bid inside of two foes coming to the three-eighths pole, turned into upper stretch
under a drive while inside of the winner, lost touch with that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. NO MORE TALK was
well placed just off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide at the three-eighths, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty while
best of the rest. RAGTIME BLUES broke a bit awkwardly, moved up under urging to set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path under
threat from both sides early on the turn, lost the advantage at the three-eighths pole, dropped back at the five-sixteenths pole and tired. WINNING DRIVE
was ridden along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. DONTBELATE broke out then
was hustled, lugged out under heavy left-rein pressure, brushed with a foe in the process, bolted on the turn, came away out towards the outside fence and
was eased but walked off. GLORY ROAD was taken up while in tight early then moved to the outside, brushed with DONTBELATE while carried out by that
foe on the backstretch, was forced out nine wide near the seven-sixteenths, dropped back then moved to the five path before the five-sixteenths and was
eased then vanned off.

Footnotes
ZEEBEAR dueled from the two path with SHARED SUCCESS to his inside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths shaking away and crossing nearer
to the inside forcing his former pace rival to tip out a path, came under challenge from the runner up and floated that rival out four to five wide, then went
clear under a drive to prevail. NOBLE HUNTSMAN chased along the inside from the tail of the field early on, came under coaxing and advanced strongly
tipping two then three wide and nudging SELL SOMETHING to the four path, offered up a bid to issue a challenge nearing the quarter pole and angled out
five wide when the leader floated in front four wide, tucked four wide as that foe went to the five path straightened away, then proved no match while
keeping on to secure the place honors. SHARED SUCCESS dueled inside of ZEEBEAR from the early stages, got shaken off at the seven-sixteenths and
came under coaxing at that juncture tipping out a path as the leader came inwards slightly, swung three wide for home and weakened. SELL SOMETHING
coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, got nudged three then four wide at the three-eighths, went six
wide into upper stretch and weakened. GIMMEDAMONEY bobbled at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three
wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT ARROW stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path while asked on the turn, was driven four
wide into the stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, drew even with that foe into the final sixteenth, drifted in and bumped lightly about
forty yards from the finish and got up to prevail. BE THE BOSS broke out then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside, vied inside of a foe in the two
path on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole, was bumped lightly by the winner
while on even terms about forty yards from the finish and was caught while clear for the place. SAFALOW'S MISSION bobbled slightly at the start, settled
towards the rear, was taken in hand briefly between foes outside the five-eighths, went three then four wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show. QUICK TO ACCUSE was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the
pace, was shuffled back some behind GOLDEN ARM as that foe came back at the seven-sixteenths, was roused while moving from the rail to three wide on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under a drive, drifted out under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and missed the show. GOLDEN ARM
disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and tired. THANK YOU JON was rated just off the
pace, chased two then three wide on the turn and came up empty. ASAP RESTORATION was ridden along at the rear, angled in outside the five-eighths
then was straightened, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. TWO FOR CHARGING was re-positioned by an assistant starter in the gate,
settled near the back, saved ground on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' T was reserved in the middle of the field on the inside, came under urging late on the backstretch, angled three then four wide on the far turn,
bobbled near the five-sixteenths, rallied to make a bid between foes into upper stretch, fought between two rivals in the final furlong and gamely prevailed.
DAKOTA GOLD was taken in hand between horses early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved well off the pace, gained three wide early on
the far turn then shifted five wide while closing fast, made an outside bid into upper stretch, fought outside of two foes in the final furlong and just missed
while narrowly able to get the place. PORTFOLIO COMPANY dropped back along the rail early, fell well off the pace while saving ground, gained on the
final turn, paused in traffic while closing fast late on that bend, found room between horses to make a bid into upper stretch, battled inside of the top two in
the final furlong and just missed while clear for the show. SPEAKING SCOUT hit the inside of the gate at the start then moved in early, saved ground while
unhurried at the back, was roused on the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the last
spot in the superfecta. DOCTOR DAVIS showed early speed on the inside of a foe under urging then was taken in hand while beaten to the front, raced in
the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the three path on the far turn, made a brief bid into upper stretch, dropped back
into the final furlong and weakened. TIZ THE BOMB moved in at the rear, traveled three wide going around the first turn, settled at the back, was urged
along in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was hustled from the gate, went around
the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the outside, came under urging in a good striking position on the far turn, dropped to the rail coming to the
quarter-pole and capitulated. MID DAY IMAGE hit the outside of the gate at the start, moved in while asked for speed, showed the way in the two path,
dropped to the rail at the quarter-pole then was swallowed up into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PROGRAM TRADING (GB) went to the front, showed the way in the two path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, came out five wide into
the stretch, lost the advantage to the runner-up at the three-sixteenths, fought on well into the final furlong then was brushed, dueled gamely inside of the
aforementioned foe into the final sixteenth then regained the lead and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. WEBSLINGER went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, stalked four wide on the far turn, made a bid after being asked at the
five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch, gained a short lead at the three-sixteenths, drifted in near the furlong marker then brushed with the winner
inside that marker, led while dueling outside into the final sixteenth, fought to the finish and was denied while able to get the place. FAR BRIDGE was taken
in hand early, went three then two wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the five path on the far turn, was driven six wide into
the stretch, chased the top two under a left-handed crop into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed winning kick but was clear for the show. BATTLE OF
NORMANDY broke out and bumped with a rival, moved in while taken in hand, settled off the pace, was asked between foes in the three to four path on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. ASPEN GROVE (IRE) was fractious in
the gate then backed out and reloaded, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under encouragement in the two to three path on
the far turn, dropped closer to the rail into the stretch and lacked the needed response. THE FRANCHISE (IRE) saved ground on the first turn, settled at the
rear, was roused with a half-mile to run, moved from three to five wide while ridden along on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked
the needed response. MONDEGO (GB) became fractious in the gate after another foe did the same, was taken under a strong hold early and conceded the
front, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn and came up empty. LION OF WAR (GB) was
bumped at the start, moved up on the outside under some urging, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the
three path on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
WHITE ABARRIO forwardly placed from the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn before settling to attend the leader from the outside while
three wide, remained patiently handled latched on to the outside applying pressure through his presence, got given a notch to work with at the
five-sixteenths and took over the front nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew clear under a drive drifting in
to the two path a furlong out, then got flashed the crop to the left side and shied outwards before being ridden out to the finish through the final sixteenth.
ZANDON raced along the inside through the first turn and then tracked from just off the inside just off the pace, came under light coaxing near the
seven-sixteenths and tipped three wide, had the rider sneak a peek back looking for CODY'S WISH, tipped out four wide under urging at the three-eighths
nearly in front of that rival, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best.
CODY'S WISH was leaning on the right side of the stall a bit unprepared for the start when the latch was sprung and lost his hind footing skidding out of the
gate and conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside through the first turn at the tail of the field before
tipping three to four paths off the rail down the backstretch, got given a notch to work with into the far turn before coming under coaxing just past the
seven-sixteenths, followed ZANDON four wide through the bend and angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and improved position to just
get up for the show honors on the wire. CHARGE IT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three wide down the
backstretch just off the pace, tucked to the two path into the far turn placed to prolonged coaxing half a mile from home, swung three wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals to the finish just getting bested for the show honors in the final jumps. GIANT GAME coaxed from the gate, established the front
narrowly and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before taking to the rail down the backstretch under the watchful eye of WHITE
ABARRIO and facing some pressure from that rival's presence latched on to the outside, tipped to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing
nearing the five-sixteenths under intensified challenge from his main pace prompter, yielded the front and swung three wide at the head of the stretch, then
weakened in the drive. LAST SAMURAI three wide just off the pace through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under urging at the
seven-sixteenths, lost ground and swung four wide at the top of the stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
EVERSO MISCHIEVOUS broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took a short advantage in upper stretch,
remained on his inside lead until just inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up at that
juncture and held under strong urging. CAPE TRAFALGAR broke out and hit the gate, was well placed on the inside, came off the rail on the turn, was
driven four wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid inside the furlong marker, fought outside of the winner to the finish and was denied while clear for the
place. FRAT PACK bobbled at the start, went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage
to the winner in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show.
CARAMEL CHIP tracked the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, angled out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. TWELTH MAN settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, dropped to the rail outside the
quarter-pole and failed to rally. BAD TO THE BONES settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
came up empty. SIGNATOR was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
BOURBON BASH was forced out at the start, settled between foes early, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, went five wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BREW PUB moved out leaving the chute, raced at the rear, moved from three to five wide under urging on the
turn and was no factor. CAPTURE THE FLAG was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, dropped back in the four path on the
turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and faltered.

FAIR DINKUM four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive taking command a furlong from home, traded leans knocking heads to the finish with BEUYS and gamely prevailed at the end.
BEUYS (IRE) three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide from mid pack, steadily advanced coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to engage in head to head combat with the aforementioned foe trading leans to the finish
fighting on game but was ultimately bested at the finish. SHUTTERS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch attempting to lean out against a rival, then got bumped back inside by DRAKON holding his path near the
three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive behind a foe lacking optimal clearance until just inside the sixteenth marker, rallied on through late and missed at the
end. HILLIARD two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into
upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish but missed. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, offered up a mild kick. DRAKON forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, got leaned and bumped lightly by SHUTTERS attempting to lean out
straightened away and held his lane bumping that foe back inside in behind RUSE with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under a drive keeping on to the wire
but was outfinished in the late going. WHAT SAY THEE broke out brushing the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside from just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home, kept on under a drive getting outfinished in the late stages. RUSE established
the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive under challenge from a host of rivals and was collared just outside the eighth pole, dug in to the finish, one paced to the end. AL'S ROCKET got
brushed at the start by ALFIO breaking outwards awkward at the start, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing two to
three wide at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ALFIO broke out at the start awkwardly brushing AL'S ROCKET
and conceded four to five lengths to the front, raced three wide then two wide through the turn before chasing three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tipped four to five wide through the far turn placed to coaxing from the three-eighths, went four wide at the head of the stretch and trailed
throughout.
