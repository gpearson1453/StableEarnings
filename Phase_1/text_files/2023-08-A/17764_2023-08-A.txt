raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and made a late gain to improve position. IT'S MAGIC was void of early speed, saved ground and lacked a
rally. SWEET NELLIE was sent along the inside and gave way.

TIME HEIST rated along the inside, pass the quarter pole while continuing and inside, run, shifted five deep through the stretch run and finished well to set
up under strong handling. HURTS SO BAD pressed the early pace two deep from the outside of foe, had a clear lead near the eighth pole but couldn't hold
off the winner late in a game effort. RISKY BOY raced mid pack early on, raced three wide while being ridden along through the far turn and kept on willingly
to the wire. BORN AGAIN GEORGE dropped back off the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and moved up late to improve position.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY was off slowly, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. CINDY'S G MAN was sent along from the
inside to set the early pace and tired readily.

Footnotes
WICKED SUPRISE showed good early foot to set the early pace and held gamely to remain clear under steady pressure. MORRIE'S JOY dropped back off
the early going, made a good bid three wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch drive and closed in belatedly. GATE CREW was pulling
early along the inside under a strong hold, raced in a bit tight near the rail, ridden along through the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. EL RAYO
settled off the early going, moved up to race six wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. STORM'S REFLECTION settled to race mid pack
early on, raced two to three wide in the lane and was outfinished in the drive. MILLARD'S SMILE dropped to off the early going, raced near the inside
through the upper stretch, shifted five wide and raced evenly late with no closing run. MODIFIER dropped back off the early going, raced seven wide near
the three sixteenths pole and had no rally while racing from the outside. SLAVA UKRAINI stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide around the far
turn and weakened in the drive. FORWARD CURVE was forwardly placed to lay up close from the outside and gave way.

JACK SPRAT chased the early pace along the inside early, two to three wide around the far turn and edged up through the stretch run under a confident
hand ride. EXCITABLE BOY sprinted clear under a steady ride early on, raced near the inside and kept on to finish second best. HEDGEHOGINTHEFOG
chased the early pace along the inside and gained ground late while racing four wide. RED MOSCATO was off slowly, raced off the pace after the poor
start, was five to six deep in the drive and never threatened. POND was off slowly, coaxed along early from the back of the pack after the poor start, lost
ground and raced far back.

Footnotes
VIOLA raced mid pack early on, moved up five wide around the far turn, came in a bit near the sixteenth pole, finished strongly to edge clear under strong
handling. Jockey of Angel Express claimed foul against Viola, along with a stewards inquiry to review the stretch run for interference and stewards ruled no
change, deemed Short Straw came out near the sixteenth pole casing Angel Express to take up. RUTH OF JUDAH stalked the early pace, raced near the
rail and finished gamely to the wire. ANGEL EXPRESS chased the early pace from the outside, was forced to checked sharply between near the sixteenth
pole and kept on gamely to the wire. SHORT STRAW broke sharply to the outside, set the early pace, veered out near the sixteenth pole forcing Angel
Express to take up and weakened in the final stages. BONITA D'ORO dropped back early on, raced three to four wide into the upper stretch and had no late
rally. GOLD OAK was bumped at the break, raced four to three wide in the lane and never threatened. WILDWOOD ENOUGH was squeezed back at the
break and never was a factor. HER SPEAKER'S ON was void of early speed and never threatened.
