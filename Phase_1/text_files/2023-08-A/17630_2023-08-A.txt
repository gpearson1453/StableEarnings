Footnotes
FLASHIN ACES stalked the pacesetters from the four path, moved up overtaking the leader near the three-eighth marker, dueled inside of SILVERFOOT at
the head of the lane, and prevailed after a long hard drive. SILVERFOOT settled outside, moved up three wide in the far turn to challenge the front, dueled
outside of FLASHIN ACES under steady urging, kept on determinedly but was unable to get by. EL FANTASMA lugged out in close quarters then was
tangled up entering the backstretch, settled on the rail, and faded. STORMY SUMMIT showed the way through the backstretch was overtaken and was
done early.

Footnotes
DOC COPE sat in striking distance while five wide, advanced strongly outside into the final turn, dug in at the head of the stretch then edged away. SPOT
ON DUDE was under a snug hold then moved up alongside ABOVE AND BEYOND to overtake the lead, led the way into the final turn then weakened late
stretch. ABOVE AND BEYOND set the early pace, was overtaken into the far turn, rallied three to four wide entering the stretch, and missed. H K MELODY
sat just off the pacesetters, swung four wide leaving the last turn, lost his path and evened out. DUKE OF DEWINTON lacked early speed, brushed the rail
leaving the backstretch, and never reached contention.

PERPETUAL BLISS was carried out by THIS TIME SWEETIE in the backstretch, took back off the pacesetters nearing the far turn, tipped four wide
entering the lane, responded to handling then closed steadily and was along with time. STUBBORN LOVE attended the pace while four to five wide, moved
up alongside THIS TIME SWEETIE then overtook the lead, and was run down late stretch. VALENTINO ROSSA raced wide through the backstretch, gained
closer order into the final turn, and rallied late to get up for show. LILLY'S OF LONDON stalked from the rail, and lacked the rally needed. DRAMATIC
FLAIR was gapped early, made up ground in the final turn, and offered a late mild rally. THIS TIME SWEETIE leaned on PERPETUAL BLISS early in the
backstretch, contended the lead, and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
FROSTEDBIRD prompted the pace from just off the rail, drew clear entering the final turn, drifted out at the head of the stretch and held under pressure.
REMARKABLE ELI sat just off the pacesetters, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the quarter pole, lost his path then angled inside, lugged in late stretch,
and missed. CHESTER SLEW trailed while five wide, drove between foes at the five-sixteenth pole, was no match for the leaders in the stretch and finished
evenly. BODYMOOR HEATH unhurried early, moved up closer leaving the backstretch, lacked running room near the five-sixteenth pole, and lost interest.
SOMETHIN HAPPENIN offered little. CARRERA CABALLO fanned three-wide into the opening turn then set a pressured pace, was unable to move on with
rival, and faded steadily. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run of the race but made no change.

Footnotes
ARANY zipped to the front then cleared the field, saw margins diminish leaving the final turn, was under pressure through the stretch, and held on.
BEAUTIFUL CALL gave chase while wide in the backstretch, loomed boldly into the stretch, kept on determinedly, and missed. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL
jostled away, angled in leaving the backstretch, drove four wide then closed late for the show. VIOLET CITY reserved off the early pacesetter, lodged a rail
bid but yielded late stretch. BAKED N WIRED broke inward into LANA'S PRETTY GIRL, raced wide and gave way. SUNDROP never reached contention.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC vied inside for the early lead, sat just off the pace inside, moved up alongside ALL THAT GOLD into the far turn, was roused at the head of the
stretch, responded gamely to the challenger, and held firm. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR settled inside early, was asked to quicken heading into the final turn,
swung four-wide then rallied determinedly outside of LANNY MAC but could not get by. UPO lagged early, gained closer order then lacked a clear path
nearing the quarter pole, closed gradually inside, and got up just in time to score show. THE BEAT stalked five-wide through the backstretch, hung off the
final turn, and closed gamely but was narrowly denied. LONESOME CAT fanned four wide, and rallied belatedly. ALL THAT GOLD vied outside for the early
lead, set a pressured pace from the four path, was overtaken in the final turn, and gave way deep stretch. SIMMS chased outside, and tired early.

Footnotes
HYPERFOCUS sat in striking range while four wide, went in pursuit of the leader approaching the three-eighths pole, gained a slim advantage over GLAVA,
battled on under right-handed encouragement, came in during the late stages taking over GLAVA'S PATH then clipped heels in the final yards before the
wire. GLAVA pressed the pace while five wide, inherited the lead approaching the far turn, was joined at the quarter pole, responded to a challenge from
HYPERFOCUS, rallied determinedly inside then lost his path late clipping heels with HYPERFOCUS. QUINTO SOL settled midpack, angled to the rail
leaving the backstretch, moved up menacingly inside at the head of the lane but lacked the kick needed in the drive. SLAATS unhurried early, raced wide
through the backstretch, drove five wide into the lane, and flattened. DECOY stalked outside early, dropped back, and offered a late mild bid. MASKWECIS
tracked along the rail, lost ground in the far turn, and showed a mild interest late. GREEK GEEK trailed wide, chased through the final turn, and faded.
COUNTRIFIED saved to no avail. SOLO RING set a pressured pace while two to three wide, was through early then was eased and walked off.
STEWARDS INQUIRY, JOCKEY, and TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of GLAVA against the rider of HYPERFOCUS alleging
interference late stretch was upheld. HYPERFOCUS was disqualified and placed second for interference to GLAVA.
