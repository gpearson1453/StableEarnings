Footnotes
SOUND OF THE BEAST stalked the pace inside, was boxed in through the turn, bulled his way through and lightly bumped KING SKULL in upper stretch,
kicked in once in the clear, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. UNEQUIVOCALLY dueled two wide, won the duel in midstretch, led to
the sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit and settled for second best. KING SKULL stalked the pace three wide, was lightly bumped by the winner in upper stretch,
could not match strides with that foe and was up for the show in the final strides. MAXIMATCH dueled at the rail to midstretch and weakened. DR BAYTER
trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
VLADISLAV settled up close in the three path, bid between foes under a ride early around the far turn, took the lead while in the three path into the stretch,
bumped with an outer challenger nearing the eighth pole, but stayed on and held off another late closing foe in the closing stages. JOURNEYMAN was held
up between foes from the three path into the backstretch, tipped out to the four path under coaxing early into the far turn, was urged from the five path into
the stretch, and ran on for place. MEDIA SENSATION had an awkward start, tracked inside of rivals in the two path, was under a drive while angling out to
the seven path entering the lane, and kept on for show. YOU TALKIN TO ME stalked in the four path, ranged up to bid under rousing early around the far
turn, tipped inwards into the stretch and bumped with an inner foe nearing the eighth pole, then flattened. EXECUTIVE SEARCH set the pace in the two
path, but lost the lead midway around the far turn, and yielded into the stretch. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF JOURNEYMAN AGAINST
THE RIDER OF VLADISLAV FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

XY TIME set a rated pace inside and held firm under a drive. MANNIX (IRE) stalked the pace between foes, angled to the rail entering the far turn, tipped
back out near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner throughout the stretch run but was held at bay. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK raced in range two
wide, bid three deep rounding the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, lacked the needed rally and held well enough for the show. EUPHORIA
STAR raced off the pace two and three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. SWIFT KID saved ground off the pace, swung five wide
in upper stretch and was no menace. T VILLE prompted the pace three wide and tired in the drive. SUN VIKING stalked the pace from the rail, was shuffled
back entering the far turn and had no further bids. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SUN VIKING AGAINST MANNIX FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
R AWESOME SAUCE settled in range around the four path, was roused to bid early around the far turn, took the lead while drifting out to the eight path in
upper stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. I LOVE IRELAND was unhurried in the three path early, advanced from the four path around the far turn,
was cued approaching the quarter, swung out to the six path into the lane, and chased on for place. LTE STARK WINTER raced in midpack around the four
path, bid between foes from the two path rounding the far turn, drifted out around the six path in upper stretch, and evened out for show. SUBTLE
SENORITA rated inside, was driven from the rail into the far turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, but flattened. SHOW ME LOVE tracked in the
two path, bid from the rail under a drive around the far turn, but faded around the three path in the stretch. INSATIABLE EVA raced wellback in the two path,
was ridden from the rail around the far turn, but made no impact. BULLET VALENTINA laid off the pace in the four path, was between rivals entering the
stretch, but did not factor. HEART OF THE BEAST trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, but was no threat. HUGE G broke in at
the start, set the pace in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn, lost the lead between foes midway around the far turn, then clipped heels passing the
quarter, and was eased. MOON DREAMING stalked in the four path but backed up between foes early into the far turn. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE
RIDER OF HUGE G AGAINST THE RIDER OF R AWESOME SAUCE FOR INTERFERENCE PASSING THE QUARTER WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
AWESOME FLAY stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive.
REBELDE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn and rallied widest to gain a share of the place late.
POWER HUMOR raced up close between foes early, steadied near the half-mile pole, angled four wide early on the turn, re-bid outside of the winner
nearing the head of the lane, continued on the left lead in the stretch and lasted for a share of second. DIAMOND COOL chased the pace inside, tipped out
in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BORIS set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU broke
out and bumped REBELDE at the start and played no further factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
LOVE RHAPSODY set the pace in the two path, opened slightly while just off the rail rounding the turn, tipped out to the three path into the lane, began to
shorten stride in the final sixteenth but held on. MARILYN raced off the pace in the three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, fanned out to the
seven path into the stretch, rallied passing the eighth pole, and just missed getting up to finish with place. ONE SMOKIN' RITA prompted the pace in the
four path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. LILY OF WICKLOW chased in the four path, swung out to the six path
turning into the stretch, but was one paced. ALLONS tracked in the two path, received a pair of right handed cues along the rail turning into the lane, but
faded.

GEPARD set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in midstretch and held clear under a drive. GOTTA LIKE HIM saved ground
in range, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on to be clearly second best. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER chased the pace two wide, lacked the
needed rally but was along for the show. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY raced off the pace outside, went six wide around the turn, was bumped near the
five-sixteenths pole then rallied belatedly. WHEATSHEAF was off slow, raced five wide in midpack and finished evenly. JOYFUL SURPRISE failed to
menace while racing four wide. BOURBON THERAPY never threatened while racing four wide and was vanned off. LIEUTENANT STAN broke a bit
awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide, steadied into the turn and never threatened. COURAGEOUS COPPER prompted the winner in three path and
faltered in upper stretch. SEBARAY was outrun inside. TEJOTA steadied early, raced off the pace five wide, bumped near the five-sixteenths pole and had
no response. BLUE LIEUTENANT had only brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
COCO was unhurried in the three path around the first turn, advanced into range from the four path down the backside, bid under a nudge from the three
path into the far turn, took the lead passing the quarter, and kicked clear into the stretch. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL tracked in the three path, was put to a ride
early into the far turn, floated out to the seven path under urging into the lane, and chased on for place. MIDNIGHT BELLA raced off the pace in the two
path, was roused into the far turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and finished evenly for show. ALTERNATE ROCK stalked in the two path, was
roused early into the far turn, tipped out to the five path turning into the lane, but faded. CINDYLOUWHO rated in the three path but made no impact.
EMPRESS ELLIE was taken back along the inside rounding the first turn, asked for run going into the far turn, but was no factor. SWOONATRA set the
pace inside, was roused when challenged early around the far turn, but yielded down the stretch.

Footnotes
GITANA stalked along the rail, was roused while tipping out to bid from the three path turning into the stretch, took the lead just past the eighth pole, and
drew clear in the final sixteenth. KAEKO raced off the pace in the five path, was put to a ride in the four path early around the turn, went back out to the five
path entering the lane, and kept on for place. SOPHIA'S STORM chased in the four path, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on to get
up for show. GHOSTLY NIGHT set the pace in the three path, opened slightly from the two path around the turn, was cued into the stretch, but yielded late
to miss minor placings. AWESOME ANNMARIE turned her head as the gate opened and trailed in the two path, angled outside in upper stretch, but made
no impact. BARBARA travelled in range between rivals around the three path early, but backed up early into the turn. SANDPIPER MEMORIES prompted
the pace in the four path but weakened between foes turning into the stretch. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY
TO LOOK AT THE START OF AWESOME ANNMARIE.
