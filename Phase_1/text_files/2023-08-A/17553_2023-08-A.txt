SHACKLEFORD STRONG set a pressured pace to late stretch and drew off under urging. TWO WORLDS was crowded at the start, raced close to the
pace, rallied into the turn, bid three wide and closed steadily to get up late for place. WEST WARPATH vied between horses early, fell back, bid along the
rail on the turn, loomed a threat, hung late and was all out for show. ROGER MCQUEEN was pushed out at the start, pressed the pace to late stretch and
was unable to sustain his bid. MEDAL OF FACT showed good early speed, fell back, went widest in the drive and finished well. FIRST MASAMUNE was off
slowly, trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
KINGSBURY DREAM broke in and bumped at the start, was unhurried early and raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid four wide, dueled for the lead
and prevailed in a game effort. WANDA STRONG bumped, was squeezed and steadied at the start, raced mid pack, bid five wide leaving the turn, dueled
for the lead and was outnodded to just miss. I'M BOX OFFICE broke slowly, was unhurried early and trailed the field, advanced to the turn, bid inside, was
blocked in the upper stretch, angled out and closed well once clear. BLAZE BEAUTY set a pressured pace, swung wide into the stretch, tired and gave way.
I OWE UNCLE MO was never far back, raced outside, went five wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. FREE LOVE bumped and was crowded at the start,
stalked the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail and came up empty. VISIONISTA broke out and bumped at the start, pressed the pace two across to
the second turn and flattened out.

early, saved ground and offered a mild bid to improve position. OVERTHOUGHT raced outside and was not a factor. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER raced
