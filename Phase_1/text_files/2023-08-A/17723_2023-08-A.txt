LUCYS MAJOR MIRCLE went to the front to set the pace, was challenged at the quarter pole and battled in the stretch but dug in late to prevail. DOCS
CARO CAT was off the pace from three wide down the backstretch then moved up at the three furlong marker to engage the leader at the quarter pole and
battled down the stretch but lacked the late response and was second best. TIME TO SKIP TOWN prompted the pace to the half mile marker then fell back
around the turn, made a mild rail bid in the stretch to be the best of the rest. CENTAURUS saved ground down the backstretch then moved to two wide on
the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. HOLY MISSION raced four wide down the backstretch then tipped into three wide and moved up on the turn
but tired in the stretch.

REVIVAL tracked the leaders from off the rail then moved out to four wide at the half mile marked, moved up going around the turn while gaining
momentum, was three wide in upper stretch to run past the leaders and cruise home. BEDROCK went to a pressured lead and was headed at the quarter
pole but fought gamely to be second best. WHEELER DEALER hopped at the start then rushed up from three wide to vie for the lead through the turn and
tired. AVALON KING pressed the early pace from the inside to the half mile marker then dropped back.

SNUGGLE BUNNY stalked the pace down the backstretch then saved ground around the turn going three wide in upper stretch, ran down the leader to be
up in the final jump. LONG MAY SHE RUN co-led from the two path to the five sixteenths pole then inched away near the quarter pole and took a clear lead
at the three sixteenths but was nailed in the final jump. FLY FREE raced near the back on the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the turn but was
no match for the top two. I'M A TRUMPER was slightly unsettled in the gate before the start, then co-led to mid turn and tired. I'M GONE tracked the leaders
while saving ground but never made a bid. ROGUE MOON trailed the field and was outrun.

GEORGIANO went to a clear early lead in the first quarter then was challenged near the three furlong marked but inched away at mid turn and drew clear in
the stretch. HOT LIL MESS rushed up to prompt the pace from the two path but couldn't catch the leader and proved second best. REMARKABLE CHARM
trailed the field to the turn then made a rail bid on the turn and showed late effort in the stretch to be along for the show. DONNAS FINAL WORD was off the
pace on the inside and made a mild bid into the stretch but failed to menace. IMA FINAL DE BUY vied for the lead from three wide at the half mile marker
then slowly weakened. KALLINIKI raced near the back, went five wide around the turn but never made a bid. HIGH VALUE TARGET raced in the middle of
the pack through the turn then dropped back and was not a factor.
