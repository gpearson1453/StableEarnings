Footnotes
SPECIAL AFFAIR was off about two lengths slowly, advanced inside, briefly tipped two wide to pass a rival midway around the turn, angled back in soon
after, angled three leaving the three-sixteenths pole, kicked in, was up near the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. IRON SHIELD dueled two wide to the
sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner from there but won the duel to hold the place. KOZEM stalked the pace two wide, steadied near the
five-sixteenths pole, swung out in upper stretch but finished evenly for the show. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES bumped with UMBRAL at the start, raced off the
pace four wide, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. CROWN JAK dueled at the rail to midstretch and weakened. QUEEN HONESTY went
evenly while racing three wide. GRAN TRICXY failed to menace while racing five wide. LET'S GO PHILLY chased the pace four wide and came up empty in
the lane. NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT was outrun inside. UMBRAL was bumped at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
BIG BUCKSALOT broke well and set an open pace around the four path, tipped to the rail into the turn, was roused while extending his advantage turning
into the stretch, and was driven out. TAPINTOYOURBEER tracked inside, was roused early into the turn, shifted out to the three path into the lane, lugged
in passing the eighth pole, then drifted out thru the final furlong while chasing on for place. IL MALANDRINO raced wellback in the three path, was ridden
along in the two path rounding the turn, angled out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and was along for show. SHA TIN was nudged along while off
the pace in the five path but made no impact around the six path down the lane. DANLEY broke slowly and chased in the four path, but never threatened.
POSEIDONS MYTH stalked inside, tipped out to the three path into the turn, was put to a ride approaching the quarter, floated out to the seven path into the
stretch, but weakened.

PREEMPTION was off a bit slowly, sped to the front, set a clear pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, angled to the rail
near the eighth pole and lasted. ELISSA JOE raced in range four wide, continued on the left lead until the sixteenth pole, kicked in late and ran out of
ground. LUMINANT raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY was devoid of speed while

Footnotes
R HARPER ROSE set the pace in the two path, was put to a nudge along the inside passing the three eighths pole, received a right handed tap on the
shoulder passing the quarter, kicked away while in the two path entering the stretch, and was wrapped up late. HAUNTED chased in the five path, was cued
from the six path midway around the turn, urged from the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for place. ETRURIAN was prompted along in the three
path, driven from the four path into the lane, but evened out for show. DUKES GONNA TAPIT brushed the outer part of the gate leaving, raced off the pace
in the five path, tipped in to the two path early around the turn, but made no impact while back in the five path in the stretch. BREEZEY BELLA stalked in the
four path but faded turning into the lane. TIME MISS broke a step slow, raced wellback in the three path but never threatened. FUTURE FORTUNE always
trailed from the six to eight paths.

Footnotes
RAGING FURY stalked in the four path, was under urging midway around the turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, rallied into the final furlong, and
was up in the final strides. ARROGANCY prompted the pace in the three path, was cued from the four path while making a bid entering the stretch, ran on
to take the lead into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe in the final strides to place. PARALEGAL set the pace inside, was roused passing the
quarter, floated out to the three path while being challenged into the lane, lost the lead nearing the eighth pole, but kept on to hold show. HALON rated
inside, was put to a ride early into the turn, remained inside of rivals going into the stretch, and stayed on. PLAYING WITH FIRE was nudged along off the
pace in the two path, urged while tipping out to the five path into the stretch, and mildly gained. MANHATTAN BOY chased in the five path, floated out to the
seven path turning into the lane, and flattened. DIAMOND MESSA was hustled off the pace in the six path, shifted to the three path early into the turn, but
weakened in the stretch. EXPLOSIVE RUNNER trailed from out in the ten path into the turn and was no menace. EKATI KING was wellback in the eight
path early and never got involved.

Footnotes
COMMANDANT prompted the pace in the three path, was driven along while making a bid turning into the stretch, took the lead near the final sixteenth, and
inched clear. GRAND BEY chased in the two path, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch but was stymied passing the eighth pole, shifted back in to the
three path, and ran on between foes for place. VAMOS VIEJO set the pace in the two path, was coaxed from inside midway around the turn, stayed on in
upper stretch, began to fade in the final sixteenth but got the bob for show. BEGANINGREENPOINT tracked in the four path, swung out to the five path into
the stretch, finished evenly, but missed the show bob. INSPIRED MISCHIEF always trailed from the three to six paths.

Footnotes
BIG AND CLASSY had his head turned at the start, advanced in the two path, waited behind a wall of horses around the turn, angled in nearing the quarter
pole, cut the corner into the lane, took the lead inside of AVANT GLORY near the eighth pole and powered clear soon after. AVANT GLORY hit the starting
gate, advanced inside down the backstretch, took the lead at the rail nearing the three-eighths marker, edged clear, drifted into the two path turning for
home, was collared by the winner near the eighth pole, could not match strides with that foe but dug in to hold the place. BIG DADDY DAVE settled off the
early pace outside, launched a five wide bid around the far turn, had aim outside in upper stretch but flattened out. DOC AMSTER vied in the two path and
weakened in the stretch. NOBLE DRAMA trailed inside for six furlongs and passed tiring rivals. BLACK BELT had early speed three wide and tired after a
half. CAJUN'S MAGIC dueled three wide between foes and faltered after a half.

Footnotes
ALL CLASS set the pace inside, opened up under rousing approaching the quarter, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, and was driven out.
ATALANTA ALEXANDRA chased in the three path, moved up under a drive in the five path around the turn, and chased on down the lane for place.
BRODERIE raced off the pace in the five path, tipped into the four path rounding the turn, angled back out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for
show. TINKATWO hit the gate leaving, rated in the two path, cut the corner into the stretch, but was one paced. DREAMBIGORGOHOME broke out at the
start and trailed in the six path, angled in around the turn and was in the two path entering the lane, but could not factor. SILVIA V'S HEROES was wellback
in the six path and made no impact. DIGITAL TRADE tracked inside but began to fade from the three path entering the lane. TESHIMA stalked between
foes in the two path, but was empty turning into the stretch. MY CHUTZPAH vied for the lead in the three path but gaveway turning into the lane.
