Footnotes
BATTALION sprinted clear entering the backstretch, set the pace along the inner rail, was hooked leaving the far turn, dueled through the stretch and
determinedly prevailed. AMERICAN UNITY chased the leader down the backstretch, engaged that one leaving the far turn, dueled and just missed.
TIJUANA BRASS , three wide the first turn, saved ground on the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and finished evenly. PREFECT hugged the inner rail
around the far turn and lacked the needed late effort. STRONG HEADED , steadied behind horses approaching the first turn, raced near the inner rail
around the far turn, remained inside and failed to be a factor. MINT GAME , wide the far turn, lacked a rally. WICKED MAD chased the pace outside horses
down the backstretch and gave way in the stretch. FERMAT , steadied when pinched back soon after the break, raced inside horses most of the trip and
was no factor. TITRATE , wide the far turn, gave way. ANTIPOISON , sent out of the gate, steadied and was rated back entering the first turn and dropped
back leaving the backstretch. PER RULING ECM2023-127 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, BATTALION WAS DQ'D DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ILLUSION OF HOPE , well off the early pace while saving ground, gained under some coaxing to the inside of a rival leaving the five sixteenths, worked
outward for a clear run soon into the lane, closed determinedly under solid urging and engaged AWAY TO RETURN near the sixteenth pole, battled a bit
then took over late to prove best. AWAY TO RETURN took over between foes then secured the rail, set a pressured pace while under rating, spurted away
after being set down soon into the stretch, dug in when confronted a sixteenth out, dueled then gave way stubbornly. ONE LAS OLAS , off the pace while
outside the winner, swung five wide for the drive, straightened and rallied mildly to nab the show. CHEM MAJOR , away alertly, forced the pace outside
AWAY TO RETURN, came three wide for the drive, drifted in with pursuit in mid stretch and faded late. VICTORIAN RIVIERA stumbled badly at the break,
recovered and was angled off the inside to advance, chased the leaders three wide past the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit wider for the drive and
weakened very late. NEED A MARKER broke well and briefly led, drafted back off the leading pair and tracked inside, waited into the lane, steadied when in
tight in mid stretch, failed to kick on after recovering and faded late.

Footnotes
CHAT BLANC hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out for the drive, worked between horses in upper stretch, moved to the outside in mid stretch,
closed outside foes and was up approaching the finish. BELTANE chased the pace, moved up in the two path leaving the turn, bid for the lead in upper
stretch and finished gamely inside rivals. LEGENDARY PHANTOM , wide around the turn, challenged for the lead near the eighth pole, hung between the
top pair and his rider briefly eased up near the sixteenth pole. CLASSIC JOKE , bumped at the break, steadied in close quarters soon after the start, swung
wide leaving the turn, flattened out and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. WITHOUT PRETENCE raced between horses on the turn and failed to rally.
PURE REALIZATION bumped CLASSIC JOKE when bearing in at the break then was outrun. HOLD MY STETSON hugged the inner rail in a forward
position around the turn and weakened. BREAK THE CHAINS accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
CONSULTANT , brushed at the start, rated forwardly while saving ground, took closer order under patient handling past the five sixteenths, eased out soon
after and bid to engage BEYOND THE PALE from his outside, battled on near even terms past the three sixteenths, stayed on under right handed asks and
just got up between runners at the wire. BEYOND THE PALE broke inward and brushed a foe, corrected to take over and clear, set a slow and rated pace
towards the rail, was taken on by CONSULTANT entering the lane, battled valiantly holding a narrow advantage through the final furlong but was edged in
the final jumps. RICCIO , taken to rate off the pace, secured the inside into the first turn, checked when moving up behind rivals leaving the three eighths,
regrouped and swung five wide with momentum into the lane, straightened to make progress under a drive leaving mid stretch, wandered outward from
there and had his final lunge fall just short. NORTHERN TICK TOCK settled off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn, continued inside and moved up
past mid stretch, came out, switched to his correct lead in deep stretch and continued well between rivals. REEL WELL , in range and outside a rival early
on, gained three to four wide into the lane, pursued past mid stretch, moved up past the sixteenth pole then hung between foes. BONDED prompted the
pace outside the leader, was called upon three wide past the five sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
PARADISE PRIDE assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gradually drew out through the stretch while kept under urging. NEVER
CHANGE , rated along the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch, remained along the rail and rallied to gain the place. SICILIA MIKE , along the
inner rail around the first turn, was not a factor down the backstretch, swung to the five path turning for home and rallied outside foes. VELVET GHOST ,
three wide the first turn, chased the pace while three deep around the far turn and weakened in the drive. GRAN ANDREWS prompted the pace outside the
winner and weakened the final furlong. GALATIANS off awkwardly as his hind end dropped down at the break, trailed to the stretch and passed tired rivals
late. SAVOY , along the inner rail both turns, gave way. NORTHERN THUNDER was not a factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE JOSIE WALES broke inward and bumped with SMOKE N SIN, quickly corrected and set a rated pace two wide while handling some inside
pressure, held a clear lead being nursed along around the turn, responded when shaken up past the quarter pole, kept on resolutely under strong handling
through the final furlong and held firm. LOVE MAMI LOVE prompted the pace to the inside of the winner heading to the turn, came out and tracked three
wide into the lane, gave game chase from there and dug in to preserve the place. BANDONARUN broke a step slow, quickly recovered and showed a burst
to get a forward spot, raced three deep into the turn, shifted four wide wide for the drive, ranged up to loom a serious contender in mid stretch, switched over
to her left lead for a couple strides then kept on with interest. BAY STREET hopped at the break, was settled off the rail then dropped in leaving the far turn,
angled back out for the drive and continued with good effort to bridge the gap. GOLDEN CHARM , between runners nearing the turn, secured the inside
around the turn, chased into the stretch then faded in the final furlong. MAGIC IN THE PARK , off the pace, raced inside through the drive and had a mild
response. TEA ROSE , inside foes stalking into the turn, checked sharply and got out well wide soon after, came four to five wide for the drive and
weakened. SMOKE N SIN broke outward and bumped with the winner, dropped off the pace while saving ground and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
LA TRAVIESA , steadied in narrow quarters along the inner rail near the three eighths pole, swung outside in upper stretch, switched leads twice in the drive
and was up under urging. QUEEN OLLY (IRE) lacked speed, raced along the inner rail in upper stretch, altered course to the four path near the eighth pole
and rallied between horses. AWESOME JAZZ lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. GOLDEN HEART , slightly
off the inner rail around the turn, chased the pace and gave way. FAST LANI sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way. BITTY
BOSS lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and offered a late move. BRZINA , shuffled back leaving the backstretch, weakened. DIVA
READY was not a factor. NOBLE BELIEF was no factor. LOLA FLO , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
MAMA G'S WISH , bumped at the break, was confidently handled three wide tracking a contested pace, had her rider remain patient as the leader moved
clear leaving the far turn, ranged up within herself to challenge past the five sixteenths, took control when roused in upper stretch, spurted clear and held
firm under solid encouragement. CHARMING WAY , between runners leaving the far turn, advanced four wide under asking into the lane, kept grinding with
pursuit past the eighth pole, wandered outward through the final sixteenth but continued to steadily gain while saving the place. NORTHERN GLOW ,
bumped at the start, was taken to rate off the pace and behind a trio nearing the turn, came out to chase three wide between runners mid turn, shifted in
some for the drive, advanced between foes past the sixteenth pole and churned on. FLIRTATIOUS LASS broke outward and bumped with a rival, had
speed and vied two wide outside CUT FROM CLASS, shook clear leaving the far turn, was taken on approaching the five sixteenths, failed to quicken with
the winner past the three sixteenths then weakened through the final seventy yards. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO , stumbled at the break, recovered and moved
up to stalk towards the inside, was shuffled behind a tiring rival past the three eighths, angled out, came two to three wide for the drive and finished with
some interest. ITALIAN DRESSING steadied at the break, lagged back into and around the turn, angled out for the drive and offered a mild kick. MISS
GEORGIE lost ground four wide and faded. CUT FROM CLASS rushed up inside and took a short lead nearing the five eighths, sparred to the turn then
retreated.
