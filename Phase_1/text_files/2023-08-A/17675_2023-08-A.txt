Footnotes
RUNNING SMART was bumped at the start, then was unhurried early, was gaining ground throughout the turn from the three path, dug in gamely to
surpass the battling contenders down the lane and be up in the final strides. GRAY MIKE broke out and bumped rival at the start, then chased the pace
between rivals, inched away to duel with the pace setter throughout the turn then continued to battle for the lead down the lane and was best for second in
the end. RACING IN MY HEART chased the pace while two wide, then bid from the three path on the turn, split rivals in the early stretch to rally along the
rail in the final furlong and just missed the place prize in the end. STUDENT PRINCE chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the
turn then made a bid at the quarter pole but came up empty in the stretch. JACK D chased the pace while four wide, then moved up swiftly throughout the
turn while two wide to vie for the lead while three wide, was used up and weakened in late stretch. ST. CALVIN was sent to the early lead in the two path to
set the pace down the backstretch, then dueled with an outer rival at the top of the bend, was met with more contenders at the top of the stretch but could
not retain bid and tired in the end. SWITCHBACKJUSTICE pressed the pace early from the inside then stopped after the half and had no final bid.

Footnotes
BRUSTER JUSTICE battled for the lead between rivals in the three path, continued to bid throughout the turn while two wide, then pulled away to duel with
ZAPPINIT down the early stretch then kicked clear and was up in the final strides. ZAPPINIT vied for the lead while four wide and outside of rivals, remained
in contention with two inner rivals throughout the turn, then dueled with BRUSTER JUSTICE at the top of the stretch then was out kicked late and was
second best. SPOTONJUSTICE stalked the group of leaders while four wide, then was moving up on the turn to battle for the lead down the early stretch
then gave way late and was best for third place. BENNY'S LEGACY was unhurried early along the inside, then bid two to three wide on the turn to rally in
late stretch but it was to no success. FIERCE JUSTICE chased the pace while two wide into the turn, then rallied down the lane but came up empty in the
end. BONNE CHERE raced at the back of the pack while three wide, then came out six wide leaving the bend to bid evenly in the stretch. GOOD FOREVER
bumped outer foe at the start, then chased the pace from the inside, made bid on the turn from the two path and was no threat. SHOOTER JUSTICE vied
for the lead from the inside, was in a hard drive throughout the turn, was used up and tired in the stretch. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE vied for the lead early
while two wide and between rivals then was thru after the three eighths pole and flattened out. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY bumped foe at the start, then settled
back towards the back of the field and was no menace.

ROSARIO'S PRAYER stalked the pace inside, angled four wide on the turn, then drew off in the rail under slight urging. FLURR pressed the pace outside of
the leader, then was no match for the winner. A STAR FOR CORA stalked the pace in the three path, then gained the show late. KISS ME KATIE led inside,
then gave way in the early stretch. VIDEO PRINCESS was not a factor. LAST CHANCE DANCE stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid.
