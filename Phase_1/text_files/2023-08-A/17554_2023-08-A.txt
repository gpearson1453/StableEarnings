path, bid late but couldn't get to the winner. DESIGNED BY KITTEN was unrushed in the two path and rallied belatedly. JE SUIS BELLE led inside before
giving way in the stretch. EVERYOTHERWON was jostled at the start, raced in the four path, then had a mild late bid. MIA BABY raced in the four path with
no late bid. GIFT WRAPPED raced evenly, saving ground early and shifting three wide at the quarter pole. MONTGOMERY PARK pressed the pace
between foes, then gave way inside through the stretch. PRETTY ASSETS lost the path early, then had no bid. MOON OVER TUSCANY was jostled at the
start, stalked the early pace inside, then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
CORNINGSTONE was well rated on the backstretch while two wide, was under a steady hand ride throughout the far turn, then dug in gamely from the four
path in the early stretch to edge clear in the final furlong and be up at the wire to succeed. SASSY KATIE set the pace into the first turn, then lead the way
into the second turn, then battled to keep the lead with outer rivals at the top of the stretch, shook clear of those rivals but was caught in the end and was
best for second. RILEYS REDEMPTION tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then moved up to vie for the lead leaving the far turn, was in
a gamely rally down the home stretch and was best for show in the end. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch then
bid mildly on the far turn and needed more in the end. CRICKENBERGER raced in the middle of the field while three wide down the backstretch, then vied
for the lead at the top of the stretch, but could not retain bid and gave way in the end. ADDICTED TO LOVE settled in the two path at the back of the pack,
then rallied on the far turn and into the stretch to close too little too late. EKATI FLATTER raced while three wide towards the back of the field then made a
mild bid on the far turn from the two path but needed more in the end. CLOSER TOTHE TRUTH chased the pace at a moderate pace while two wide
throughout the first half then flattened out in the second half and had no final bid in the end. SHAKIN IT UP BABY raced towards the back of the pack along
the inside, then urged on the far turn to bid in the stretch and was no threat. CHIMES settled along the inside towards the back of the field then bid three
wide on the far turn and was no threat. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE settled along the inside and failed to rally. REDHOTJUSTICE settled in the two path and was
no factor.

pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, was clear briefly but then couldn't hold off the winner. CORONA GRANDE stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the
quarter pole, then faltered late. WIN ME OVER pressed the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn but yielded late. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE raced four
wide, then faded in the stretch. BAD BOY GEIST led in the two path before giving way in the stretch. SECRET RENDEZVOUS saved ground, bid at the
quarter pole but faltered in the stretch. J'S NAUGHTY BOY passed tired rivals. SECRETO DE AMORE was off awkwardly, then raced evenly. PAYNTER'S
CANVAS bobbled at the start. TAILLIGHTS was bumped at the start, was steadied on the first turn, stalked the pace inside, then gave way on the far turn.
