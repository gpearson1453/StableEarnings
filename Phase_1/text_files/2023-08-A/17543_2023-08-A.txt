Footnotes
AMERICAN BOUND stalked the pace looming outside the pacesetter from mid track in upper stretch surging late to win clear. LUNAR PRAYER broke
sharply to a clear lead hustling into upper stretch being engaged late from the outside proving no match. MOONLIGHT TANGO went evenly early cutting the
corner to vie from the rail in upper stretch continuing to respond late to finish well. MISS SHADY a step slow through the turn racing evenly down the lane as
no menace. BAY OF ANGELS was never involved racing six wide through the lane. CONSTITUTIONALIST played no factor. BLUE LILY fractious pre start
bucked at the break. DON'T LOOK UP was always outrun.
