FANTASTIC DAY dropped well back early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, angled to the inside leaving the three-sixteenths and finished fast to be up in
the final strides. PESO was reserved off the early pace, came two-wide entering the stretch, caught the leaders at the three-sixteenths pole, disputed the
issue from that point and just missed in a game effort. ALLEVA broke slowly to get away behind the field, moved up four-wide on the turn, caught the
leaders entering the stretch, disputed the issue from that point but wasn't able to stay with the top two late in a good try. A VIEW FROM ABOVE chased the
pace from along the inside, came three-wide into the stretch and weakened. NEW EVERY MORNING was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing
two-wide and tired. POLACCO set the pace for three furlongs, gave way when headed and was eased in the stretch.
