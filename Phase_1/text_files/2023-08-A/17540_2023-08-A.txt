NIKOLAOU tracked the early leaders from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path through the stretch proved best. GRAND GIZMO
set the pace and had a clear lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. RAGING BEAR was unhurried early, had a
mild gain on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. VITAL SIGNS stalked the early leader and was roused on the far turn
but faded through the stretch. STREET MAX was in range but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

MORE SAVVY set the pace, took command on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch drew off. DOODLE DANDY was well back and
closed the gap on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SAN NICOLA STAR was unhurried early and
roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. KOZY KAT stalked the early leader and was hustled along on the far
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. ROYAL CITY REIGN tracked the leaders from the inside but chased on the far turn and
from the three path at the top of the stretch was empty.

SENSIBLE PORTIONS showed speed from the outside and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and was kept to task. SYNCHROMESH was
unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and was up for place. DRAGON'S KEY tracked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the
the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ROCKLAND EXPRESS was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch finished evenly. UNBRIDLED INFERNO was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed
more. IRIE ISLAND MAN was off slow and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. ARTIE'S ALL IN was in touch and roused on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. DYNAMIC MISSION was off the pace, showed nothing and was never in contention.

CRAFTY CONQUEST was in range, a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. STRONG ENDING was off the pace,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. CORE was in touch, hustled along on the turn and from the four
path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SUMMER RETREAT set the pace and had the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and
gave way. MONEY MATTERS stalked the early leader and had a good position on the turn but weakened through the stretch. BIG TIME LOUIE was off
slow, showed nothing, was outdistanced and walked off.
