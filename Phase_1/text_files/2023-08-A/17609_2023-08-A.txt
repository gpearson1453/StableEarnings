Footnotes
SUMMERTIME BANDIT with the pace after breaking in good order, narrowly showed the way into the turn, dueled while closest to the inside into the
stretch, shook clear, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task. CHARLIE'S PEAK vied early while widest of the first flight up
the backstretch, dueled outside the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, fully extended to save the place. TUGBOAT
jostled at the start to be last away, moved up to race closest to the lead pack up the backstretch and into the turn, two path into the stretch, gaining for the
second spot while also not a threat to the winner late. MISS CHARLIE GRAS one paced, came three wide out of the turn, not enough late for the runner up
position. KNIGHTS SWORD vied early between the top two, fell back off that pair midway on the turn, went evenly through the stretch. BEYOND D'ORO
broke in, bumped inner rival, raced back, five wide exiting the turn, no bid. BE A BANDIT broke out, raced back off the pace, three to four wide into the
stretch, failed to produce a rally. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
RISKY PRIORITY last to leave, lagged well back off the busy first flight, continued to trail turn, shifted out a bit to be four wide into the lane, rallied well out in
the strip to be up in time. INFINITESIMAL moved up to vie four wide out of the chute, continued on the outside through the turn, put a head in front past the
furlong marker, led late, nipped at the wire. GOBOT with the pace for over a half three wide and between foes, fell back off the leader in upper stretch,
coming again late while dealing with some traffic. PARTY LITTLE BOY contest the issue up front out of the chute closest to the inside, held a slight
advantage through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, caved in the final furlong when headed by the winner. PEANUT N IKE vied up front in
the two path while between horses up the backstretch and into the turn, gave way midway on that bend and finished well back.

Footnotes
JUMPIN JUDY away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn in hand, extended that advantage into the stretch, held late while
being kept to task the final furlong. HIDDEN LOVE off the pace and the inside, lost some position in the turn, two path into the stretch, steadily closing the
gap on the winner while too late, edging clear for the place. KISS UPON A STAR within striking distance early outside, closest to the winner through the turn
and into the stretch, could do little with that one late, caught for the second spot. RUN AWAY SAMARI settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground
turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. CHUCHI went one paced three wide to also be found lacking any late energy. CHACHA
TO CATALINA broke in and slowly, void of speed for three furlongs, steered out for the drive, improved position when finding best stride too late.
REMEMBERIN RONALD broke back, four wide into the turn, improved a bit into the lane then flattened out some in the final furlong. MY NEW PALACE
pressured the winner in the early going from the outside, got out late turn, backed up. BLUERIDGEBALLERINA was finished after three furlongs. QUEEN'S
SOLDIER balked at loading, broke through the gate prior to start, reloaded, broke back, showed little.

Footnotes
HAIL THE CAT broke with the field, raced back off the pace and the inside, swept up to challenge four wide into the stretch, clear under a steady right
handed crop. SAMURAI'S GRANDSON in the second flight off the inside, roused three wide and behind the winner entering the stretch, had little for that
one late, clear of the rest. DREWNANIMOUS last away, trailed, staged some mild interest to finish best of the rest, no threat to the top two. VALLEY
MISCHIEF in the second flight, moved to challenge with the winner inside that one exiting the turn, chased, faltered in the final furlong to lose the show.
RED IDOL dueled up front along the inside, weakened. POP POP MIKE fell back to trail after the start, failed to menace. SPIRIT OF DREAMS dueled up
front for a half two path, shook clear by midway on the turn, stopped when headed by the winner entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MY LIL DUDE broke well, set or forced the pace off the inside into and through the turn, continued to duel the middle half, gained a slightly larger advantage
upper straight, slight drift past the furlong marker when surrounded by traffic, found more and dug in late to prevail in game fashion. CHILI RED settled off
the pace and the inside, came four wide for the drive, enjoyed a relatively clean trip to the wire unlike some of his counterparts to his inside, late bid, nod for
the place. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT forwardly placed toward the inside, covered up in traffic into the far turn, continued in traffic into the lane, waited, altered
course toward the inside inside the furlong marker, finished willingly but missed the place. HEY JACKSON in mid pack off the rail, between foes into the far
turn, behind considerable traffic into the lane, shifted outside past the furlong marker for room, finished well while too late. GHOST COWBOY broke in to
bother an inner rival, prompted the pace off the inside, remained in a striking position into the lane, was flat late while between horses at the wire. RUN ON
ACES back off the pace and the rail, closer through the second turn, caught up in an increasingly large group of horses into the lane, waited a furlong out,
continued in traffic and was in close quarters at the wire. ZIPPY TOGA broke back, devoid of speed for five furlongs, made a good gain along the inside
through the second turn, saw that advance stall when in a bit tight along the rail into the lane, traffic again with a furlong to run, not enough late while closest
to the inside of the lead group at the wire. BIG BROTHER lacked speed, continued back into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late interest.
SABERMAN broke on top, set or forced the pace along the inside, gave way in the drive. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE four wide into the first turn, tired from
those earlyt efforts. PRINCE SIMBA bothered and off slowly, sluggish, well back first turn, pulled up before a half, vanned off. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF QUIET AS MIDNIGHT AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
MAXIMUS FREEDOM broke sharp, cleared to the inside, shrugged off nearest pursuer turning for home, drew out under steady handling in promising
debut. SOUNDS LIKE POWER bumped at the break, in mid pack early, moved a bit closer four to five wide into the lane, up late for the place, not a serious
threat to the winner. SPINNING ACES reluctant to load, moved up steadily the opening quarter to press the winner through the turn from the outside, could
not keep up with that one through the lane, caught late for the place. BOBBY TWO SHOT'S broke back, lacked speed for a half, three wide into the lane,
improved position through and around traffic, no menace to the top three. JOE T back off the pace and the inside, in the two path out of the turn, also
improved by passing mostly tiring rivals. CAJUN CYCLONE in the second flight early, had little left for the stretch run while well off the inside. OTRA COSA
in mid pack backstretch, angled out when moving a bit closer three wide into the lane, flattened out the final furlong. CUNIMBUS bumped at the start, raced
in the main body for three furlongs, four wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. GUS'S DREAM WORLD broke well, raced forwardly and
inside for three furlongs, backed up through the stretch. JACK THE WHISTLE lacked speed outside, four wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick.
COTEAU RIDGE last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOSTON PAULETTE forwardly placed along the inside into and through the opening bend, continued to track while saving ground in the second flight up
the backstretch, advanced and challenged inside the leader second turn, kicked well clear through the lane under pressure. ELLA'S BABY settled off the
pace inside, continued back in the run up the backstretch, improved inside through the second bend, closest to the winner a furlong out, not a threat to that
one, edging clear for the runner up position. PAYTON'S INDIAN five wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, settled in the second flight outside the
winner, between foes into the lane, vied with the runner up past the furlong marker, outkicked by that one to the wire, clear of the rest. WA WA WEE WA
back off the pace and the inside, closer into the lane, went evenly to the finish. MIDNIGHT FAITH showed the way past the wire the first time, continued to
set the pace while off the inside, three wide when headed by the winner into the lane, weakened. LAST PENALTY broke in and steadied at the break, void
of speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. TOUCHING ACES made little impact from well off thepace. DREAMED I AM FAST broke to the
inside, lacked speed and was never involved. SWEETASBAILY forwardly placed early while between rivals, chased the middle portion then gave way.
ABBY DABBY pressed the issue early from the three path, fell back then stopped in the far turn, well back.

Footnotes
MANGUM away in good order, allowed the dueling leaders to go early off the inside, continued to stalk in the turn, ranged up on that pair three wide turning
for home, wore down the remaining speed with less than a furlong remaining and drove well clear. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN moved up to duel after the
start, alternated into and through the turn, edged away from the other speed in upper stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner a furlong out, no match,
clear 2nd. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. broke inward but alertly, set or forced the pace for a half closest to the inside, could not match strides with the runner up
in upper stretch while also proving no match for the winner the final furlong, well clear of the others. COHERE settled in the second flight outside, lacked a
response in the drive. SADIE'S LIGHT second ground inside, weakened through the stretch. CHEATIN CHARLIE last away, fell further back, was never
involved.

through the lane in holding the runner up safe. MIDNIGHT CROWN forwardly placed up the backstretch, moved up press the winner through the turn,
chased through the stretch, little progress on the winner, clearly second best. R T'S IRON MAN settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide for the drive,
finished up best of the rest. ANGOLA VACATION back off the pace, improved position into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. UNCLE CHAN forwardly
placed up the backstretch, fell back through the bend and also went one paced through the lane. INDEFENSIBLE TOWN last to leave, failed to menace in
lacking a bid. D'FESTIVE CAT fell back after breaking with the leaders, did not threaten. ALWAYS LEAVING remained always back. TYLER'S SENSATION
pressured the issue for a half, stopped in the turn, well beaten. PER LOUISIANA RULING 25215, ONE MORE SLEEP HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM
