Footnotes
PYLON broke alertly and pulled clear, vied on the turn, drifted out into the stretch but gamely held inside challenge safe. FIRST RULE pursued the
pacesetter three wide, slipped through inside into the stretch, loomed a threat but could get by the winner. SAPONARA prompted the pace three wide,
reached near even terms at the quarter pole then weakened. APACHE was urged close up between rivals, engaged the leader on the turn then faltered in
the stretch. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY dropped back after the start, chased inside and lacked a rally. KEFI broke a step slowly, rushed up inside then gave
way. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, PYLON HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

WILD ALEX pressed the pacesetter in hand, was urged through the turn, shook loose passing the eighth pole and lasted under steady urging. TAPORICAL
chased off the leaders inside then rallied making a gradual gain in the final furlong but failed to get up in time. CHICA CHUCK lacked speed outside, moved
very wide into stretch and rallied with good energy. LUIS ALBERTO raced within range three wide then began fading on the turn. HONEST ROGUE moved
quickly to the front inside, resisted when challenged by the winner, vied from the quarter pole to the eighth pole and gave way. LEE ALEJANDRO lagged far
behind and trailed throughout while never a factor.

NO SABE NADA stalked the pacesetters three wide, led at the five sixteenths pole then pulled away through the stretch under left then right handed urging.
HELIUM settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out rallying on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. IRISH CORK forced the pace in the two
path, dueled through final turn and weakened. MISCHIEF AFOOT lacked speed, advanced inside into the far turn, swung wide in the stretch but failed to
threaten. WISH FOR PEACE dropped back early inside and was never in contention. BERKS angled inside setting the pace, was collared by duo after half
a mile and gave way readily.

MO BILLS rated early, advanced inside, angled out on the final turn, hooked the pacesetter near midstretch and drew away under moderate pressure.
BLONDE SAMARITAN far behind early, rallied along inside down then backstretch then finished willingly to get up for the place late. RUGELACH set a clear
pace to the stretch with brisk fractions, was collared near midstretch and weakened. GRACEFUL UNION settled off the pace, moved very wide on the final
turn and failed to menace. PINK SUNSET dropped far behind and lacked a response. CHEZ SOLEIL close up inside early, engaged the pacesetter before
half a mile then quickly faltered on the final turn. IN HER CUPS flashed speed in the two path for half a mile and stopped.

ALPHA WHISKEY broke a step slowly and trailed to the stretch, swung very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and drew clear driving. BRIGHT
FORECAST pursued the pacesetter outside, rallied on the turn, continued willingly but was outfinished. TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE hustled to a clear
advantage before a quarter mile, led in the stretch then tired in the final furlong. THE GREAT GAZOO was eased back and to the outside into the far turn
and lacked a rally. GRAND MACALLAN showed early speed inside, chased the pacesetter and gave way.

SEVIER set the pace under rating in the two path, controlled the lead, drifted out badly through the stretch but continued gamely increasing advantage late.
MYSTERY MO settled along the inside, angled out rallying on the final turn, moved back in through the lane, loomed a threat but was outfinished.
BROTHER BRAD reserved just off the leader inside then flattened out in the stretch. MY DANNY BOY prompted the pace outside, went after the leader on
the final turn then faltered. SCOOP DAWG stumbled at the start, made a brief bid on the final turn then faded. AWARD NOMINATED moved close up

SUPER QUALITY dueled outside, took over at the three eighths pole, pulled away and remained safe while kept to his task. ANOTHER LULU lacked speed,
advanced inside, angled out rallying in the stretch with a slight gain. NOTION TO TAPIT trailed far behind then closed well with late energy inside. EDWARD
MADDEN was urged off the dueling leaders outside then flattened out in the stretch. JOKEMEISTER vied with the winner inside to the turn and faltered.
CALL ME MAESTRO outrun early, moved very wide on the turn and into the stretch while no factor. SOUTHERN LAD hustled off the dueling leaders in two
path early and gave way.
