Footnotes
GOOD STORY shifted in and moved forward inside on or just off the rail early on the turn racing in behind the leaders, moved out five wide coming past the
quarter pole, continued to drift out gradually throughout the lane and under steady urging and through a long drive edged past late. SKY BUY was
well-placed stalking the pace, went four wide on the turn moving to challenge and take the lead at the quarter pole, was in command in upper stretch, drifted
out just a bit, was outfinished but a clear second. AZTEC BAY was quick to the lead, set the pace racing off the rail in hand, faced outside pressure, was
overtaken about the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in the stretch, kept on evenly late. CELTIC WAR CRY was lightly bumped at the start, pursued from
outside four then three wide on the turn and off the leaders, moved to the rail at the top of the stretch, ran on inside for the minor award. VOODOO
PRIESTESS broke outwardly bumping that rival lightly then in turn bumped by that one, shifted to the rail and tracked from inside, dropped back passing the
seven-sixteenths, came out a bit for the drive, failed to rally. HEY RIRI exchanged light bumps on both sides at the start, raced between foes at the rear
early, came into upper stretch on the rail, altered out at the three-sixteenths as a rival came in front, failed to rally. MIDSUMMER STORM switched outside
the leader, moved forward to press that one from outside three deep coming past the five-eighths, began to lose ground on the turn, was guided out a bit
past the five-sixteenths, floated six wide into upper stretch, continued to weaken.

Footnotes
ANGEL ART bumped the inside rival at the start, settled off the pace, advanced inside into upper stretch, lacked room and had to tap on the brakes
momentarily, moved out near the furlong marker for room, found it between runners, shot through to the lead, dueled late and got the nod. GATITA SUAVE
broke well, dropped back in behind the leading trio heading up the backstretch, tracked near the rail, was in the two path coming into upper stretch needing
some room, came out a near the eighth pole, fought on but missed. YOOOU KNOW exchanged minor contact at the start, settled in behind shifting in two to
three wide heading to the turn, raced in behind mid-division, angled seven wide in upper stretch, gained steadily but needed more. MURPH was in just a bit
tight passing the half, eased back stalking from outside three wide, fanned five to six deep for the drive, ran on. ALEXIS'S STORM exchanged minor contact
at the start, contended from between runners into the turn racing two to three wide, struck a narrow brief lead near the furlong grounds, had no extra. SURE
CAN was bumped at the break but moved forward inside to the lead, set the pace facing outside pressure, gave way in the stretch. TRITONE GAL was
bumped into a rival and pinched back at the start, brought up the rear, swung seven wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. LADY MOSLER attended the
pace from outside, pressed four wide on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
MASAKADO was outsprinted early pursuing from mid-pack racing three wide into and on the turn, swung out five to six wide at the top of the stretch, struck
the lead in mid-stretch while drifting in, continued to drift in a bit while clear and held safe. UNDER THE OVERPASS was bumped at the break, outsprinted
early, ridden along at the back two to three wide coming to the three-eighths, came out seven wide at the top of the stretch with momentum, evened out
while drifting in and was only second best. PASSIONED was in just a bit tight at the start, lacked early speed, saved ground on the rail through the turn,
weaved a bit to advance past runners in mid-stretch and kicked on mildly. FORCE OF JUSTICE bobbled at the break then moved forward from between
runners and clear to force the pace, shifted in racing inside on the turn facing pressure, weakened in the stretch. SIR MASON bumped the outer rival at the
start, had good position just off then pressing the leaders from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, drew nearly even at the quarter pole, came up
empty in the stretch. UNCLE CHINITO broke well, was outpaced and consequently chased in behind racing off the rail in the two path, weakened and came
out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SWITZER stalked from outside, rallied three to four wide taking the lead in mid-stretch and fending off an outside challenger in the final sixteenth.
UPSIDEDOWN MAN pursued from mid-pack outside a rival two to three wide on the turn, swung out five to six wide turning into upper stretch, rallied
outside looming a threat while nearly even coming to the sixteenth pole but was turned away and only second best. SPEED WARNING stalked in behind in
range and off the rail, was kept down inside and in a bit tight into upper stretch by an outside rival, had room between coming near the furlong marker but
lacked the needed late kick. KING OF SONG sped clear, set the pace near the rail, yielded late. JACKSON ROAD came out a bit at the break, chased from
inside mid-pack, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch several paths, chased in behind, came out further late, missed the super. MIDNIGHT
CAT was bumped at the start, outpaced early, raced outside at the back two to three wide on the turn, failed to menace. PRACTICAL SENSE bumped a
rival at the start and slow into stride, failed to threaten. VICTIM OF THE NITE broke a step slowly and in a bit tight, raced at the back, swung seven to eight
wide into the stretch, drifted a bit, failed to rally.

Footnotes
VOODOO MAMA JUJU broke well but was allowed to settle into stride off the pace, advanced four wide and outside on the turn, ridden along from the
five-sixteenths, struck the lead just past the sixteenth pole and was thereupon taken in hand edging clear willingly. SOUTH PACIFIC forced the pace from
outside, moved clear two wide early on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, was overtaken late and no match. CHASING ARTEMIS was unhurried bringing
up the rear early, raced near the inside, swung six wide, ran on mildly for show honors. I HAVE COURAGE vied inside early, lost ground on the leader
entering the turn, kept on but needed more and lost third late. TOP MULE stalked in the clear off the leading pair and outside, advanced three wide on the
turn, asked for more past the five-sixteenths, flattened out in the stretch. SHAKE IT GIRL showed brief speed from between runners, dropped back off that
pair, failed to rally.

Footnotes
ANTIPOISON quickly moved clear, set the pace shadowed by outside rivals, saved ground on the turn, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging in
mid-stretch, turned back the nearest challenger and just held from two outside foes. MILITARY HOP settled off the pace, moved out from two to three then
four wide early on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep, rallied strongly and was gaining late but just missed. EKATI'S VERVE settled further back
racing outside, moved out on the turn from three to six wide, rallied seven wide and outside in the lane and just missed. ACE NINE NINE shadowed the
eventual winner from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, loomed a threat coming to the furlong grounds but kicked on evenly late. SAVOY was in
just a hair tight in the early going, raced in the back half of the field, rallied from just off the rail in the stretch to improve. GALLANT GOLD was up close
briefly in the early going, chased two to three wide mid-division through the turn, came out a bit in mid-stretch and ran on. MYSTIC LINK chased from inside,
made no late bid. MUCHACHO MACHO exchanged minor brushing early, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, had no rally and kicked on evenly.
MICE AND MEN pursued from outside three to four wide, drifted out a bit at the top of the stretch, faded. NORTHERN THUNDER got away a step slowly
and lacked any early speed, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CANADIAN GINGER broke outwardly just a bit, moved forward under some coaxing, stalked from outside, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, challenged the
leader in mid-stretch, began to edge past a sixteenth out and just held from a rallying foe. TRANSLATE was forced in a bit at the start, settled off the pace
racing in the two path into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch beginning to pick it up, drifted about some in the lane, was gaining late but missed.
GOLDEN CAN broke inwardly, quickly moved clear to set the pace, saved ground inside on the turn, was challenged in mid-stretch, overtaken near the
sixteenth pole but kept on gamely while being outkicked. LADY JEAN brushed the outer rival at the start, stalked outside foes mid-pack going three to four
wide on the turn, kept on evenly in the stretch. TRIKKI NIKKI stumbled then was brushed at the start, angled in early, saved ground on then just off the rail
through the turn, needed more. EXPECT OURS broke in just a bit, chased from between runners in the second flight, ran on. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL lacked
early speed despite encouragement, came out at the top of the stretch, failed to menace. PRAY FOR THE U S A was up close tracking inside, dropped
back and faded.

Footnotes
SMOOTH FLYIN MIKE tracked from inside, shifted five wide into the stretch, gained steadily, just got up in a head-bobbing finish. ON THE MARK switched
outside the leading pair stalking three wide into the turn, swept to the lead at the quarter pole, maintained a narrow lead, was re-engaged by an inside foe in
mid-stretch, dueled with that one then lost the nod to a rallying outside foe. THE KHOZAN ONE attended just off the leader, moved two wide to challenge,
kept on determinedly inside runners in the lane but missed. PARADISE VALLEY raced toward the back off the inside two to three wide on the turn, ran on
mildly. RUNNING RIVER moved quickly to the lead, set the pace inside, came up empty. CLASS ACTOR was outrun.

Footnotes
TRUE BLUE PEARL was in just a bit tight between runners early, shifted in and rated in behind the leaders racing two deep then nearer the rail, bided time
through the far turn, came out and found room between runners, split foes near the sixteenth and kicked clear. MARY JANE CHROME got away well and
went right to the front shifting in, set the pace inside facing some pressure, kept on once headed but needed more late. MOSALAH was taken back when in
a bit tight on the first turn, switched out, advanced willingly two to three wide between runners up the backstretch, stalked into the far turn just off the leaders
then moved move thoroughly three then four wide leaving that bend and taking the lead in upper stretch, flattened out late. RACING COLORS steadied
slightly in the early going then settled well back at the rear, made a rapid advance sweeping past foes five then six wide on the far turn, loomed a threat at
the top of the stretch, could not sustain the effort and flattened out. BACKSTREET GAL bobbled at the break but quickly recovered to get forward position in
pursuit of the leaders racing three wide and between into the first turn, dropped back, failed to rally. MISSAWLET pressed the pace two to three wide,
faltered and faded. POUNDING MUSIC moved forward from outside but caught four wide through the first turn stalking the leaders, was keen up the
backstretch, dropped back and faded.
