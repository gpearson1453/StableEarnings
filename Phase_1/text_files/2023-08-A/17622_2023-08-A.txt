TIME IS PRECIOUS raced close to the pace, angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed with a rush and got up in the final strides.
WILLSHERWONTSHE vied past the eighth pole, inched away, led to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was
boxed in early, angled out on the turn, bid between horses, finished well and was gaining late. TIZ MY HOUR vied along the inside, was checked on the
turn, fell back and continued willingly to the wire. THE TIME'S RIGHT pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled past the eighth pole
and was unable to sustain her bid. SHAKE RAG broke slowly, advanced outside to the turn, was crowded entering the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
MARKING'S MIRACLE pressed the pace while racing outside, rallied five wide on the turn to challenge, dueled through the stretch and proved best.
PRETTY PEPPY pressed the pace while racing between horses, rallied four wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game
effort. ARE YOU LISTENING got away well to set a pressured pace, inched away briefly on the turn, responded to duel past the sixteenth pole, faltered and
held for show. PERFECTLY PUNCTUAL was unhurried early, bid off the rail, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. PRINCESS KITTEN
pressed the pace, bid between horses in tight quarters leaving the turn, fell back and leveled off. KAYE moved up inside to vie, was steadied on the turn, fell
back, came again inside and hung. CANDY TRACK raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace. COUNCIL'S JAZEL was not a factor. MI
PRINCESA was crowded and steadied at the start, steadied again along the backstretch and outrun.

Footnotes
HALEY WHO dueled throughout and prevailed in a long drive. I GET STORMED was never far back, raced outside, challenged on the turn, dueled in tight
quarters, had the rider hit her rival with the whip and was outfinished in a game effort. MISS CONTINENTAL dueled throughout, was in tight while racing
between horses in the stretch, was hit by her rival's whip, steadied and fell back. SIMPERING SMILE pressed the pace between horses, bid inside on the
turn, loomed a threat and didn't have enough late. ROSES FOR SUZZETT contended early, pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and leveled off.
WESTLAND trailed the field, rallied six wide on the turn, swung wide and finished well. UNBRIDLED DIVA saved ground while racing mid pack, lacked a
stretch response and dropped back. DANIEL'S GIRL raced in close, fell back on the turn, angled out and gave way. ISLA JANE led early, fell back into the
turn, angled out, came again outside, was crowded, checked, stopped and was not urged thereafter. Following a stewards' inquiry, I GET STORMED was
disqualified and placed third for causing interference in late stretch.
