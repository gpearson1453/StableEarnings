Footnotes
MIGHT BEE SPEEDY prompted the pace at the start, was shuffled back a few positions outside with three furlongs to go, resurged three wide outside
midturn, loomed five wide turning for home, rallied down the stretch not switching leads to take control at the furlong marker and was inching away for the
win crossing the finish. EXTRACTION WILL took control from the beginning, opened up unchallenged on the turn, was collared outside by runners at the top
of the stretch, determinedly battled between at the eighth pole and won the nod for place in a gritty late effort. BODIE stalked on the rail near the rear in the
early going, was on hold behind foes inside running throughout the turn, slipped up the fence turning for home posing as the main threat but could not find
another gear in deep stretch to threaten and lost out in a tight photo for place at the wire. HALF TO RELOAD travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail
down the back straight, chased the loose frontrunner on the turn, was in the mix of things up front between horses at the top of the lane, path closed nearing
the sixteenth pole, shifted outside late and held for a minor role in the end. GUNGI settled between foes in midpack down the backstretch, was roused three
eighths from the line to go after the pacesetter, could not match strides with others on either side on the turn and made little impression driving to the wire.
ETHNIC SOUL was unhurried early trailing on the fence, could not keep up with others saving ground on the turn and passed a weary run in mid stretch.
DO THE GRIDDY stalked outside three deep in midfield down the backside, could not make up any ground on rivals running three wide outside through the
turn and had little to give in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ZANA attended the pace from between runners into the turn, dueled inside a foe but off the inside briefly in upper stretch, edged clear by mid-stretch, held
sway while being kept to the task. GOOD NEWS MONEY stalked from outside a couple back of the leaders, came into upper stretch four deep, loomed a
threat, ran on evenly late and got the place. COCO'S DREAM broke inwardly, stalked in behind the leaders racing on the rail then two wide through the turn,
gained momentum through upper- to mid-stretch, was in just a bit tight late running in behind the leader and missed place. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST got away
slowly, lacked early speed, swung out for the drive, passed tired rivals. NEOLITHIC NATION attended from outside pressing early then drawing even three
deep on the turn, was in contention to upper stretch, faded. SPEEDY N SMART set a pressured pace inside, began weakening three furlongs out, came out
in mid-stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
SACRED DANCER broke sharp from the outside to clear and take command on the rail at the half, dictated the pace unchallenged throughout the turn to
have a good lead at the top of the lane, began to shorten stride at the furlong marker, drifted out in the late stages but held safe by a diminishing narrow
margin at the wire. KNOW HOW (GB) tracked the loose frontrunner on the rail in midfield down the backside, took up the running on the fence to go after
the pacesetter midpoint on the turn, swung just outside in the three path gaining momentum at the top of the lane, was closing in with every stride but just
missed getting there in a photo at the finish. WINYAH BAY was allowed to settle inside trailing this compact field at the half mile marker, was coaxed for
more run with five sixteenths remaining on the rail, slipped up the fence turning for home and closed in mid stretch to be a non threatening third at the finish.
LIVIN ON LUV stalked outside three deep near the rear down the backstretch, was roused continuing three wide on the turn at the three eighths marker,
was in with a chance for a smaller share in the three path straightening out for the drive and was one paced to the wire settling for a minor role in the end.
MIMI'S GOLDEN RING hopped at the break spotting the field, recovered to track in hand outside at the half, could not quicken with rivals on either side in
midturn and faded in upper stretch.

SYSTEMATIC settled in behind the dueling pair up front and inside a rival but off the fence, travelled in the three then four path on the turn, took command
in upper stretch, extended the margin late while being kept to the task. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH broke just a bit awkwardly, settled at the back, came out six
wide turning into the stretch and full of momentum, loomed a threat coming to the furlong grounds but could not sustain the effort and just held place.
SWIRLING DANCER dueled inside, kept on in the lane but was no match for the winner and missed regaining the place. OLD SECRETS broke a step
slowly, raced at the rear two to three wide on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, ran on evenly. AMERICAN GAMBLE forced the pace racing outside a
rival and kept wide going three to four deep on the turn, weakened in the stretch. KERICS BEAUTY was urged at the break, chased briefly inside, dropped
back early on the turn, came out for the stretch run, failed to menace. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER chased while racing near the rail either on or just off it, faded
in the lane. QUIET MADDELENA stalked from outside the eventual winner racing up close and in range of the leaders four then five wide on the turn, came
up empty.

Footnotes
TARADAR cleared from the outside to lead on the rail into the first turn, was uncontested setting the pace down the backside, opened up some in upper
stretch and had enough in reserve to hold off the late challenger at the wire. BOKERMIN stalked near the rear between foes in the two path in the early
stages, started to pick up runners two wide at the quarter marker, split foes in mid stretch and was full of run late to make it interesting at the finish. A GAL
FOR T J tracked on the rail going in the first turn, was content watching the loose frontrunner down the back straight, was in tight on the fence with five
sixteenths to go, swung outside at the quarter pole and could not rally to pose a threat to the winner in the stretch. KITTEN'S BOY travelled in the middle of
the pack on the rail on the first turn and backstretch, was roused on the fence midpoint on the far turn, began to pick up the bit, was in with a chance inside
at the top of the lane but was one paced late and settled for a minor role at the finish. PHIL IN ECHO stalked outside three wide near the back on the first
turn, was roused splitting foes three furlongs from the prize, swung out in the six path for the drive to the wire and was willingly in the late stages of the race
gaining on rivals at the end. THY KINGDOM tracked just off the rail in the first turn, watched the top two down the backside, took closer order outside
midway on the final turn, shifted four wide to be in the hunt turning for home and levelled off in the last furlong. MAMBOINTHEFOREST stalked in midpack
in the early going, offered a brief run down the backside four deep at the the half until the three eighths marker and gave way at the top of the lane. MY
GIRL HOOTER was unhurried trailing on the rail in the first turn, continued to see the field down the back straight, was uninterest when roused on the far
turn and was not a factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
UPHILL DANCE bumped the inner rival at the break, forced the pace moving clear coming past the nine-sixteenths, raced near the inside into the turn, was
challenged again passing the five-sixteenths, turned back that rival past the quarter pole, was clear in upper stretch, held sway under steady hand-urging
late. SCORED brushed a rival at the start, settled in the second group tracking inside a rival but off the fence, moved from the two to three path late on the
turn coming four deep into upper stretch, chased the winner home in vain but was second best. MAGICAL TRICK broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground
inside, kept on in the drive. DYNAMIC STRIKE stalked from outside a rival in the second flight three to four wide through the turn, ran on evenly late.
DIFFERENT DRUM had some bumps from both sides at the start but went to the front showing brief speed contending for the early lead inside the eventual
winner, dropped back off that one about the nine-sixteenths, switched out and advanced again this time from outside, bid three deep past the
five-sixteenths, flattened out in the lane. RED ELEANOR raced off the pace lacking sufficient early speed despite some encouragement, went three wide
and inside a foe on the turn, swung out seven wide turning for home, ran evenly and made no bid. NIKITA'S GEM raced outside the aforementioned four
deep through the turn, was floated eight wide into upper stretch, ran evenly and made no bid. SPIRIT BEAR hit the gate and was in a bit tight at the start,
failed to menace while racing off the inside. TEXENSIS was never a threat racing near the inside.

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD hopped at the start, recovered to have a good position inside behind the top three leaders, waited on the rail through the turn, shifted out
three wide for the drive and wore down the game frontrunner in deep stretch for the win. ALICIA'S KID had a slim lead down the backstretch inside, set the
fractions narrowly up front on the turn, put away fellow speed rivals in upper stretch, braced for the late challenge from the winner in mid stretch and
stubbornly surrendered the lead at the seventy yard pole in a gritty performance. BLUE MAX was in tight between runners in the two path into the turn, was
taken back briefly at the three eighths marker, re-rallied inside at the quarter pole and put in a good late run to capture the show money. FORESTER'S
TURN hopped at the break, stalked near the rear in the beginning, rallied four wide picking up horses at the quarter pole, swung eight wide straightening out
for the drive and finished up gamely to the wire for a minor share. AL HEYBAY tracked four deep watch the front threesome at the half, was urged four wide
midway on the turn, was gaining on rivals swinging out seven wide for the drive and stalled outside in the final sixteenth. STORMY SOUL prompted three
wide in the early going, was nudged to keep up with horses three wide midpoint on the turn, offered little response and gave way between in the six path in
upper stretch. MIDNIGHT MEADOW tracked the front three five deep down the backside, made little gain on rivals five wide outside foes on the turn and
angled out widest in the nine path for the drive but could not get involved to the wire. TALL WATER leapt up at the start, trailing down the back straight,
caught up to the field running on the fence at the three furlong marker and yielded on the rail in mid stretch. STRIKING HEIR pressed in the two path
between foes down the backside, continued to force the pace on the turn, was in range five wide at the top of the lane and tired between runners at the
furlong marker.

Footnotes
CURLIN CANDY was well-placed tracking inside, moved out passing the three-eighths, came into upper stretch four to five wide, bid at the furlong marker
taking a narrow lead, got the nod. BORN TO BOOGIE was in tight quarters on heels and between runners in the early going, raced toward the back two to
three wide into the turn, cut the corner shifting to the rail past the five-sixteenths, bid inside coming to the sixteenth pole, missed. FIRING BULLETS was
urged at the start but lacking sufficient early speed, saved ground inside on the turn gradually taking closer order, was guided out a bit at the top of the
stretch and under stout urging, moved out further in mid-stretch, showed late interest. INDIAN MUSIC quickly moved clear, set the pace racing off the rail,
weakened in the stretch. HELLO FRIENDS settled mid-pack racing between runners about three wide, came out a bit in the stretch, ran on. MITZI was
lightly bumped at the start, raced just back of mid-pack going four to five wide on the turn, floated eight deep into upper stretch, needed more. MY SUNNY
VALENTINE bobbled slightly into a foe at the start, raced at the back going three to four wide on the turn, came out through the stretch and needed more.
GOGO SHOES settled off the leaders racing outside runners four to five wide on the turn and closer to the leader at that junction, fanned six to seven wide
into upper stretch, faded. BIG GINGER was up close stalking three to four wide on the turn and between runners, faded.

OUTLAW KID had a good spot on the rail watching the top three at the half, slipped up the fence at the quarter pole, shifted outside three wide for the drive
to the wire and wore the frontrunner in the final few jumps. SILENT RESERVE took command down the back straight, opened up on his chasers through the
turn, continued to run on in upper stretch, began to shorten stride drifting outwards at the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly nearing the wire.
MASON'S GAMBLE stalked in the two path near the back of the pack between runners in the beginning, followed the path set by the winner inside with five
sixteenths to go, continued up the fence for the stretch run, was gaining on the leaders late but could get there in time and settled for a clear third in the end.
WARP RIDE settled in midpack three deep, kept pace with the leaders outside running three wide, angled out in the six path straightening out for the drive
and closed to get up for a minor share at the finish. ROCKCREST tracked the top two outside down the backside, rallied three wide outside foes two
furlongs from home, was in the hunt in the five path at the top of the lane and stalled in deep stretch. AIM FOR THE SKY prompted the pace on the rail in
the early going, chased the loose frontrunner through the turn, gave way between horses at the quarter pole and faded in mid stretch. FORESTER'S
FORTUNE showed no early speed trailing inside down the backstretch, was checked mildly on the fence midpoint on the turn, swing outside in the five path
at the furlong marker but made little presence to the finish. SILENT RUNNER stalked four deep outside horses down the backside, could not match strides
with rivals three wide on the turn, was steadied briefly at the furlong marker and was not a factor at the wire. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL#1 FORESTERS

Footnotes
CARA CARA had forward position pressing inside keen to go on, was eased back off the leading pair about the seven-sixteenths, guided out past the
five-sixteenths and niggled along, came into upper stretch four wide, was in command by the eighth pole, drew clear. SOCIETY'S KAT settled mid-division
inside, was off the rail on the turn, shifted five wide leaving that bend, ran on to get the place but no threat to the winner. GAMBLE'S ORB pressed the pace
two to three wide heading into the turn, drew even at the five-sixteenths, took the lead at the quarter pole, was no match and lost place late. SPRING HIGH
settled outside at the back, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, came in through the stretch, ran on mildly. GIVE ME THE BOOTS set the pace
two wide facing pressure inside and out early, weakened. VELIKIY chased two to three wide, faded. RIFLING shifted in, saved ground through the turn
racing at the back, failed to menace.

Footnotes
GRACE ON THE GREEN was unhurried near the back of the pack in the beginning, started to pick up horses in hand splitting rivals at the three furlong
marker, angled out widest for clear run in lane nine at the top of the stretch, took control with three sixteenths to go and gamely held off the closer late for
the victory. KANTBACKOFF was nestled behind the leaders on the rail at the half mile marker, waited to pounce on the fence with five sixteenths from the
line, had clear running room in mid stretch, bullied her way through and finished strongly surging late just missing getting up at the wire. BIJOU BABY had a
good spot tracking the top three down the backside, took closer order to the front three wide at the half, straightening out for the drive was four wide in with a
chance if good enough, could not match strides with the top two finishers but won the show battle in the end. JULIE'S MIST settled in midfield down the
backstretch, tracked in the second flight three wide, was looking for a path five deep at the top of the stretch and showed late energy toget up for a small
share at the finish. WAR VOW to this field on the rail down the back straight, chased the pace inside at the half, was back up the front when collared turning
for home at the quarter pole by numerous rivals, battled stubbornly until the eighth pole inside and stalled late. MARDENE travelled in midpack six deep
down the backstretch, advanced around runners four to five wide on the turn, angled out to be in range of the leaders in the eight path at the top of the
stretch but levelled out at the furlong marker making little impression late. DREAMS AND SCHEMES trailed on the rail down the backside, saved ground
near the rear on the turn, was nudged for more inside at the top of the lane behind a wall of runners, swung out eight wide at the furlong marker for clear
running room and finished evenly to the wire. ELLA FRANCES tracked four wide down the backstretch, rallied four wide to bid upfront with three furlongs to
the finish outside rivals, poked her head in front briefly turning for home and yielded in the final furlong. BRIEF stalked three deep near the back in the early
stages, could see the field four wide with three eighths remaining, angled out eight wide for the drive and could not get involved running to the wire. I'M
PHANTOM pressed three wide in the early going, had a narrow advantage at the half, was involved in a four way battle in the three path between foes at the
quarter marker and tired at the furlong pole. TAPPING A RHYTHM prompted between horses in the two path down the backside, could not maintain position
running on the turn, was shuffled back seeing the field at the top of the lane and could not offer a stretch run.
