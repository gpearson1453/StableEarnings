Footnotes
SMOOCHINWITHCINDY rated close off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead approaching the five sixteenths, drew clear
midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground racing well back on the opening turn then eased out
with a bid entering the backstretch, steadily improved from that point, raced in the four path on the far turn but had to settle for second. DASHING LASS
saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. LINDA'S TAJ
tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, was met approaching the five sixteenths and dueled close to
the mid point of the far turn, then weakened. EMBRACEABLE broke a step slow, raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. IMAGINE RITA saved ground into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ALL THE ENVY rounded the first turn about
the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed no response and was eased the final quarter.

Footnotes
HAPPY CHAMP was shuffled back early and rounded the first turn about the five path, stalked from the seven eighths pole then took the nod approaching
the three quarter pole, was urged clear at the three eighths, widened at the rail on the far turn then steadily handled in the lane. LOKOYA ROAD was
bumped leaving the gate then settled in the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path,
dueled through the stretch and held on in the duel for second. ROCKY DICE veered outward leaving the gate and made contact with Lokoya Road then
saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
ROYAL CRUSADER rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out in
the upper stretch and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening. JASONTAKESLONG rated a slim early lead, was met toward the three quarter pole and
stalked from that point, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LADDIE LIAM was jostled
leaving the gate and never factored. FIVE STAR PHIL settled just off the pace and off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into
the far turn.

Footnotes
REMYS SHOWTIME raced with the pace while alternating the lead with THEWITCHISGONE, dueled that one leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a
close disadvantage two deep through the far turn, but dug in determinedly to edge ahead later yards. The latter raced with the pace inside while alternating
the lead with Remys Showtime, dueled leaving the three eighths pole and contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely leaving the turn
but reluctantly ceded later yards. LEG UP bobbled at the break then stalked from the three path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn then flattened later yards. MISS YOU AJAX settled off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and passed a rival in the lane. TIMMY rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and weakened in the lane. ICE COLD FROSTY rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded
in the four path of the far turn. RUN TO DAYLIGHT rounded the opening turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
GRANDY was hustled to the front approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the rail on the turn, was met leaving the turn but
dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over WYSOQUIET, who pressured the pace from the three eighths pole, drew to even terms two deep into the
lane but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. CHRISTOPHER'SHEART gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and
ran evenly in the stretch. TAKE YOUR TIME had a brief early lead then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path but flattened later yards. RACING
HOT LINE gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SOUL CATCHER broke a step slow then gave chase inside, raced at
the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. CANDY FOR JUBA chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened stride.
ALEXANDER GRADY gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and flattened in the lane. GREATEST NOTION was unprepared at the start and broke
in the air. DIRECT PROOF saved ground.

Footnotes
I'LLTAKECAREOFIT took over shortly after the start and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and held well with steady stretch handling. TREASURER saved ground just off the early pace, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn but flattened stride late yards. I'M THE MONEY MAN raced off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out leaving the turn and finished well to take third the final strides.
O'RIGSBY rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well.
VAGABOND VIRGIN stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, then flattened
in the lane. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and showed little more. JAZZ WITH DENIS tapered in and stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, stayed in
range of the lead in the three path on the far turn but weakened in the lane. ALDRINALINE raced well back in the four path the opening turn, left the turn
outside and showed little response. RED HOT TODDY rounded the first turn in the six path and never factored. OFFICER STONE saved ground early and
never factored.

Footnotes
COWGIRL ATTITUDE pressured the early pace then dropped back approaching the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride and took the lead two deep
midway on the turn and was kept alert through the lane. ELLIES AT WINDSOR became fractious in the gate then gave chase through the backstretch,
entered the turn near the rail, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and dug in to take second the final yards. POWER SONDE gave chase
outside, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and took the nod for third under the wire. PATTI BLUE EYES ducked out leaving the gate then gave
chase, raced in the four path on the turn, though flattened late yards. IT'S A REAL HONOR was bumped then pinched back at the break, gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. I SHALLBE RELEASED ducked in leaving the gate then gave chase,
raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. ABUNDANT STORY gave chase outside and never factored. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE gave
chase to no avail. CAT WITH A NOTION was bumped outward and into It's A Real Honor leaving the gate, set a pressured early pace and drew clear
approaching the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway on the turn and gave way from that point.
