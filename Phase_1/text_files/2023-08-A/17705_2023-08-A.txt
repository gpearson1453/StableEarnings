Footnotes
ACE OF CLUBS broke out and bumped BOWTIE BOYS, chased off the inside early, took aim two wide into the lane, drew alongside the runner-up in deep
stretch and drove past. ELIGIO dueled for the lead from inside, inched clear around the turn, showed the way into the final sixteenth and could not fend off
the winner. ALWAYS ON CAY shifted in early and corrected before going between foes to challenge for the lead, dueled outside ELIGIO into and around
the turn, lost touch with that rival three wide leaving the bend, weakened in the final furlong and saved the show. THOMPSON raced up close outside the
top pair early, chased three then four wide around the turn and flattened in the lane. BOWTIE BOYS took a bump from inside at the start, coaxed along
early in mid-pack, went three wide into the turn, exited five wide and lacked the needed response. RINGTONE sat off the pace from inside, tipped out and
came three wide into the lane and failed to menace. READY TO STORM chased three wide into the turn, four wide into the drive and came up empty.

DOUBLE JAB rated in a stalking position on the inside early, tipped two wide around the bend, reached the front with a furlong remaining, kicked clear
shortly after and won going away. GRAND TIGER set the pace under pressure early, cleared along the inside around the bend, relinquished the lead at the
eighth pole and stayed on to hold the place. GRAZED stalked outside a rival into the turn, was caught behind LORD TRIPPING around the bend and altered
to the inside, kept on through the lane but could only earn the show honors. GIANOLA chased along the inside out of range, cut the corner into the stretch
and improved position. LORD TRIPPING prompted the pace from outside early, failed to stay with the leader around the bend, chased three wide into the
drive and flattened out. BLACK AS MY HEART traveled four deep near the back into and around the bend and failed to threaten. TOPPERS WAGER
chased between rivals in the two path off the pace and proved no menace. GHOSTLY ACT raced three deep into and around the turn and could not

Footnotes
LEMON SUSHI stalked up the backstretch, bid outside the leader at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over around the turn, moved over to the inside while
dueling with SAULS CALL past the quarter pole, cleared into the stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and lasted over the late bid from the
runner-up. SUPER CHIEF raced up close on the inside, tipped two wide on the turn, launched a late bid in deep stretch and missed. WINDRIBBON tracked
from inside early, found traffic briefly behind GOLDENSUNRISE at the quarter pole, altered out to the two path and finished willingly down the lane for a
clear third. BIG HAND chased widest up the backstretch, navigated the turn four to five wide and could not rally in the furlong grounds. SEATTLE
BREAKOUT climbed early and dropped back, trailed into the turn, came six wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally. SAULS CALL chased four wide
into the turn, launched a bid from outside around the bend but could not stay with the winner late on the turn, entered the stretch three wide and weakened.
HANDSOME GARY dropped back early, raced along the rail on the turn, tipped three wide outside a pair of rivals entering the stretch and could not rally.
GOLF DRAMA forwardly placed three deep into the turn, remained three wide to the stretch and flattened. MYSTIC FLYER chased three deep into the turn,
got bumped by inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, eased out and came five wide into the stretch and could not rally. WHAT AN IDEA raced in range early
then started to climb and lost ground, drifted out into rival and steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, lost positions around the bend after and had little left
for the drive. GOLDENSUNRISE stumbled at the start then recovered and went up to take control early, was challenged from outside at the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost command with three furlongs remaining and retreated.

Footnotes
PRANCINGTHRUPARIS away quickly from outside to take control but was soon confronted by O MANDY from inside, lost command leaving the
backstretch but fought back through the turn, regained control entering the stretch, cleared inner rival with a furlong remaining and held late.
RUNAMILEINMYSHOES got forced in leaving the gate and lost ground, moved into range along the inside up the backstretch, traveled on the inside to two
wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and put in a late bid but could not get by. O MANDY was off a bit slow and inward to begin then went up to
duel with the winner from inside, took over nearing the turn, battled around the bend but relinquished the lead turning for home, lost touch with the winner at
the eighth pole but stayed on to the wire. ASADA FRIES was off slow to begin, sat off the pace then angled to the inside for the turn, saved ground to the
stretch, then came with a belated rally to pick up a minor share. SMOOVE OVER became fractious in the gate, hustled from the gate then had to pause
when the leader crossed over into her path, chased from out of range two wide into the turn, angled to the inside around the bend, steered out in the drive
and kept on while unable to threaten. LONGHORN LASSIE raced up close early then drifted out near the half-mile pole, drifted out again on the turn and
weakened. RUBY'S HOME broke a step slow and was green early while losing her path, trailed into and around the turn and failed to menace.

LORD PRANCEALOT sped clear and crossed over, felt some pressure from outside on the turn before clearing again past the quarter pole, put to right
handed urging and held over the late bid from LAST CALL LONDON in the closing moments. LAST CALL LONDON broke a step slow and lost hist path at
the start, climbed a bit then settled into stride and started to gain along the fence up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, moved off the fence in
the drive, challenged the winner from outside late but ran out of time. MICI'S EXPRESS dropped back early, went two wide into the turn, advanced while
easing further out and came four wide into the stretch, closed well in the final furlong and gained the show. REFOCUS stalked the leader inside a rival to the
turn, put in a mild bid from outside around the bend but failed to keep up with LORD PRANCEALOT past the quarter pole, continued within range entering
the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. WILD JEWELS chased widest up the backstretch, went seven wide into the
turn, moved into the four path around the bend and could not rally. SHADY APPEAL stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, traveled three deep around the
turn, took an awkward step entering the stretch and faded out of contention. SMOKEM EZ came away slow, chased five wide into the turn, lost ground
around the bend and came three wide into the stretch and weakened. SALSATION tracked six wide into the turn, was forced to check near the
five-sixteenths pole, moved in and exited the three wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
INNER BEAUTY (IRE) dueled for the lead from inside then took control around the clubhouse turn, cleared at the five-eighths pole, showed the way to the
top of the stretch, continued clear into deep stretch and was able to hold on over late charging rivals. ABHITA broke a step slow, settled inside, looked to
start a rally leaving the far turn but got put in a bit tight, gained a clear path and moved out in the lane, tried to split foes and bumped with outer rival at the
sixteenth pole, surged late and missed. DOLLY MAY (IRE) tracked on the inside, two wide on the far turn, closed through the lane and got bumped by
ABHITA at the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. DOWNBURST stalked the pace from inside, roused late on the far turn, tipped out in the
stretch to take aim at the winner, altered in late and got outfinished. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) broke a bit slow, pulled hard early between rivals, got
boxed in on the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SHEZMISBEHAVING broke a step slow, trailed on the inside into the first turn,
continued at the rear three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. GOLDEN TEMPER stalked in the two path, three deep with a quarter mile left to run
and lacked a response when called upon. ASPIRATIONAL settled three deep early, traveled four deep on the far turn, five wide into the stretch and came
up empty. ILA VEIW TOO dueled for the lead from outside into the first turn, ceded command around the bend then took a stalking position in the middle
stages, coaxed around the far turn in the two path and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
ALL THE KING'S MEN bumped leaving the gate, stalked four deep early, bid four then three wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, dueled with BIG
GUN in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. BIG GUN closest in pursuit from the two path, lost positions and came under ride on the far turn, cut the
corner into the stretch, challenged inside rivals at the eighth pole, battled with ALL THE KING'S MEN to the wire and could not get by. LEN'S LUCK raced
two wide near the back early on, rounded the far turn three wide, summoned a mild rally and was along for the show. MONTANA chased three deep early,
between foes into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and could not find the needed late kick in the final furlong and got edged for the show.
BUFFETT stepped to the front from inside, led two to three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. COMMISSIONER H bobbled
leaving the gate, settled inside and failed to rally. RIPPIN' RUIS (AUS) bumped with outer rival then steadied shortly after, got bumped between rivals five
wide into the first turn, chased two wide off the pace into the stretch and lacked a rally. ICE STORM drifted out to bother rivals entering the first turn,
remained off the inside up the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide and came up empty. L L L COOL rated in the two path early, chased in
range up the backstretch, dropped back under asking on the far turn and tired. AMERICAN EMPIRE was off a bit slow from outside, got bumped entering
the first turn six wide, remained wide to the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and proved no menace.
