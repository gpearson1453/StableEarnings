Footnotes
Z FIRST reserved in the early going to race between horses in the second flight through the turn, tipped out to the three path at the head of the lane and
drew clear down the stretch convincingly. BAHAMIAN MOON unhurried from the start, settled near the rear of the field, commenced a rally mid-turn, worked
through traffic down the stretch while finding her best stride late to be up for the place. LADY IN HEELS pressed the pace through the turn, took the lead
briefly in upper stretch and kept-on willingly through the drive. TREVESS tracked the pace from three wide while hard held and lacked a closing kick when
called upon. BEACH HOUSE sped to the lead away from the gate while under constant pressure and weakened in mid-stretch. OUR STRONG VOWS slow
early to be at the rear of the field and made a mild bid in deep stretch. TRANSLATE raced off the pace near the back of the pack and showed late interest.
SMOOTH PEBBLE well placed along the fence to be in striking distance late in the turn and lacked a response for the drive. MOOR STRENGTH stalked the
pace from four wide to mid turn and flattened out.

Footnotes
MO FOX GIVIN was rated along three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then dropped to the inside entering the lane, then was given
one pop left handed with the crop, shied and drifted out, then was straightened and remained clear to the wire wile being ridden out to the wire, green.
LIAM'S MESSAGE was settled early, made a three wide move on the far turn to move into striking contention, but flattened out, held place award.
SURPRENANT COCCA was off slowly, settled in the back early, made a four wide advanced by the quarter pole, then finished willingly to just miss the
place award. YATTA tracked the pace along the inside, shuffled back on the turn, shifted off the inside and came four wide into the lane and had a belated
rally. BEYOND OSCAR was hard held early, between rivals by the half mile marker, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. THE MYTH set the
pace on the inside and was headed by the winner on the turn and weakened. COTINGA was reserved early and lacked a serious rally. SPIRIT IN THE
MIST (FR) was settled back early and failed to menace. DOOBLAY stalked the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the backstretch and dropped to
the inside entering the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BILOXI BLUES settled in hand in the clear while racing mid-pack early, split rivals two wide in the turn while commencing his rally, angled to the clear in
upper stretch and closed with a rush to be up in time. HECKLED stalked the pace from the rail in perfect position to the far turn, angled three wide to
overtake the pacesetters in upper stretch, took the lead in mid-stretch and was caught in the final yards. LADY CLAYPOOLE (IRE) rated off the leaders for
the first five-eighths, rallied up the rail in the turn, cut the corner coming home and finished willingly. HEAVENLY APPOINTED set a well rated pace to lead
to the top of the lane, responded when challenged in upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. HAINT BLUE (FR) tracked the leaders from two wide and
lacked a closing response when called upon for the drive. FRIENDSHIP ROAD squeezed at the start when pinched between rivals, dropped to the rear of
the field and was one paced passing rivals in the lane. DETERMINED FIRST broke inward leaving the gate to impede rival, moved quickly to press the pace
for three-quarters and gave way. PASSIONFORQUALITY broke outward squeezing rival, dropped back to trail down the backside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
INTEGRATION was well rated while three wide, made a four wide bid and took over off the turn while under mild coaxing, then drew off in the lane to prove
best while being given one reminder pop left handed with the crop, much the best. UTAH BEACH was settled on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the
turn and rallied well for the place while no match for the winner, clearly second best. VINTAGE YEAR was away alertly and crossed over to the inside, then
chased the early pace, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then was quickly confronted by the winner leaving the turn and proved to be no
match for that rival, weakened, bested rest. ELON was keen early and three wide into the first turn, then ran off to a big lead on the backstretch, headed on
the turn and tired. KING COVEE was reserved on the inside and lacked a serious rally. YOUNGDUMBANDBROKE was reserved two wide, advanced three
wide on the turn but tired. VALENTIN C was void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
CARRONADE settled off the pace while well in hand, split horses in the far turn to commence his rally, angled out four wide at the head of the lane and
pulled clear to the wire. SMALL FIELD unhurried early to be near the back of the pack, moved to the clear to rally four wide turning for home and chased the
winner down the lane to gain the place. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD slow early to be near the rear and mounted a belated five wide rally down the lane to be
closing fast at the wire. TOLAGA BAY saved ground racing just off the leaders, waited for racing room at the top of the lane, steadied briefly in mid-stretch
and came on late. ANAMNESTIC reserved in mid-pack down to the far turn, rallied three wide to loom large at the head of the stretch briefly taking the lead
and was outkicked down the lane. SMART STRIKER tracked the leaders from two wide to the turn, rallied to the front in upper stretch and flattened out.
KAZAN (IRE) slow to trail down the backside and mounted a mild late rally. DYNA MAST never seriously menaced at any time. WINSTON WOLF well
placed for the first half mile and faded. JOLLY BY GOLLY pressed the pace to the quarter pole and tired. GRAEL set a well measured pace to the far turn
and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
GLIDER was allowed to settle two wide, between rivals at the half mile marker, coaxed on the turn and dropped to the inside, waited by the quarter pole
behind horses, angled out at the three sixteenths for racing room, closed full of run and drew clear late to prove best, driving. NO ONE TO BLAME tracked
the early pace, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then was caught leaving the sixteenth marker and then held the place award. FORT
WASHINGTON was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and then finished well on the far outside to just miss the place award. ALEX JOON was
settled early on the inside, came three wide into the lane and had a mild late gain for the last spot in the superfecta. WOW WHATA SUMMER was rank
early and three wide into the first turn, then settled into stride, made a four wide move on the turn by the quarter pole, but flattened out. STREET COPPER
pressed the early pace two wide, then got out and or shied around the five eighths marker, then got back into stride, made a two wide bid on the turn but
weakened the final furlong on the left lead. OCEAN CITY set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the five eighths marker, then was headed
by the quarter pole and weakened the final furlong. FEBRUARY SON was reserved early and lacked a rally.

BOUNCER broke outward leaving the gate bumping rival, sped to the front while under constant pressure, dueled with the runner-up through the lane and
prevailed in a drive. FROSTED DEPARTURE moved in from the outside post several jumps from the gate, pressured the winner to the head of the lane,
moved up to engage that one in upper stretch and could not get by in a prolonged drive. TOP RECRUIT in tight early when the field bunched up leaving the
gate, rider checked to the back of the pack, raced three wide chasing the leaders and kept on in the lane to be best of the rest. FREE SOUL crowded in
between horses early while lugging in slightly, dropped to the back of the field in the run down the backside and failed to gain in the stretch. O'CONNER
SUNSET bumped at the start by the winner, reserved in hand when field bunched shortly from the gate, rallied briefly in the turn and flattened out.
SEVERAL OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED BY THE RIDERS OF O'CONNER SUNSET, FREE SOUL AND TOP RECRUIT REGARDING THE START AND
THE STRETCH RUN, AND A TRAINER'S OBJECTION WAS RAISED BY THE TRAINER OF FREE SOUL FOR THE RUN DOWN THE STRETCH. UPON

Footnotes
GIGANTE was reserved early on the inside, shifted out on the first turn and was three wide on the backstretch, made a four wide sweep on the turn, kicked
clear leaving the furlong marker and then held off NAGIRROC late to prove best, driving. NAGIRROC was hard held early, then was between rivals on the
turn, came five wide into the lane and sent down, closed well but could not get to the winner. SILVER KNOTT (GB) was well placed on the inside, boxed
nearing the quarter pole, swung out three wide leaving the turn, was in traffic by the furlong marker and then finished willingly late to gain the show award.
MAJOR DUDE pressed the pace two wide, then was coaxed along and made a bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then was sent down for the drive and
fought on gamely but faded late, lost show award late. NORTHERN INVADER steadied on the first turn, tracked the pace and made a three wide bid on the
far turn , between rivals by the quarter pole but flattened out. MO STASH set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
FEV ROVER (IRE) took command immediately from the gate, slowed the tempo through the first half while unpressured, responded at the head of the lane
when briefly challenged and drew off as much best under confident handling. GINA ROMANTICA unhurried in the early stages, coasted into contention up
the fence down the backside, made a rail rally turning for home to engage the leader but proved no serious threat down the lane while a clear second best.
ROMAGNA MIA (GB) saved ground early through the first turn, angled three wide entering the backstretch, chased the leader to the turn, made a four wide
bid in upper stretch and failed to close ground. MISE EN SCENE (GB) climbed in the early going while taken in hand to be at the back of the field, held that
spot to midway on the turn and went by a weakening rival down the lane. JAN'S GIRL prompted the pace for three quarters of a mile and tired.

Footnotes
SET PIECE (GB) was taken back early to trail the field on the inside, shifted out midway on the far turn and circled the field seven wide leaving the turn and
closed well under left handed crop to draw away to prove best. SANTIN stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained a short advantage
nearing the furlong marker but could not go with the winner while running on to be second best. ADHAMO (IRE) was reserved early, eased out on the turn
and started to advance and came five wide into the lane, finished willingly to the wire to gain the show award. NEVER EXPLAIN was reserved early,
between rivals and in traffic leaving the turn four wide, then had a belated rally to just miss the show award. WIN FOR THE MONEY was settled three wide,
between rivals leaving the turn and had no kick while improving late. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) was settled early between rivals, inside on the turn and swung
out leaving the turn and had no rally. STRONG QUALITY set the pace on the inside, two wide off the turn and weakened the final furlong. CATNIP was
rated along three wide, made a mild bid four wide leaving the quarter pole but then was empty in the drive. STRONG TIDE was reserved on the inside and
was not a threat. MASTER PIECE (CHI) tracked the pace two to three wide and weakened. ATONE tracked the pace on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
THISNAMEISOKAY stalked the pace from two wide down the backside, moved to bid on the turn, took command in upper stretch and drew clear
unchallenged down the lane. WATCH THIS BIRDIE tracked the pace to the far turn, rallied three wide and finished willingly to gain the place. GALILEI
reserved off the pace to the far turn, rallied between horses through traffic to the top of the lane, angled to the clear and was gaining late. PRETTYKEEN
chased the pace from the fence through the far turn and finished evenly. WINTER PRINCESS rated in mid-pack down the backstretch racing four wide,
made an early bid into the turn and flattened out in the lane. FISH MOONEY unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and made a mild bid down the
stretch. CHA CHA MISSION passed tiring rivals in the stretch. FUNNY ENOUGH never threatened. UP TO SOMETHING trailed most of the way as a
non-factor. TEQUILERA set the pace while racing on a clear lead and came up empty turning for home. COMPASS FIRE flashed brief speed and was
through early.
