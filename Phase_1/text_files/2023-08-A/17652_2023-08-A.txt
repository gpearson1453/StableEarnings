and had the lead on the turn but from the three path a the top of the stretch failed to hold. SNEAKY REBEL was away alertly and roused from the inside on
the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. PASSION TO PLEASE was up close and forced the pace on the turn but from the

PARTY OF NO tracked the early leader, forced the pace on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
DIAMONDBACK set the pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outgunned and declared a non starter.
CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE settled off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. FOUR
KNIGHTS stalked the early leaders from the inside and raced evenly on the far turn but had no late kick. THELONIOUS was in range and saved ground on
the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no rally. A I INITIATIVE was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch was no threat. BOCELLI was in touch but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START RESULTED IN DIAMONDBACK BEING DECLARED A NON STARTED.

had the lead on the turn but with a clear lead in mid stretch was caught late. M C JACKHAMMER was away alertly and roused from the inside on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. GUS'S GAMBLE was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but was no real threat.
VOYANT settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER
ON M C JACKHAMMER AGAINST ROLLING HILLS FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.
