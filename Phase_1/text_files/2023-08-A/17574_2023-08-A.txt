Footnotes
MOTOWN CLASSIC broke alertly and established the early lead, set a pressured pace into the turn while inside of ONE BIG SMILE, carved out moderate
fractions while pressed to the quarter pole, held a narrow lead to mid-stretch, dug in under firm encouragement into deep stretch and held ONE BIG SMILE
at bay in the final strides to prevail. ONE BIG SMILE engaged with MOTOWN CLASSIC in the early running and pressed outside of that rival through decent
fractions into the turn, kept close attendance to MOTOWN CLASSIC to the quarter marker, continued to battle into the lane, could not get by the determined
winner in deep stretch and was denied for the win, while besting the rest. CATCHMENT broke in at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered to chase
the moderate pace from the inside, angled three wide for the stretch run, could not impact the top pair in the final furlong and held safely for third. UPDRAFT
chased outside of an inner rival in the early stages, slipped to the rail in upper stretch and lacked a late response. WOLF'S LIFE lacked early speed, raced
widest into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
MISS FLAGG was sent to the early lead and set a decent pace into the turn, was pressed along the bend by JULIET'S KITCHEN and battled with that rival
into upper stretch, raced on even terms to mid-stretch and dueled into the final furlong, kept to task under steady handling into the final sixteenth, took a
narrow lead in deep stretch and determinedly held in the final strides to prevail. JULIET'S KITCHEN was asked to be forwardly placed in the early running
and stalked the pacesetter into the turn, advanced to press MISS FLAGG while outside of that rival along the bend, battled with MISS FLAGG into upper
stretch, dueled into deep stretch and was gamely bested at the finish, while holding safely in the end for second. STANDFORGRIT broke alertly, was taken
back off of the early pace and tracked from the inside into the turn, chased the leading pair to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the stretch run, was
gaining in the late stages but could not reel in the leaders and held clearly for third. PRINCESS HEKAWI lacked early speed, chased two wide through the
bend and did not factor.

POUR ON THE COLE was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace while outside of rivals into the backstretch run, advanced to
prompt the pace into the far turn, took command nearing the quarter marker while two wide, shifted out a path in upper stretch and raced three wide into the
drive, dueled with BEROLIJEAN to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, kept to task under steady late urging and lasted for
the win in the final strides. BEROLIJEAN (FR) made contact with MASHHAD FLATS leaving the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early
running and settled outside of rivals into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and was well placed while widest into the far turn, was
roused three wide nearing the quarter marker and confronted POUR ON THE COLE while four wide in upper stretch, battled with POUR ON THE COLE to
the furlong marker, dueled into deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner and was held at bay in the final strides, while well clear of the rest.
MASHHAD FLATS lunged at the start then made contact with BEROLIJEAN and was off slowly, settled off of the early pace while not far back into the first
turn, raced outside of an inner rival into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, chased two wide to the quarter marker, slipped
to the rail into upper stretch and advanced nearing the furlong grounds, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked by the top
two, while holding clearly for third. DI LAURIAN was hustled leaving the break and dictated terms into the first turn, set a moderate pace into the backstretch
and was prompted to the half-mile marker, was overtaken along the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final stages.
BROOKYS TAPIT stalked the moderate early pace from the inside, inched closer along the backstretch run, raced a bit in tight heading to the far turn and
checked leaving the three-furlong marker, lost position heading to the quarter pole, trailed into the stretch and did not offer a late response. PER RULINGS
FROM HIWU, BROOKYS TAPIT AND POUR ON THE COLE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
GUN BULLET was forwardly placed in the early stages, rated off of the pace into the first turn then drifted out a path and carried out BUY THE RUMOR,
tracked the decent pace while outside of a rival through the backstretch run, was roused two wide leaving the three-furlong marker then angled four wide for
the drive, closed to come within aim nearing mid-stretch, drifted in a path inside of the furlong pole and bothered HERON BAY, continued to gain ground into
deep stretch, caught the runner-up in the final yards and kept to task in a drive at the end to prevail. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE settled off of the early pace
while saving ground, made a mild gain nearing the half-mile marker, chased along the rail on the far turn, rallied in upper stretch and vied for the lead at the
furlong marker, took command into the final sixteenth, could not hold off GUN BULLET and was outfinished in deep stretch while besting the rest. HERON
BAY stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, raced widest into the backstretch run and prompted the decent pace to the half-mile marker, kept
pressure on RESERVE PROOF to the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and held a narrow lead at the furlong pole, was bothered by the
oncoming GUN BULLET inside of the furlong marker and was pinched back, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and kept on to win the
nod for third at the finish. RESERVE PROOF assumed command leaving the break, set a pressured pace while off of the rail into the backstretch run,
carved out decent fractions while pressured to the half-mile, held foes at bay to the quarter marker, fought back against HERON BAY into the drive, could
not keep pace with oncoming rivals in deep stretch, weakened and was just edged for third. BUY THE RUMOR was allowed to settle, was carried four wide
into the first turn by GUN BULLET then settled three wide and raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, trailed into the far turn and did not offer a late

fractions along the backstretch run, held foes at bay to the quarter marker, lost the lead in upper stretch, fought back from the inside heading to the furlong
marker, could not match strides with the top two in the late stages and held for third at the finish. NORTHERN ROSE raced close to the early pace and

while four wide nearing the quarter marker, steadied slightly and lost position approaching mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. DRESS REHEARSAL

TORREY'S GIRL was prominent in the early running and raced close to the decent pace, saved ground into the turn and vied for the lead nearing the
quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, had the margin cut into by the oncoming runner-up but kept
to task in deep stretch and held safely at the finish. RAUCOUS TIZZY was prominent in the early running then took back off of the decent early pace,
improved position on the turn while outside of rivals, was roused five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly in the final
stages, put mild pressure on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel in TORREY'S GIRL and bested the rest. LIAM'S SECRET chased from the second
flight early on, lost ground while two wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in the final stages, was outkicked by the top
two and stayed on in deep stretch to secure third. HAYDEN'S ANGEL was bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was off slowly, chased from the
rear in the early stages, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, could not sustain that bid in the final furlong and finished evenly. LUCY TREASURE
raced close to the decent early pace while outside of rivals, improved position while three wide along the turn, was coaxed four wide into the stretch, was
outrun to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. HANNAH IN A HURRY chased the decent pace while saving ground and did not threaten in
the stretch. DANEHILL SONG broke alertly and established the early advantage, set a decent pace into the turn, carved the fractions along the bend while
racing off of the rail, lost the lead to TORREY'S GIRL leaving the quarter marker and chased into the stretch, took a bad step inside of the furlong marker,
was pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MOOGIE SON broke a step slow, was not pressed for speed in the early going but relaxed nicely while tracking the early pace, kept to the two path to the
far turn, angled out near the quarter pole to set up a late run, came into the stretch in the four path and rallied strongly, drifting in during the late stages while
well clear of the place horse. BUTTONWOOD TREE came away from the break in good order and took a position right behind the pacesetters, was always
close up and saved ground throughout, ran on well late and just got up for second despite having to maneuver around a tiring AZURE STAR (IRE) in
mid-stretch. CHARBONNEAU broke in after the start, bothering O B's, was rank passing the finish line the first time then went five wide on the first turn, was
pulling on the rider into the backstretch run and pressed the early pace to the far turn, took over the lead passing the quarter pole but could not fend of the
late run of the winner and was nailed on the wire for the place. RACKATAPTAP raced in the back of the field in the early stages while under a hold,
responded when asked to move forward down the backstretch run, loomed a serious threat while racing three to four wide in the far turn, was under a drive
from the quarter pole but finished one-paced. AZURE STAR (IRE) was sent from the gate to grab the early lead, set comfortable fractions while being
chased by BUTTONWOOD TREE to the inside and CHARBONNEAU to the outside, held a narrow advantage going into the far turn then was challenged by
CHARBONNEAU, lost the lead inside the quarter pole without much resistance and was outrun to the wire. O B'S was off slowly when CHARBONNEAU
took the path after the break, saved ground but was well behind the pace in the early stages, traded bumps with QUALITY CAT at two separate stages in
the race, fell back to last down the backstretch, tried to mount a rally with about three furlongs to run but could not make any headway on the leaders and
finished evenly. QUALITY CAT was fractious prior to the start, was outrun in the early stages, got bumped by O B's during the backstretch run, bumped into
that rival again at the seven-sixteenths pole, made a brief rally in the far turn but stalled and had nothing to offer in the stretch.
