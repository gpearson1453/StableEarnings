Footnotes
TWENTYONE N CHANGE rushed away from outset and led the field in tandem along the backstretch, took a ground saving journey around the turn, and
shook clear of challenger in final sixteenth for the score. SAMURAI MIKE came away alertly and set the early pace in tandem from between rivals, was on
even terms at upper stretch, but failed to match strides with eventual winner in final sixteenth. HI HO CHEERIO settled into second flight, chased the
pacesetting duo around the turn from a ground saving stance, but couldnt catch the top pair in closing strides. MIAMI CROCKETT was unhurried along the
backstretch, trekked the two path around the bend, and gained mildly on the leaders in final furlong. PERFECT FANNY gave chase to frontrunners along
the backstretch as the widest of three abreast, maintained a wide track into the homestretch, and finished evenly. LANGUAGE BARRIER showed reserve
through the opening half before passing a tiring rival in late stages. TAKE ME UP BRADY faded rapidly in the homestretch after pressing the pace from a
three wide stance along the backstretch.

Footnotes
AIN'TNOSWEETIE rushed form outset and was widest of four abreast along the backstretch, gained sole command near the conclusion of backstretch, then
steadily widened the margin for a clear victory. ELLE'S LIL DIVA broke alertly and rated close up between rivals along the backstretch, was the lone rival in
the second flight around the bend, and finished a clear second but was no match for tough winner in final furlong. PAT'S GAL came away in tandem with
three rivals, and rated close up before being shuffled back near the half pole, then rallied mildly to get up for the show. ALQWANI established a ground
saving stance shortly after the start, settled into mid pack at conclusion of backstretch, then weakened in closing strides. VOODOO FIRE failed to threaten
and passed a tiring rival in late going after being unhurried along backstretch and trekking the three path around the turn. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT showed
reserve and tucked to save ground around the bend before tiring in closing strides.

two path stance and gave chase to leader through the opening half and finished a clear second behind the runaway winner. ANGEL'S SHADOWS settled
into mid pack shortly after the start, trekked the three path around the bend, and finished willingly for the show. KAPRIZOV failed to menace and passed
tiring rival after a tardy start and trailing the field through the half. CINCO MAJESTIC stalked the leader along the backstretch and tired in closing strides
while saving ground throughout. STRADIVARIAN failed to threaten after a hesitant break, two path journey, and tiring in the end.

Footnotes
ANGEL OF ATTACK pressed the early pace from a two path stance, gained command near conclusion of backstretch, had a slight advantage at upper
stretch, engaged in a stretch duel and bested that rival by slimmest margin at the wire. FOUND JORDAN showed reserve early before being roused near
the half pole, angling out to three wide at upper stretch, and being outnodded at the end of a stretch duel. TOTAL SURPRISE showed reserve and saved
ground through the opening half, angled out between rivals at upper stretch, tucked to the rail near the eighth pole, and rallied mildly to earn the show.
SWEET ANALYZER settled into a stalking pose while trekking the three path through the opening half, rated close up at upper stretch, then failed to match
strides in final furlong. WHODOESITBETTER lacked a closing bid to end a ground saving journey. CAUSEWAY SURPISE flashed early foot and led the
field through the opening bend nd along the backstretch, was headed inside the half pole and faded thereafter. B L'S CONCERTO trekked three wide
around the opening bend, settled into a two path stance along the backstretch, and faded steadily in the latter portion of contest. THE RIDER OF HORSE
FIVE, FOUND JORDAN, LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE THREE, ANGEL OF ATTACK, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
WORKIN NINETOFIVE loomed three wide along the backstretch, advanced on leader around the bend while maintaining a three wide stance, then wore
down the leader in final sixteenth for the score. LYRICAL settled into mid pack, gave chase to leader from a two path pose around the turn, then earned the
place with strong closing strides. WHERE'S FRANKIE rushed from outset and led the field into the homestretch from a two path position, but could not fend
off the top pair in the final sixteenth. DIVA DE KELA came away awkwardly, trailed the field along the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, and was a
mild threat in the end. FLASH FLOOD lacked a needed rally after giving chase from between rivals and swinging wide at upper stretch. PEPPERMINT
SISTER broke alertly and pressed the pace while trekking the two path, was within striking distance at upper stretch between rivals, then weakened in final
furlong.

Footnotes
SENSE OF FLURRY showed patience in the early going, tucked to save ground through the bend, responded strongly to urging at head of stretch, and ran
down the leader for the score. BALIMOS rallied mid track to earn the place after being unhurried along the backstretch and angling out to be widest of all at
upper stretch. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE rushed from outset to set the pace from between rivals, had a clear advantage at upper stretch, but was caught in
closing strides. ROUNDABOUT stumbled at the break and rated back through the first call, tucked to save ground around the turn, floated out near the
eighth pole and finished willingly. PICAFLOR came up empty after settling behind the pacesetting trio through the opening half and trekking wide at upper
stretch. SPOILED BRAT faded rapidly after rushing from outset to set the pace in concert with two foes as the inner most rival. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES
hustled away from the break and pressed the pace as the outer most rival of three abreast along the backstretch, lost ground to pacesetter through the turn,
and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ANN ALEE flipped in gate while loading, rushed from outset to gain first command, briefly relished command near conclusion of backstretch, then came
again and finished under a stiff drive for the score to end a ground saving journey. HARLOW'S HARMONY rushed from the break and shared command
along the backstretch, trekked the two path around the bend, but was unable to match strides with eventual winner in final furlong and finished a clear
second. JOMAMA SASSY established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, gave chase to front runners around the bend, then held onto the show
but was unable to run down top pair. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN came away alertly and chased the frontrunning duo from between rivals, led the second flight
into the turn, then lacked a needed rally in the final furlong. STYLIN N PROFILIN was unable to improve position after settling into second flight and giving
chase as the widest of all rivals around the turn. SUNSHINE FEVER trekked three wide while rating in the second flight, angled in near the three sixteenths
pole and weakened in closing strides. DIAMOND MISSY rated back and failed to menace while trailing the field from outset.

Footnotes
BIG LEAGUE BENNY broke on top of the short field, saved ground through the turn while relishing command, angled out to three wide at upper stretch, and
dug in to get up in late strides for the score. HIGHTAIL COWBOY came away alertly, gained command halfway down the backstretch, tucked to save
ground through the bend, led the field at the eighth pole, then was nailed in final strides and forced to settle for place honors. NEW DICE lacked a needed
rally to end a wide journey. O DOGG showed reserve from outset, tucked to save ground around the turn, and was of little threat to front runners. DILLON
ROCKS stalked the early pace from a three path pose, rated two wide and close up at upper stretch, then faded rapidly in final furlong.
