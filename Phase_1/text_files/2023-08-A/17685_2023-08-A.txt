Footnotes
I'M NOBLE was rank around the first turn on the inside off the pace, then moved through on the rail to co-lead down the backstretch, matching strides with
KURT'S CHOICE to the top of the stretch then edged away, dug in when MY CALANTE challenged him in mid stretch and held on. MY CALANTE was
allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch while racing four or five wide then tipped in to save ground around the final turn, made a rail bid in the
stretch but was not enough but proved second best. GLENDALE raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from three or four wide
down the backstretch then went three wide into upper stretch, drifted out to mid track and kept on rally for the show. LITTLE RED RIFLE hustled along early
to press the pace from the two path around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch and around the final turn then made a rebid in early
stretch but only passed tiring rival. KURT'S CHOICE broke well and went to the front around the first turn then was engaged entering the backstretch by I'M
NOBLE and co-led to the top of the stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and tired. CALICO JOE was off a step slow and was allowed to settle at the back of the
pack but never made a serious bid.

Footnotes
OUTOFTHEDARK broke in and bumped with GOT GHOSTED at the start, kept on to prompt the pace from the two path and took the lead at the eighth pole
while racing erratic down the stretch but kept on and drew clear. GOT GHOSTED had an awkward start, broke out and bumped with OUTOFTHEDARK and
CARPE GOLD leaving the gate, then hustled up to be off the pace from between horses, moved out to three wide in upper stretch and tipped in to two wide
at the eighth pole to prove second best. KIRILL THE THRILL was forwardly placed from three wide around the turn then tucked to the inside at the three
sixteenths pole but had to maneuver through traffic at the eighth pole but was a game third. JONNY B GONEY was slow into his stride leaving the gate then
rushed up from four wide to vie for the lead around the turn but floated out going into the stretch and weakened. BENZ LAKE THUNDER broke well then
settled in the middle of the pack and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CARPE GOLD was bumped by GOT GHOSTED at the start, raced near the back and
was not a threat. EXPOUND had good speed through the turn then was headed by OUTOFTHEDARK at the three sixteenths pole, drifted in at the eighth
pole and tired. JOSH'S DRAMA was off the early pace then dropped back on the turn and was outrun. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE
JOCKEY OF GOT GHOSTED CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF OUTOFTHEDARK FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE
STARTING GATE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LANE tracked the leaders down the backstretch from three wide then moved up around the final turn, engaged the leader at the three sixteenths
pole and was bumped by KOOKYBERRY near the eighth pole but kept on to prevail. KOOKYBERRY sprinted to the front to set the pace for the first quarter,
edged away on the final turn to a clear lead but ducked in around the three sixteenths pole then angled out and bumped with MIDNIGHT LANE near the
eighth pole and fought gamely to the wire to be second best. STRABELLA hopped out of the gate and trailed the field around the first turn then hustled
along down the backstretch and moved between horses going into the final turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch and made a late run to be best of
the rest. HONEYCRISP saved ground to no avail. DANZONBY stalked the pace from the two path around the first turn, moved up from four wide down the
backstretch then dropped back on the final turn and was not a factor. GRACE A'LACE pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then took a
brief lead on the backstretch and continued to press the pace to midway through the final turn and tired. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE
JOCKEY OF KOOKYBERRY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF MIDNIGHT LANE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE

STABILITY sprinted to the front to set a pressured pace down the backstretch then edged away on the final turn and drew off in the stretch to prove best. P
R CALL ME MAYBE was in tight and shuffled back going into the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch, moved up through the final turn
on the inside, angled out to five wide into the stretch and made a late rally to prove second best. BRIARTOWN steadied going into the first turn then was
placed off the pace down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the final turn but was outfinished in the stretch. HARLEEZY rushed up to press the pace
through the final turn and fought gamely in upper stretch but weakened. LOUIS stalked the pace from three or four wide down the backstretch, made a three
wide bid on the final turn and tipped out four wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. LAPINSKI UNION was forwardly placed from three wide around the
first turn then fell back slightly on the backstretch, moved between horses going into the final turn but lacked a late response in the stretch drive. RAIL
TOWN was off a step slow, went five or six wide into the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack while racing four wide down the backstretch but was
never a threat. BABY ITS COLD remained back and was outrun.

Footnotes
SUPERSTAR SWANK rushed up the rail to prompt the pace around the turn and took over at the top of the stretch and drew off to prove best.
COMMISSIONER OSCAR had no early speed through the turn then angled out to four wide in upper stretch and made a late rally to prove a clear second.
LATIN FORCE raced five wide to the turn then moved in to two wide around the turn then shifted to the rail for a bid in the stretch but was empty and held
the show. ZENYARTY BONES raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, moved out to three wide at the eighth
pole and made a late run to just miss the show. MACH TWO had good early speed to the turn then retreated. TWOTWENTYSWIFT lacked speed and was
not a threat. WESTDAKOTA raced near the back and was not a factor. MO MO TOWN had good speed away from the gate to take a clear lead to the
quarter pole and tired. MORNING THUNDER was off the pace early to the turn and gave way.
