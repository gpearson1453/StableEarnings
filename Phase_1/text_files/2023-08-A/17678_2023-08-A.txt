Footnotes
SUMTING RIGHT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin down the backstretch and through the second turn, then lasted under
steady pressure. SAILOR'S SALUTE hopped at the start, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then made a steady gain and closed the gap on that one late. JEFF'S ANGEL unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn,
fanned widest into the stretch, flattened and held the show. SCOOP THERE IT IS mid pack, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide
into the stretch and had no rally. FAST FASHION stalked the pace outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch and faded. GLOVANNA was never involved.

SONG OF INDY rated inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out and came three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drove clear
late. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, drew off, then was no match for
the winner and held the place. DANCE OR STROLL never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened
and gained the show. AMAZON LIZZIE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. UP IN
ARMS unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and flattened out. BLU SKY SUNRISE stalked the pace on
the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and faded. THE TWO NANCY'S showed little, inside.

Footnotes
RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
SALLY'S MUSTANG well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the
winner and held the place. ODD GAL mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
made a steady gain, edged up for the show and held. WILD LOOKER tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into
the stretch, flattened and held a share. DOWN TO EARTH well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. DON'T MAKE ME BEG was never involved. BEAUTIFUL STAR reared at the start, ran evenly three and four
wide to the stretch, fanned widest and faded.
