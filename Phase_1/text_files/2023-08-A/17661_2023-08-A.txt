MISS D'S PRIDE was away alertly, a factor on the turn and switched to the inside and was up in time. CHICAGO FREDDY was hustled early, had a clear
lead on the turn and was second best in a good effort. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS was off the pace, raced evenly on the turn and from the four path at the
top of the stretch was up for show. EL BANDOLERO showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. MY SONG BABY was in touch
and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MY WROTE was well back, showed little and from the six path at the
top of the stretch had no impact. FIRST ROUND was off slow, chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch faded.

REMEMBEROLDTYMES showed speed from the inside and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. ORBITING THE SKY was
well back, trailed the field on the turn and angled outside at the top of the stretch and rallied late. LOUEMMA was in touch and moved up on the turn but
from the the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. WEST PAW was hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. KOZY KAT stalked the leader but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no rally. J M R BOLD VISION
was in range and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

HOLIDAY WITH AMY was in range, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. ASHWICKEN was
unhurried early and gained ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. PERFECTION SAVER showed no speed,
saved ground on the far turn and finished well. MIZZ GEMMA was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
had no late kick. EYE GOT IT GOOD set a pressured pace and dueled on the far turn but had nothing left. SOPRISE ASTRAY was up close and had a slim
lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. SUPER FOLLOW was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and passed tired
foes through the stretch. LOADED MISTRESS was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. NAVY BLUE ANGEL forced the pace but lost ground on the
far turn and was empty.
