Footnotes
NEW YEARS LOVE was restless in the gate, vied for the early lead from the inside to the turn then fell back slightly while saving ground on the turn but
made a rebid in the stretch and slipped through in deep stretch to prevail. RAGING LADY broke out at the start then was placed off the pace through the
turn then ran down the leader but was out kicked by inside rival and proved second best. MILLI STARR sprinted to the lead and inched away on the turn
then was challenged in the stretch but fought gamely to hold the show. AUNT IRENE was forwardly placed while racing four wide to the turn but fell back
around the turn, moved out to four wide in upper stretch to improve position. LA ROSA DRIVE was forwardly placed while racing three wide but flattened
out. DOZO broke out leaving the gate then stalked the pace from five wide on the backstretch, moved in to three wide around the turn and was outfinished
in the stretch. HEY ROXY was never a threat. SWEET TATUM was out run.

IMA HOT TOTTIE went to the front to set all the pace but floated out into the stretch, kept on and drew off. FLYING LADY pressed the early pace from the
two path to mid way down the backstretch then fell back around the turn but made a rebid in the stretch and was along for the place. CORY LOVES RAIN
chased the leaders down the backstretch then made a two wide bid at the five sixteenths pole but couldn't catch the leader and weakened in deep stretch.
ATHENIAN PRINCESS prompted the pace from three wide to the half mile marker, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. DANGERELLA
trailed the field to mid turn but was not a factor. WEST'S ON FIRE was always back.

RANDOM AFFAIR had brief early foot then vied for the lead to the half mile marker, reclaimed the lead and inched away in upper stretch and just held on.
TOMBI lacked room coming onto the main track and had to check, then trailed the field to the turn, saved ground around the turn, moved out to three wide
at the three sixteenths pole to make a late run and just missed. MY PAL settled off the pace down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn then
angled out to three wide at the quarter pole but was outfinished late. KICK IT stalked the pace from three or four wide down the backstretch then was taken
back around the turn and passed tiring rival. MASTERPIECE DAY was roused to the lead to the half mile marker then vied for the lead to the quarter pole
and tired. RANCHER stumbled shortly after the start and almost unseated the rider but rider lost irons, then rushed up to contention but faltered and
galloped in.

Footnotes
KNIGHTED rushed to contention and kept on to vie for the lead at the half mile marker, match strides to the top of the stretch, drove past the leader at the
eighth pole and was kept to task. FRISCO KID saved ground to the turn then angled out to two to four wide around the turn, kept moving out to five wide into
upper stretch and rallied but was too late. PRINCE OTTO hustled to the lead, engaged at the half mile marker and dueled to early stretch and gave way
grudgingly. KEENEYE GEORGE prompted the early pace to the half mile marker then settled off the pace while saving ground around the turn and faltered.
AUDACE was last away but moved up from between horses at the five furlong marker and kept on from three wide through the turn and finished evenly. OH
SNAP remained back. HONKY TONK MUSIC pressed the pace from the two path to the turn then retreated.

OMACHE KID raced near the back to the turn then moved up from between horses at the quarter pole, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch to make a
rally and be up in the final jumps. RHODIUM RUNNER sprinted to the lead and co-led from the two path to the quarter pole then inched away in the stretch
drive but was nailed in the final jumps. LIL LATIGO was off the pace in the second flight on the inside to the three furlong marker then moved out to four
wide in tupper stretch and made a late run to be a game third. EXPECT ROYAL rushed up to co-lead from the inside to the top of the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. CHERUBIM was off the pace in the second flight from the two path to the turn then moved up from three wide at the three furlong marker and
engaged the leader at the quarter pole but tired. FERRARI ROAD was off the pace in the second flight from three wide to mid turn and weakened. RI' PIN
SNAP has an awkward start and trailed throughout.

GREY ROGUE sprinted to the front to share clear command from the inside to the five sixteenths pole then edged away, drifted out in mid stretch while
tiring but just lasted. TASHKENT raced in the middle of the pack on the inside down the backstretch then went two wide around the final turn, tipping out to
four wide in upper stretch to make a rally and just missed. WILLTOBELUCKY raced in the middle of the pace from the two path down the backstretch then
saved ground around the final turn and was gaining on the leader but weakened. THE GREATEST EAGLE was unhurried through the final turn and passed
tiring rivals. JU JU GUY chased the leaders down the backstretch then gained ground around the turn but tired in deep stretch. GIMME SPACE was allowed
to settle around the first turn then moved up from two wide down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn but failed to menace. CLEARLY MAD
roused to the front to share a clear command from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and tired.

Footnotes
FERRARI RED hustled to the lead to set all the pace, was headed a the five sixteenths pole and match strides with EZ FITZ to the quarter pole then dug in
and drew off to prove best. EZ FITZ was away alertly, prompted the pace from three wide to the three furlong marker then moved to engage the leader at
the five sixteenths pole and matched strides to the quarter pole but floated out entering the stretch and was tiring but held on for the place. PALACE PATCH
was off a step slow and trailed the field to the seven sixteenths pole then slipped up the rail to press the pace at the three furlong marker but fell back
around the turn, made a rebid in the stretch to just miss the place. CHASING THE KING was just off the pace in the two path to the half mile marker then fell
back and chased the leaders home. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF PALACE PATCH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
JOCKEY OF FERRARI RED FOR ALLEGED INTERFERNCE AT THE THREE FURLONG MARKER, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF
FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAD TAKEN. THIS WAS A NON WAGERING EVENT, HORSES RAN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY.
