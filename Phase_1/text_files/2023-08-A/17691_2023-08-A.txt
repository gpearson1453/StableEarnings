Footnotes
ARMAVIR settled off the pace in a good position, rallied between horses on the second turn, closed steadily, wore down the PAINTSVILLE to get up late
and held off the late charge of DAPPER DUDE. DAPPER DUDE was allowed to settle and raced in the back, rallied into the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining late. PAINTSVILLE vied inside to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead, led to late stretch and was
outclosed. ELECTRIC CHARGE was unhurried early and trailed the field, angled out at the top of the stretch, finished well and was gaining late. ICE
VORTEX raced mid pack, rallied into the second turn, bid six wide to get within range and hung late. HANDSOFFTHEGOODS was fractious loading and
failed to threaten in an even effort. DARK SOLUTION stumbled at the start, vied three across to the second turn, tired and stopped. INDIO GUAPO vied
between horses to the second turn, tired and stopped.

JOURNEYIST was sent to the front to set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew off and extended the lead while kept to task. COTTON CANDY
ANNIE was checked entering the first turn, stalked the pace while racing in hand, moved up to challenge into the turn, dropped back and was no match for
the winner. QUILTING PARTY saved ground to the stretch, lacked a rally and battled for show. ZING was never far back, had little left for the drive and was
outfinished for third.

TIMELESS GLORY veered out at the start, stalked the pace along the inside while being rated, rallied into the second turn, assumed command, drew off for
a clear lead and held well under left handed urging. ON A TOUR broke slowly and was crowded at the start, was unhurried early, advanced inside around
the second turn, bid willingly, gained late to narrow the gap and finished second best. BERTRADA raced mid pack, rallied between horses on the second
turn, came up empty late and held safely for show. COUGER set the pace to the second turn, fell back, weakened and gave way. KITTEN ROCKS lagged
while racing outside, dropped in entering the second turn, bid three wide and came up empty. LINDALOUIMAGE saved ground in an even effort and was
outrun. CAIRO SUMMER pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
TIGHTROPE set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off and was ridden out. REAL NEWS broke awkwardly to be off a step slowly, advanced inside on the
turn, angled out, bid six wide, closed to earn place and was no threat to the winner. LAND MARK DEAL broke slowly, dropped inside to save ground and
closed along the rail to earn show. MISTER KELLY was never far back, went five wide leaving the turn and lacked a stretch response. IAN GLASS raced
close to the pace along the inside, bid three wide and came up empty. SMOKIN RICHIE stalked the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way.
GREELEYS ICE stalked inside to the turn, angled out in the upper stretch and had nothing left. LUCKY SHOT was checked into the turn and was not a
factor. PAYSTER was outrun in an even effort.
