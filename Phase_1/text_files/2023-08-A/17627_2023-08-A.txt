Footnotes
ENDALE ARCH shared the command to the half mile marker then edged away and kept to task in the drive. EL JEFE COBB raced in the middle of the pace
to the turn then made a rail bid around the turn but couldn't catch the leader but was a game second. CREDIT RATING raced near the back to the turn then
circled the field and rallied for the show. DALE'S ADDICTION shared the command to the half mile marker then tracked the leader around the turn and tired.
BIG BLUE OKIE trailed the field to the turn then moved up from four or five wide around the turn and into the stretch and showed late interest to improve
position. MAJOR TIMING had brief early speed then settled off the pace from three wide to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. FUSAICHI WILDCAT
was off the pave from four wide to the three furlong marked and gave way. BUZZ SHINER raced wide down the backstretch then angled in on the turn to
save ground but was not a factor.

and fought gamely in the stretch but was no match for the winner. SPARKLE IN THE SKY rushed up to a clear lead through the turn then was headed at the

Footnotes
SUEZ tracked the leaders down the backstretch then fell back on the turn but made a rebid at the three sixteenths and gave a late surge from between
horses at the sixteenth pole to just get up for the win. OPTIMAL was off the pace down the backstretch then chased the leader around the turn and drove
past in the final sixteenth to take a brief lead but was nailed in the final jumps. THREE BALL was forwardly placed down the backstretch, fell back on the
turn but made a rebid at the top of the stretch for a late run to be up for show. MOST AMUSING sprinted to a clear lead to set the pace but was collared in
the final sixteenths and gave way. CHUCK NAZTY was last away, rushed up the rail to be in contention and was gaining in the stretch drive but was
outfinished. CREATIVE LETTERS was outrun. PODEROSO EQUS was not a threat.

WHISTLING HOME was hustled to the lead under pressure to the quarter pole, inched away into the stretch and drew off to prove best. LOTSA LACE shot
away from the gate then vied for the lead from three wide to the quarter pole and chased the winner home. MISFIRED raced near the back on the
backstretch then made a bid around the turn, tipped in to make a rail bid in the stretch and was up for the show. DREAMER GIRL vied for the lead from the
two path then tracked the leaders from three wide around the turn but was empty. UNPLUCKED GEM failed to menace. TRULY A MESS was bumped by
inside rival at the start then trailed down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the turn, tipped out to two wide into the stretch but tired. NAUGHTY EVELYN
bumped outside rival at the start then tracked the leaders, angled out to four wide at the half mile marker and vied for the lead for a furlong and gave way. A
JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED THE JOCKEY OF TRULY A MESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF MISFIRED FOR ALLEGED

CELEE'S LAST TE went to the front to set an unchallenged pace, drew off to prove best. RAY AREWETHEREYET stalked the pace from three wide and
fought gamely in the stretch, held the place. INTO CLASSIC tracked the leaders from two wide and fought gamely in the stretch but flattened out. MISS
IMPORTANT trailed the field to the turn then made a rail bid on the turn to improve position. DIRT FLIRT was close up to the turn while racing four wide
throughout and was not a factor. RED HOT MOON settled near the back and was not a threat.
