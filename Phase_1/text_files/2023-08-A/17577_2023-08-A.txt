Footnotes
BLONDE DYNAMO had a good position in the second flight tracking outside, took closer order to the front pair at the five sixteenths marker, was roused for
more five wide at the furlong pole and wore down the leaders in deep stretch to just get up for the win. MY ASSISTANT prompted outside in the beginning,
was content to sit just off the leader on the turn, contested for the front four wide straightening out for the drive and fought on stubbornly with runners on
either side to the wire just missing in a gutsy effort. ROSES ARE FREE pulled the rider to the lead down the back straight, set the pace up front having a
narrow advantage on the turn, was headed outside at the top of the lane, battled until the last eighth and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch inside at the
wire. HARD ROCK WARRIOR broke out to begin, trailed the field down the backstretch as well as on the turn, swung out widest in the seven path for the
drive, was full of run in the final furlong and closed in well to capture a minor share at the wire. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE settled in mid field four deep
down the backside, kept pace with the leaders outside rivals on the turn, shifted out six wide for the stretch drive and was one paced in the last fulrong.
KIMONO KATE was nestled behind the top pair in the beginning on the rail, was nudged on to go after the engaging leaders with five sixteenths to run,
offered little response and faded between horses in the final eighth of a mile. DOO DAH travelled on the rail in mid pack down the backside, made little
headway on the fence through the turn and had nothing to give inside for the stretch drive. SHEZ A SEALY stalked on the inside near the back of the pack
in the early going, save ground running on the fence throughout the turn but could not get involved between runners in the four path running to the finish.
BLUEBERRY DOLL was brushed inside at the start, settled near the rear outside down the back straight, made little impression on the turn and had nothing
to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MACHINA travelled in the middle of the field four deep down the backside, was coaxed at the three furlong pole, began to reel in the leaders just outside,
loomed the threat four wide at the top of the lane, collared the frontrunner at the sixteenth pole and was edging away nearing the wire. SMART BIRD took
command from the start, was pressured inside on the turn, put away the early pace foe at the top of the stretch, was collared outside by the winner at the
eighth pole, could not hold hold off the late surge and settled for second best on this day in a gritty effort. CHROME'S ANGEL stalked near the rear three
deep down the backstretch, followed the path behind the winner on the turn, was checked mildly in upper stretch, angled out to the five path for the drive
and regrouped to finish up gamely to close in and capture third at the the wire. ALBERTA BE MINE was squeezed at the start, tracked three deep outside in
the early going, was roused midpoint on the turn to get involved up front at the top of the lane, could not find more late between foes in the stretch to
threaten and settled on a small share in the end. GOLD FORESTER tracked two deep between rivals in the beginning, was taken back off the pace at the
half, kept in touch with the leaders on the turn to be in with a chance straightening out for the drive but could not be a menace in the late stages of the race.
JOLENE JOLENE broke out to begin, pressed inside down the back straight, hounded the pacesetter on the rail throughout the turn and could not find
another gear and finished evenly on the fence to the wire. SOCIAL DRINKER was pushed in at the break, trailing down the backside, began to smartly pick
up rivals outside commencing at the three furlong marker, continued to rally outside to be in the mix of things widest in the seven path in upper stretch but
could not sustain the run and stalled in the final eighth. FOREST MAIDEN broke in at the start, settled between foes in mid field at the half mile marker, was
urged for more outside three furlongs from the wire making little impact and could not be a factor running through the stretch. ITS A BIRDIE broke inwards to
begin, travelled on the fence in the middle of the pack at the half, was ridden along on the rail with three eighths to go losing ground to runners on the turn
and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
HELL BENT was unhurried to trail the field down the back straight on the outside, still could see the field running on the turn, was behind a wall of rivals at
the top of the stretch, began to weave through traffic in mid stretch, found clear running room finally at the sixteenth pole and surged late to just get up at the
wire in a well timed stretch rally. SMALL TALK was outside stalking in the third flight down the backstretch, started to gain momentum outside runners three
furlongs from the finish, angled to the six path looking the main threat turning for home, took command at the furlong marker and was just caught at the wire
by the surging winner. SPANISH PRINCE had a loose lead down the backstretch, continued to dictate the pace on the turn, was headed outside at the top
of the lane, put away that challenger in upper stretch, could not hold off the late closers in the last sixteenth and held on for the show at the finish.
TOURIST'S DREAM chased on the rail at the three quarter pole, was shuffled on the fence entering the turn, offered a mild run two wide outside to be in
range four wide at the quarter pole and was gaining mildly down the lane to be involved for the show award at the finish. PRINCE OF THIEVES was
bumped inside at the start, stalked at the back down the backstretch, was in hand on the rail through the first part of the turn, shifted out with five sixteenths
to go, angled out widest in the seven path for the drive and showed good energy passing some in the late stages of the race. NEWPORT AGENT was
bumped between foes to start, settled near the rear two deep down the backside, offered a mild run at the half to the quarter marker and faded between at
the eighth pole. JMR PURE SENSATION broke out bumping outside foe to begin, travelled near the back of the pack on the rail, could not get into
contention inside on the turn and was not a presence in the stretch drive. ORPHAN HALLIE stalked in the third flight on the rail down the backstretch, could
not quicken with others three eighths from home and flattened in the three path running through the stretch. EXULT was three deep outside horses tracking
the pacesetter, took closer order chasing the frontrunner just outside on the turn, loomed four wide at the top of the lane and backed away between runners
at the furlong marker. CANYOUHEARMENOW tracked with runners on either side in the beginning, was roused with three furlongs remaining, could not
keep up to the leaders on the turn and retreated on the fence through the stretch.

Footnotes
SEGUIMI was urged from the start, quickly moved clear and shifted in to dictate the pace inside, was never thoroughly challenged saving ground and setting
the tempo, put to urging at the top of the stretch and had enough in reserve to hold sway while being kept to the task. MALIBU UPROAR exchanged a light
bump at the start, was coaxed forward from between runners early, moved nearer the rail tracking off the pace inside saving ground, advanced inside a rival
on the far turn, came out a bit with aim on the winner, could make no headway despite all-out urging. STOP THE HUMBUG settled off the pace inside early,
was off the rail heading to the far turn and beginning to advance, moved out from three to four wide late on that bend gaining between rivals to the top of the
stretch where five wide, was best of the rest but no match for the top pair. MAYITO was off the early leaders but within range two to three wide early,
pushed along leaving the backstretch, fanned six wide into upper stretch between runners, ran on but needed more. EXECUTIVE GIANT was just a bit
fractious in the gate, in just a bit tight early, shifted in on the first turn, continued to save ground on the far turn while making up distance on the main group,
improved inside late. DE ONLY SOLUTION exchanged a light bump at the start, was well-placed tracking inside up close, saved ground through both turns
advancing inside a tiring rival at the quarter pole then shifted out coming three to four wide into upper stretch and with momentum but could not sustain the
run and flattened out. JACK THE CAT settled in the back half of the field off the fence in the two to three path, swung five to six wide turning for home, ran
on evenly while never menacing. HIT THE POINT lacked early speed and was unhurried at the rear far off the pace, passed tired foes in the stretch.
WENJACK shifted in racing mid-pack outside foes three to four wide into the first turn, was still in position and urged along coming past the quarter pole but
floated wide at that juncture coming into upper stretch seven deep, faltered and faded. FIRST SPRING raced outside off the pace mostly three to five wide
and was never near enough to threaten. SOCIETY JOE moved forward after the break under some encouragement from the rider, stalked the eventual
winner about a length and a half off that one racing three deep, came up empty.

Footnotes
BOSTON TEA PARTY moved quickly to the fore, set the pace inside of rivals but just off the fence, was kept busy through the lane and held safe. DREAM
JEREEM had some very light brushing at the start, switched outside foes leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn coming out six deep turning for
home and forced outside rivals, could not reach the winner but was a clear second. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was bumped at the break, raced off the pace two
wide into the turn, was guided out a bit in upper stretch but faced traffic so altered out again in mid-stretch, ran on to secure show honors. NINETYFOUR
EXPOS chased the leading pair in behind, raced mostly two to three deep on the turn, came out four wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick.
BAJAN BULLET bumped the outer rival at the start, raced inside at the rear, was in just a hair tight early on the turn, switched out racing two wide at that
juncture, ran on mildly inside foes late. VICTORIA'S CHIEF was very lightly brushed at the start, raced mid-pack into the turn three wide, fanned out five
deep leaving that bend, faltered and faded. SEA TO AIR chased the eventual winner three deep, drifted out a path leaving the turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
ROCKET RILEY was allowed to settle on the fence trailing down the backstretch, rallied outside picking up runners at the quarter pole, still had lots to do
five wide at the top of the lane, found her best stride late closing strongly at the furlong marker and got up just before the wire in a well timed late run.
TACHYON SPEED stalked in the middle of the pack three deep outside horses at the half, started to gain on the leaders midpoint on the turn, loomed the
threat in the five path turning for home, took command at the eighth pole and was caught late the surging winner at the line. I'M SNOW ANGEL stalked
close to the back four deep down the backstretch, began to lengthen stride around foes two furlongs from the wire and was running on end between horses
to the wire closing well to capture third. MOUNTAIN SOUND travelled in the middle of the pack between in the beginning, rallied two wide closing mid point
on the turn, found a seam in the four path in upper stretch to be in the thick of things, battled with rivals until the eighth pole and faded nearing the wire for a
minor share. SILENT TRIBUTE emerged from an early three horse battle to lead at the half, was collared outside with five sixteenths remaining, battled
determinedly inside until the eighth pole and tired in deep stretch. MISS WATERLOO forced the pace outside down the back straight, bid for the lead
outside midway on the turn, began to extend the lead two furlongs from the wire, was collared in mid stretch and yielded in the final furlong.
LOOKHOWPRETTY travelled on the rail in midfield in the beginning, was urged with five sixteenths from the wire, could not make any gains on fellow rivals
and had little to show in the stretch drive. SEATTLE SIGNAL was in the mix up front with runners on either side after the start, could not keep up with the
front two three furlongs from home and backed through the field on the fence midturn.

Footnotes
JILLI MARIE travelled in mid pack three wide outside down the backside, offered a four wide move to be in range through the turn, bid for the lead in upper
stretch, took command at the seventy yard pole and was inchning away at the finish for the win. SILENT GUROO took control from the onset, dictated the
pace throughout the turn, was headed outside turning for home, fought on stubbornly the entire stretch with outside horses and just missed at the wire for
the win in a gallant stretch effort. DREAMING OF AUDREY had a good spot tracking outside down the backstretch and throughout the turn, bid for the lead
in lane four with runners on either side straightening out for the drive, could not find another gear late to threaten the top two but kept on going and held
safely for the show prize in the end. ENDORPHIN RUSH was in range under restraint early, rallied to be in contention at the furlong marker but needed
more late to pose a threat at the finish. ALPHA MIA travelled close to the back of the field down the backstretch, was shuffled inside to be last with five
sixteenths to run, angled out to be five wide for the drive and showed late interest in the final furlong passing rivals. STARLIGHT RIDGE was off slow to
begin, settled near the rear two deep between foes in the backstretch, offered a brief run between horses from the half until the three eights pole and
passed tired runners down the lane. SPARKLE SAMMY chased inside between rivals, could not match strides with the leaders in mid stretch and levelled
out in the final furlong. FEDALIA was in hand behind the pace down the backstretch, saved ground waiting on the turn inside, was in range if good enough
on the fence turning for home and levelled off in the final furlong. ANTIGONE was last outside down the back straight, offered a mild turn of foot four wide at
the three furlong marker, swung out widest in the eight path at the top of the stretch but could not get involved running to the wire. BILLYJANE stalked near
the rear three deep down the backside, made little impact three wide running on the turn and could not reach contention in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
MR CROWLEY broke quick to lead the field down the backside, set a pressured pace on the turn, repelled foe in upper stretch and cruised home
comfortably drifting out in the final sixteenth. LENNY K trailed the field into the stretch, angled out at the top of the lane, found a seam between foes in the
five path splitting rivals at the eighth pole and closed determinedly late to get up for second besting the rest. CALL MY BANKER stalked on the rail in the
early going, continued to keep pace on the fence through the turn and closed up the fence late to get up and capture third with a strong late kick.
COMMANDER JOE was brushed at the start, took closer order to horses running between foes on the turn, was in the mix for a small share at the top of the
stretch and was outfinished late settling for a minor share in the end. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE tracked the loose leader down the backstretch, pressed the
winner outside on the turn and faded in the final furlong losing positions late. ROCKSTAR RO broke out bumping foe at the start, ran in midpack three wide
on the turn making little impression and re-rallied mildly in the late stages passing some rivals. KING ALFREDO was in touch with the leaders inside at the
half, battled on the turn keeping pace with the top pair and tired between runners in the final sixteenth. DRAGON'S BREW settled near the rear widest down
the backside, offered little run three to four wide on the turn and failed to menace outside in the stretch drive. SUNSPEAR was bumped by rival at the start,
chased between in the early stages, was hustled for more run four wide on the turn and retreated in mid stretch.

Footnotes
CLIFF'S HEAD settled comfortably on the fence in midfield at the half, rallied inside on the far turn gaining on the leaders, angled three wide for the drive
and accelerated at the furlong pole to draw away at the finish. GRANDE BELLA tracked on the outside getting a good position two wide into the first turn,
prompted the pace down the backstretch, bid for the lead midway on the final turn, poked her head in front briefly in upper stretch but was not match for the
winner late while comfortably besting the rest for second money. REINS OF PURPLE travelled four wide in the first turn, was steadied between runners at
the five furlong marker, angled out widest in the six path for the drive and closed with a strong finish just missing getting up for place at the finish. ZIPPITY
DAY stalked near the rear four wide on the first turn, travelled four deep in midpack down the backside, was scrubbed on for more with three eighths to go,
rallied between runners in the final furlong and got up for a small share in the end. MERITAMEN hopped at the break seeing the field in the first turn, was
headstrong fighting the rider down the backstretch for wide outside horses, was picking up rivals through the far turn, was on hold briefly behind tiring
runners midway on the far turn and offered a good finish four wide to be involved for the minors at the finish. LADY IN RED was hustled to get the lead
entering the first turn, continued to set the fractions having a slim advantage down the back straight, was urged to keep the lead midway on the far turn, was
collared in upper stretch and faded on the rail in the last sixteenth. SMARTY ILLUSION was void of speed inside trailing into the first turn, advanced some
on the fence down the backside and showed late energy through the stretch to pass weary rivals to the wire. WAR'S END KISS was nestled behind the
leader into the first turn, had a good spot watching the top two at the half, was urged for more trying to keep up with the leaders at the three eighths pole,
was willingly between runners at the top of the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. MANITOULIN ISLAND was in hand on the rail early in midfield, was
nudged on for more with three furlongs to go, could not make up any ground and yielded in the stretch. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS stalked between rivals on
the first turn, advanced outside runners down the back straight, was in the mix for a share midpoint on the far turn and gave way with rivals on either side in
mid stretch. TENPENNY NAIL trailed the field into the field turn, was last down the backstretch, still could see the field on the final turn and was not involved
in the stretch run.
