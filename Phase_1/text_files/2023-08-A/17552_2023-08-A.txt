Footnotes
WABAUNSEE Tracked along the three path, challenged at the furlong marker and drew clear. MISSIMPAZIBLEEVAN Set the pace along the two path, was
hooked, battled some and then was no match. UNBRIDLED'S REIGN Unhurried saving ground, eased out some and rallied. E Z TOLL Close up along the
rail, altered out nearing the sixteenths pole and finished well. SWEET SUGAR BABY Five wide on the turn and failed to rally. SUBTLE GIANT Two path on
the turn and weakened. BECKY'S MISSION Four wide early, continued wide into the lane and failed to take part. REGAL REBEL Hopped at the start, close
up five wide, four wide on the bend and tired.
