Footnotes
ANGKOR sparred for the lead outside of FAVORITE OUTLAW, led narrowly turning for home, then drove clear entering the final furlong. FAVORITE
OUTLAW dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that one in midstretch. FIRE BABY broke a step slow, tracked along
the inside, failed to slip through inside of the leading pair and checked slightly when quarters got tighter approaching the nine sixteenths pole, chased while
trailing the short field in the two path around the turn and surpassed a tiring outer rival late for show. OVERBORE raced a bit keenly behind the leaders with
eleven sixteenths to go, stalked outside of them into the turn, pressed around the bend, but gave way entering the lane and faded.

Footnotes
BELLA HAZE pressed the leader from the three path, bid turning for home, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear.
FUNDAMENTALLY bumped with an outer rival before subtly shying from an inner foe at the start, shifted outside of rivals down the backstretch, tracked
from the five path into the turn, inched closer turning for home while tipping to the six path, then ran on through the lane to gain place in the final sixteenth.
GLORIETTE set the pace in the two path, met the eventual winner's bid nearing the lane, got headed by that one in midstretch, yielded through the final
furlong and lost place late. SHE'S COOL pursued from midpack in the six path approaching the turn, tucked behind foes to be two wide with three furlongs
to go, cleared an inner rival at the five sixteenths marker, cut the corner turning for home and chased evenly. SINGSATIONAL splayed her feet when the
gates sprung causing her to come out slow, raced off of the pace in the two to three path, moved up turning for home and ran on to gain a minor share.
SWEET MIMI tracked in the four path, chased turning for home while getting outmoved by an outer rival and faded through the lane. FASTA LAVISTA
BABY broke slowly, trailed the field along the inside into the turn, shifted out while picking up stride approaching the lane and stayed on willingly. YAMMY
YAMMY BELLA snagged the outer half of the gate upon leaving it, lacked speed in the four path and made little impact. SHARPER GAL hopped slightly
while bumping with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside and weakened turning for home. VIVIS IN FRONT failed to maintain
midpack position very early on and steadily faded.

Footnotes
NOM DE PLUME tracked along the inside, smoothly shifted three wide to take aim outside of the top pair in upper stretch, grinded away to bid at the
sixteenth pole and edged away. BRU NA BOINNE tracked two wide and between horses, shifted three wide nearing the lane, but was outkicked by an inner
rival while floated four wide in upper stretch, ran on in pursuit of that bidding foe and gained place late. WORK OF FICTION pressed three to two wide
around the first turn, vied around the far turn, led in upper stretch, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the sixteenth pole and lost place late.
STORM BAY settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path and rallied between horses. HOLY FOLEY raced at the rear two wide,
pursued in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the eight path entering the land and rallied willingly. PRIVATE CREDIT set the pace along the inside,
vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, got headed by that one in upper stretch and gave way. BEYOND DOUBT shied slightly from an inner rival and
exchanged contact with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and never threatened. MAGIC BUBBLES bumped with an inner rival at
the start, pursued behind the main group into the first turn but was subtly shuffled back with thirteen sixteenths to go, shifted out to the four path entering the
backstretch, ranged up four wide around the far turn, but was floated five to six wide entering the lane, weakened while drifting inwardly on his left lead in
upper stretch and faded. PEDIGEEK saved ground at the rear but to no avail. MISS PEABODY tracked three wide while tugging strongly, pursued from
within range around the far turn, but was floated four wide at the quarter pole, five wide in upper stretch and weakened while getting forced inwardly among
foes in. TWO MINUTE DRILL broke outwardly and required a firm left rein to be corrected, then steadied behind a crossing-over rival early on, pursued form
midpack along the inside, then in the three to four path around the far turn, fanned seven wide entering the lane and gave way. LEXA lacked speed three to
five wide, swung to the nine path entering the land and never got involved.

Footnotes
WEST SARATOGA showed speed three wide, cut down to the two path while dictating terms entering the backstretch, drew away from outer chasers at the
quarter pole and was kept to task under busy handling. GENEROUS TIPPER raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but lost position approaching
the far turn, tracked among foes around that bend, inched closer to regain place while shifting out entering the lane, then rallied in pursuit of the clear leader
in the final furlong, but needed more and was second best. DJANGO leaned outwardly and broke multiple lengths slow, lacked speed in the four path, took
closer order in the five path before taking contact knocking out his hind quarters at the eleven sixteenths pole, ranged up and gained ground around the far
turn, but flattened out entering the lane and held show. THANKS FRANK bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the tow path, gained between
horses at the nine sixteenths pole to press the leader from the three path and among foes into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one at the
quarter pole and faded. TOWN HALL checked from tight quarters between horses soon after the start, then was shuffled back towards the rear along the
inside around the opening hook, pulled in the four path approaching the eleven sixteenths, floated from an inner foe into an outer rival's hind quarters at that
marker, then was urged among foes around the far turn and lacked a bid. FIRST OF HIS NAME bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace
along the inside, shifted to the three path down the backstretch, but chased the main group around the far turn and failed to menace. COASTAL BRINK
prompted the pace along the inside, tracked down the backstretch and faded. MONEYSHOT tracked in the four path, moved to press at the five furlong
pole, but yielded between horses turning for home. HALLELUJAH HARRIS trailed and never got involved. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS veered outwardly and
broke many lengths slow, then got outrun.

Footnotes
SAND AND SEA pressed two wide, led around the far turn, met an inner challenge from SAHLABIYA entering the lane, sparred before drifting out and
creating separation with his inner counterpart inside the final furlong, dueled gamely through the late stages and prevailed. SAHLABIYA tucked from the four
path to the rail while achieving an inside tracking position around the first turn, loomed a danger pursuing two wide and behind the pace setter around the far
turn, bid inside of that one entering the lane, sparred through the lane but was fended off then saved place late. MUSICAL SCORE stalked in the three path,
chased the embattled leading pair from the two path in upper stretch, dueled for show with an outer bidder through the final furlong and narrowly held.
ALWAYS AT EASE laid off of the pace in the four to two path around the first turn, gained ground in the four path around the far turn, bid for show in
midstretch, dueled for that position late but just missed. MUSTANG LADY broke a step slow, laid off of the pace two wide, improved in the four path entering
the lane and moved up for a minor share late. MILLION DOLLAR CAT pursued from midpack in the five to three path around the first turn, then lacked a bid
while chasing behind rivals in upper stretch and yielded late. YO PUEDO brushed the inner part of the gate at the start, pursued from midpack along the
inside, then two path around the far turn and failed to factor. KLIMT'S MUSE steadied soon after the start when an outer rival shifted across his path, trailed,
fanned from the four path to the seven path entering the lane and made little impact. DAWNY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SEDUCE set the
pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner leaving the three furlong pole and weakened with five sixteenths to go. SCARLET STRIPE
laid off of the pace while hung in the six to four path around the first turn, took the far turn in the five path and tired.

Footnotes
CARCANO tracked in the four to three path around the opening bid, offered a bold bid outside of CONCERTED at the five sixteenths pole, sparred with that
one while wrestling an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. CONCERTED set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge at the five
sixteenths pole, dueled with that one turning for home, but was bested in the final furlong and remained well clear of show. TIZ WICKED STRONG broke a
step slow, bobbled and took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, gained inside of rivals turning for
home, stayed on while shifting out in the final sixteenth and gained show late. ACTIVE DUTY stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn while a bit
off of the inner rail, lacked a bid before fading and lost show late. ICE TIME leaned inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two
path and failed to menace. SPEED INSTITUTE leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, then checked among foes into the first turn, emerged from
among rivals soon after to press the leader two wide around the first urn, but failed to keep pace with that one at the three furlong pole and weakened
through the lane. TEXAS PRIDE raced at the rear in the three path, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, but flattened out in the five path while
bumping with an inner rival in upper stretch. ENOUGH ALREADY pursued from midpack along the inside, chased under strong urging in the three to four
path around the far turn, then bumped with an outer rival in upper stretch and faded. BOBWHITE BOBBY laid off of the pace in the three path and faded
between horses turning for home. CREATIVE WAY pursued from midpack in the three to four path and steadily faded.

Footnotes
BAY STORM tracked along the inside, awaited racing room while behind the leaders in upper stretch, produced a rail bid at the furlong grounds, led soon
after and held from an outer rival late. QUARIA COMET tracked in the four to five path, ranged up to bid leaving the furlong grounds after an inner BAY
STORM struck the front, vied with that one through the late stages but was fended off. GOIN' GOOD pressed the leader from the three path while between
horses, bid along with rivals on both sides leaving the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by those foes and chased them home. LINGUISTIC stalked
outside of the top pair and from the four path, chased between horses in upper stretch and lacked a bid. LOVE AND MONEY set the pace inside of pressing
foes while just a touch off of the inside, maintained an advantage through upper stretch, but was headed by a rail bidder inside the final furlong and yielded
between horses nearing the sixteenth pole. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) bumped with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and failed to
menace in the four path. SOUPER MUNNINGS was void of speed two wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane and made little impact. NEW BOSS
bumped with an outer foe leaving the gates, trailed along the inside, swung to the seven path entering the lane and was outrun.

WADSWORTH settled far back three wide, shifted out five wide entering the backstretch, crept closer well in hand four to five wide around the far turn,
progressed to offer a bid in the seven path entering the lane, drove clear of inner rival sin upper stretch, was confronted by bidders on either side in the final
sixteenth and narrowly lasted. HIGHWAY ROBBER checked while losing inside position early on, then steadied behind foes entering the first turn, rated at
the rear in the two path, gained in the three path and between horses turning for home, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied after bumping with an
inner rival in midstretch, surged outside of the clear leader in the final sixteenth to offer a late bid but missed. ANGLOPHILE laid off of the pace two wide
and between horses, gained three wide inside of WADSWORTH around the far turn, but was forced to await racing room nearing the lane as that rival got a
jump, bumped with an inner rival entering the lane before exchanging contact while splitting foes through tight quarters in upper stretch, aimed inside of the
now-leading aforementioned foe, bid in the final sixteenth but needed more. DESERT DUKE settled off of the pace in the three to two path, pursued
between horses around the far turn, but encountered traffic turning for home, was blocked behind foes entering the lane, searched for racing room until the
final furlong, tipped five wide nearing the final sixteenth and stayed on to gain fourth late. TALL BOY tracked three wide, bid along with an outer rival at the
five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by a wider bidder entering the lane, leaned out and bumped a rival at the furlong grounds and gave way between
hroses. LINCOLN HIGHWAY raced at the rear while caught in the four to six path around the first turn, then fanned to the seven path entering the lane and
moved up. ACT A FOOL stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole as an outer pair of rivals joined the fray, brushed with inner bidders
entering the lane and weakened between horses in midstretch. SHARAR laid off of the pace four wide, gained approaching the far turn, sustained a bid at
the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival while five wide entering the lane and weakened while being jostled between horses at the
furlong grounds. GOLDEN BANDIT tracked along the inside, got outmoved by outer rival at the three furlong pole, surpassed an inner tiring rival turning for
home, but was bumped and forced inwardly by ANGLOPHILE while attempting a rail bid entering the lane, but failed to sustain progress and gave way.
HIDDEN PATH saved ground off of the pace, retreated to trail turning for home and got outrun thereafter. WORTHINGTON set a clear pace, but weakened
inside of a trio of bidders nearing the five sixteenths pole.
