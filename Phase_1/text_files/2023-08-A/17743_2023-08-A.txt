midway on the turn, swept by the leaders at the top of the stretch, shifted in while clear, drew off and was ridden out. ELECTRIC EEL dueled inside for the
lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch run and earned the place spot. LEGENDARY THUNDER dueled between rivals for the early
lead, dueled two wide on the turn, dug in through the lane and was outfinished for second. CHARLIE'S EXPRESS dueled three wide early, chased on the
turn and finished evenly. ZAVA raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and then lacked a rally. SEE THE TRUTH chased on
the inside, continued on the rail on the turn and had no rally. DARK VICTORY chased three wide early, between rivals at the quarter pole and failed to rally.
JASPER'S PRIDE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. T V MAN was bumped and off slowly, then outrun. LEPRECHAUN chased on the inside,

UNCORKED (AUS) raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside, dug in gamely
and wore down WHITE LILACS in the final strides to prevail. WHITE LILACS set the pace on the inside, was pushed along on the backside, shook free on
the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong, dueled to the wire and yielded grudgingly. CREATIVE CAIRO raced three
wide on the first turn, settled off the pace inside, angled out three wide entering the stretch, rallied outside and closed well for third. SAIL BY tracked on the
inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled in behind the winner in upper stretch and rallied mildly inside. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) raced off the pace inside,
then two wide, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. BLUE TIMES stalked close up two wide, pressed the pace on
the backside, chased on the far turn and tired. FROSTY O TOOLE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. SWEET SURPRISE raced off the pace,
gave way and stopped.

Footnotes
BIZ BIZ BUZZ tracked on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, closed willingly inside, dueled with JUST JEREMY in deep stretch and proved
best. JUST JEREMY pressed the pace early on, then chased two wide, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed well, dug in gamely outside and battled to
the end. COMMANDING GENERAL set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, responded, dug in gamely, then was no match for the top pair and
held well for third. LIKE WHAT I SEE stalked outside, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished evenly. FULL DISCLOSURE shuffled
back in the chute, raced off the pace inside, steadied entering the turn, then rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. POGI stalked outside, went three wide
past the quarter pole and finished evenly. MAMBA ON THREE raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. KYGO (GER)
trailed the field and did not factor. AGGRANDIZE raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and faded.

off the pace, moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane and flattened out. PRINCE FILIP chased close up two wide, chased on the turn and tired.
