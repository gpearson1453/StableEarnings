THRILL OF THE NITE contended the early pace outside of SECRET HAVEN, disposed of the rival then turned back a challenge from MOHAYMEN DAY
and held under steady handling. PAULINA'S STAR swung out to the five path at the head of the lane, and closed gamely late to secure a second-place
finish. MOHAYMEN DAY stalked the dueling pacesetters while four wide, moved up alongside THRILL OF THE NITE in the final turn, and lacked the rally
needed. SWIFT SWALLOW trailed and offered a late bid. SASSY CINDERELLA stalked inside and lacked a closing response. SECRET HAVEN pressed
the early pace from the rail, was unable to move on with rival,s and faded steadily.

Footnotes
LADY KALIPA took the lead quickly and rated a clear pace, extended the advantage entering the stretch then was steadily encouraged, and held under a
late threat. ALBERTA angled inside leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly outside into the final turn, was gaining late on the leader but missed after a
game effort. GIMME THAT GIRL sat in range early, swung out in the final turn, closed steadily through stretch and was out-finished for place. PUNCH
PERFECT gave chase, bid inside, and flattened out in the stretch. GHOSTLY RUNNER broke outward, tracked the pacesetter from the four path, and
lacked a closing response when called upon. BONNIE AND MOE saved ground and lost interest.

AFTER A FEW settled in the three path early, took closer order from along the rail, drove four wide off the final turn, moved up alongside BUNNY NOREEN
approaching the stretch then kicked away. NO MORE JO KING broke outward leaving the gate, chased outside leaving the backstretch, closed well late to
get by for second. BUNNY NOREEN chased the early pace from the two path, inherited the lead into the far turn, was overtaken in the final furlong and
yielded. I SAID QUIET was gapped early, lodged a rail bid improving her position late stretch. QUICK DIAL stalked five wide leaving the backstretch, and
came up empty for the drive. MISS MCBRIDE settled in range, and lacked a solid bid. GRACEFUL SPIRIT flashed some early speed and tired. GOLDEN
FORTYNINE quickly went to the front, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, and stopped.

Footnotes
WAR GIANT raced wide entering the backstretch carrying CREDIBILITY wide, raced four wide into the far turn, was roused approaching the stretch,
responded to encouragement, and won driving. FLASHFORDANI was carried out into the backstretch, fanned four wide, rallied four wide into the stretch,
gained a slim advantage but was outkicked. BACKSTREET BOBBY shifted out to the five path in the backstretch, chased along the rail into the final turn,
angled out to the two path, was in tight between foes at the eighth pole, and went by tiring foe late. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) pressed the pace from the
rail, was brushed leaving the backstretch, gained a short lead at the head of the lane, and gave way. CREDIBILITY was carried out in the early stages,
steadied, and bid belatedly. LINCHPIN STORM dueled outside TOOL TIME for the early lead, exchanging bumps through the backstretch was unable to
move on with rivals, and faded. TOOL TIME disputed the early lead from between foes, exchanged bumps inside of LINCHPIN STORM, and faded.
GODGUNSNCOUNTRY chased in the second flight from along the rail, was steadied after the five-sixteenth pole, and retreated.
