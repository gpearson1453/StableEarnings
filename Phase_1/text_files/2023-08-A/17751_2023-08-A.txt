Footnotes
KATHERINE'S GEM was void of speed early trailing inside, advanced smartly on the fence down the backstretch, slipped up the rail at the quarter marker,
rallied angling off the fence with an eighth to run and wore down the frontrunner late to edge clear crossing the line. DIXIERIBSY took command from the
start, was pressed inside at the half , repelled the early challenger at the five sixteenths marker, opened up turning for home, was asking for the wire in the
final sixteenth, could not hold off the surging winner late but bested the rest comfortably at the finish. GLENROSA travelled near the rear two wide down the
backstretch, saved ground through the turn, burst between foes in the four path in mid stretch and determinedly won the fight for third money at the wire.
DANISH SKY settled in midpack outside three deep down the backside, could not quicken with others three wide on the turn, shifted out to be in the five
path turning for home and dueled to the wire for the show award just missing in a photo. UNDER BUDGET could see the field with four furlongs to run, could
not make any headway to rivals throughout the turn, shifted out six wide in upper stretch and passed tired runners down the lane. PRINCESS O DENMARK
was hustled early to press for the lead inside with a half mile remaining, could not find more giving way up front midpoint on the turn, and retreated inside in
mid stretch. BOSTON MABEL was reined back to watch the top pair engage at the half, was roused three wide outside runners at the quarter pole to be in
range in the four path at the top of the lane and stopped with horses on either side in the final furlong.

Footnotes
WAHRER SCHATZ broke just a half-step slowly, settled at the back racing near the inside, bided time till the far turn, moved four then five wide outside foes
on that bend, struck the lead nearing the sixteenth pole, just held off a late charge from TAKE CHANCES, who eased back from outside a rival passing the
wire the first time, tucked in saving ground on the first turn racing off the pace, angled out leaving the far turn to enter the top of the stretch six deep, ground
on steadily and was gaining late but just missed. BAREFOOT SERVANTU was in just a hair tight in the early going, settled outside mid-division two to three
deep, was guided outside a foe late up the backstretch, put to urging three then four wide on the far turn, kept on to get up for show. HIGH TREASON
tracked inside along the rail saving ground early, came out two deep on the far turn moving into upper stretch three wide, was outfinished for third.
FOREVER DANISH pressed the pacesetter from outside two to three wide applying further pressure up the backstretch, edged to the lead past the
seven-sixteenths, fought on in upper stretch, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way. DADDY'S LEGACY went straight to the fore to set the
pace inside on or just off the rail, faced pressure up the backstretch, was overtaken past the seven-sixteenths, came up empty. DANISH DYNAMITE stalked
mostly three to four wide in range of the leading pair, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
PEMBERLEY took command from the onset, opened up a touch on others throughout the turn running in hand, continued to be unchallenged in upper
stretch and was kept to the task mildly in the last furlong to hold safe in a well rated front end score. ANITA MARGARITA was content sitting off the
pacesetter outside down the stretch, continued to track the loose frontrunner on the turn, chased in vain down the lane making little headway but
comfortably bested the rest for the runners up share in the end. STATE OF MIND trailed this bunched up pack down the backstretch, took closer order three
wide between horses at the quarter pole, split rivals with three sixteenths to go and finished with intent to capture third in the final sixteenth. BRITISH
CROWN was in a good spot nestled on the rail behind the frontrunner down the back straight, saved ground through the turn losing some positioning, was
shuffled on the fence to trail briefly with three sixteenths to run and resurged between runners at the eighth pole for a small piece of the prize. COURTLY
RO stalked near the rear four deep outside horses in this compact field, crept closer four wide entering the stretch, swung out widest to the six path for the
drive to the wire and offered little finish outside to be no menace in the end. BOUDICA settled in midpack three wide between rivals down the backside,
continued three deep outside runners in mid field on the turn, rallied five wide to be in the hunt turning for home, could not find another gear to quicken with
others on either side in upper stretch and yielded between foes at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ATTABE settled off the leaders, raced outside on the turn going four then five wide, bid nearing the furlong grounds, was in command coming to the
sixteenth, held from a rallying foe. MORNING RUN bumped the inside rival at the start, settled at the back, raced off the inside into the turn, swung eight
wide turning for home, was gaining but too late. MRS. C settled in the back half, raced off the fence in the two path into the turn, moved to the rail past the
quarter pole, bid inside near the eighth pole but was outkicked. TALKING WONDERS was off the leaders going two to three wide on the turn, kept on in the
lane near the inside. BE LIKE LEIGH was ridden along three furlongs out, fanned out from four to six wide leaving the turn, needed more. BEAUTIFUL AS
YOU moved forward to track a few lengths off the leader, raced off the rail into the turn going in the two to three path, took the lead past the quarter pole,
was overtaken in upper stretch, faltered. SHAYSTOWN was bumped at the start, chased three to four wide, came out a bit turning for home, failed to rally.
CENTENARY gave one toss of the head at the start, allowed to advance willingly up the inside into and on the turn, was guided out near the quarter pole
racing in behind the leader in the two to three path, moved out a bit further at the top of the stretch, found room but produced no bid. CANTHO broke
outwardly just a bit, quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
MALIBU MAMBO had a good trip rating kindly alone in midfield down the backstretch, waited on the fence to pounce on the far turn, had running room at
the top of the lane on the rail, surged inside to take control at the furlong marker and was drawing away for the win at the finish. DUN DRUM assumed
command three wide early to clear to the rail entering the backside, dictated a mild pace down the back straight, continued up front comfortably throughout
the far turn, was clinging to the lead in upper stretch, roused when headed by the winner at the eighth pole, could not fend off the challenge and finished up
willingly to the wire holding the place share. READY FOR THE LADY was allowed to settle trailing the field in the beginning, could see the runners unhurried
down the backside, started to gain momentum outside with three furlongs from the finish, swung out widest five deep for the stretch run, could not close on
the top pair in deep stretch and settled for third crossing the finish line. GASTON kept a close eye outside the frontrunner down the backside, continued to
sit just off the pacesetter under mild fractions on the turn, shifted three wide with runners on either side at the top of the stretch to be in the hunt if good
enough, stalled at the furlong marker and faded late holding for a minor role in the end. GOLDEN GLIDER stalked near the back in the early stages in this
compact field, offered a mild move around runners three wide to take closer order to the leaders at the half, was in the mix of things in the four path
straightening out for the drive, battled between un til mid stretch and gave way to rivals to the wire.

Footnotes
STOLEN MONEY moved to the lead early, shifted in setting the pace, was challenged midway on the far turn and briefly headed, dug in along the inside,
turned back that rival and held off another's charge under steady handling. MUSKOKA GIANT brushed a foe lightly at the start, eased back and shifted in
heading into the first turn, settled off the following group saving ground, was ridden along by the half, came out turning into the stretch, loomed a threat
between runners in mid-stretch but was only second best. INFAMOUS COVERT was lightly bumped at the start, rated in behind the leader in hand and
saving ground, moved out on the far turn making a bid two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, put a nose in front, drifted out leaving the far turn and again in
upper- to mid-stretch, flattened out. COPINSAY raced up close and between runners early, dropped back. CANYOUHEARMENOW broke a step slowly,
gained forward position stalking from outside three wide, failed to rally. BOX N SCORE was no factor racing at the back and off the inside.

HOT CARGO took control down the back straight, set the fractions through the turn, opened up on others turning for home, shifted to the rail under a drive
at the furlong pole, was getting leg weary asking for the wire in deep stretch and just held at the wire in a photo. DOMER ALLURE was bumped lightly inside
to begin, settled near the rear in the early stages of the race, swung out widest a clear run in the six path outside horses at the top of the lane, found her
best stride late and was full of run in deep stretch just missing getting up for the win at the finish. WEEHAWKEN settled on the rail watching the leader in the
beginning, waited on the turn nestled behind the frontrunner on the fence, angled out to the four path looking to be the main threat straightening out for the
stretch run, shifted inwards under right handed urging in upper stretch and was gaining slowly to the wire but had to settle for show money in the end. SHE
MAKES A POINT travelled in near the back with runners on either side early on, started to pick up rivals commencing at the three furlong marker, shifted in
the five path for the drive, angled inwards to the rail in mid stretch and was gaining late in the final sixteenth. INSCRUTABLE was void of early speed trailing
down the backside, could still see the field unhurried through the turn, was willingly down the lane and showed good late energy to pass multiple runners
finishing to the wire. SARAH'S DANCER lightly bumped outside foe at the start, tracked in between horses three deep down the back straight, started a run
three wide to be in with a chance at the quarter marker, continued to sustain a run until the sixteenth pole and stalled in deep stretch. MO TOURING was
four deep outside horses tracking in the second flight, made little gain four wide outside throughout the turn, angled five wide for the drive to be involved for
a share of the prize in mid stretch and levelled out late. WINGS FROM ABOVE prompted the pace just outside, was scrubbed on for more trying to keep up
with runners three furlongs remaining, continued to be in range of the leaders between foes in upper stretch and weakened in the lst furlong. I HAVE AN
IDEA tracked two wide in the second tier down the backside, lost position between foes at the three eighths marker to be shuffled back on the turn and
could not get involved on the fence running to the wire. MARALINGA settled three deep outside in the third flight early on, offered a mild run at the half until
the quarter pole and had nothing to show inside for the stretch run. SERENADING HALL stalked in the third flight on the rail down the backstretch, could not
keep pace with others on the turn losing ground on the fence and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
PLEASURE'S GOLD was bumped into a foe lightly at the start, moved up near the inside into the far turn, was off the rail moving out further coming past the
quarter pole, shifted seven deep into upper stretch, found the best stride late after drifting in and bumping a rival past the eighth pole and rapidly drew away
through the final sixteenth. HAI BOBBI was bumped lightly at the start, moved forward inside to the lead after a sixteenth and well clear into the turn, drifted
out turning for home and again after weakening past the eighth pole. HAPPY VALENTINE was well-positioned staling the leaders, advanced four wide on
the turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch having come out a bit, was bumped past the eighth pole, kept on between. SPIDER BELLE was forced in to a foe
at the start and generally bothered, slow to gather into stride, raced toward the back off the inside, fanned widest of all into upper stretch, rallied nine deep
outside but too little too late. DIAMOND CRUSH settled off the pace, began to pick it up on the turn moving out from four to five wide on that bend, came
into upper stretch eight deep, ran on with mild late kick between foes. SOUPER FLASHY broke inwardly bothering foes, was ridden along early on the turn
going three to four wide on that bend, shifted in once in upper stretch, ran on evenly. HELL N WILD stalked off the loose leader early, advanced to make a
mild bid three wide, altered out late. I'M INTO MISCHIEF was well-placed into the turn racing near the inside, came out in upper stretch, steadied on heels
as a rival drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole. SOUPER PECAN was shut off and forced in at the start consequently spotting the field several lengths, was
not a threat. PROUD SPEAKER failed to menace while racing just off the inside. FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDER HAPPY VALENTINE
AGAINST PLEASURE'S GOLD AND THE RIDER OF I'M INTO MISCHIEF AGAINST HAI BOBBI, THE FIRST OBJECTION WAS NOT ALLOWED BUT
WITH RESPECT THE SECOND, HAI BOBBI WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED EIGHTH BEHIND I'M INTO MISCHIEF FOR
INTERFERENCE.

PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) settled in last with rivals on either side entering the turn, made steady gain three wide between foes at the half, shifted out to be
five wide with clear running room at the top of the stretch, wore down foes in mid stretch and had enough to hold for the win at the wire. TRADING BAY
broke sharp for the lead early on, was taken back sharply in tight surroundings on the fence nearing the five eighths marker, rated behind the front pair on
hold inside throughout the turn, looked for clear running room at the top of the lane, finally shifted out five wide for clear run at the eighth pole but could not
quicken enough late to get the winner at the wire. BREATHING FIRE was brushed at the break, pressed between foes for the front early down the back
straight, assumed command inside on the turn, was collared outside by runners turning for home, stubbornly fought on inside down to the wire and re-rallied
to capture third in deep stretch. MRS. GREEN emerged with the lead three deep outside down the backstretch, was content to sit just off the inside
pacesetter through the turn, had a brief lead between runners at the quarter pole and was evenly to the finish in the final sixteenth holding for a minor role.
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE was brushed at the start, stalked near the rear down the backstretch, had a good position tracking the top pair three wide outside on
the turn, bid three wide for the lead at the top of the lane, had a slim lead with three sixteenths remaining, battled through the stretch and faded nearing the
wire in a close finish for third. GLORIANNIA settled in the middle of the field down the backside, could see them all when the field bunched up at the half
travelling comfortably on the fence, swung out widest in the seven path for the drive to be in the mix but needed more in the late stages to pose a threat.
MADEMOISELLE NOVA trailed four deep outside after the start, improved position some running into the turn, advanced four wide outside at the half,
shifted out in the six path between foes for the drive but could not make any impact running to the finish line.

Footnotes
DIOSA CATRINA settled toward the back switching off the rail, advanced outside foes four to five wide turning into upper stretch, rallied outside and edged
past late under steady handling. WELL ACTUALLY stalked two to three wide, drew even prompting the pace about the seven-sixteenths, took charge at the
five-sixteenths, drifted out a bit turning into upper stretch, was outkicked but kept on well enough to maintain the place. LA PRINCESSA POLLY shifted in
tracking in behind the leaders just off the fence, came out three wide turning for home, bid between runners, kept on late inside but needed more. VIVID
VIXEN settled off the pace and outside two to three deep, gradually advanced on the far turn, shifted to the rail near the furlong grounds, altered out late as
room on the rail became tight, ran on evenly. P. S. RISING STAR raced off the pace in the two to three path, went evenly and made no bid. NO MORE
DIAMONDS was a bit rank and pulling keenly early setting the pace, was pressured by an outside rival into the far turn, faded in the stretch. HELLUVA
HOLIDAY lacked early speed, dropped well back heading up the backstretch, swung six wide, passed tired foes. TARA LUNA raced in the back of the field
mostly three to four wide, failed to menace. THATSITTHATSALL was outside foes mid-pack three to four wide early, tired.
