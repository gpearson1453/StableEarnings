Footnotes
CARIBBEAN PLEASURE exchanged contact with Buddy Buddy leaving the gate then rated close inside, started a bid leaving the quarter pole and was
eased to the three path on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took over the final yards. ENTRY TIME pressured the pace then challenged and
took the nod two deep approaching the head of the lane, dug in under steady encouragement to put HONEYQUIST away but was caught in the final yards.
The latter closed to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the rail midway on the far turn, remained a factor
to mid-stretch but relented later yards. ALLEN CAN DO IT gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BUDDY BUDDY exchanged
contact with Caribbean Pleasure at the break then chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. FIBER STRONG engaged in
close early chase, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane. Per Stewards ruling #173, CARIBBEAN PLEASURE is disqualified from
purse money.

Footnotes
ABENDEGO took the lead nearing the half mile pole and set a pressured early pace, was met and dueled leaving the seven sixteenths and drew clear of
River Royale RVF at the quarter pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement and just lasted. PINNACLE REEF engaged in
close chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn, dug in to take second in the final yards and just missed the win. DE'S CASTLE gave
close chase, rounded the turn at the rail and was outfinished for second the final yards. ROCKING TO HOME gave chase through the backstretch, rounded
the turn about the four path, drifted toward the head of the lane then flattened stride. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn
and showed little in the lane. RIVER ROYALE R V F pressured the pace and dueled at mostly even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped
back approaching the quarter and faded off the rail on the turn. Small Paw became extremely fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

JUBASLILBALLERINA stalked the early pace off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at even terms from the three eighths, drew
clear into the far turn and drew off; handily. GHOST OF ALCINA saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn then
came along to take second later yards. FAR MORE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail and passed some rivals. XTENDED STREAK rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled
from that point, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened. SHEWEARSSTILETTOS settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five path on the far turn. HARLAN'S VALENTINE stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. LIME STAR rounded the first turn about the five path and was never a factor. JUGSY raced well
back. AFIRE saved ground. RUMORGOINGAROUND rounded the first turn about the five path and was never a factor.
