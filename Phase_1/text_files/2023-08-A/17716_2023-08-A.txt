Footnotes
STRINGS was nicely rated just off the early pace while saving ground, edged up closer entering the turn, tipped two wide heading into the lane, roused
forward to a slim lead, dueled inside of CHARMING CHARLIE in final stages, dug in gamely and refused to let rival by. CHARMING CHARLIE was allowed
to settle in the back through early stages, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, moved up into striking distance a furlong out, dueled outside of
STRINGS in deep stretch, dug in determinedly but could not get by the winner. RICKEY B was well placed tracking the embattled pair up the backstretch,
made a move three wide at the head of the lane, raced in close contention into the final furlong then evened out late. BROADWAY dueled inside of
SWAGGY GEORGE up the backstretch and around the turn, got overtaken in upper stretch and steadily weakened. SWAGGY GEORGE dueled outside of
BROADWAY through early stages, battled on around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

RAINBOW DASH was reserved and raced well off the top trio in early stages, picked up the pace nearing the quarter pole, hustled along four wide into the
lane, gathered momentum under a drive and edged by in closing strides. DO YOU BILEVE tracked the top pair along the inside up the backstretch and
continued to sit up close around the turn, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, vied for the lead past the sixteenth pole then shook free to a slim lead
and got denied in final strides. WAR MUSIC pressed the pace up the backstretch and vied for the lead with ANNIEWAY U WANT IT around the turn,
continued to battle for the lead in deep stretch and got overtaken late. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT set a pressured pace up the backstretch and dueled with
WAR MUSIC around the turn, continued to battle for the lead with the additional challenge of DO YOU BELIEVE through the lane, fought back past the
sixteenth pole then weakened late.

GUIDED ARROW broke sharp and taken under slight restraint to prompt the early pace, let put a notch late on the backstretch and dueled for the lead with
UNBOWED around the turn, shook free two wide turning for home, quickly widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady encouragement.
LEA ME BE was allowed to settle in early stages, picked up the pace late on the turn, came four paths wide into the stretch, finished with good response but
had to settle for second best. GEM COLLECTION tracked the top pair then picked up the pace three wide around the turn, came three paths wide into the
lane and ran on for a share. UNBOWED led the way by a slight edge in the opening quarter, dueled inside the eventual winner around the turn then tired in
the drive. GO FOR IT raced in the back, came two wide into the lane and had no response.

ALL GOOD TIMES was allowed to settle heading into the first turn and rated up the backstretch along the inside, tipped out and picked up the tempo two to
three wide midway around the far turn, responded willingly under a drive, dug in determinedly and swept by late. XCARET took over the lead around the first
turn and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around the far turn, opened up to a commanding lead a furlong out then got overtaken late. HOPING
FOR A RING tracked the pace up the backstretch, hustled along two to three wide around the turn, weakened off the clear leader but stayed on to prevail for
a share. SHE'S SO PRETTY was forwardly placed through early stages, chased inside around the turn, weakened off the clear leader and got edged for
show. CARRY ON was forwardly placed around the first turn and continued up close to the half mile marker, weakened, came three to four wide into the
lane and failed to threaten. GYPSY WIFE raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT STORMIN secured inside position around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, was patiently handled along the rail entering the
far turn, slipped through a narrow opening turning for home and challenged KAYLA for the lead, dueled gamely, edged away to a slim margin and held firm.
KAYLA was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid turning for home, took on the rail bid from FLAT
OUT STORMIN at the head of the lane, battled for the lead along the outside then failed to match late. MISS PEACH raced off the early pace, picked up the
tempo three wide late on the far turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch, brushed with rival then dug in along the outside and finished well.
INTERSTELLA raced near midpack then moved up closer, raced in contention and hustled along three wide going by the quarter pole, got brushed four
wide in upper stretch and gave way. KELA'S TURN raced in contention around the first turn, stalked the leader up the backstretch, chased two to three wide
in close range around the far turn, remained in strong contention a furlong out then came up empty. STONECOLD STUNNER was reserved racing in the
back, swung three wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. JUST LIKE TRISTA raced four to five wide heading into the first turn, raced off the early pace,
hustled along four wide around the far turn but failed to move on. DEMIDANU led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch,
continued on top around the far turn, got collared at the head of the lane and retreated. BOSSY MOMENT raced off the pace around the first turn, moved up
near midpack past the half mile marker, sustained bid through the early stages of the turn then dropped back. OLIVE OYL came up empty after a half.
