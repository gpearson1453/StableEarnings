Footnotes
LUBU coaxed along near the inside, shifted out to race four wide around the far turn and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. CHUBLIN dueled
for the early lead along the inside and kept on well in the drive to finish second best. LITTLE CRYBABY dueled for the early leader three wide from the
outside of foes and weakened a bit through the drive. RITZ ON BROADWAY vied between rivals early on, angled wide through the upper stretch to race
from the outside and weakened. TURBO MILLIE dropped back off the early going, raced three wide around the far turn and had no late response. PAMZ
PALACE was off very slow, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, was six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. MISS
MELODRAMATIC was hustled along early, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. ARTICUNO refused to break, stewards had an inquiry to review the start
and declared Articuno a starter.

Footnotes
LINAHASPECSHOES stalked the pace early on, moved up two wide near the quarter pole and just got up while racing from the outside in the drive. LUNITA
set all the pace to cross over from the outside, dug in late and gave way to winner grudgingly late. UNBRIDLED SASS prompt the early pace from the inside
and kept on to the wire while racing from the inside. ELLIE VICTORINA dropped back off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
had no final winning bid. HONEYCAMP raced mid pack early on, was four to five wide around the far turn and had no rally. FORTIBUG was off slowly, raced
near the inside and lacked a bid. EXPECT A CIRCUS was slow early on, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
BEARGREASE stalked the pace, raced from the outside in the drive and failed to sustain a bid.

LORD BERRIER stalked the pace, raced five wide through the upper stretch and prevailed late under all out pressure. EVEN THUNDER was allowed to
settle early, moved up into the far turn, raced six wide into the upper lane and just missed in a game effort. THE SICARII rated along early, ridden into the
far turn, raced widest in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. PYLON dueled for the early lead outside of foe and weakened in the drive. PRIMORDIAL
FEAR chased the pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. READY AND RICH was carried out through the far turn by fallen rival, checked
near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. GREAT GO GO duel along the rail, took bad steps near the three eighths pole and unseated his rider.
Stewards filed an inquiry and no change. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, PYLON HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE

PEOPLE FORCE was under a firm hold early on from the outside of rival, cleared down the backstretch, challenged through the upper stretch and held
gamely to prove best under strong handling. LOOSE GOOSE stalked the pace near the inside, moved up from the outside of rival to challenge through the
far turn, took aim into the upper stretch four deep but couldn't get by the winner to finish second best. SWING LOW was allowed to settle early on, raced
four to five wide in the stretch run and was no match for the top pair. SAGRADA RAY showed good early foot to set the early pace and tired readily in the
final stages.

Footnotes
EMILIA'S LEGACY (PER) showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. PEACE PACT
chased the early going from the inside, angled out around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. SK'S HEART was away alertly, tracked the early
leader from the outside, ridden along near the three eighths pole, challenged through the far turn and was outkicked in the drive. DON'T ANNOY ME settled
off the early pace, raced near the inside and had no final winning bid. HOME TOWN FAV raced mid pack early on, was five wide into the upper stretch and
lacked a rally. LADY AMANDA dropped back early and failed to respond.
