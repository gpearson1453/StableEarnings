Footnotes
BRAVE CITY GIRL forwardly placed early along the inside, covered up in traffic into and through the turn, steered out for room in upper stretch when
straightened for home, a bit unruly, late surge to close with determination and be up in time. RUMPUS away in good order, raced closest to the leader just
off the inside up the backstretch, continued to pursue that one into the stretch, challenged nearing the furlong grounds, gained the advantage, led late, could
not contain the winner. SWEET SASSICAIA in the second flight in the two path and outside the winner, angled three wide into the lane, some late interest to
be up for the show. TARGET VISION underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke sharp from the outside, cleared to the inside, showed the way into and
through the turn along the rail, responded briefly when confronted nearing the furlong grounds then caved in to lose several positions. TWO JET bit restless
in the gate, was last to leave, raced back off the pace off the rail, angled out to be four wide into the straight, improved position a bit without posing a serious
threat. MRS. NECAISE broke back,lacked speed, also staged a mild rally to better position a bit the final furlong. COPPER MOON within striking distance
early, three wide into the lane, had little for the run to the wire. MISS G G fidgety in the gate, hopped slightly at the break, main body outside up the
backstretch, five wide into the turn, moved toward the inside into the lane and went evenly to the wire. RAISE THE PRAISE fell back to trail after the start,
failed to menace. ZINASDESTINYVIRAGO in mid pack off the inside for three furlongs, swung five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick.

Footnotes
ADIEU LE CHAT in the second flight up the backstretch along the inside, asked along in the turn, steered three wide into the stretch when beginning to
advance, bid between horses past the furlong marker, dug in and proved best in game fashion. TANGO CHARLIE also in the second group early, three
wide through much of the turn, floated out five wide into the stretch when the winner steered out, challenged with that one with a furlong to run, led,
outkicked in the late going while clear for the place. COACH KENNY broke a bit outward, void of early foot in trailing early, came six wide for the drive,
staged a belated rally down the middle of the strip to be in time for the show. WAR SONG back off the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, cut the
corner into the lane to improve significantly then flattened out in the final furlong. PRAY IDE SING in the second flight while between the top two, angled out
when moving with that pair out of the turn, came up empty in the final furlong to finish up evenly. OVERDELIVER away well outside, dueled in the two path
through some glib early fractions, faltered the final furlong. LT. BONURA lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally when called on at the head of the lane.
TRAELEE last to leave, remained back. REECE'S PRIORITY dueled up front closest to the inside through those lively fractions for a half and stopped.

Footnotes
CANT ATTACK ARCH broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, showed the way into the turn,shrugged off nearest pursuer turning for home, stayed clear to
the wire under steady handling. FIRE VISION chased the winner up the backstretch into the turn, briefly moved closer to that one late in the turn, could do
little more with that rival to prove second best in holding sway for the place late. JUST A WIN broke out, fell back to trail, two path into the lane, rallied
through some traffic to be along for the show, slowly getting to the runner up late. BLACK ACE broke back, saved ground turn, improved along the rail into
the lane, closest to the top two a furlong out, flattened, caught for the show. JUST ANOTHER WIN lacked speed outside, five wide exiting the turn, improved
a bit. DR STRICKLANDS ACE forwardly placed early, fell back before three furlongs, some traffic midstretch. FOLLOW THROUGH back off the early pace,
moved closer from between horses late in the turn, faltered through the stretch. HIGH ARABIAN mid pack early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
WICKED TOUGH forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch inside, patiently handled while creeping closer while covered up in traffic from midway on
the turn until late in the bend, split foes entering the stretch, challenged, gained the advantage and edged away late in finishing up willingly. HOLIDAY RUN
back off the pace while toward the inside, followed the winner into the lane when moving closer, lodged a brief bid inside that rival and between horses with
less than a furlong remaining, no match late to prove second best. CHIPEEE broke well from the outside, pressed the issue into and through the turn in the
three path, could not match the top two late, came back for the show. HALF CRAZY broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn,
headed by the winner a furlong out, weakened. TRUVY'S BANDIT broke back, lacked speed for three furlongs, came four wide out of the turn, displayed
some mild late interest down the middle of the strip. WILDCATS'S MEOW forwardly placed outside, moved slightly closer while four wide through the turn,
had little for the drive. HOLIDAY FOREVER broke slowly, moved closer five wide with a move through the turn, failed to sustain that advance through the
stretch in tiring. MINE YOUR BIZ void of speed, raced outside, four wide through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. ALWAYS LOGAN lacked speed out in the strip, five wide turning for home, remained back. CHELSEA'S GLORY was finished early, trailed in.

Footnotes
CHIEF CHARLIE bothered a bit when forwardly placed in the first turn, angled in to be clear onto the backstretch, moved a bit closer just off the inside into
the far turn, engaged the leader soon after, clear in upper stretch, drifted out late under a steady left handed crop as the runner up was challenging, gained
the nod over that rival at the wire. IZZY'S BABY BOY settled off the pace toward the inside, moved a bit closer after a half, chased the dueling leaders
through the second bend, challenged outside the winner, bothered slightly when that one drifted out in the waning strides, missed. I'M D'CAT unhurried
early, slightly closer toward the inside second turn, switched out nearing the furlong marker around the tiring early leader, mild rally to be along for the show,
not a threat to the top two. BELLO CREEDO fractious in the gate, broke on top, sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way through the first turn and
up the backstretch, offered brief resistance when the winner came alongside far turn, began to gradually weaken when headed by that one soon after.
COOL INDIVIDUAL back off the pace, improved into the lane after moving around a tiring rival turning for home, not a serious threat. MIAS MOONBEAM in
mid pack off the inside, four wide far turn, went flat through the lane in lacking a closing response. EAST LEX a bit restless in the gate, fell back to trail after
the start, passed a couple of weakening foes while never a threat. COLONIST antsy in the gate, off a bit slow when a bit unprepared, remained back and
was never a factor. COMPLEX SYSTEM chased early, gave way. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF IZZY'S BABY BOY AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

CUSTOM PRAYER within striking distance into the turn off the inside, moved closer into a challenging position turning for home, engaged the leader in
upper stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. DIAL UNCLE JOEY in mid early early between foes, lost position in traffic
through the turn, four wide into the stretch, encountered additional traffic with a furlong to run, finished up willingly when clear to earn the place. THA ILLEST
DEAL broke alertly, cleared before a furlong, continued to show the way through the turn and into the stretch, responded when the winner challenged upper
stretch, dueled with that one past the furlong marker, could not match strides late, caught for the place in the final strides. RAZZ in the second flight off the
inside, came four to five wide wide out of the turn, lacked a winning kick behind the two leaders with a furlong to run. STRAY CAT STRUT broke back, was
five wide and behind horses into the lane, improved position with some moderate late interest. PALANTE shuffled back just after the start, lacked speed,
three wide into the stretch, traffic with a furlong to run, waited, finished up evenly. ST JOE back off the pace well wide, fanned six wide into the stretch,
improved a bit outside of traffic through upper stretch then flattened out in the late going. FRIEND'S DO CARE in the second flight while between horses for,
began to weaken when nearing midstretch. CARLOS'S MAMA off a bit slow, trailed most of the way in remaining back. GEM OF CARLOS in the main body
inside, waited behind traffic late in the turn, came up empty in the run to the wire. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER away in good order, chased the early leader,
began a steady retreat after a quarter.

Footnotes
CALICOCO cleared soon after the break, rated kindly while set a relaxed set of early fractions, remained clear into the stretch, held a steady advantage to
the wire while kept to pressure. RANCH WATER forwardly placed, moved closest to the winner after a half, chased that one into the stretch, could do little
with that one through the stretch, clearly second best. CREEKSIDE settled off the early pace, asked for run second turn, along for the show with a mild rally,
not a threat to the top two. MANLY DEEDS four wide into the first turn, moved up to chase the winner onto the backstretch, continued to head up the first
flight from the outside then began to weaken in the final turn. THE BOSS SOSS closest to the winner early, fell back into the second flight, had nothing left
for the drive. BUCK DOLL TAYLOR lacked speed in trailing early, failed to mount a bid. TACTICAL VISION fell back after the start, also lacked a closing
rally. Z'S GUITAR last away then bobbled soon after, finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MAN broke on top, showed the way through the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, responded when challenged
second turn, rebuffed that rival into the stretch, drew out through the stretch under steady handling. COSMIC TRAIN void of speed in trailing for six furlongs,
swung out four wide turning for home, finished willingly to be up late for the place, not a threat to the winner. STRONG EAGLE forwardly placed off the rail
but inside horses first turn, idled in the run up the backstretch while remaining in striking position, lodged a sudden move to challenge outside the winner far
turn, briefly dueled with that one then could not keep up through the stretch, caught late for the second spot. BAYOU JAM settled off the pace, raced in the
second flight the middle half, lacked a serious response in the drive, not enough for the second spot. BALLINONABUDJET broke out and lastly, continued
back, failed to rallty. RIGHTANDJUST chased the winner early well off the inside, gave way after a half.

GRACE HAZEL broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, set a pressured but soft pace the middle half, shook clear through the stretch. SWEET
ALEXIS carried out into the first turn when closest to the winner, pressured that one up the backstretch off the inside, dueled late in the final turn, could not
keep up through the stretch, clearly second best. TAP IRON FIST broke in, bumped foe, settled off the pace, came on the outside for the drive, proved no
match for the top two. PORTO DEL ACE got out into the first turn to carry out the runner up, continued forwardly for a half, came up empty for the drive.
EASY ACES bumped, squeezed back start, trailed, improved slightly without posing a threat. REINE LE FER off a step slow, raced back, failed to menace.
DELTA NIGHTS in mid pack for five furlongs, faded through the stretch.
