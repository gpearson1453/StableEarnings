prompted the pace taking a clear into the far turn being collared from the outside in upper stretch ceding grudgingly late. CAGUA slow early gave a mild rally
on the far turn, entering the picture late at mid track. KITTEN BY THE SEA pressed early then chased from the inside to upper stretch extending near the
rail hanging late. SILVER STICK STAIR tracked evenly to upper stretch lacking a closing move there. CHECK SIX played no factor. WALKIN PRINCESS
raced evenly through the far turn weakening down the lane. BEE WINGS was always outrun. AVENIDA MANANA had early speed weakening on the far
turn giving way in upper stretch.

LOVE TO ZOOM raced evenly along the outside through the turn coming five wide in upper stretch sweeping clear late from mid track. ROMANTIC
COMEDY pressured the pace dueling through the turn ceding in upper stretch staying after it late salvaging place. MY PINK BABY BIRD pressed early then
raced evenly through the turn mustering a mild response down the lane to gain a couple spots. JUST LIKE INDY slow early played no factor. RAHTID
