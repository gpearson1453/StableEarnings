Footnotes
MYFRIENDSAWINNER showed her natural speed as she jetted to the front willingly, took advantage of her one post position and raced along the rail,
saved ground through out, set the pace to her comfort level, was hand ridden down the lane and lightly encouraged as she maintained he pace and focus to
the wire for the win. OURPERFECTPRINCESS vied for the lead, settled into a stalking position, stalked the leader from the two path, was kept close to the
leader, then could not sustain the bid and chased the leader into the stretch and to the wire, second best. DEBBIES PASSAGE was off a step slow, raced
three wide, was wide leaving the turn, closed in the stretch getting up for third. SAY WHAT was off into a stalking position, stalked from the two path, raced
an even race.

MORE ROMANCE was off a bit slow, settled on the rail, edged out into the four path down the backside, launched a bid at the three eights poles, circled the
field through the turn eight wide, cleared by the quarter pole, led into the stretch, was encouraged with a right handed crop, drifted out, but had enough to
draw away and win easily. HIT'EM UP was off mid pack, raced four wide, circled through the turn, joined the front runner by the quarter pole, matched
strides with the front runner and was collared by the eventual winner who was closing o the outside, was encouraged and chased the winner down the
stretch running second best. MARTIQUE MISS was off a bit slow, raced four wide, circled the field in the turn, shifted into the three path in the stretch,
closed well. BE BO stalked the early leader, raced three wide, drew beside the front runner at the five sixteenth pole, was quickly joined by an outside foe,
matched strides, collared by another outside closer, could not sustain bid and faded. KANCANCUTIE was off slow, raced four wide, gained ground but it
was not enough today. LEPRECHAUN CHARM showed little. PIECE OF ME lashed speed then tired. VALENTINE ANGEL trailed.
