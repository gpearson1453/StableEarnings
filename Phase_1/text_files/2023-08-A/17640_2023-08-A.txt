Footnotes
WHAT'S UP MR. Z vied inside for the lead, was pressed on the backside, shook free nearing the quarter pole, responded when roused, kicked clear and
was kept to the task. IRISH RILL pulled and was steadied in the early stages, then tracked the pace, moved up inside on the far turn and rallied on the rail in
the lane. HERE COMES BILLY raced three wide early, vied four wide, then three wide on the backside, chased three wide on the far turn and held third.
GROUCH raced two wide off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn, lacked a rally and finished evenly. PAL was outrun early, angled out in the stretch
and closed belatedly outside. DUQUESNE raced three wide on the first turn, moved up three wide to contest the pace on the backside, chased two wide on
the far turn and tired. KRATOS was outrun early, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SALTIN' THE RIM raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. CASSATION steadied twice in the early stages, raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and tired. JOHNNY OIL was outrun
early and did not factor.

Footnotes
BEE BY THE SEA raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside, surged in deep stretch and was up in time.
VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD raced off the rail, off the pace, made a four wide run on the turn, bid entering the stretch, dug in gamely, put a head in front at the
sixteenth pole, led late and was caught. R GOODTIME CHARLIE chased between rivals, moved up between horses entering the stretch, steadied in tight,
then rallied between foes in the final furlong. LIVING WATER was bumped at the start, chased two wide, bid two wide entering the turn, then dueled inside,
dug in gamely and yielded in deep stretch. MAGNETRON was outrun early and did not factor. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK chased three wide, bid three wide
on the turn, dueled and tired. CAJUN MANDATE was bumped at the start, showed good speed on the inside and gave way on the turn.
