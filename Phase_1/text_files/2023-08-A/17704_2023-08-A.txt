Footnotes
RIVER CITY ROCKER took the lead shortly away from the gate, set a well rated pace to the top of the lane, responded when challenged in upper stretch
and kept on gamely. VOODOO PRIESTESS unhurried early saving ground along the fence through the turn, angled out turning for home, ranged up to
engage the pacesetter in upper stretch and could not get by. THE MONSTER IRUS tracked the pace while racing wide through the turn, circled up to mount
a bid at the top of the lane and failed to close ground in the drive. CASTLE BORN prompted the pace to the turn and flattened out. LAVERN was never a
factor.

Footnotes
MI DINERO dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn to draw clear, then widened the margin to prove best under a drive. ECHO
LANE prompted the pace three wide early, then rated two wide on the turn, then finished willingly on the inside to gain the place award. PAEZ dueled for the
lead two wide, then floated out four wide leaving the turn and faded, bested rest. TISHA was away alertly, then settled back to trail the field, then passed the
tiring rivals. COOLKID stalked the pace four wide early, three wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and weakened. LOVE IN MAY chased the
pace on the inside and weakened. NOBLE ONE was reserved early and saved ground while being no threat. NANCY MADE MY DAY chased the pace
three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
GETTIN'DOWNONIT settled off the pace in the first turn while prompting the leader, moved to the lead down the backside while well rated, responded when
called upon at the top of the lane and kept giving down the stretch in a game effort. WORLD FACTOR tracked the pace to the far turn, was set to an early
drive and kept grinding down the lane to come up just short. BLIND EYE reserved off the leaders in the early going, circled three wide turning for home and
closed well. HERE'S LIAM unhurried early to trail, rallied in upper stretch while angling out late to be gaining at the wire. JEBY chased the leaders while well
placed for the first three-quarters, made a bid in upper stretch and flattened out. ANZIO was never a threat. MO TOWN BLUES flashed brief speed setting
the pace through the first turn and came up empty. SHAMELESS APPEAL was never a factor.

Footnotes
AFTERNEATH was away alertly to set the early pace while clear and crossed over to the inside, then was kept to a mild drive to prove much the best.
FLUFFY was bumped at the start, settled back early, came six wide into the lane and closed well on the outside to gain the place award. WHITE HEAT
tracked the winner on the inside and came two wide into the lane, ran on to the wire but needed more, lost place award late. CORINTH was reserved early,
came four wide into the lane, lugged in by the furlong marker and had a late rally. ONE COOL CHICK chased the pace four wide, three wide by the quarter
pole and had no kick. ANY FOOLS GOLD chased the pace on the inside and weakened. SIPPIN' TIME was bumped at the start and lacked a rally. CHICA
MUSIC was settled on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and was empty. STATELY APRIL was checked after the start, then was not a factor.
PERTURB was off slowly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SEVEN CHANNELS unhurried in the early going while saving ground, waited patiently to the head of the lane, angled out for the drive and closed with a
rush to be up in time. WICKED FINN raced wide through the first turn, pursued the leaders from three wide down the backstretch, made steady gains to take
the lead in mid-stretch and was out-finished late. SCANNO tracked the pace down the backside, rallied in the turn, tipped out four wide down the lane to
mount a closing rally that was not good enough. GREAT BRITAIN raced three wide in the first turn prompting the pace under stout restraint, was bumped by
rival in the turn, continued on to stalk the pace down the backside, loomed up turning for home and finished evenly. CLINT MAROON (GB) well placed while
reserved off the pace along the fence and rallied mildly down the stretch. REMEMBERING WILBUR chased the pace from between horses and lacked a
response when called upon. AUCTION KINGDOM never menaced and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GOSPEL WAY pressed the pace for a half mile
and came up empty. SOCIALLONGDISTANCE sped to prompt the pace into the first turn from between horses, bumped rival while trying to get our and
racing rank, went to the lead down the backstretch and tired turning for home. CHESS'S DREAM was never a factor.

DETERMINED DRIVER was well rated early, made a three wide bid off the turn and hit the front nearing the furlong marker and drew away to prove best
under a drive. CALL ANOTHER PLAY was allowed to settle early, came three wide off the turn, then was in tight around the furlong marker and then split
rivals late under hand urging to gain the place award. CALL THE QUESTION was well placed early, made a two wide bid leaving the turn to split rivals and
gain a short lead, but faded late, held show award. LANDOFHOPEANDREAMS was allowed to settle early, slipped through on the inside leaving the furlong
marker but needed more late. FONDRE dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane. BUZZAWAY was reserved early on the inside and
lacked a rally. HIDDEN VASE dueled for the lead three to four wide and drifted out leaving the turn and faltered. MISSY BOSS was off slowly, three wide on
the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HEARTBURN stalked the pace to the far turn while racing clear of the balance of the field, took control turning for home and cleared off unchallenged.
SATISFIED reserved off the early pace to the far turn, saved ground closing along the fence and finished well. HIGH FASHION LADY unhurried early to be
well off the pace, gained ground racing two wide in the final bend, tipped out to the four path and finished with good energy. SINGALONG slow early to trail
to the far turn, began to rally into the four path turning for home, dove to the rail from behind horses in upper stretch and made up ground late. NANCY MY
LOVE was never a threat while passing tiring rivals in the lane. LOOKIN AT KISSES tracked the pace from the fence and lacked a closing kick. STORMIN'
AMANDA set the pace while under stout early restraint and weakened in the far turn. MORETHANASTORM chased the leaders from two wide into the far
turn and flattened out turning for home.

CASTAGNO was allowed to settle early on the inside, made a five wide sweep on the turn to take over off the turn, drew clear to prove best under a drive.
HROTHGAR was reserved early three to two wide, came six wide into the lane and closed well, clearly second best. NOBLE CONQUEST was settled two
to three wide, advanced five wide by the quarter pole, but had no late kick, held show award. CELERITY was settled back early, swung out seven wide
leaving the turn and had a belated rally, missed show award. BARLEEWON was rated three wide, made a four wide move on the turn but flattened out. JOE
PHILLIPS was rated early, made an early bid three wide to take over and led on the turn but weakened. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER vied for the lead on the
inside and weakened. RESIDENT LIBERAL was reserved on the inside and saved ground on the turn to no avail. VINTNER vied for the lead between rivals
and then was on the inside on the turn and tired. ELEVATED FOREVER vied for the early lead three wide, then dueled for the lead two wide and stopped.

MY BOY BLUE reserved off the early pace, rallied three wide to engage the leaders in upper stretch and prevailed in a determined drive. CHARMED (GB)
stalked the pace to the head of the stretch, took a brief lead at the top of the lane, dug-in gamely to duel through the lane with the winner and just missed.
OFFICER COUNTRY slow early to trail while patiently handled, angled wide turning for home and closed with a late rush to be gaining at the wire in a good
effort. FLY FLY AWAY tracked the pace to upper stretch, rallied from behind a wall of horses, angled down to the rail and finished willingly. LUCA DREW
THE ACE unhurried early on, commenced a rally into the turn, was steadied on the turn lacking racing room, finished evenly and pulled up lame and was
vanned off. CHEERS FOR KITTEN stalked the pace for a half mile and tired. NITRO TIME sprinted off to a clear lead after breaking alertly and faltered in
upper stretch.

PURE COURAGE was settled early, made a middle move to duel for command, then fell back on the far turn, came again the lane to draw clear late to
prove best, driving. ABAAN vied for the early lead on the inside, then dueled for command on the inside, made a bid to draw clear but was caught late in the
drive, clearly second best. IMPERIAL ASSASSIN (IRE) tracked the pace and weakened, held show award. PRESS PAUSE (FR) was settled between rivals
and had no rally, bested rest. BE YOURSELF was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally, vanned off. FLYING SCOTSMAN was settled early
between rivals and was not a threat. CLUBBING stalked the pace on the outside and tired. RISK TAKING was settled early and tired. GOOD BOY (FR) was
settled back while jumping poorly, no factor. JUST ANOTHER ONE (IRE) chased the pace and stopped.

Footnotes
GOLD CHARM (IRE) patiently handled while racing at the rear of the field to the backside on the final lap, rallied into the turn to steadily close ground on the
front-runners, engaged the leader in the drive and drew clear to the wire. CAINUDOTHETWIST well rated in mid-pack for the first mile and a half, quickly
moved to take command into the final bend, opened a clear advantage but could not hold off the winner down the lane. BERCASA (IRE) settled in hand
through the first seven jumps, moved to the leaders down the backstretch the final time and flattened out in the stretch. RIGHT TEMPO (FR) unhurried for
the first three turns and made a steady advance in the late going. CLARA BELLE prompted the pace for a mile and a half, dropped back in the final run
down the backside and passed tired rivals coming home. MET IN MIAMI set the pace for the first lap and a half and gradually gave way. DURRAGH (IRE)
prominent placed early, stopped into the final bend and was eased to the wire.
