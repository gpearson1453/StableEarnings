RAINBOW SUREBET was forwardly placed racing three wide through early stages, drifted out wider leaving the turn, sustained an outside bid through the
lane, steadily inched up closer on LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS and nailed rival on the wire. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS tracked the pace along the inside, launched
a rail bid entering the head of the lane, took over the lead, continued on top in final stages then got nipped on the wire. REMITTANCE SENT hustled up to
the lead at the start, held firm around the turn, got collared by rail running LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS near the furlong marker and weakened to show. PINK
PARTY PANTS raced up close two wide through the early going, sustained bid around the turn then flattened in the lane. SPITFIRE SUZIE raced in the last
flight, hustled along three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FLYWHEEL EFFECT raced in the last flight, came four wide into the lane and never
menaced.

Footnotes
SAMIRA tracked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, continued in contention on the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, reached the
leader in the final sixteenth, dug in gamely and edged away. SUGAR SHACK QUEEN sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace with AJS RIDE
applying pressure up the backstretch, shook free to a clearer lead entering the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued on top at the sixteenth pole,
briefly fought back when confronted by eventual winner but could not move on with rival in final stages. MY GOLDEN DAY was allowed to settle in the
opening quarter, moved up closer racing four paths wide near the quarter pole, sustained an outside bid through the lane and cleared the rest. KYNLIE'S
EMPIRE raced in range up the backstretch, moved up closer racing three wide mid-way around the turn then faded in the lane. A J'S RIDE prompted the
pace up the backstretch, chased three wide in contention around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
JAVISTHA tracked the early pace along the inside, cut the corner entering the lane, tipped two wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer, dug in gamely in
final strides and edged FIREY EMBLEM on the wire. FIREY EMBLEM stumbled at the start and recovered quickly to take over as slim, held clear around
the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued to dig in on top in final stages and got edged approaching the wire. HAIL COLUMBIA prompted the pace
in early stages, continued forwardly placed two to three wide around the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane, remained in close contention into final
stages and finished evenly. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO raced of the early pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, gained closer
contention but needed more for late impact. QUEEN CORDELIA raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide into the stretch and lacked a needed rally.
PRINCESSOFCHITOWN raced off the pace, swung four wide into the lane and failed to move on. GLORY ROLL raced up close in the opening quarter then
weakened past the half, chased three wide around the turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
NAVE quickly cleared the lead soon after the start, widened advantage still racing in hand around the turn, came two wide into the lane, pulled away from
the field under confident handling, tapped twice in the final furlong and kept to task. NICE ONE JULIO tracked the clear top pair into the turn, saved ground
entering the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but dug in to last for place. STROLLER BOY raced off the clear top trio in early stages, hustled
along four wide into the lane and just missed place. A JUST CAUSE raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and improved position.
WICKLOW LADDIE lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring foes in the lane. JUPITER MISSION was the closest pursuer of the
clear leader into the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then gave way. CAPALA raced off the pace, hustled along four wide around the turn and lacked a
rally. BLITZED IN BEE SIX chased the pace near midpack, came three wide into the lane and faded in the final furlong. CAN'T BE CAUGHT failed to move
into contention.

hustled along the rail into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. K C'S FIRST B M W chased in contention through early stages, sustained
inside bid around the turn the weakened in the lane. CALLE DE BOYD was the closest pursuer of the eventual winner, remained forwardly placed around

Footnotes
BILLY BOB ROCKET steadily edged up closer along the inside up the backstretch, waited patiently for a clear path around the turn, tipped two wide heading
into the lane, vied with FRANKLY EPIC to the furlong marker then took over and finisihed going away. FRANKLYGREAT tracked the pace in the opening
quarter then moved up the inside to challenge HANDSOME STRANGER for the lead late on the backstretch, vied around the turn then shook free turning
for home, took on the challenge from BOLLY BOB RICKET, fought back to the furlong marker then failed to be a match and finished second best. PRIZED
TAP bumped with rival at the start, raced up close in opening quarter then weakened mid-way around the turn, made a rebid along the outside in upper
stretch and prevailed for a share. BILLY WHO lacked early speed, came wide into the lane and improved without threatening. HANDSOME STRANGER led
the way up the backstretch, vied with FRANKLY EPIC around the turn then gave way in the lane. POE MANS RIDE raced in range up the backstretch, given
cue three wide at the quarter pole, ran on into upper stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCKYHOTSTUFF tracked the pace up the backstretch, edged closer along the rail late on the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, reached CONFETTI
BETTY near the sixteenth pole and edged away. CONFETTI BETTY vied for the lead with CENTERFOLD up the backstretch then shook free mid-way
around the turn, continued to lead the way along the inside into stretch run, dug in under pressure but could not hold off LUCKYHOTSTUFF in deep stretch.
TAPTHATLUCK raced off the early speed then picked up the tempo along the outside late on the turn, swung wide into the stretch run, sustained an outside
bid and gained a share. CENTERFOLD vied outside of CONFETTI BETTY up the backstretch, could not match strides past the midway point around the
turn, ran on into the lane and got edged for show. KASA lacked early speed and raced in the back, saved ground and gained closer contention along the
inside into upper stretch then flattened late. SHELBY TO raced in range in the opening quarter, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
BARBED WIRE raced off the early pace, saved ground then swung four wide into the drive and never threatened. SHY RUNNER was forwardly placed up
the backstretch, sustained a three wide bid around the turn then came up empty in the lane.
