exchanged bumps and prevailed. TEE ROY vied throughout, was in tight and exchanged bumps in the stretch and was outfinished in a good effort.

W F JAZZ CAT bumped at the start, vied to the turn and gave way. TOO HOT FOR YOU raced close to the pace, went five wide along the backstretch,
rallied into the turn, bid and came up empty. GEEBEESBIGBOY came in at the start, pressed the pace, dropped inside on the turn and stopped. EL OCHO
dropped inside, raced mid pack, was not urged in the stretch and showed little. HOLLYWOOD DAX broke slowly, bumped and was pinched back at the

Footnotes
IZA DADDY was unhurried early, raced in the back, rallied into the turn, bid five wide, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. DUBRONSKY was
sent to the front to set the pace past the sixteenth pole and was outclosed to finish second best. SWITCHERONIMO raced close to the pace while wide, had
nothing left for the drive, lacked a bid and held safely for show. I'MAGAMBLER was unhurried early, saved ground, angled out on the turn, swung wide and
lacked a bid. LOOKING FOR BULL was never far back, stopped on the turn and dropped back. TRIPP A MATIC pressed the pace to the second turn and
stopped. BEAR BRIAN was through after a half, stopped, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
INDIAN EXCELLENCE pressed the pace along the inside, fell back and angled out on the turn, bid five wide, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get
up late. TURN ON ARCH pressed the pace, rallied three wide between horses on the turn, assumed commuand into the stretch, led to deep stretch and
was outfinished in a good effort. RESTLESS MOVER raced close to the pace towards the outside, rallied four wide on the turn to challenge, dueled for the
lead, didn't have enough late and settled for show. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY vied two across to the turn, dropped back and gave way. NO REGRETS N LOVE
vied inside to the turn, dropped back and gave way. RAISE OUR FLAG bumped at the start, was slow early, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked a
response. SPECIAL PRIDE broke out and bumped at the start, saved ground in an even effort and was outrun.
