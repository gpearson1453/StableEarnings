LASTFORTINOFAMILY hustled along to vie for the early lead just off the inside, moved ahead and took the rail after two furlongs, was roused again with a
quarter mile to go, opened up in the lane and held sway under steady handling. HIGHLY PERFECT forwardly placed inside, found himself boxed in along
the rail on the bend, gained a clear path two wide at the top of the stretch, moved clear for second then closed the gap on the leader too late in the waning
yards. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS was a step slow at the break then bumped, raced in contention from paths two or three, drew away for third upper stretch
and was also making up ground on the leader inside the last eighth. EMPTY HOLSTER was prominent from outside for a half mile then began to gradually
yield. A BOLD RYDE broke inward, bumping ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, vied for the lead between rivals, began to retreat as he drifted out to path four into
the lane then steadily gave way.

BACKSHOT shared the lead outside WINGING WAYS from the beginning, was two wide through the bend, battled in the lane and gradually edged ahead
the final sixteenth. WINGING WAYS vied for the lead from inside, fought gamely in the stretch but slowly wore down the last sixteenth. ROAD GAME broke
outward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, moved out three wide midway on the backstretch, rallied belatedly outside the top pair in the stretch but was
unchallenged for the show. W W RUSSIAN GOLD chased from path three, lost ground, staying outside KING TITO entering the stretch and only made up
minor ground the last furlong from path six. KING TITO bumped and forced out some at the break, soon moved out widest of all, was four wide taking the
bend, floated out a bit further at the top of the stretch and had no late bid. CHANGE DIRECTION was bumped, forced in and squeezed between rivals, was
steadied, soon well back and showed little.

STUMP bumped just after the break, shared the early lead from inside, did not keep up nearing the quarter pole, swung out leaving the bend, rallied from
path four in the lane and got up in the waning yards. TAPIT SAM vied for the lead from between rivals on the backstretch, was two wide on the turn, gained
the rail into the stretch, fought with SHANGHAI POINT for the advantage, bumped and leaned on the latter nearing the wire and was outfinished in a game
effort. SHANGHAI POINT a step slow at the break, was soon prompting the pace from outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, battled through the
lane, began to slowly yield deep stretch and bumped with TAPIT SAM nearing the finish. ONE WAY HOME was squeezed and shuffled back shortly after
the start, moved to the outside, stayed off the rail through the turn, angled out to path five upper stretch and had no late bid. SIRCORRI advanced from
inside on the bend, fanned out to path three for the drive and steadily faded. TIZRIK lugged in some just after the break to bump ONE WAY HOME,
displayed early speed between rivals, was steadied back from tight quarters into the turn, altered out four wide and steadily gave way.

JACK VAN BERG was quickly clear, showed the way just off the inside, floated out some entering the lane, put to a drive upper stretch and kept LITTLE
MIGHTY MAN at bay under steady handling. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN rated from outside, moved clear for second from path three on the turn, lost a bit more
ground staying outside JACK VAN BERG into the stretch, was closing the gap belatedly in the late going but proved easily second best. D' YANK chased
from inside, was just off the rail through the bend and passed between tired ones midstretch. TAP'S BIG SHOT hustled along from the start, raced in the
second flight between rivals on the backstretch but began to fade two wide on the turn. CRANKSHAFT was an early factor, did not keep up along the rail on
the turn and steadily gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
UNCLE O. G. rated on the front end from inside, drew off when let out on the second bend, was roused leaving that turn, drifted out some inside the last
furlong, held a straight path the final sixteenth and maintained control. DRAGGING MAIN bumped shortly after the break, progressed four wide on the
backstretch, angled in on the second turn, took over second along the rail, floated out to path four entering the lane, closed the gap some on UNCLE O. G.
as he drifted out upper stretch, kept a straight path the final eighth, leveled off but proved easily second best. NOBLE CREEKER was bumped by
MARCHING ORDERS at the start, bounced off of DRAGGING MAIN then back into MARCHING ORDERS, gradually advanced just off the inside, angled
out to path seven at the top of the stretch, lodged a mild bid and caught ALPHA LEA for third nearing the wire. ALPHA LEA settled early, picked up his pace
from inside after a half mile, came into the lane from just off the rail, moved clear for third while gaining a striking position upper stretch but leveled off inside
the last furlong. SPAN reluctant to load, dropped back from between rivals on the backstretch, was widest taking the second bend and passed tired ones the
final eighth. LELAND JOHN vied for the early lead outside UNCLE O. G., did not keep up after a half mile, floated out to path five into the lane, drifted out
under left-handed pressure midstretch, was steadied and continued to fade. MARCHING ORDERS stumbled inward, bumped NOBLE CREEKER then was
bumped by that one a few strides later, took the first bend four wide, improved position some three wide on the second turn, swung out to path six for the
drive and had little to offer. WAVE THE GOLD steadily gave way from between rivals once on the backstretch, angled in on the second turn and was empty
for the stretch run.

Footnotes
IGGY BIGS gradually angled in as she vied for the early lead, moved clear nearing the end of two furlongs, took the rail soon after that, was challenged
upper stretch, dug in and and shook free inside the last eighth. GHAALEB'S CITY contested the pace inside IGGY BIGS at the start, did not stay with that
one nearing the end of a quarter mile, moved outside the latter, rallied to vie again for the lead upper stretch but could not sustain her bid inside the final
furlong. GOLDICAT forwardly placed from inside, angled out three wide for a clear path midway on the backstretch, stayed in that path through the bend
and found best stride too late deep stretch. MOON PIES IMAGE chased from inside, was just off the rail taking the turn and failed to have a stretch bid.
GHAALEB'S RANGER chased from outside and failed to menace. SHINE DOWN unruly in the gate, dwelt then swiped the gate breaking in the air, was
hustled along but never a factor in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
NOT TO BE DENIED shared the early lead from just off the inside, moved clear on the backstretch, had the rail on the second bend, floated out some into
the lane, was put to a drive, lugged in some deep stretch but held sway. BLAME TERI pressed from just outside NOT TO BE DENIED, moved clear for
second on the second turn, battled through the stretch, lacked the needed late kick but lasted for the place. CARSON RESERVE well placed from inside,
did not stay close on the second bend, rallied from inside the last two furlong, lost her path with less than seventy yards left, altered out some and narrowly
missed for second. ORNERY ANGEL boxed in early, gained a clear path three wide with a half mile to go, improved position on the second turn, fanned four
wide entering the lane, threatened midstretch but leveled off in the late going. WARM BEAUTY was steadied back from crowding shortly after the start,
saved ground on both turns, altered out widest at the top of the stretch, surged the final furlong but was too late. CANDY LOOKER chased from paths two or
three, angled out five wide upper stretch and only made up minor ground inside the last eighth. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE was an early factor from outside
but faded two wide on the second bend.
