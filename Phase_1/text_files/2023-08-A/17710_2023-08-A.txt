quarter pole, vied between foes past the eighth pole and weakened late. DOLLAR BILL was bumped after the start, never threatened while racing two and

Footnotes
GREAT ANALOGY had a slow start and was hustled along while behind and inside early, took an awkward stride into the turn, tipped out to the three path
while under a drive into the lane, rallied between foes into the final furlong, and was up in the closing stages. OLGA stalked from the five path into the turn,
bid while being floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an inner foe late to place.
BLACK BELT BARBIE tracked in the three path, was roused early into the turn, fanned out to the nine path entering the lane, and kept on for show. SHE'S
A JOY raced off the pace in the three path, was urged from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. GO LIL LADY set the pace in the two path and was
put to a ride into the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and yielded passing the eighth pole. LOOKING FOR HOPE got bumped by an
outer foe at the start, pressed in the four path, bid rounding the turn, but gaveway entering the stretch. TRIBUTE was fractious in the gate, broke in and
bumped an inner foe, chased in the four path but failed to menace.

BIG BALLOONS tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained through the lane, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead late. BLUE SOLDIER raced
in range two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was outkicked late. VOY Y VENGO dueled two wide between foes to the
sixteenth pole and held well enough for the show. LUCKY DONNIE G dueled at the rail to the rail to the sixteenth marker and weakened a bit late. DOC
BALLARD was devoid of speed inside, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. CORPORATE AFFAIR saved ground off the pace, tipped out in
upper stretch and a mild gain while in somewhat tight at times. GREAT KOSTAS failed to menace while racing five wide. KRAZYKATKOUSIN dueled three
wide and faltered in the lane.

GRAND VALLEY rated in the three path, swung out to the eight path into the lane, and rallied down the center to get up in the closing stages. THE RED
MAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, bid from the three path into the stretch, brushed with the inner pacesetter
passing the eighth pole, ran on and led passing the sixteenth, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. ETERNAL FLAME bumped with an inner foe at
the start, chased in the four path ranged up and was in the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. TORETTO set the pace inside, was
roused passing the quarter and tipped out to the four path into the lane, brushed with an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and faded. SMOKIN CLOUD
bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, but lost ground between foes early around the turn, and did not factor. FREELANCE trailed
along the inside early and never threatened. CHURCHILLS VICTORY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked inside but weakened down the stretch.
CHURCHILLS VICTORY RACED WITH NO FRONT SHOES.

Footnotes
RASTANI stalked the pace inside, bid at the rail early on the turn, took the lead leaving the three-eighths pole, was headed by SWEET TEMPTATION near
the quarter pole, dueled inside of that foe to deep stretch and prevailed. SWEET TEMPTATION tracked the pace outside, bid three wide nearing the
three-eighths pole, took a short lead near the quarter pole, dueled outside of the winner from there and was narrowly outfinished. DIVINE prompted the early
pace outside, took the lead nearing the turn, led in the two path past the three-eighths pole, could not keep pace with the top two from there, tipped out in
upper stretch and kept on to narrow the gap late. UNCAPTURED DOVE set the early pace two wide, chased around the turn and faded after a half.
APPEAR was outrun inside. ARZAG had brief speed four wide. MILLENNIUM PARK had early speed three wide, retreated around the turn and was eased
through the stretch.

for the show. CAJUN FANTASY dueled two and three wide, drifted in in midstretch and weakened. LIGHT AND PATH failed to menace while racing two
wide. EILAT dueled inside to midstretch, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and dropped back. ANTRIM trailed inside. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER

Footnotes
MARTHAMAYWHOVIER bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced prominently inside of foes in the two path, took control while in hand midway around
the turn, was cued at the top of the lane, and dug in along the inside to hold off an outer foe. FOREVER UNCAPTURED bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked in the six path, ranged up around the turn and bid while tipping into the three path entering the stretch, ran on, but was denied to place.
NOVELLIE tracked in the four path, was under rousing from the three path around the turn, swung out to the five path for the stretch, and finished evenly for
show. LAVEAU chased in the six path, was driven from the five path into the lane, but made no impact. FOR THE THRILL raced off the pace in the two path
and did not threaten. J J MONET bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace from the six path into the turn, but yielded from the four path turning
into the stretch. QUICKSTYLE bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path and never menaced. SOPHIA LAUREN was wellback in the five
path and never a threat.
