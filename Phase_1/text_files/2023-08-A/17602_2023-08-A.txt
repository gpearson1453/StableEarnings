Footnotes
THUNDERS ROCKNROLL was quick to begin from the outside to cross over to the rail early on, challenged through the upper stretch and kicked on gamely
to be clear late under strong handling. MORGS WORLD was hustled along early while racing off the early pace, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch
and kept on gamely to the wire. CALY BALI was off slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, rushed up two deep to challenge the early
leader from the outside and weakened in the final stages. CAJUN NINJA coaxed along early, raced two deep past the three eighths pole, angled five deep
through the stretch run and raced evenly late with no closing run. HEATIN UP was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced near the rail through the far
turn and faded. WEST SIDE GIRL was void of early speed, raced far back and trailed.

FIRE SWORD vied for the early lead from the inside and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. BIG LEAGUE BENNY chased the early pace,
raced along the inside around the far turn, angled to race from the outside in the drive and got up for the place position while racing from the outside.
CANNONBALL COMIN pressed two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CANONIZE raced mid pack early on, raced five wide into the upper
stretch, shifted in and raced even late with no closing run. GAINER dropped back off the early going, raced two to three wide in the lane and lacked a bid.
BOTANY was off slowly, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and never threatened.

HURTS SO GOOD vied for the early lead two path and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. HI YAH was coaxed along to chase the early leader
and kept on to the wire racing three deep. YO DAWG was off slowly, raced near the back after the bad start, raced near the inside around the far turn,
angled to race from the far outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly. RIDING THE TRAIN hustled along early, raced two to three wide around the far
turn and was outkicked in the drive. SAINT CHARLES dropped back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. DIVE DEEP
coaxed up along the rail, checked early from the inside, shuffled back into the far turn and faded.

EISENSTAEDT showed good early speed along the inside, patiently handled around the far turn and drew off to be well clear under strong handling.
SIGNOFTHECROSS tracked the early leader two deep early on, hard ridden through the far turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. WORDS OF
WISDOM stalked the pace, raced three deep near the quarter pole, took aim into the upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. ASTRONOMICAL settled
mid pack, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. BOB'S ALL IN void of early speed, raced near the inside
around the far turn, angled five deep in the lane and had no rally. MR NAVIGATOR dropped back off the early pace, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and lacked a bid.
