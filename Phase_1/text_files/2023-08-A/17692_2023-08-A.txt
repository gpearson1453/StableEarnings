Footnotes
NOMO RON gave chase and raced close in the three path on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take over later yards and drew clear approaching
the wire. ZIGGY MON chased the early pace toward the inside, was eased five wide through the turn then steadily improved to take second the final yards.
STEVETHEVANDRIVER took the lead nearing the half mile pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths but was met in
later yards and flattened nearing the wire. BIG DADDY D R gave chase toward mid track, steadied off the heels of Barry Karafin Bets past the quarter pole,
raced in the five path through the turn then finished evenly to pass rivals. BE BE BOP gave chase, raced in range of the lead at the rail on the turn then
flattened later yards. FLAMING EAST chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
AW ITE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. BARRY KARAFIN BETS was shuffled back on the chute then gave chase,
rounded the turn about the five path and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
CONNECTING FLIGHT raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead leaving the five eighths pole and repelled Marquet Classic from the seven
sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled while wavering paths in the lane. NELLY TOO saved ground off the pace, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and raced close at the rail on the far turn but steadied from tight quarters at the rail in later yards. THE MONEY MACHINE
took the lead while tapering to the inside but was met into the first turn, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths
and ran evenly in the lane. HERECOMES SCARLETT rated close inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
ran evenly in the stretch. RIA FORMOSA broke a step slow and raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and raced evenly in the lane. MARQUET CLASSIC stalked the pace from the three path,
challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. JERSEY COAST saved
ground and showed little response. ECLIPTICALS SHORTY was eased after a half mile. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the
rider of Connecting Flight for alleged interference in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Nelly Too.

Footnotes
CIDERHOUSE WAY settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and race in the four path on the far turn, dug in past
the eighth pole and took the nod under the wire. SUMMONING DENIS rated a slim early lead inside, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole and
raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was nipped under the wire. ALDARIGHTTRICKS rated close inside on the
first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then flattened the final
sixteenth. JUST CALL ME AL raced with the early pace two deep, challenged leaving the half mile pole but dropped back past the three eighths, rounded
the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. MOON FALL rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and weakened in the lane. SCARE DEM settled two deep on the first turn then eased out
entering the backstretch, gave chase passing the seven sixteenths pole, eased to the five path on the far turn and showed little further. I SEE NOTHING
rounded the opening turn in the five path, picked up the chase past the half mile pole but dropped back toward the three eighths and weakened approaching
the far turn. RED SPEAK PLEASE saved ground and was through early.
