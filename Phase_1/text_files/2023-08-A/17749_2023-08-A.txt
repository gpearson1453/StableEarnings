FLAG RAISER bore in at the start bumping the runner up, battled for the early lead two wide, took over after a quarter, set the balance of the pace and
widened through the stretch under strong urging to win as much the best. PROSECUTOR was bumped and forced inward at the start, chased the pace in
the four path and finished clear for second. CHOCOLATE RABBIT never far back, went evenly two wide. INDY CARR trailed into the stretch, swung wide
and passed tiring rivals in the eight path. CHILTEPIN failed to menace. BLAKE'S RYEN contested the early lead along the inside, chased the pace for a half
then gave way. THE RIDER OF PROSECUTOR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FLAG RAISER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
AT THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

DIAMOND DUST prompted the early pace three then two wide through the turn, gained a narrow advantage at the top of the stretch, was asked with right
handed urging nearing the furlong marker and edged clear late under brisk handling. MR LOOOCH stalked the pace from the three path into the stretch,
rallied two wide through deep stretch and finished second best. ALTISSIMO stalked the pace four wide, drifted entering the stretch and finished with good
courage in the six path. FAIR AND SQUARE drifted in at the start, rushed to the lead inside rivals, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then was
outfinished. DOUGIE D ORO wide early, inched closer four wide on the turn then came up empty. MEDIA DARLING was antsy in the gate, pressed the
early pace two wide, retreated on the turn and jogged to the wire.

CANDLELIGHT HOURS stalked the pace three wide while out in the seven path down the backstretch, angled inward on the far turn, rallied to make the
lead three wide at the top of the stretch, drifted in nearing the furlong marker, was corrected with left handed urging and drew clear late. SONNET set the
early pace off the rail in the five path, bumped with I RECALL repeatedly past the half mile marker, kept pressure two wide into the stretch, was in tight near
the furlong marker and finished second best. I RECALL dropped the runner up before a half, was bumped repeatedly by that one nearing the far turn, set a
pressured pace to the top of the stretch, was in tight at the furlong marker, altered course to the four path and was outfinished. MARKET SUCCESS raced
widest of all and lacked the needed response. SHE'S CRAFTY was no threat. AUNT BEE was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SONNET LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
I WANNA WIN away alertly, set the pace off the rail in the four and five paths into the stretch, was headed by the runner up nearing the furlong marker then
fought back gamely under left handed urging to get back up in time. TANTRUM never far back, rallied two wide into the stretch in the seven path, gained a
narrow lead near the furlong marker and just missed hanging on. SILENCE saved ground and went evenly. FOREWARNED failed to menace. OAKS
HONEY chased thew winner two then three wide into the far then weakened. SAMMY'S SMILE raced widest of all and stopped on the second turn.
