Footnotes
CRANKY SHEILA stalked the front runner from the three path, launched a bid at the three eights pole, cleared the leader at the five sixteenth pole, was in
full control at the quarter pole, drew off with no contest for the win. THE X FACTOR was off in the middle of the field, launched a bid at the three eights pole,
raced in the four path, was i full stride by the quarter pole, was under heavy encouragement in the stretch, was closing in on the eventual winner with each
stride, was about to take the lead and ran out of room, earning a game second place finish. MALLORI'S MAGIC was off a step slow, trailed the field early,
made one run, building momentum with every stride, shifted into the four path when she launched a bid at the three eights pole, continued to gain ground,
closed down the stretch hitting her best stride but could not get to the lead in time today. ABBEY CAKES took back early on, settled into the middle of the
pack, raced in between foes, showed little late. IZEADISTORTEDLADY vied for the lead, set the pace while racing n the rail, showed the way then started a
steady retreat at the five sixteenth pole. CONTEMPO GRAY raced from mid pack, saved ground and raced on the rail, improved position a bit then had no
late kick. SENSING GOLD raced five wide, on the outside of the second tier of horses, moved up but could never really get involved. BABY YOUR
PERFECT trailed, inside, no impact. QUARANTINED stalked the pace while racing on the rail then tired.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC CONTROL was forwardly placed along the outside of the pace setters, rated, raced four wide, was allowed to inch forward and take the lead in
the turn, willingly took command, was given the cue at the quarter pole and drew off easily for an un contested win. PEPPERONIKID raced five wide and
improved position from mid pack, gained ground through the turn, had cleared the second front runner by the quarter pole, but was no match for the winner
but still ran a game second. CLASSIC RUNNER raced in the six and seven path, was off the pace and allowed to settle, launched a bid at the half mile pole,
found his stride, was seven wide as he circled the field through the turn, was encouraged down the lane and responded well out finishing the rest. MESABI
vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace early, could not sustain the bid and gave way. MIDNIGHT HUNTER stalked the front runner from the three
path, then faded early. RED RAIDER XPRESS trailed the field early on, raced wide through the turn and made a mild bid late. MORO'S BULL CREEK raced
from of the pace in the three path but to no avail. SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE raced from mid pack along the rail and ran an even race. DIRECTIONAL was
off mid pack, raced three wide behind horses, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, then faded in the stretch. JUST HANGIN RIDGE had an awkward
start, still vied for the lead, raced on the rail then faded.

Footnotes
DANCIN N THEPULPIT stalked the front runner from the three path, was took back and asked to rate behind horses, willingly waited through the turn, was
given the cue deep in the furlong ground and easily jumped up and took over putting away the rest and taking the win. LOVELY JOYCE was off of the pace
in the early goings, raced six wide and improved position, passed through the middle of the field while still gaining ground, came to the quarter pole, was
asked to close and did so handily getting up for second. ZEEROCK trailed the field by many early on was allowed to settle, coasted along the rail until the
half mild pole, found his stride and started gaining, was in touch with the field by the three eighths pole, shifted out to circled the field on the outside, not
taking any chances on braking momentum, closed down the stretch. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF stalked the pace from the five path, maintained the position into
the middle of the stretch and put in a mild bid late. RECLAIMED vied for the lead, raced in the two path, led the others while setting the pace, was
challenged and battled in the stretch but did not have enough today. LAYLA'S SONG raced off of the pace early, improved position, launched a bid at the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path, cleared the rest and took the lead at the eighth pole, was racing in front for a few stride then was collared by
another fast closing contender and faded in the last five strides. BELL PEPPER raced in mid pack, traveled in the four path, was in between foes, raced
through the turn in between and behind horses shifted into the rail in the upper stretch and closed well, got behind a wall of horses in the last sixteenth of a
mile and lost momentum looing for room, finished flat. COUSIN VICKIE raced in mid pack in the five path, advanced along the outside, the faltered.
BEULAH K flashed early speed. HALF SCOUT vied for the lead, was asked to rate off of the pace and stalked closely behind, raced in the four path and
was in contention then stopped at the quarter pole. PETULA was off in the middle of the field, raced on the fence and faded.

Footnotes
GREEK HEIRESS was off in the middle of the filed, raced on the rail saving ground through out, cut the corner and closed on the fence in the stretch drive
getting up for third place money. JENNY'S PENNY stalked the front runner on the rail, maintained position through out, while being behind and inside of
rivals, was kept on point and ridden down the rail, shifted out into the four path after the eighth pole, had a refreshing burst and got up for the win. MY
OCHO stalked the pace from the three path, battled near the quarter pole from in between rivals, then had no kick. GOLD STRATEGY raced from off of the
pace in the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field through the turn and tired. VOODOO MISTRESS was off mid pack and
three wide and raced even. OUR PASTOR vied for the lead, led from the rail, led into the furlong ground, battled and just missed. MUSIC MISTRESS was
never involved. JUST PUSH SEND flashed early speed. COUSIN KRISTI showed little.
