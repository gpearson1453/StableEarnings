MYSTICISM , away alertly while also drifting in, corrected and quickly cleared, was a bit green while headstrong past the half, took better to rating two wide
around the turn, responded when shaken up heading to mid stretch, kept on under solid encouragement through the final sixteenth and held firm. CAILIN
DANA bobbled at the break, recovered and commenced a four wide run leaving the far turn, took closer order three wide past the five sixteenths, continued
with good energy and earned the place. KALIFORNA K was off slow then steadied when in tight soon after the break, trailed heading to the turn, angled out,
circled five wide with progress into the stretch and closed steadily. SHE IS ROMANTIC broke a step slow, edged up towards the rail past the half mile
marker but got put in tight entering the turn, was coaxed along pursuing around the turn, came out for the drive, moved up between runners in mid stretch
and kept on with effort to the inside of a rival. CHI CHI , broke a bit slow, inside while off the pace, eased out and knifed her way between foes entering the
lane, swung out six wide and finished with interest. SHE'S MY NIECE stalked the early pace two wide, dropped in to chase around the turn, stayed on to
about mid stretch then faded. INDIAN DREAMER was forced in a bit at the break, stalked the early pace four then three wide, failed to keep pace past the
five sixteenths, was floated out entering the lane and faded. SOPHIE JEAN , step slow, forward early on while off the rail, steadied off foes near the three
and a half furlong marker, chased mid turn and weakened.

UNIFIED A. P. was nudged to the front, moved clear near the half and set a rated pace towards the inside, responded when asked soon into the lane,
wandered outward when widening in mid stretch, corrected and continued on under steady hand encouragement to prove best. COCKTAIL CUTIE stalked
the winner while two wide and to the inside of a rival, was scrubbed on giving hard pursuit past the five sixteenths, saw the winner get away past the three
sixteenths but continued on with good effort the hold down the place. BROOKYS GAL , away alertly, prompted the pace three wide outside rivals, was
pushed along staying in range heading to the quarter pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch, kept trying but was out kicked for second. MOMENT'S
PLEASURE , off slowly after ducking in at the break and appearing to graze the inner portion of her stall, corrected and was taken off the inside, worked
between rivals while gathering some steam approaching the stretch, altered out five wide and finished well. DORIE MILLER broke a step slow, saved
ground, drifted out some nearing the lane, angled back in past mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. LOVME LIKEAFOOL , between rivals pursuing past
the three eighths, angled in for the drive and gave way. ACCLAIMED PREACHER hesitated at the break, was taken well wide, made a mild advance leaving
the three eighths, circled five to six wide into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BLAMELESS secured the inside early on and was taken to rate, eagerly took closer order past the half mile marker, patiently tracked the leaders until a rail
seam opened up entering the stretch, surged through under asking, spurted clear in mid stretch and held firm under an energetic drive. HIGH HEATER ,
between rivals in mid pack, moved up leaving the half mile marker, stayed in range while coaxed along past the five sixteenths, swung out five wide for the
drive, closed steadily and narrowly held the place. TABLE FOR TEN settled inside early, eased off the rail and advanced between runners into the far turn,
remained between foes past the quarter pole, worked outward to about the six path in upper stretch, straightened and closed willingly while just missing
second. BRAVESTONE pulled his way forward and prompted from the outside, bid to apply more pressure around the final turn, dueled three wide on a slim
lead between foes soon into the lane, was displaced from his inside heading to mid stretch and faded late. SHOT OF A LIFETIME , off the pace and in the
clear past the five eighths, saved ground into the stretch, got through past mid stretch and rallied. J T'S WATCH rated outside the winner early on, gained
past the three eighths, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, battled four wide outside foes in upper stretch, failed to keep pace leaving mid stretch and
faded. SWEET SAVANT saved ground, angled out nearing the lane but lacked a rally. MY INDY , three deep past the five eighths, raced four wide into the
lane but failed to respond. SUNRISE JOURNEY took over early and set a rated pace inside, took pressure from BRAVESTONE from the far turn, drifted off
the rail when hounded by rivals to his outside entering the lane, ceded soon after and dropped back through the final furlong. TEX HANLEY was rated back
off foes leaving the gate, saved ground and was not a threat.

Footnotes
WORCESTER took over early and set a pressured pace while off the inside, shook clear under asking nearing the lane, opened up under solid handling
past the three sixteenths, switched over to his left lead leaving the furlong grounds and widened while kept alert. MUCINO drifted out at the break,
straightened and edged up to stalk the pace, angled out leaving the far turn, took closer order three to four wide approaching the quarter pole, gave hard
chase from there and continued with good effort to the wire. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES forced the pace three wide outside the winner, shifted in past the three
sixteenths and gave way grudgingly. YELLOW BRICK , four wide into the first turn, continued four wide when making a bit of an advance to the half, was put
to serious asking leaving the far turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, lugged in when switching to his left lead leaving the eighth pole and
weakened. ARROMAX broke a step slow, steadied soon after, gained some while saving ground into the far turn, pursued to the head of the stretch then
gave way. UNION TRAIN , three wide into the first turn, was coaxed along three wide between runners past the five eighths, failed to go on entering the far
turn and tired. CONFUCIUS broke a bit slow, was hustled up soon after then dropped in near the seven eighths, failed to respond leaving the far turn,
dropped back, was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
DADDYSRUBY pulled his way clear in the opening furlong then angled in to set a rated pace, spurted away a bit when roused soon into the stretch, kept on
under right handed asking past mid stretch then maintained a safe advantage while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. CORNELIA FORT drafted
towards the inside and rated within range, took closer order leaving the far turn, angled out and lightly brushed with a rival soon into the stretch, straightened
away past the three sixteenths and finished with good energy to gain the place. GOLDEN AGAIN tracked inside, eased out with pursuit into the lane, chased
hard past mid stretch and kept on with interest. SHE'S A BIT SASSY was lightly steadied off a rival entering the backstretch, regrouped and settled, raced
two wide into the lane, worked between runners leaving mid stretch and churned on. I HAD THAT ONE TOO saved ground early, angled out for the
backstretch run, circled four wide into the lane and closed belatedly. SENSIBLE MOVE , three wide stalking the pace, was pushed along mid way on the
final turn, failed to kick on near the quarter pole and faded. ROSIE FORECAST had an inside trip, got put in a bit tight nearing the quarter pole and lacked a
rally. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS stalked outside, was ridden along nearing the lane, shifted three wide, was lightly brushed soon after and gave way. COURT
SNORT broke a bit slow, lagged off the pace, angled four wide nearing the stretch but failed to generate a run. TAMARA MINE steadied back from between
runners in the opening furlong, chased off the rail and faltered in upper stretch.

his advantage in mid stretch then was kept to strong handling to the wire. GIVER NOT A TAKER bobbled outward at the break, regrouped and saved
ground leaving the far turn, shifted out for the drive and rallied. CLOUSEAU , four wide early, chased three wide outside a rival past the five sixteenths,
continued pursuit past mid stretch but came up empty. BARELY FUNTIONAL , off the pace, raced four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn and failed to
make a serious impact. KANGAROO COURT broke inward then steadied when shying inward soon after, drifted out leaving the chute, corrected to give
hard chase, saved ground leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, faltered, was eased in the final furlong. BOSS SULLY drifted

Footnotes
TURN ON THE JETS (IRE) rated in range while saving ground, was guided outward when gathering steam mid turn, circled four wide into the lane, leveled
off under left handed asks past mid stretch, sustained under steady pressure through the final sixteenth, forged to command late and prevailed between
runners. BEER CAN MAN showed speed inside rivals then rated back a bit to track the leader, eased out into the lane, closed gamely between horses and
just missed. RADICAL RIGHT edged up three deep into the turn to take a stalking spot, bid to engage the leader with a quarter to go, battled on between
foes leaving the sixteenth pole and kept on willingly. WAR AT SEA drafted back off the pace after an alert start, settled four wide into the turn, circled four
wide under asking into the lane, moved up behind SUMTER near the sixteenth pole, altered off that one's heels and finished well. SUMTER settled off the
pace while three wide, shifted five wide for the drive, moved up past the sixteenth marker then was out kicked between rivals. NOBLE REFLECTION ,
fractious in the gate, had speed outside rivals then was nudged clear past the half, dropped in to make the pace, was joined approaching the stretch, kicked
back to a daylight advantage near mid stretch, was taken on by a host of rivals in deep stretch and ceded in the final yards. SILENT POET flashed speed
then stalked between runners, steadied briefly near the quarter pole then failed to seriously recover.

Footnotes
BOOK SMART rushed up inside rivals and poked a head in front with five furlongs remaining, sprinted away past the half then was coaxed along on the
turn, saw his lead diminish past the five sixteenths, thwarted challenges to open back up under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, switched over to his
correct lead inside the furlong grounds and was resolute to the wire. THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) stalked three wide, took closer order outside a rival
near the quarter pole emerged the closest pursuer leaving mid stretch, came back on to loom inside the sixteenth marker, could not threaten from there but
stayed well. QUICK BUCK , urged chasing three wide mid turn, moved up in grinding fashion near the sixteenth pole, shifted out and continued on willingly
to gain. PATRON D'ORO had speed between runners then stalked two wide after the winner cleared off, gained ground past the five sixteenths, stayed on
to give chase past mid stretch then faded late. TAHOE SECRETS saved ground while under a hustling ride mid turn, stayed inside but lacked a solid punch.
STOP AND A TRES , four to five wide, made steady progress inside the furlong pole then flattened out late. KENTUCKY BOURBON broke a step slow,
saved ground with some run past the half, angled out past the five sixteenths, came four wide for the drive but needed more. TOP GUN CLASSIC drifted out
at the break, lagged back, came wide for the drive and never threatened. D COLDEST , between runners headed to the turn, dropped back.
