Footnotes
OVERBEARING vied early, then settled back while three wide, was swiftly moving up on the turn then ducked out, but kept on chugging past inner foes
down the lane to prove best in the end. CLAW was rated along the inside behind the field in the early furlongs, then came out four wide leaving the turn,
rallied in the late stretch and closed willingly. PEPE AND HEYWOOD angled in to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, then
vied with outer foes heading into the stretch, but could not retain bid and gave way in the end. BREITHORN pressed the pace under a steady drive into the
turn, then made a bid to vie for the lead leaving the bend but just didn't have enough and flattened out in the stretch. POSITIVELY AWESOME settled along
the outside of an inner foe behind the group and was thru after the early furlongs.

Footnotes
LOUISE BROOKS tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was moving up on the far turn to challenge the pace setter for the lead, gained
command then kicked clear of incoming rivals at the top of the stretch and kept on to succeed in the end. SEIVER stalked the pace from the inside
throughout the first three quarters, was in a long drive leaving the turn, dug in gamely while brushing an outer foe in the early stretch then pulled away from
the battling foes to finish second best. ANIMAL PRINCESS lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was under a easy hand ride
before dueling with an outer rival at the top of the far turn, lost command but continued to menace gamely down the stretch to share the show prize in the
end. ARIANA VALENTINA was unhurried early in the early half, was moving up along the inside heading into the second turn, steadied off the heels of rival,
then regained bid to close well down the lane sharing third place despite challenges. BOARDWALK FRIES was well rated while two wide down the
backstretch and throughout the far bend, then rallied at the top of the stretch to close willingly in the end. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE moved down the
backstretch from the inside in the middle of the field, then bid between rivals on the far turn to menace from the four path in the early stretch, was brushed
slightly, then continued to close gamely in the end. QIA was rank early then settled back behind the field, was moving up on the far turn, came out five wide
and found more in the stretch to close well but it wasn't enough. MY JO JO settled along the inside throughout the first half then gained speed quickly on the
far turn to challenge for the lead but it wasn't enough and gave way in the final furlong. COLETTE'S SPIRIT settled at the back of the field while two wide on
the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and into the stretch but came up empty. GRASS CUTTER was out four wide heading into the backstretch, then
was moving up swiftly to duel for the lead while two wide, was hard used after the half and dropped back and had no final bid. PER RULING FROM THE
HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, ANIMAL PRINCESS HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ESTILO CLASICO stalked the pace while three wide in the early furlongs, then moved up to battle for the lead leaving the turn, gained command mid stretch

the five path to close belatedly in the stretch. ELUSIVE IMAGE pressed the pace while two wide, then gained command at the top of the turn, was
challenged for the lead by an incoming outer rival heading into the stretch and gave way in the end. CAPE COD SUMMER raced along the inside towards

Footnotes
RECKLESS KELLY sharp speed from the bell, pressure came from the outside entering the turn, drifted out bad around the bend, regained momentum
when straitened up, running on the wrong lead went clear under a steady drive. DELTA CHARM slow to start, moved up along the rail into the turn, when
RECKLESS KELLY drifted out took full advantage of the opening to grab a narrow lead, stayed in the fight till inside the sixteenth marker unable to match
strides late with the winner. RACING raced two wide and off the pace into the turn, lost ground around the bend, finished off evenly through the wire. APPLE
SHAKE SHAKE very slow into stride, raced off the pace into the turn, clean trip around the bend, mild gain through the stretch. TEQUESTA pressed the
pace into the turn, carried way wide when RECKLESS KELLY drifted out, still in range for the drive, had no late kick.

DEEDS OF LOVE was moving up while three wide down the early backstretch to stalk the pace into the turn, then vied for the lead with inner foes, kicked
clear of WILD ARMY BRAT then dueled with BIOME in the final furlong and was up in the final strides to prove best. BLOME set the pace along the inside
down the backstretch, was challenged for the lead at the top of the turn, vied gamely clearing WILD ARMY BRAT then dueled with DEEDS OF LOVE in the
late stretch but was outkicked in the end and was second best. WILD ARMY BRAT pressed the pace into the turn from the two path, then battled grudgingly
throughout the remainder of the course before giving way in the end. MISS LONELYHEARTS raced at the back of the pack while two wide, then came out
four wide on the turn rally in late stretch and was no threat. GOODBYE KYLE chased the pace from the inside early then was thru after the half and failed to
rally.

NICHIREN stalked the pace while three wide, then dug in gamely leaving the turn to combat the pace setter in the final furlong and was up at the wire to
prevail. KITCHEN FIRE emerged from the pack to lead the way into the turn from the two path, was able to clear the turn but was confronted with contention
by NICHIREN from the outside and was outfinsihed in the end. THE JUDGE AND JURY was rated along the inside early then bid while two wide at the top
of the stretch, shifted to the four path then surged down the late stretch just missing victory in the end. CAPT. CANDY prompted the pace early then settled
back to stalk the pace throughout the turn before giving way in the stretch. FILIGREE settled between rivals in the back pack then rallied in the late stretch
and was no threat. CALL WIL raced while three wide in the back of the field then bid from the inside on the turn and was no menace.

SUTTON VALLEY lead the way from the inside down the backstretch, cleared the turn then continued to draw away in the stretch to win in the end wire to
wire. NOTTOWAY chased the pace while four wide, then vied for the place position with two inner rivals leaving the turn, lost crop then continued to urge on
down the lane and was able to hold onto the place prize in the end. CLASSY SOLUTION chased the pace from the inside, then menaced on the turn to
battle for the place position in the stretch but was outfinsihed in the end. LITIGANT raced in the middle of the pack while three wide, then bid on the turn to
rally from the five path in the stretch but came up empty. MY BEAU chased the pace while two wide, then menaced for second position on the turn and
between rivals, was used up and gave way in the late stretch. THERISASTORMBREWIN was gaining ground slowly and steadily throughout the first half
then rallied on the turn and into the stretch and was no threat. POINTER chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then flattened out on the
turn and had no final bid. SHIMMERING LIGHT raced in the middle of the field at a moderate pace and needed rally in the end. LORD DARNLEY settled
along the inside then circled three wide on the turn and was no threat. NOON TIME GEM stood in the gate after the start and had no chance in the end.

Footnotes
TWO BY TWO rated well back of the leaders down the back stretch, saved ground into the far turn, angled off the rail nearing the quarter pole, full of
momentum was blocked in upper stretch, quickly shifted in four lanes towards the rail, surged to victory inside rival. BORGOBYTHESEA took command
early, set a leisurely tempo down the back stretch and into the far turn, felt pressure from outside rival, kicked clear once more in upper stretch, could not
hold off late rush to the inside. second best today. JAMMIN STILL away last, reserved energy down the backside, took his que leaving the quarter pole, and
closed the gap willingly through deep stretch. REDEEM EDDIE was very hard to load, ground saving trip, moved into contention near the furlong marker,
unable to sustain bid. STRONG HEADED chased the leader around the first and into the far turn from the two path, came under a drive leaving the three
eighths marker, no late bid. GREAT FACES four wide trip early, raced off the pace and outside down the back stretch, made a middle move from the
outside around the far turn, weakened through the stretch.
