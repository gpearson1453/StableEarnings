LA POPIS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up along the outside to take the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gradually drew
clear. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on well for second. LASSIE CAT
was prominently placed while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. GUNNHILD broke out, then was unhurried early,
came four-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. CAMDEN HIGH saved ground chasing the leaders but lacked a rally when asked. SETTLER'S
COVE prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired after five furlongs.

unable to resist the winner late but continued on well for the place. ABOVE THE STARS saved ground stalking the pace, angled out nearing the eighth pole
and finished in a mild rally. FIRST PROMISE was allowed settle in stride, moved up along the outside to be four-wide the final quarter and went evenly late.
LAKER JET was bumped at the start, then dropped back, came two-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. BLOWING BAYOU saved ground while

MISSED THE BOAT was never far back while racing four-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and and was fully extended to hold off TAX CODE late.
TAX CODE was prominent early racing along the inside, checked nearing the half mile pole lacking room, dropped back, then rallied five-wide into the
stretch and finished strongly despite drifting out slightly during the drive. PRAYER OF JABEZ hesitated at start to get away behind the field, then rushed up
between horses to dispute the issue while three-wide into the stretch and weakened slightly late. SMILING GOODBYE prompted the issue for a half mile
and tired. ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE set the early pace from along the outside, dropped back slightly on the turn, was five-wide entering the stretch and gave
way.

THEUNTOUCHABLEONE dueled with MR. BUGS for the lead from along the inside into the stretch, shook that one off and quickly drew clear. MR. BUGS
dueled for the lead into the stretch, was no match for the winner late but was clearly second best. SEVENTH HOUSE bobbled at the start, then saved
ground chasing the top two, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. OUR HY ROLLER was forwardly placed while racing two-wide on
the turn, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. SUBITO SLEW was off a step slow, the saved ground on the turn, slipped through entering the
stretch and showed some interest late. STREET MOGUL was unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ELEGANT PREACHER
gave way after showing brief speed while three-wide.

COBRA JET dueled for the lead from along the inside, opened a slight lead entering the stretch, then responded when challenged by BAROSSA and was all
out to hold that one off in a prolonged drive. BAROSSA was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught COBRA JET
nearing the eighth pole but couldn't quite get by that one late. YOU SPLIT TENS was off a step slow, then quickly moved forward on the turn to vie for the
lead. disputed the issue to the stretch and weakened. LAGO DE ORO saved ground stalking the pace, steadied lacking room nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, angled out entering the stretch but lacked a rally. JEDI KNIGHT prompted the issue for a half mile from between horses and tired.

four-wide into the stretch and finished fast to just miss. QUIET CHARM set the pressure pace while saving ground, responded during the drive and held on
gamely despite being unable to resist the top two late. PICK YOUR BID prompted the pace to the stretch from along the outside and weakened. UPPER
ROOM was brushed at the start by WARFRONT FIGHTER, then was prominently placed racing two-wide, lacked room turn, angled out for the drive but
lacked a rally. WARFRONT FIGHTER broke out to brush UPPER ROOM at the start, then was in tight along the inside nearing the half mile pole, dropped
