Footnotes
CHECK ME OUT broke in good order, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to set the pace turn, shook clear when straightened
for home, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. DR. SNYDER broke forwardly, raced closest to the winner into the turn, fell back off that one
in upper straight, closing the gap late while clearly second best. ARKANSAS ZONG within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, came
back for the show the final furlong while not a threat to the top two. RED ON THE HEAD in the second flight while also racing off the inside, closest to the
top two past the furlong maker, outfinished for the show spot while also not a threat to that pair late. STRUTTIN APRIORITY off a step slow, raced back,
moved off the inside, swung five wide into the lane when improving, flattened out a bit late to finish up best of the others. MR LEO AND JOSE in mid pack
early well out in the course, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, roused, came up empty for the stretch run. FLASHY LOVER four wide into the turn
when in the second group, came three wide for the drive, failed to make an impact in the run to the wire. LOVELY SASSICAIA made little impact while
racing three wide. ALL COUNTRY broke back and failed to menace. ANOTHER FINAL hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained
back. FLATTERSOLUTION main body early, was finished after three furlongs.

Footnotes
OLDER AND WISER last to leave, void of early foot, came five wide out of the turn, set down, closed willingly, late bid, edged clear final strides. WILLIAM
GUSTAVO with the early pace three wide, between foes into the turn, dueled out of the bend closest to but not on the rail, drifted out a bit past midstretch
stretch to brush with F T W SLAM, could not contain the winner late, narrowly saved the show. OURPERFECTPRINCE behind the pace while off the inside,
four wide turning for home, late bid to miss the second spot while gaining the nod for the show. F T W SLAM prompted the issue early in the four path up the
backstretch, advanced to challenge turn, dueled outside the runner up into the stretch, brushed by that one approaching the furlong marker, weakened late
from between horses. PRINCE OF GLORY vied early while between horses, fell back through the turn, two path into the stretch, came again late while
closest to the rail of the first flight. GOLDUSTER underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke in good order, fell back to race in mid pack, went one paced
through the lane in lacking a closing kick. HULLINAHURRY failed to menace in remaining back. ROLL ON OUT broke back, trailed most of the way and was
never a threat. ZAICI flashed brief speed in vying for the advantage early, stopped, jogged in well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH MIDSTRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT OIL steadied exiting the chute in some traffic, trailed into the turn well out in the strip, four to five wide into the lane, advanced, late surge to be
up at the wire while remaining outside. OUT MAKING TREBLE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, moved up to contest the pace soon after the start,
set or forced the pace for a half, drew clear into the stretch, extended that advantage past the furlong marker but could not contain the winner late, remained
well clear for the second spot. CLEVER PRINCE steadied slightly in some traffic inside the winner with three furlongs to run, three wide through the turn,
finished up best of the rest. ADMIRAL AFLEET lacked speed, continued to lag in trailing early in the turn, saved ground into the stretch and improved
position up the inside, not enough late for the show. LOST GOLD last away, remained back to prove never dangerous. CATINANDSCATIN forwardly placed
in the run up the backstretch, lodged a brief bid far turn, gave way in the drive. DOUBLE BOGEY flashed some brief speed to show the way early, began a
steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
TIZ THE BIG ONE broke on top, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, disposed of that rival early in the turn just as a second foe was mounting a
challenged on the outside, took care of that rival into the lane, clear past the furlong marker, enough left late to hold off the runner up. GYPSY'S
SOULMATE back off the pace, moved out a bit, came three to four wide for the drive, was coming late while clearly second best. JAMAICAN ME lacked
early foot toward the inside for three furlongs, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, finished willingly while too late for the top two at the wire. FLASHY
BOY forwardly placed early outside, lodged a three wide bid midway on the turn, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. MUSTAFA one paced while
racing outside, four to five wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. B W P SPIRIT lacked speed four three furlongs, improved a bit in the drive without
posing a serious threat. TOTALLY ADDICTED dwelt at the start, trailed for three furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. BARSINVIEW dueled up front inside the winner for a quarter and began to give way, continued to weaken through the stretch. CLASSIC RED
RACER within striking distance early off the rail, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
FLASHY PREMO last away, outrun for six furlongs, three wide into the lane, shifted out when straightened for home, closed with good resolve to be up in
the final strides. BODE'S LIGHT chased the early leader, advanced and challenged into the far turn, shook off that one with less a furlong remaining, led
late, nailed at the wire. FLIT N FLOT TIME settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, rallied with the winner late, flattened out a bit late,
best of rest while between the top two at the wire. HERE COMES MAGIC forwardly placed, between horses into the lane, lacked a closing punch.
APPLEWOOD off the pace while three wide through the first turn, moved inside and saved ground through the second bend, went evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing kick. SCREENPLAY broke well from between horses, clear through the first turn when settled the pace, joined by the runner up to duel
through the second bend, gave way in the drive. LIAM SKYE broke back, failed to menace. MATH MAN lacked speed and was not involved. FORT BONZ
restless in the gate, raced in mid pack and four wide through the first turn, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
FINISHWHATUSTARTED broke alertly, cleared to the inside when showing the way up the backstretch, rated into the turn, extended advantage through
upper stretch, enough left to last. CHERRY STAR back off the pace and the inside, got out a bit when advancing five wide out of the turn, lost considerable
ground to the winner as a result, rapidly getting to that one with a late burst. ARMS APRIORITY moved up inside to race in a forward position, proved no
match for the top two in the drive, comfortably held the show. CAT B CAUSE lacked early foot, raced four wide out of the turn, improved position with some
mild late interest, no threat to the top three. BRIDLED UP turned in a one paced effort while racing toward the inside. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR void of
speed, was six wide out of the turn, improved a bit down the middle of the strip without posing a serious threat. OUR CLOVER GAL chased the winner early
off the inside, began to weaken by late in the turn. GLAMOROUS STAR last to leave, lacked speed, made little impact downt htre lane. BYE BYE BIG BABY
in the second flight early, faded. CHICKIETOWN STAR chased the winner for a half outside, gave way through the stretch. ANGEL AND ME remained
always back.

Footnotes
LIKE THIS broke well, set the pace while in hand, continued to rate through the turn, drew off through the lane, won geared down and ridden out. HEZA
SEXY ZONG within striking distance while racing outside, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clear for the place. APRIORITY AVENGER away in
good order, raced within striking distance for a half, also proved no match for the winner nor could he contain the runner up through the stretch. GRAY
DANE off the early pace and the inside, improved position with some mild late interest. CATCH ME T last away, void of speed in trailing for over a half,
improved with some belated interest up the inside. MALAKI EMPIRE off the pace well out in the strip early, four wide through the turn, failed to respond
when roused for the drive. POPPA MAGIC in mid pack for a half, also came up empty for the stretch run. BEAUDEAN fell back, failed to rally. SHAWN'S
SOLVING closest to the winner for four furlongs, faltered through the stretch.

Footnotes
HOOSIER outrun in the early going, moved closer under modest encouragement while four wide through the turn, roused when straightened for home,
closed with good energy to win going away at the end. HARDLY ABLE broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, shook well clear by midstretch, proved
no match for the winner late while holding sway for the place. MO CREDO lacked early foot well out in the strip, five wide through the turn, rallied for the
show while also closing the gap on the runner up. ZINGING BAYOU last away, trailed for a half, found best stride too late through traffic. HARPES HILL
chased the runner up for a half, had little left for the stretch run. TWOFEXUSNEXUS forwardly placed early, began to fall back before a half. GUTZY in the
second flight for four furlongs, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
ZIPPING MOLLY away in good order, prompted the early leader, took over far turn, drew out upper stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire
under steady handling. STARSHIP NOLA back off the pace toward the inside, angled out four wide turning for home, finished up willingly to be well clear for
the place while not a match for the winner. CHARMING KAT settled in mid pack, moved closer four wide turning for home, along for the show. GYPSY
JACKPOT in the second flight while racing outside, moved closer through the turn, flattened out in the drive. MINT JULIUS back off the pace and the inside,
improved slightly outside, never dangerous. LAKE BALI moved closer through the turn, vied for the second spot past the furlong marker, faltered. SHEEZA
PRIORITY broke back and never menaced. SILK NOT SATIN broke on top, set the early pace, gave way when headed far turn. BON CHANCE BET in the
second flight, chased through the turn, caved in when the real running began the head of the lane. PUMP IT broke back, sluggish, fell far back, distanced
after losing contact with the field.
