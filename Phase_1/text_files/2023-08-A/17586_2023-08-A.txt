Footnotes
TENSAS ALL OURS in the second flight off the inside, moved closer into the far turn, idled along through most of that bend, dropped to the rail turning for
home, took over, drew clear under a single right handed crop past the furlong marker and stayed comfortably clear to the wire under a steady hand ride to
win ridden out. CHICKEN TRUCK lacked early foot, began to advance three wide early in the far turn, continued willingly to the wire to be up late for the
place, not a threat to the winner. ZULTAN broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, continued to set a relaxed pace up
the backstretch and into the far turn, got out a bit late in that bend allowing the winner a sizable opening into the straight, chased that one past the furlong
marker, weakened a bit and was caught late for the second spot. MONARCH MAN broke back, moved up to race in mid pack inside of several rivals into the
first turn, continued to save ground, improved into the straight then flattened out the final furlong to lose a position or tow. CRIMSON STORM in the main
body off the inside, four to five wide second turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. MOR BIG LEE restless gate, void of speed
for six furlongs, improved a bit off the inside into the lane, never dangerous. SCORING DRIVE lacked speed outside, five wide into the stretch, failed to
muster a rally. BIG ACE prompted the pace for six furlongs, lodged a brief bid late in the final turn then gave way through the stretch. VETERAN'S
HOLIDAY broke sluggishly, remained always back. MERCI within striking distance inside, shortened stride second turn, pulled up in apparent distress upper
stretch, vanned off.

Footnotes
LIKEN IT broke thru gate prior to the start, broke on top, dueled in the run up the backstretch, edged clear by late in the turn, extended that advantage past
the furlong marker before holding the runner up wafe late. GOLDEN PALACE with pace out of the chute, dueled outside the winner from midway up the
backstretch into the far turn, fell back off that one into the lane, chased that one pace the furlong marker then was coming back on that one a bit late. IN
THE ARCH off a step slow, raced back for five furlongs while three wide through the turn, rallied from between horses to earn the show, no real threat to the
top pair. TURN ON THE MAGIC in mid pack just off the inside, asked along midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a meaningful
response. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL off the pace outside, came five wide out of the turn, went one paced to the wire to also be found wanting. OVERTAXED
forwardly placed off rail, four wide turning for home, tired. B W P SPECIAL raced inside, shuffled while continuing to save ground turn, remained back when
clear for the drive. MARKITOFF finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
TOLATETOOWAIT broke alertly, helped show the way into the first turn between horses, held a narrow advantage onto the backstretch while under a snug
hold, soft fractions, clear second turn, drew out upper stretch, remained comfortably clear the final furlong while being kept to task with a steady right
handed crop. HONEST ANGUS back off the early leaders under restraint, moved closer before a half, chased the winner through the final turn, proved no
match through the lane, held sway for the runner up spot. AVENDORE fell back to trail after the start, moved closer while improving along the inside through
the second turn, slowly getting to the runner up late. GEAUX VOTE within striking distance for six furlongs, came up empty for the stretch drive, outkicked
for the show. PLANTS AND BIRDS settled off that soft pace, lacked a serious bid as well when the real running began at the head of the lane. CALIFORNIA
CALI failed to menace. LUCKY HARBORAGE broke back, moved up to be forwardly placed on the outside into the first turn, raced keenly through that bend
when forcing the issue, began to fade after five furlongs.

Footnotes
MISTS OF TIME behind the first flight in the run up the backstretch, moved out and ranged up four wide to challenge midway on the turn, took over into the
stretch, steadily increased advantage past the furlong marker, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. QUANA DUDE back off the pace and the
inside, five wide exiting the turn when beginning to advance, slowly getting to the winner late. GALLANT STAR in mid pack while racing outside, four wide
and inside the runner up entering the stretch, could not match that one late, clearly best of the others. GENIUS forwardly placed while three wide, remaining
within striking distance exiting the turn, had little left in the run to the wire. GRAND PRADO broke alertly, set or forced the pace four over a half closest to
the inside, also faltered in the drive. PERFECT PERIGEE last away, trailed, moved well wide, five wide exiting the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while not a threat. IRISH EXPECTATIONS with the pace early pace while between foes, began to falter before a half. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) broke
back and failed to menace. BUNKIE'S SONG steadily faded.

Footnotes
AFLEET ASCENT lacked early foot off the inside, encountered a bit of traffic early in the turn, two path into the stretch when beginning to rally, was moving
smartly when forced to alter course in some traffic with a sixteenth to run, continued to close with good resolve to be up in time. FIREINTHESTORM with the
pace off the inside, held a narrow advantage between horses into the stretch, headed upper straight, battled on to regain a narrow advantage past the
furlong marker and proved game to the end. BANKROLL moved up to contest the pace along the inside, continued to vie turn, led upper, also gave ground
grudgingly in the final strides. MUCHO MARVIN back off the issue in the run up the backstretch inside, continued to save ground turn, closer along the rail
into the straight, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE behind the lead pack backstretch, two path through the early part
of the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, continued evenly through the stretch. MAD GOLD in the main body outside, five wide turning into the straight,
also lacked a closing kick. MIDNIGHT BAYOU pressed the pace up front outside, four wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. RAP ARTIST away in
good order, set or forced the pace for three furlongs between horses, gave way late in the turn. M AND M'S CUSTOM lacked speed, failed to rally. MR.
PRIORITY broke back ,and failed to menace. CHIMNEY ROCK last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JAYDYN CAT broke out to carry STAND BY TIME OUT, was straightened to race close up front the start outside, continued to vie three wide through the
turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, well clear, steady handling. ONE LINE RULER broke well from along the inside, narrowly set
the early pace, continued to hold a slight advantage late in the turn along the inside, fell back off the winner upper stretch, lugged in a bid soon after, no
match, held the place. LIGHTOFMAINE forwardly placed behind the first flight just off the inside, set down drive, slowly getting to the runner up late, clear of
the others. BUCKSKIN JERRY broke through the gate prior to the start, away in good order, setteled in the second flight just off the inside, lacked a late
punch. COAL DANCER bothered, off slowly to be last away, back early, improved along the inside through the turn, continued with mild interest through the
stretch. DARK SKYER settled off the pace, roused three wide turning into the stretch, continued one paced to the wire. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY broke
in, raced in mid pack after straightened, lacked serious bid. C C LLAM in tight at the start, remained back in failing to menace. STAND BY TIME carried out
at the start, remained back. ASTROLOGY GIRL broke in to bother C C LLAM, was straightened to force the issue up front, weakened from between foes
entering the stretch. MY IDEA remain always back to be outrun. COSTA LADY trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
OCELOT prompted the leader from along the inside first turn, fell back under restraint onto the backstretch, crept a bit closer along the rail under continued
patient handling far turn, rail bid into the lane, shook clear by a furlong out and maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. TOUCHDOWN JOE
showed the way through the first turn in the two path, set a pressured pace the middle half, allowed the winner the inside turning for home, fell back off that
one, drifted out midstretch stretch but stayed on after being straightened to be clearly second best. DEER CROSSING last away, raced back off the pace
outside and four wide first turn, loomed a brief threat four wide late in the final turn, lost considerable ground to the winner into the lane and flattened out
upper stretch, came back for the show. PLAY MO settled off the pace and the inside, lost some position in some traffic while three wide late in the final turn,
between foes past the furlong marker, improved, missed the show with some continued late interest. TAMBOURINE STAR forwardly placed early, two path
and outside the winner late in the final turn, came up empty for the stretch run. PAYNT BATTLE lacked speed, failed to serious menace. IBERIAN RUNNER
stalked the pace while three wide, lodged a brief bid three wide and outside the runnerup late in the final turn then faltered in the drive. MUFFIN NUTS
remained back throughout in failing to make an impact.

Footnotes
BOX OF PICTURES broke with the field, raced back off the pace and the inside, moved closer four wide late in the turn, chased the leader past the furlong
marker, late surge to collar that one late. BLESSED ASSURANCE lacked speed off the rail, roused four wide out of the turn, also turned in late run and was
up in the final strides for the place. MAESTRIA bumped and was off slowly, was used to move up to contest the pace inside, continued to vie along the rail
through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home only to weaken late late to be caught by the top two. SIENNA BREEZE broke sharp, with the pace
between horses, weakened. COUNTRY LADY unprepared for the start while detained, broke in a tangle and was steadied, moved up to contest the pace
three wide and outside, also faltered in the drive. CATCAKE broke back, failed to menace. AKIANE'S SOLDIER bumped with MAESTRIA at the break,
trailed and was never a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, COUNTRY LADY WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER
DUE TO AN UNFAIR START.

PAYOFF CYCLE cleared soon after the start, set a soft and unpressured pace, remained clear through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out.
PLENTY OF CENTS closest to the winner after breaking in good order, continued to pursue that one through the second turn while being asked, minimal
gain on the winner late, narrowly lasted for the place. WHEELS TURNING raced in mid pack and off the inside, came four wide for the drive, rallied on the
outside to narrowly miss the place. IDE LIKE HAWAII in the second flight outside, continued one paced, not enough late for the show. R T'S D'ORO broke
awkwardly and lastly, raced well back off the pace, improved position into the lane then flattened out a bit late. SHADY STAR off slowly then was bothered
at the break, recovered to move up and race within striking position for six furlongs, backed up down the lane. DEPUTY KNIGHT lacked speed, remained
always back. WILDCARD GOLD off a bit slow, was always outrun. LITTLE STAR TARGET lugged in at the break, fell back, was never close while wide into
the lane.
