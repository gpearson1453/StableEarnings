Footnotes
KRIXUS FLASH away cleanly, slightly bothered by rival going to rail, settled along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, advanced
well on the turn two to three wide, entered lane widest, bid four wide and easily drove past rivals in the final sixteenth. MACHO SAM away best, sent for
lead, unable to attain lead, had to settle for a chasing two wide position on the turn, entered lane three wide, was best of the pace setters while unable to
hold off rallying rival. SEIGE THE DAY broke out, aggressively ridden early, to clear, entered turn clear, rider kept the aggression and drifted out to take the
path of NOT GONNA LAST, who had to take up and clip heels, kept to task while being outfinished in the lane. NOT GONNA LAST chased pace along the
inside, continues along the inside on the turn, attempted to split rivals entering the lane, path was shut off by SEIGE THE DAY, causing SEIGE THE DAY to
clip heels and losing all chance. OMAHA RUTSCH stalked pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, entered lane along the rail and
failed to improve. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW, SEIGE THE DAY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED BEHIND NOT GONNA LAST FOR
INTERFERRENCE IN UPPER STRETCH
