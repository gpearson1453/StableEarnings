Footnotes
DREAM WARRIOR well placed and inside, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room,
then made a steady gain and edged up late. DARK DAHLIA mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made
a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. LEMON CURRY eased the lead off the rail, held sway to the final sixteenth, then weakened and held the
show. VALIANT VICTORIA well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out.
EASTERN MARKET mid pack, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out, then drifted in and weakened.
ORPHAN EXCHANGE unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and could not gain. GEARED UP was never
involved.
