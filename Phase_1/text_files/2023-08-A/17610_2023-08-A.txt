Footnotes
MISS DUTTON stalked the early speed from outside, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, took over under urging just
inside the final sixteenth and began to draw off. ABBMAR broke on top, was encouraged to keep the lead and moved to the inside, drew clear on the turn,
floated out entering the lane, gradually angled back to the inside, did not have enough left deep stretch but proved easily second best. MINI DRESS vied for
the lead outside ABBMAR from the early going, did not keep up on the bend, came into the stretch behind the latter and had little to offer. JAMAICAN
TRAFFIC was an early factor, saved ground through the turn and proved empty for the drive.

VIVA VIOLENCE rated between rivals on the backstretch, was let out three wide nearing the bend, took a clear lead, was put to urging midstretch, steadily
widened command and ridden out the final sixteenth. AMARI S. well placed inside from the beginning, moved clear for second on the turn, was no match for
VIVA VIOLENCE when set down for the stretch run but was unchallenged for the place. LORI ATTACK was soon outrun, though urged along early, moved
to the inside with a half mile to go, came off the rail at the top of the stretch and drew off for third. DELTA LADY prompted the pace from outside but began
to fade four wide on the bend. FILLY FROM ILLY was hustled to a clear early lead, challenged from both sides after two furlongs and also began to yield
after three furlongs.

Footnotes
WARNING LABEL was kept close from outside, went for the lead four wide on the bend, drew clear under urging upper stretch and maintained control under
steady handling. AVENGING WARRIOR disputed the pace two wide between horses, could not hold back WARNING LABEL in the lane but edged ahead
for the place in the late going. KANITHAPPEN broke outward, bumping STORMIN EL PRADO, raced in contention between horses, angled in some with a
half mile left, was crowded briefly into the bend, lost ground fanning five wide into the stretch, rallied the last eighth and took over third nearing the sixteenth
marker. STORMIN EL PRADO bumped from the rear at the break, was prominent between rivals, vied for the lead three wide on the turn, was steadied
when caught in tight quarters between horses entering the lane and gradually wore down. FAITHFUL KING helped press the early pace between rivals,
angled in with four furlongs to go, threw his head and became difficult to control while boxed in entering the bend, was checked hard, saved ground through
the turn and gradually angled out the last furlong as he showed a willingness to run. CALL ME DROSSEL displayed early speed from inside but flattened
out for the drive. There was a stewards inquiry into FAITHFUL KING'S loss of action into the turn. After their review, no change was made.

second bend, came into the stretch from path five, rallied inside the final furlong and finished on every terms with CHERNYAHOVSKIY. MEMORY BANK
settled well off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, lost ground widest through the second turn and rallied belatedly deep stretch. TRIPLE

Footnotes
COPPER CROSSING shared the lead from inside, did not stay with ARGYBARGY BUCK into the second bend, floated out some into the lane, took the
advantage inside the last eighth and narrowly kept the latter at bay. ARGYBARGY BUCK vied for the lead from off the inside, drew clear when allowed after
five furlongs, stayed just off the inside through the second turn, steadily drifted out in the lane, lost the lead, held a straight path in the waning yards but was
outfinished in a game effort. GEORGE'S VISION settled inside, commenced his bid nearing the end of a half mile, progressed three wide on the second
bend, bumped with STAY STRONG upper stretch, altered outside ARGYBARBGY BUCK inside the final furlong, closed in the waning yards but was too
late. FUTURE VISION prominent in the second flight through the early going, did not keep up two wide on the second turn, had the inside for the stretch run
and lacked a late bid. STAY STRONG raced outside FUTURE VISION for more than a half mile, moved clear for third three wide on the second bend,
angled in beside COPPER CROSSING nearing the quarter pole, fanned out leaving that turn, began to yield, bumped with GEORGE'S VISION upper
stretch and continued to give way. I CAN'T TELL YA was a factor from outside for a half mile then gave way.

RACETOTHEFINISH hesitated at the break, prompted the pace from inside, angled out approaching the bend, progressed three wide, took the lead outside
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE midstretch, moved clear and maintained control under nearly all hand urging. AROSE FOR LYLA was soon well back, picked up her
pace after a quarter mile, stayed off the rail on the turn, angled out widest upper stretch, steadily closed the gap, gained second seventy-five yards out, was
too late to catch RACETOTHEFINISH but drew away for the place. ICY RIVER vied for the early lead inside DELIGHTFUL BREEZE, was bumped by the
latter shortly after travelling two furlongs, did not keep up along the rail on the bend, angled outside RACETOTHEFINISH at the top of the lane and
continued to yield. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE displayed early speed from outside, lugged in some to bump ICY RIVER after a quarter mile, moved clear on the
turn, floated out some entering the lane, was challenged from outside and flattened out the final furlong.

Footnotes
TWO COOKIE RULE bobbled a few strides from the gate and was allowed to settle, swiftly advanced from outside on the backstretch to gain the lead
before finishing a half mile, saved ground through the second bend, moved clear entering the lane, was challenged from outside upper stretch, dug in and
slowly edged ahead deep stretch. AHEADOFTHEGAME bumped at the start, soon moved to a clear lead, was overtaken from outside approaching the end
of four furlongs, angled outside TWO COOKIE RULE into the second turn, rallied to challenge the latter upper stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for
second best. DIAMOND DAVE broke outward, bumping AHEADOFTHEGAME, chased from just off or along the rail, came into contention while saving
ground through the second bend, angled out three wide upper stretch, could only make up minor ground in the late going but was easily best of the rest.
MKAR THE FAST a bit reluctant to load, retreated from inside on the backstretch, was two wide taking the second turn and had no late bid. PERFECT
WAGER soon trailed, angled out widest at the halfway point, advanced four wide on the second bend, angled in beside MKAR THE FAST approaching the
quarter pole, moved out four wide again upper stretch and had little to offer the rest of the way. ALLEN broke well, was three wide taking the first turn,
steadily retreated from between rivals once on the backstretch, was eased in the stretch and walked off.
