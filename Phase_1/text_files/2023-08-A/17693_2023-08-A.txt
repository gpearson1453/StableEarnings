came up empty and was best for second. BLUFF CITY dueled briefly with an inner rival before chasing the throughout the turn in second position then
flattened out in the stretch. GOLDEN REIGN broke outwardly at the start, then chased while two wide, made a mild bid on the turn before fading in the
stretch. WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER was impeded at the start, then moved up while three wide, shifted in to the rail, was in a strong drive heading into the
stretch then gave way in the end. URSO GRAYDAR was forced outwardly at the start by an inner rival then trailed behind the field and was no factor.

SKYS IMAGE broke outwardly at the start, then chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, moved between rivals while bidding on the far turn,
dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to edge clear in late stretch and be up driving. MOON DAZE set the pace from the inside into the first turn and down
the backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the far bend, held the lead gamely in the early furlongs before being out finished by SKYS IMAGE in the end.
TIZZY JUSTICE was unhurried early, then saved ground on the backstretch, moved up while four wide on the far bend, brushed inner rival at the top of the
stretch then closed well for the show prize. SHEZA NUT was moving down the backstretch while chasing the pace in the two path, continued to bid gamely
throughout the far turn to get in close behind the leader, did not have enough bid and gave way in the stretch. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE was impeded at the
start, then raced at the back of the pack along the inside and passed tired foes in the stretch. CIERRA EMPIRE settled towards the back of the pack while
three wide, was in a mild drive on the far turn and lacked bid in the end. WEST COAST JUSTICE chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch,
was urging steadily to hold third position throughout the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. EMPIRE SUNRISE was well placed along the inside
heading into the first turn, then stalked the pace down the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the second turn. NORA'S STAR chased the pace
from the inside in the early furlongs then, dropped backed after the half and eased across the wire.

APPLEGATE angled in towards the rail to set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn and was kept to task down the stretch to succeed in the end. THE
MOTTO angled in towards the inside, steady slightly avoiding outside rival, then chased the pace throughout the remainder of the course and could never
catch APPLEGATE. TOTALITARIAN raced while two wide and outside a rival, then moved to the three path to rally late stretch but came up empty.
RUFFLED WATERS raced behind the field from the inside throughout the first half then rallied too little too late in the stretch. MAJESTIC MR. JONES broke
inwardly and bumped rival, then settled along the inside, made mild bid on the turn and was no threat. CHARMING VICTORY broke outwardly and bumped
rival, then raced at a moderate pace along the inside and needed rally in the end. WHOOP GONE was squeezed at the start, then chased the pace briefly
along the inside then stopped after the half. There was a JOCKEY'S OBLECTION, the rider of THE MOTTO claimed foul against the rider of APPLEGATE
for interference in the early furlongs. After reviewing the replay, there was no change made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
MO SENSE hopped and was off slowly at the start, then saved ground throughout the first half, was gaining on the far turn from the two path, then dug in
gamely at the top of the stretch to duel with PARTAKE in the final sixteenth and was up at the wire to prevail. PARTAKE dueled from the two path down the
backstretch and into the far turn, then shook clear of NATIVITY in the early stretch, then battled with MO SENSE in the final furlong and was out finished in
the end. NATIVITY broke outward and bumped rival, then dueled from the inside throughout the backstretch and into the far turn, then gave way grudgingly
in the stretch and was best for the show prize in the end. QUEEN CARINA veered in and bumped rival at the start, then chased the pace from the inside,
came out three wide on the turn and flattened in the stretch. GLIMMERING LADY raced evenly throughout the course from the two path and needed rally in
the end. SOPHIE'S SHADOW chased the pace while two wide down the early backstretch then was thru after the three eighths maker and was no menace.
