Footnotes
MR LAOBAN raced mid-pack three wide and outside into and on the first turn, advanced willingly up the backstretch, took the lead by the three-eighths, was
asked for more at the top of the stretch, geared down through the final sixteenth. FINN'S POINT got away well, was joint leader heading to the first turn,
eased back ceding the lead content to rate in the two path, moved out four wide leaving the backstretch, put to urging on the far turn, swung six wide into
upper stretch, fought on to get the place while no threat to the winner. SETTE STELLE was unhurried at the back racing inside, went in the four path on the
far turn still far back, angled out in mid-stretch, kicked on mildly. NATURE OFTHE BEAST was taken under a hold early racing mid-pack inside saving
ground, made a swift advance up the backstretch inside to reach striking distance, swung out five wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. CAPT
COMPLICATED moved forward outside on the first turn, took the lead and cleared on the first turn while shifting in, set the tempo near the inside up the
backstretch, was overtaken early on the far turn, faded. EL GRAN CUYAYA raced outside at the back early, advanced four wide and outside into the far
turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
LUCKY LORRAINE raced five to six wide and outside throughout while just off the pace, moved nearer to challenge for the lead in upper stretch, lost the
crop about the sixteenth pole then edged past late. MATOULA was mildly coaxed from the break, moved clear early, dictated the pace racing well removed
from the rail in the two to three path then three to four path up the backstretch, drifted out a bit turning into upper stretch, was put to urging at the top of the
lane, challenged by an outside foe in mid-stretch and outfinished. SHAOLIN was within range four to five wide stalking the leader, put to urging past the
quarter pole, shifted inside the leader in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. PRUSSIAN BLUE settled outside a foe at the back, went two to three
wide on the far turn, was no threat to the top three. RATIONALMILLENNIAL was within range three to four wide, dropped back and faded. SIRENETTA
saved ground to no avail.

GILDED GHOST settled off the early leader outside a foe three deep, advanced up the backstretch willingly taking the lead three furlongs out, asked for
more at the three-sixteenths, was just flagged inside the final furlong and geared down the final sixteenth. ALLIE'S HALO raced four to five wide early, made
a mild advance early up the backstretch, shifted in soon after, advanced inside a rival on the far turn, was no match for the winner. LIFESAWINDINGROAD
stumbled badly at the start spotting the field about seven lengths, brought up the rear, raced quite wide on the second turn while advancing five to six deep,
lacked the needed late kick. PAUL'S TRICKY TALE settled well back racing inside, failed to menace. LILLI ROSE keenly moved clear setting the pace off
the rail under restraint from the rider, was overtaken three furlongs out, drifted out in upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
YOU'RE THE ONE attended then prompted the pace from outside, took a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, was asked for more by upper stretch,
responded to draw away. SEA ART stalked from outside a foe off the leading pair, raced mostly three to four wide, was no match for the winner but secured
the place. BIG AMBITION was outsprinted in the early going racing outside, went three to four deep through the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, got
up for show honors. WINKIWINKI was quick to the lead, set the pace off the rail, moved nearer the fence into the turn and was pressured by the winner,
gave way. CHILD PROOF tracked from inside a rival off the leading pair, failed to menace. FABULOUS CANDY was very hard to load, broke a step slowly,
was never a threat.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN GIRL was urged at the start, gained forward position stalking four wide, dropped back on the far turn, asked for more by the quarter, floated out
a few paths turning for home, kept on and surged late to just get up. EVITA was caught five to six wide through the first turn, advanced mildly up the
backstretch, gradually shifted in on the far turn, made the rail at the quarter pole, bid inside in late stretch but missed. SERGEANT MOLLY broke alertly and
quickly moved clear to set the pace racing off the rail in three path, turned back an inside challenger midway on the far turn, spurted clear by the quarter
pole, drifted out turning for home, began to shorten stride and drifted in then out in mid- to late-stretch, was outfinished. TREASURED GEM broke outwardly
and was also forced out a bit, bumping a rival at the start, rated just in behind the leader inside, moved up early on the far turn, made a mild bid coming to
within half a length of the leader from the inside but in the two path and put to urging at the five-sixteenths, was promptly turned back, kept on in the stretch
and loomed a late threat but needed more. COMPASS RISES settled in the four to five path in the back half of the field, passed foes on the far turn coming
into upper stretch five to six wide, ran on mostly one-paced but with mild late interest. KAKE'S TAP DANCER was bumped at the start, settled mid-pack
inside early, faded in the lane. GUN RUNNIN' GAL was reluctant to load, caught seven wide into the first turn taking back and shifting in on that bend but
still racing deep out on the course in behind foes, fanned out again on the far turn still about mid-pack, failed to rally. INCLUDE THE MUNNY was urged at
the start, chased briefly five then four wide steadily dropping back early up the backstretch. INVEST WISELY stumbled a bit outwardly at the start, was not a
threat.

VALUABLE BREIGH moved five then four wide on the turn taking command, drew clear in the stretch while drifting in. CARTWHEEL unhurriedly brought up
the rear, swung ten wide into upper stretch, was no match but second best. LIKING IT TWISTED soon lead vying inside foes but off the fence, faced more
pressure early on the turn, had no extra. THEA'S THEME vied between runners three wide early, made a mild bid dueling early on the turn, lacked the
needed late kick. ROSY APPLE shifted in late up the backstretch, improved position passing foes. LEVIOSA was urged at the start, chased five wide into
the turn, dropped back and shifted in a bit on that bend, came back out turning for home, failed to rally. PROSPERA raced off the pace going four to six wide
on the turn, failed to rally. CALYPSO GHOST attended the early pace, chased four wide into the turn, faded.

SHERO moved forward into the turn dueling early on that bend, took a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, edged clear in upper stretch then extended the
margin, was in hand very late once safely in front. BOUND BY DESTINY was urged at the break but outsprinted early, raced off the inside about in the four
path on the turn and trailing, kept on to get up for second. R AVERIE LYNN was hard to load, broke sharply and was quickly clear to set the pace, raced off
the rail, was engaged and dueled through the turn, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAMP PENDLETON was caught four to five wide in the early going while forwardly-positioned, stalked from outside into the far turn caught wide again,
eased back and angled in cutting the corner past the quarter pole, bid inside, dueled late and held that rival. NIGHT OPS was caught widest into the first
turn but able to move in a path from five to four wide on that bend, pressed up the backstretch going three to four wide on the far turn, contended for the
lead in upper- to mid-stretch, dueled late but was second best. TINY TIN moved quick to the lead setting the pace from off the rail, pressured up the
backstretch, contended till the lane but was outkicked. LIFESPAN switched off the rail in the early going racing in the two then three path on the first turn,
settled in behind the leaders, floated nine wide into upper stretch and gaining, loomed a threat at the furlong grounds but could not sustain the effort and
evened out. MELINA'S DREAM was outpaced racing inside, fanned six wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. UNDERDOG was coaxed forward,
raced three wide in range of the leader early, moved four wide into the far turn making a bid near the quarter pole, drifted out numerous paths leaving that
bend, weakened in the stretch. COSMIC TREASURE was in tight on the rail entering the first turn, raced near the inside off the lead, failed to rally.
FEARLESS FLY raced outside at the rear in the three to four path early, failed to menace.
