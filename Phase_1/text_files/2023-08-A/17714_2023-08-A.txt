Footnotes
EMM ESS EH showed good early foot to set the early pace near the inside down the backstretch, challenged into the far turn and responded well to edge
clear under strong handling. ENEMYNUMBERNINE rated along early, ridden along three deep near the three eighths pole to challenge the leader and kept
on in the drive to finish second best. BUCKIN' LUCKY raced mid pack early on, moved up along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled
out near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. VIENNESE WALTZ settled off the early going, ridden along two deep past the quarter pole and lacked a
bid. SEVERN SPIRT pressed the early leader three deep, raced two to three wide around the far turn and faded while racing from the outside. HONEY B B
was off slowly, lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
QUINCANNON pressed the early pace three wide from the outside of foes, shifted out through the drive and just got up under strong handling. SALOON
dueled early on near the inside, raced two deep between through the far turn, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. JUDY'S ARMY was bumped
soundly at the start, raced mid pack early, was near the inside around the far turn, angled through the stretch and closed in gamely. IRISH WARLOCK was
bumped, checked at the break, made an early five wide bid near the quarter pole from the outside of rivals, led near the eighth pole and weakened late.
DISPUTED NOTION dropped back near the back of the pack early on, moved up three wide through the far turn, raced in a bit tight near the eighth pole,
angled in and raced evenly late. BOLD HONOR settled off the early going, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. GLORIOUS
MAHOMES dueled for the early lead along the inside and faded. PER RULING FROM HIWU, SALOON WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

under strong encouragement. PEACH TEA rated along under a firm hold early, raced near the inside around the far turn, dug in through the stretch and
finished gamely to the wire while racing three deep. ARIEL MOON showed good early foot to set the early pace, raced well clear near the eighth pole and
gave way to the top pair grudgingly. TALONNADE dropped back off the early pace, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late
rally. TINA TINA TINA stalked the pace early on, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no final winning bid. ROANAN GODDESS was off a
step slow, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no late rally. DETERMINED BLUE pressed the early leader from the
outside and faded in the drive. CUNDI settled back off the early going, raced three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. MONSTER SUMMER
settled off the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. ROBBERY stalked the pace, raced five wide around the far turn
and faded in the drive while racing from the outside.

Footnotes
DESTIN'S MISSION sprinted clear early on and held well to prove best under strong pressure. BOSS MAN J J tracked the early leader from the outside two
deep, dug in through the stretch run racing four to three wide and kept on gamely to the wire. FREESTANDING tracked the top pair from the inside and kept
on while continuing to race near the inside. BOURBON CURRENCY dropped back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn and had not enough in
the drive racing four wide. MARATHONER raced three wide early on down the backstretch, was five wide into the upper stretch and raced even with no
closing run. MONSTER MASON was off slowly, settled off the early going, raced three to two wide in the lane and had no late rally. PRINCE PERE coaxed
along early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid.
