Footnotes
PATIO'S PORCH vied for the lead, took the rail, set the pace, was never challenged and won easily. MYGLORYBEE was off mid pack and racing on the
rail, edged out along the back side into the three path, launched a bid at the three eights pole and angled out into the six path, was asked at the quarter pole
and responded well finding his best stride late closing well and gaining ground quickly, needed more time and ground. SPARKIN vied for the lead, then
ended up stalking the pace from the three path, followed the leader through the turn and chased down the stretch, could not get tot the winner but was
second best today. PUNCHIE stalked the pace from the four path, raced between foes, was hand ridden i n the turn and encouraged, improved position
sligthtly, then ran even down the lane. CHARLIE'S PARADE was a bit keen on the bit but still in a stalking position early on, raced three to four wide down
the back stretch, launched a bid at the three eights pole and edged out into the four path, made a move to circle the field, spooked at horses to the inside,
steadied, regained composure and raced into the stretch in the six path and finished even. SERRANO'S WARRIOR vied for the lead, then stalked on the
rail, and gave way by the three eights pole. ROCK SOLID WORDS was bumped by foes on both side at the start, raced on the rail but had no impact.
SAUCER EYES raced from off of the pace angled out five wide through the turn but to no avail. SNAKEBIT trailed through out.

in between horses four wide, maintained her position until the eighth pole, shifted out seven wide and closed well getting up for second place honors. MISS

closing rival, settling for third place. ZYDECO MUSIC was off a bit slow, raced on the inside in the two path, saved ground through out, shifted out a bit in
the upper stretch, then shifted back inside while closing ground. NONEYA raced in the middle of the field, raced between horses in the two path, maintained
position, then closed with a mild bid late. LAKE MARIE vied for the lead, shuffled back into a stalking position, stalked from the three path, was wide through
the turn, and had no rally late. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN ran from off of the pace in the two path, and finished with an even effort. FREE LIKE A GIRL was off of
the pace early, stayed to the outside racing in the seven path, improved position slightly down the back side, was mid pack through the turn, was cued at the

STAR MOMENT stalked the pace from the two path, saved ground racing on the inside, stayed tucked behind the leaders through the turn, patiently waited
for her cue, finally was asked at the eighth pole, she responded well, willingly exploding into another gear and charging home, ambushing the front runners,
taking the win and everyone by surprise. BIRDIE CALL vied for the lead, led while racing on the rail, did all of the work up front, was merely a few strides to
the wire and was caught late settling for second. WHOLELOTTAMO raced from the middle of the field, stayed to the inside advancing up the rail, launched a
bid at the half mile pole, continued to gain ground on the inside, moved into the a bad spot going into the turn,, clipped heels with a rival in front of her
switching leads traveling into the turn, was thrown off balance, had to re gain her stride and was able t finish third. EVE'S DELIGHT vied for the lead, raced
on the rail, stalked the pace, then gave way. A G'S CHARLOTTE raced mid pack and in the three path, finished even. CHEAPSKATE DIVA stalked the
pace, raced the three wide, launched a bid at the half mile pole, was in contention but had no kick. FORT POLK raced off of the pace, was four wide and
made no impact. LOUISIANA LIBERTY was off a bit slow, raced in the four path while trailing the field, improved position, was widest in the stretch and had
no finish. MO BLING was mid pack and in between horses funning in the three path, but could never get involved.

one run gained mildly. BLACK SWORD was off the pace and was never involved. STARPORT flashed early speed and faded. CHARLI MICHAEL was fast
but faint early.
