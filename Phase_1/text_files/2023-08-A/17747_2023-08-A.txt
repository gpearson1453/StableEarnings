Footnotes
WESTERN CAPE was asked to show speed leaving the break and dictated terms in the early stages, set a decent pace to the turn then extended the lead
heading to the quarter marker, kept to task to mid-stretch and drew away under mild urging in the final sixteenth. BID ON THE PRIZE rated off of the decent
early pace while outside of runners, chased three wide along the turn and raced widest into the stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages
but offered a mild late bid and secured the place in the final strides. SMILING FELON was fractious in the gate, broke in at the start and was off slowly,
rushed up in the early stages and pressed the decent pace while inside of WESTERN CAPE, chased that rival into the stretch, weakened in the final furlong
and was outfinished for the place in the final strides, while well clear for the show. VINNIEBOB raced close to the decent early pace while between runners,
lost position into the turn, was outrun to the quarter marker and tired.

Footnotes
WOUND UP tracked the fast early pace while outside of DAD BOD, advanced to press that rival while three wide on the turn, took command nearing the
quarter marker, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, was kept to task under moderate urging to deep stretch and pulled away in the final stages. MR.
CLUTCH was allowed to settle in the early going, was coaxed along two wide into the turn then swung four wide for the drive, improved position at the
furlong pole, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages and stayed on to secure the place. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was forwardly placed in the
early running, chased the fast pace into the turn and gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, came three wide for the drive and ran evenly to
the furlong pole, lacked a final response in deep stretch and was outfinished for the place, while just holding for the show. UNION GIG bobbled at the start
and was off a bit slowly, chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground while two wide and between runners along the turn, came in tight
in upper stretch and checked in traffic, shifted out for the final sixteenth, lacked the needed late response and missed for the show. ALMANERA (IRE)
chased the solid pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. DAD BOD broke alertly, showed good early speed and
set a quick pace to the turn, carved out fast fractions while off of the rail and was pressed by WOUND UP along the bend, was overtaken nearing the
quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
TIGER IN MY TANK broke alertly and was prominent leaving the start, contested the solid early pace with KRISTIN LEE while outside of that rival, dueled
with KRISTIN LEE along the turn while carving decent fractions, took command leaving the quarter marker and drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, widened
the lead under moderate urging into the final sixteenth and was hand urged to the finish as much the best. AUTISM INCLUSION took back off of the quick
early pace while not far back, chased the dueling pacesetters while between runners along the turn, was guided to the outside approaching the top of the
lane and came four wide for the drive, rallied widest in the final furlong, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages but finished well and was up in
the final strides to secure the place. KRISTIN LEE was asked for early speed and engaged with TIGER IN MY TANK to set a quick pace into the turn,
dueled along the bend with that rival while inside of TIGER IN MY TANK, could not match strides into upper stretch, ran on into the final furlong, was just
edged for the place in the final strides and just held for the show. DRUM BUNNY bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased from the rear in the
early running, was coaxed along outside of rivals into the turn and raced three wide while gaining ground nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
could not muster a final response in deep stretch and just missed for the minor awards. CLEAR THE COAST raced close to the solid early pace while
outside of rivals, lost ground while three wide along the turn, chased the leaders to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. DADS DREAM chased the
solid early pace while outside of rivals, slipped to the inside and saved ground along the turn, could not keep pace into the drive and did not threaten.

Footnotes
PRINCESA DEL TIGRE was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the pace into the first turn, was carried five wide along the first turn by DUST
MAKER, recovered into the backstretch run and attended to the decent pace while two wide, was given her cue and confronted the pacesetter along the far
turn, took command into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, came under pressure from MY YAMMY LADY in the final sixteenth,
was fully extended in the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. MY YAMMY LADY was allowed to settle, trailed through the backstretch run while
saving ground, was roused at the quarter marker and mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, put pressure on
the winner in deep stretch but could not get by and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. GETAWAY CHARM was prominent into the first turn,
stalked the decent pace from the inside through the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn and lost ground while in tight nearing the
quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, was unable to impact the top two in the final furlong but stayed on and won the nod for third in a blanket
finish for that position. A ROUSING BABE settled off of the decent early pace, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, mounted an inside bid
along the second turn, could not sustain that bid into the stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and was just edged for third. TOM'S STYLE tracked the
decent early pace from a two wide path, tracked outside of an inner rival through the backstretch run, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn and
gained ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages. DUST MAKER assumed command leaving
the break and dictated terms into the first turn, drifted out to the four path leaving the seven-furlong marker and carried out PRINCESA DEL TIGRE,
recovered heading into the backstretch run and set moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, was confronted by PRINCESA DEL TIGRE nearing the
quarter marker and was overtaken heading into upper stretch, chased into the drive and gave way in deep stretch.

stretch, drifted out a bit at the top of the lane, was set down and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task to deep stretch and drew away
in the final stages for a convincing win. MATCHLESS settled off of the solid early pace, raced outside of a rival into the turn and improved position nearing
the quarter marker, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, could not impact the winner in the final stages but
stayed on and was up in the final strides to secure the place. JAZZY LOVE tracked the quick early pace while outside of runners, improved position while
two wide along the turn, was asked for run three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker while in pursuit of BLACK ZABAT, could not muster
the needed late response and was just edged for the place, while clear for the show. PANDEMIC GIRL bobbled at the start and was away slowly, trailed into
the turn and was guided three wide along the bend, mounted a five wide bid heading into the lane, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and passed
tiring rivals in the final stages. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE tracked the solid early pace from the inside, angled four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch
and offered a mild late bid. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA tracked the solid early pace from mid-pack, was coaxed two wide into the turn and gained ground
nearing the quarter marker,, swung three wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and weakened.
MADAME GAZELLE tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn, mounted a two wide bid nearing the quarter marker,
chased the leaders to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. SHE'S SO FANCY was sent leaving the break and showed good early speed,
dictated terms while clear into the turn and showed the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the quarter marker, Burnham lost her crop
approaching the top of the lane, chased to mid-stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ALFONSIA stumbled at the break, recovered nicely and raced extremely wide down the backstretch but well in hand, angled to the inside and saved ground
through the turn, deftly sliced through a narrow opening approaching the quarter pole, swung out to the four path for the stretch run and launched a strong
rally down the middle of the track to prevail. MAGIC WANDERER broke a step slow then was knocked off balance by ADAPTED MEMORY, rushed up to
gain a tracking position behind the speed duel, bided time through the turn while saving ground, responded when asked to go after the leaders past the
quarter pole, tipped out to the three path for the stretch run and finished well but as unable to fend off the winner in the final yards. SURFLINE broke sharply
and was inside of the calvalry charge for the early lead, kept to the inside path and took a short lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, repelled a bid from
ADAPTED MEMORY, getting the best of that one inside the furlong pole, then could not hold off a pair of closers but held on for third. ADAPTED MEMORY
broke in and slammed into MAGIC WANDERER, then rushed up to race between a quartet of horses contesting the early pace, gained a short lead going
into the turn, battled with SURFLINE to the furlong pole then weakened. LITTLE CHEYENNE broke inward and bumped OH ANGEL at the break, then
raced wide down the backstretch while pressing the early pace, continued wide through the turn, came into the stretch racing on the wrong lead, had no rally
and continued to race greenly to the wire. OH ANGEL bumped at the start but was still able to be part of the early pace mix to the turn, began to struggle to
keep up passing the three furlong marker then had nothing to offer in the stretch. RAY TAYLORS RUMBLE was slow to get into stride, fell far behind early
and trailed the field throughout.

CLOVISCONNECTION assumed command after an alert beginning and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions while well handled through the
backstretch run, inched away along the far turn, extended the lead approaching the furlong marker, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and
held safely in a drive to prevail. COUSIN RICHIE was a bit keen in the early stages, settled along the first turn and saved ground into the backstretch run,
tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker and saved all of the ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and advanced at the furlong
pole, was able to make a mild gain on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel in CLOVISCONNECTION and held for the place at the finish. TRINIDAD
was allowed to settle in the early running and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while between runners through the backstretch run,
was well placed while two wide heading to the far turn, made a steady gain into the stretch, continued that bid into the final stages and was up in the final
strides for the show. DRUIDIC settled outside of an inner rival along the first turn, was unhurried while two wide through the backstretch run, came in a bit
tight entering the far turn and was steered three wide heading to the quarter marker, swung widest into upper stretch and mounted a six wide rally into the
drive, closed willingly while widest through the lane and just missed for third at the wire. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) was prominent in the early running,
stalked the pace while three deep along the first turn, tracked outside of rivals along the backstretch run and was coaxed along three wide into the second
turn, was set down four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster a final response in deep stretch and was outclosed. SEA DOG was
squeezed at the start and was away slowly, settled along the inside into the first turn, improved position heading to the half-mile marker and continued that
advance while saving ground approaching the quarter pole, mounted an inside bid in upper stretch, could not sustain that run into the final stages and did
not offer a late response. RODRIGOKNOWS was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace from a two wide path into the backstretch
run, advanced to prompt CLOVISCONNECTION to the half-mile pole, ran in pursuit of the pace setter along the far turn, was coaxed along three wide into
the stretch and gave chase to the furlong marker, could not offer a final response in deep stretch and gave way. HAPPY DOES was forwardly placed early
on and stalked the decent pace while four wide along the first turn, tracked from the second flight through the backstretch run, lost position into the second
turn, chased while four to five wide into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NOLDE reserved from the start, settled at the back of the field through the early stages, relaxed in hand down the backstretch, circled the field with three
furlongs to run, surged ahead at the three-sixteenths pole and won as the rider pleased in a very impressive effort. RESPECT THE HUSTLE not asked for
speed from the break, settled near the rear of the field and in the three path, awaited room through the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the clear
turning for home and made a nice late run but was no match for the winner. ECOLOGIST raced between horses tracking the early leaders, was being
prompted some to keep up but was going well through the far turn, got a rail run into the stretch and kept on well enough to gain the third spot. LIL
MIRACLE MAN came away well, was able to get good position through the first turn, settled in a tracking position three wide to the far turn, launched a rally
from the five-sixteenths, came into the stretch still three wide, bumped with HEY MATE at the head of the stretch, continued to run on but was unable to find
another gear when needed. IL CAPITANO lunged leaving the break and was away a step slowly, rushed up and was sent for the lead into the first turn,
seized the early advantage and then opened up a clear lead when unchallenged, held that lead to the stretch, denied a bid by HEY MATE from the quarter
pole to mid-stretch, then weakened in the late stages and was unable to hold position. HEY MATE broke well, allowed IL CAPITANO the lead and tracked
from a couple of lengths behind, moved to challenge going into the far turn, was never able to overtake that stubborn rival, was bumped off stride by LIL
MIRACLE MAN just past the three-sixteenths pole, lost any chance at that point and finished evenly. AUSPICIOUS STYLE got a good trip through the first
turn and was inside of a trio tracking the early pace, stayed inside through the far turn and was forced to idle and wait for racing room to the stretch, found a
wall of horses in front turning for home, had no rally and was long-stepping rough spots in the grass intermittently down the stretch. TWIRLING DERBY
broke well then allowed to settle at the rear, saved ground, was poised to make a run in the far turn, checked slightly in traffic and was not able to recover
and chased the field home.
