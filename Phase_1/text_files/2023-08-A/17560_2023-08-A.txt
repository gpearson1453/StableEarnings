BOX STEP away alertly, set all the pace, shook clear under right handed urging in upper stretch and prevailed under energetic handling. SPARKLING
JEWEL close up along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the five path nearing the top of the stretch and was steadily gaining ground late under right
handed urging. RAINBOW SHIP never far back, finished with good courage in the four path. KICHI KITSU broke slowly, rushed to contention outside rivals,
drew on near even terms for the lead two wide midway on the turn then was used up. INDY PRINCESS KOKO was no threat. SCATERRA stalked pace
along the inside for three furlongs then gave way in the stretch.

RUMBLE STRIP RON saved ground through the far turn, shifted out to the two path, split horses two wide under right handed urging in mid stretch, made
the lead late and won under confident handling. GOLD N SILVER away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside until deep stretch then couldn't handle
the winner. VISUAL MISSION settled four wide early, dropped back and angled in to the two path on the far turn then came on again late three wide.
NAMBITI with the second flight along the inside, moved up on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. SPEEDY MOBILE pressed the pace three wide and
faded in the stretch. POWERFUL PHIL was no factor. SERVE REVENGE COLD stumbled at the start, advanced steadily outside rivals into the far turn then
came up empty. ATTACK ANGLE pressed the early pace two wide, stopped abruptly on the far turn, pulled up at the top of the stretch and was walked off.
