Footnotes
TOP BLUE vied for the lead, raced in the two path while setting the pace, was joined by another competitor and worked in a set, then was joined by two
more to the outside and led in a four way set, raced through the turn, shook one, continued into the stretch, battled down the stretch in a three way battle,
after a grudging effort TOP BLUE was finally able to grind down the other two and pull away for the win. OLD BAY vied for the lead, raced in the three path
while matching strides and setting the pace with another inside foe, had another set of two join on the outside, raced in between horses, shook one and
went into the stretch in a set of three, battled down the lane, OLD BAY was a little bit leery to commit to racing exactly in the middle of the other two, did not
want to go through and pass the winner but was second best today. SPIN THE BREEZE stalked the early pace from the four path, advanced, joined the
leaders at the half mile pole, raced on the outside of three other rivals, eliminated one rival, and went into the stretch with a three way battle on her hands,
battled gamely for the first sixteenth then finished even. BOH'S N O'S stalked the pace from the three path, shifted into the four path and launched a bid at
the three eighths pole, circled the field on the outside, was encouraged into the stretch and asked through out the stretch drive but had no late kick. BETSY
IS THE GAL raced on the rail, tried for the lead, led briefly in company with another competitor, took back and settled into a stalking position, stayed to the
inside saving ground through out, then tired in the lane. CHARME DISCRET raced off of the pace while trailing the field, moved up and improved position,
shifted six wide entering the upper stretch, but was never able to get involved.

NEVER CHANGE stalked the early front runner from the two path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, shifted into the three path and went for the lead,
cleared the leader by the quarter pole and led the field into the stretch, had one rivals threatening the whole stretch drive but did just enough to stay a length
in front and was able to hold sway for the win. INSTIGATED stalked the early leaders from the three path, shifted into the four path at the three eighths pole
and circled the field in the turn, was in contention at the top of the lane, was encouraged down the lane and closed with conviction, could not get to the
winner but was able to hold off the rest and score second. TEEWINOT PASS was off of the pace the early part of the race, stayed in the three and four
paths as he started to put his run together, launched a bid at the half mile pole, improved position, gained ground with a steady stride, closed in the stretch
and got up just in time to take third place money. GOODLUCKCHUCK stalked the pace from the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled
the field through the turn, cleared the front runners by the five sixteenth pole, raced between foes entering the upper stretch, shifted into the rail and finished
flat. I AM THAT I AM raced in the middle of the pack early, raced in the four path, gained ground and improved position, angled out to the outside and
circled in the turn, was seven wide in the upper stretch, was cues but did not have any late kick. SHANE'S JEWEL vied for the lead, raced in the two path,
set the early fractions, was challenged by another rival at the five sixteenth pole, relinquished the lead and faded. JARLIAN raced mid pack, stayed inside
on the rail, but was never a threat. CURLIN'S THRILL was off a bit slow, raced in the three path as she trailed, put together one run, gained ground and
improved position, shifted into the seven path, was asked and responded with a mild bid late. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU stalked the pace, raced on the rail
and saved ground, then retreated.

Footnotes
INSIGHTFUL vied for the lead, took control of the race, set the pace from them rail, was able to go wire to wire as the best in the race today. SCAMPER
ALONG was off in the middle of the field, raced on the outside of the third tier of horses in the four path, circled the field through the turn, found best stride
and corned the turn well, closed down the lane on the inside with urgency, was flying in the last sixteenth closing in on the winner but had too much to do
and just missed settling for second. SHINELIKEADIAMOND stalked the pace, raced two wide, challenged for the lead at the quarter pole, battled briefly but
could not sustain the bid and flattened out finishing third. CLASSY SADIE was mid pack, raced on the rail inside of the second tier, advanced position, was
tucked in behind horses through the turn, needed room but didn't get it and had to angle out into the three path, tried to get running again but had lost too
much momentum and ran even. CHLOE ROSE raced mid pack in between horses in the second tier, continued to traveled in the two path into the stretch
but made no impact. RED PRIESTESS raced off of the pace, raced on the rail as she settled trailing the field, improved late. TRULY AMBITIOUS was sharp
out of the gate and briefly rallied to gain field position, settled into a stalking position, stalked through the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
STILL GAME was off a touch slow, trailed the field, launched a one pace, one run bid, circled the field in the turn while gaining ground and building
momentum, shifted out six wide for the stretch drive, closed well with a one pace run and a well timed trip, cleared the leader in the last few jumps and won
with a game effort. ARCH STREET was off in the middle of the field, raced in the four path, launched a bit at the three eights pole, challenged for the lead at
the quarter pole, battled for the first sixteenth of the stretch drive, took control and took the led, looked like the winner drawing off but was run dawn late and
just missed. SHUDABEENACOWGIRL raced from off of the pace, traveled in the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, then finished even.
PUSSYCAT was sent out of the gate and established early positioning, raced in the two path and shuffled back a bit, was asked to go when an outside
competitor launched their bid, had to steady at the three eights pole and lost momentum, shifted down to the rail during the stretch drive closed well.
CORONA CAMPIONE raced mid pack, stayed on the fence, maintained position, shifted into the five path in the middle of the stretch, but made no impact.
RAPID RUBY was racing in the middle of the field from the three path, improved position, was in contention at the tope of the lane, then faded. SUN
STREAMING raced from off of the pace, stayed on the rail and saved ground, but never really go involved. KAPATUDE stalked the pace from the rail but
was nomenace. TIZ RACE DAY vied for the lead, took the lead and set the pace while racing in the three path then faded.

Footnotes
SILVER STYLE settled in three wide, remained outside rivals while steadily gaining ground, when roused in deep stretch, went clear under an all out drive.
ROCKINGHAM JOE tracked the leader from the start, chased foe around the bend from the outside, inched clear deep stretch, could not hold off late rush
from outside rival, game try. HOLLA AT YOUR BOY nice clean start, controlled the tempo while being chased from the outside, conceded the lead nearing
the furlong marker, stayed on well for the show. FIRE AND KNIVES slow start, raced along the inside entering the turn, saved ground around the bend, no
kick through the stretch. THREE FOLD slow into stride, roused along the inside to gain position, checked hard entering the turn, regained momentum,
finished evenly through the wire. IT'S A PITY last away from the gate, raced well off the pace into the turn, closed the gap through the stretch, never a real
threat. EXTRA MONEY close up while four wide into the turn, in range and still four deep leaving the quarter pole, faded through the lane. TATUM raced
wide and just off the early pace, lost ground around the turn, weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOSS LOGIC stalked the pace from the three path, settled in hands and ran at a comfortable pace, launched a bid at the three eights pole, was encouraged
and hand ridden out of the turn, saw a hole at the top of the lane and angled in, punched through the hole and shifted down to rail, battled with the leader,
exchanged blows, was encouraged and responded gamely, out finished the rest taking the win. HOLDTHEFLIGHT stalked the pace from the four path,
raced in the four path, launched a bid at the three eights pole, challenged for the lead at the quarter pole, took command of the race and led briefly, was
challenged by a closing inside rival, battled with that foe, until seep in the stretch but just missed late settling for second today. LOOKIN AT ROSES was off
a step slow, was allowed to settle and trail the field, was in touch with the field even though he was still last at the three eights pole, launched a bid as he
circled through the turn, angled out into the four path in the stretch, found his best stride coming down the lane andclosed with conviction but needed more
room. MY MAN VITO vied for the lead, raced on the rail while setting the fractions. even though he was on the lead he was rated in hands and launched a
bid at the three eighths pole, then faded during the stretch drive. MIDNIGHT ACT stumbled at the start, was off of the pace, stayed on the rail and saved
ground, but never got involved. PIT BOSS stalked from the rail, then faded.
