Footnotes
DANCING FOR MONEY never far back, closed willingly, drifted to the five path entering the stretch then drifted into the three path near the furlong marker
and proved best by the narrowest of margins under left handed urging. TRAMA QUEEN away alertly, set a pressured pace for a half, shook clear on the far
turn, dug in gamely through deep stretch under left handed urging and just failed. BAD AND BEAUTIFUL pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn,
shifted out to the six path in upper stretch then faded. DUDE'S MIST DATE passed tiring rivals. RAG TOWN with the second flight inside, failed to respond.
TWELVE SHARP was no factor. LIFENHOWULIVIT stalked the pace two wide and was through after a half.
