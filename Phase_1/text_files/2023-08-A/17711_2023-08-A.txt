EBONY EYES away well and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backside while racing just out from the rail, commenced her bid three wide
through the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to take command in deep stretch and draw clear late. B C CHU CHU pressed the
pace from the outside of MS. STANFORD in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead two wide into the final turn, was no match for the
winner late, but battled gamely two wide in the drive to hold the place. MS. STANFORD away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, drifted off the rail leaving the turn, and finished from along the rail
in the drive to just miss the place. STILETTOS ONLY stalked the early pace while racing racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued
four wide into the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. ANZAC BAY steadied through the stretch the first
time when put in tight quarters at the rail, advanced into a stalking trip from along the inside entering the backside, advanced from along the rail midway to
the final turn, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn, angled to the rail entering the lane, was put in tight quarters again soon after entering the
lane, and appeared to clip heels with MS. STANFORD, and failed to regain her momentum. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of
foul. The rider of ANZAC BAY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of MS. STANFORD for alleged interference entering the lane. After review the claim of
foul was upheld, and MS. STANFORD was disquallified from third and placed fifth.

ACE DEUCE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of TIMELESS SHRUG entering the stretch the first time, continued his battle with that
mare in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, opened a clear advantage midway through the turn, and was never seriously threatened late.
VANCOUVER'S HUNTER tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground along the inside, maintained a striking position in the run
down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly in deep stretch to get up for the place.
TIMELESS SHRUG broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from the
inside of ACE DEUCE in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from just off the rail in the drive to
garner a share. VALUE MAX away well and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued three wide into
the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive while racing two out from the rail. BODEGA unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch the

Footnotes
ROSE OF TEXAS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, continued
to show the way while saving ground at the rail entering the final turn, and drew clear in the drive under confident handling. ISLAND LIVING away alertly and
tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, mounted her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed
willingly two wide in the drive to get the place. TOBESUNNY stalked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. VISENYA away well and tracked the leader in the run
down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing at the rail. PROUD CAUSE
unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, was always well back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BELLAROO away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the
final turn, and continued three wide in the drive to be up in time. LASTING LIGHT tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at
the rail, rushed up from along the inside midway to the final turn to challenge for the lead entering the turn, battled for the lead through the turn, and finished
from along the rail in he drive to just miss. ICE BREAKER settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing five wide in the drive to get up for a share. AMANDA settled off the early pace while
racing three wide in the run down the backside, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive.
ARIKARA away well and raced to the lead entering the first turn while racing out from the rail, set a pressured pace into the backstretch, rallied two wide into
the final turn, entering the lane two wide from between rivals. but faded in deep stretch. ZETAMARIE unhurried early while trailing the field into the
backstretch, commenced her bid four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ANAAMY stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, saved ground entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late
stages. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of ARIKARA entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the
outside of that rival to the final turn, before weakening.

NO PEOPLE broke inwards while bumping with HOAX in the opening strides and trailed the field into the backstretch, commenced her bid four wide
entering the final turn, and finished best of all five wide in the drive to get up in time. CHI CHI'S SONG settled off the early pace while racing one out from
the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and closed with a rush from along the rail in the drive to just
miss. ALOBRAH broke sharply and cleared to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backside,
saved ground through the final turn, and just failed to last. LICORICE away alertly and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch, mounted her bid
smartly two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to just miss. I'M ALL SHOOK UP away well and tracked the pacesetter in the run
down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. HOAX was
bumped solidly in the opening strides, but worked her way into a stalking trip from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, steadied sharply when put
in tight quarters at the rail nearing the final turn, and was unable to regain her momentum. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of
foul. The rider of HOAX lodged a claim of foul against the rider of I'M ALL SHOOK UP nearing the final turn. After review the claim of foul was upheld and
I'M ALL SHOOK UP was disqualified from fifth and placed sixth.
