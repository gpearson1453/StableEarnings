Footnotes
HONEY DIJON traded a bump with PERMED at the start, chased just off the inside before briefly tipping to the three path when the leader took over the
space in front half a mile from home, tucked back to the two path into the turn and advanced on that rival knocking heads midway before coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch taking over the front, drew clear under a drive to prevail. INTO STARS struck the off side
stall at the start, chased along the inside, began to get out a bit greenly near the seven-sixteenths and got corrected with a right handed crop and a stiff left
rein and scraped the paint three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. PERMED traded a bump at the start with HONEY DIJON, came under hustling and chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show
honors. SEVEN NATTY PATTY coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along three then two wide before tucking inside through the turn,
came under increasing pressure from HONEY DIJON to the outside through the turn and was headed for command when cutting the corner into upper
stretch, then weakened in the late stages. MY STARSHIP brushed the near side stall at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. BOBBY JEAN
broke out at the start and was corrected, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PHINNEYS HARBOR came away alertly from the outside post, tracked the solo leader on the outside, engaged that foe in the three path on the turn, took
the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was put to a left-handed crop into upper stretch then shook clear, switched to a right-handed crop while remaining
on her inside lead at the furlong marker, was guided in outside the sixteenth-pole then given one final pop of a right-handed crop, remained on her inside
lead under a strong hand-ride while being flagged with the crop to the finish and just held to prevail. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT was urged along at the rear,
dropped back while caught in the five path early on the turn then angled to the rail before the three-eighths, saved ground from that point into the stretch
then moved out around the three-sixteenths, rallied in the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and closed with good courage but just missed while
clear for the place. TERESA was hustled from the gate then carried in early, bumped with a rival near the five-eighths then attempted to savage that foe
briefly before being pulled out by the rider, climbed some near the seven-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the
stretch, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. STRANGE FRUIT was urged along on the outside, chased in
the four path for most of the turn then moved to the five path, spun six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick.
MONTAUK MYSTIQUE went to the front then moved towards the inside, showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged to her outside while inside
to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole and gave way. KNOCKZCATOFFZFENCE broke in then was hustled,
settled towards the back after being taken in hand briefly early, angled out leaving the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. MAGNOLIA WIND was sent hard from the start, bumped with a foe near the five-eighths, chased in the two path on the
turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE chased just off the pace two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths and advanced on the leader to take over command before swinging four then three wide into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive to
prevail. OUR COUNTRY struck the off side stall at the start and conceded five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. ROCK THE
WEEKEND chased four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show
honors along well clear and best of the rest. AMANI'S EAGLE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, yielded the front and floated five to six wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. HONOR LEO JEAN leapt up in the gate fractious
before the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. MORE
THAN WORK stumbled badly at the start falling to his face and tossed the rider in the process, got apprehended by outrider following the finish and walked
off under his own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on MORE THAN WORK before the result was allowed to stand and the race
was declared official.

Footnotes
TRUCULENT broke fast and went straight to the front, moved in early then relinquished the advantage to a hustled rival, stalked the pace on the outside in
the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, shook clear under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop into
the final furlong, drifted in coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a hand-ride to the finish. ROCCO STRONG broke in then was
corrected by the rider, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, was roused four wide on the final turn,
chased outside into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. DATESFREEDOM broke awkwardly and was off a step
slow, was caught five wide under tight restraint early on the first turn then was wrestled back under a vigorous hold, dropped in over heels outside the
seven-eighths pole then advanced quickly on the inside, moved up inside the leader outside the three-quarter pole then dropped back just off the pace, was
roused late on the backstretch, chased inside to the two path on the final turn, kept on some in the stretch and earned the show. MY FRIENDS BEER was
bumped soundly shortly after the start, traveled around the opening bend in the two path under snug restraint, dropped back early on the backstretch then
settled at the rear, was roused in the two path early on the far turn, moved to the three path late on that bend then was driven five wide into the stretch and
failed to respond. TWO THIRTY FIVE was hustled from the gate then bumped soundly with an opponent just after the start, moved from the rail to the two
path on the first turn, showed the way while held together under snug restraint, vied in the two path under urging on the far turn, was headed near the
five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MISS D'OR CHERIE four wide in aim of the front, advanced tucking to the two path into the turn to press the leader from the outside, took over command
nearing the quarter pole and swung three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. BOOK OF WISDOM chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along
second best. MY MANE SQUEEZE broke out at the start bumping EKWANOK, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two to three
wide at the half mile pole, came under coaxing just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position
just holding for the show honors on the wire. RECENCY got away to an awkward start, then got bumped by SUPERSTARSUSAN and conceded four
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed
tired rivals just missing for the show honors at the end. EKWANOK got bumped at the start by MY MANE SQUEEZE, then got forced to steady off the heels
of PRETTY UP five and a half furlongs from home as that rival crossed in front and conceded about a length of ground and position, chased five then four
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. SNARKY established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under intensifying pressure from the eventual winner to the
outside and was placed to coaxing in response with five-sixteenths to go, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to
the finish. PRETTY UP got away to a stutter step start, crossed to chased just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside into the turn and came under
light coaxing when beginning to fade at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. REALTA steadied after the start when
PRETTY UP tucked in front and conceded three lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming under urging at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. SUPERSTARSUSAN broke in at the start bumping RECENCY and then got steadied conceding four lengths to the
front before settling into stride, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

ALPHA BELLA coaxed from the gate intent on the lead, showed the way along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the
backstretch and through the far turn, floated out four wide into upper stretch, went clear through the stretch to the finish while in hand to prevail comfortably
at the end. VIRTUAL REALITY just off the inside latched on the aforementioned foe through the first turn, attended that rival from the three path down the
backstretch, came under coaxing briefly and got out four then five wide at the three-eighths coming under a right handed crop, cornered five wide into upper
stretch thoroughly shaken off and tired.

Footnotes
MAGICAL WAYS moved up to get the lead then showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage under the crop in upper
stretch, drifted out some outside the furlong marker, fought back gamely to get the lead again in the final sixteenth, fought with the runner-up to the finish
and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MOVING PICTURES pressed then chased the pace, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, took the
advantage under urging in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, swapped back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole,
lost the advantage back to the winner in the final sixteenth, battled with that foe under a solid hand-ride to the finish and just missed but was well clear for
the place. PAPI ON ICE bobbled slightly at the start, dropped well off the pace, went five then six wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was
along for the show. SOUNDS SPOOKY chased the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path early on the turn, shifted four then five wide later on
that bend, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SWAY'SINMYDNA lost his footing at the start, settled between foes, dropped
from the four path to the two path under urging on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. PINE VALLEY chased the pace on the outside,
dropped back in the four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. SCOTTO was taken up while pinched back between horses at the
start then dropped back, raced at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. WITH KNOW NAME came inward at the start, was urged
along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left. GINNSU WARRIOR was urged along towards the
rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SUERTE broke in at the start bumping MIGHTY ATLAS, chased along the inside patiently handled until set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command a furlong out, drew clear under a drive to prevail. MIGHTY ATLAS got bumped solidly at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased along
the inside coming under prolonged urging from the half mile pole, steadily threaded through rival and angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while along to just get up for the place honors in the final jump. SOUTH STREET coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive and was nailed at the finish for the place honors while clear
for the show. MIRACLE MIKE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. KINGFISH STEVENS established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under some
pressure from the presence of BUCKORTWO to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. DEPUTY CONNECT coaxed from the start, chased just off
the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened. BUCKORTWO coaxed from the gate,
prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
YONO chased five to six paths off the inside coming under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch, made no
impact. SKATE TO HEAVEN four then three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside at the half
mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered no response. KINGDOM ON PAWS showed brief
speed three wide, came under coaxing four wide at the three-eighths in retreat, went five wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
PAY ZONE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, drifted out a bit
under a right-handed crop in upper stretch and edged clear under strong urging. KASIMBA showed speed then set the pace under pressure from both
sides, vied in the two path early on the turn, lugged out to the three path under extra left-rein pressure outside the five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to
the winner, drifted out in upper stretch, was guided inward in the final furlong and safely secured the place while unable to go with the winner. OFF THE
CLOCK was re-positioned in the gate then taken up while in tight between foes early, raced on the outside while ridden along, went five wide on the turn,
moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DREAMWITHINADREAM was ridden along off the pace, went around the
turn in the two path, swung six wide into upper stretch and gained some but failed to impact. BOLT D'PLATA broke a bit slow then was checked, dropped
well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor. THE COMPAS MAN (IRE) was hustled from the
start, showed speed then pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back at the half-mile pole, chased inside on the turn and tired.
