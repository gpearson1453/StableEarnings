Footnotes
BOURBON THUNDER settled off the pace inside, then two wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled, gained a short lead turning for home, dug in
gamely in the final furlong, dueled with INDIAN BUZZ to the wire and prevailed under hand encouragement late. INDIAN BUZZ tracked on the inside, bid
between rivals entering the far turn, dueled, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive and battled on willingly to the finish. LORD MIO stalked two or three
wide, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly and lacked a late bid. HONOR THE FLEET cleared the field entering the clubhouse
turn, set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far turn and tired. MISSISSIPPI raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. BIG
RED ROCKS stumbled badly at the start, raced four wide early, trailed the field and gave way.

EXTREME ACCESS raced three wide early, made a three wide middle move into contention, took charge past the half mile marker, cruised on the far turn,
kicked away at the top of the lane, then was kept to the task. WISSAM SHARAF was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far
turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed well but second best. PRINCE OF TROY raced four wide early, stalked outside, chased on the far turn and
finished evenly for third. SCREAMING UNCLE tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. COAST ALONG raced off the pace
inside, checked entering the first turn, then settled off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. INTERSTELLAR raced three wide
off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. TWO MINUTES APART raced two wide off the pace, three wide on the far turn and failed to
respond. WAR STRIDE broke slowly, was outrun early and never involved. WALK SADLY set the pace on the inside, then chased the winner and gave way
on the far turn.
