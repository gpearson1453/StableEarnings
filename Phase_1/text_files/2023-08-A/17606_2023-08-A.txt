Footnotes
SPECTRIER moved three wide to the front near the far turn, shook off challenge then increased advantage while kept to his task. RUTHENIAN bid wide
with the winner into the final turn, continued well but was second best. FATHER GLADO set a pressured pace in the two path, lost the lead then was in tight
near the three eighths pole, rebid wide but was no threat. EL PATOJO trailed far behind then caught a fading opponent late. SIDNEY'S BID was urged to
keep up inside, steadied and bobbled slightly nearing the three eighths pole and faded. A claim of foul by the rider of SIDNEY'S BID against the winner for
interference near the three eighths pole was dismissed.

Footnotes
SPEARGUN lacked speed, advanced strongly inside on the turn, angled out then passed dueling leaders and pulled away in the final furlong. BAZOO
stalked outside pacesetters, earned a narrow lead at the quarter pole, battled and was up for the place. FOX RED vied two wide then inside and dueled
gamely to the finish. NEVER SATISFIED raced just off the leaders four wide and flattened out in the stretch. UBIQUITOUS coaxed within range five wide
down the backstretch and lacked a bid. LUCKY AS A SEVEN rushed up to a narrow advantage inside then faded on the turn. RACK GIN dropped back at
the start and trailed throughout.

placed outside the dueling leaders, led on the final turn, continued gamely but could not resist the winner. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR set a pressured
pace inside, dueled to midstretch then weakened slightly in a good effort. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED stumbled at the break, advanced before half a mile
then flattened out. RUSH CENTER settled close up inside then began fading on the final turn. APRIL FOOLS ANDY forced the pace outside for five furlongs
and gave way. CORONOVA chased very wide throughout and lacked a response.

Footnotes
A BIT BAD N BOUJEE angled inside while close up on the first turn, bid into the stretch then ran down the loose pacesetter with a late surge. CHICA
RABIOSA dueled outside for half a mile, shook loose on the final turn then weakened. DAILY BRIEFING prompted the pace three wide then flattened out in
the stretch but held the show. CREME CARAMEL broke a step slowly, advanced wide, bore out into the stretch and was no threat. NURSE RACHETT
forced the pace briefly inside then faded after half a mile. MISS LOYALTY trailed early, raced wide throughout, moved extremely wide into the lane.
RAVENEL chased off the pace and was always outrun. OUI MADAME dropped back along the inside and gave way readily.

Footnotes
LADY LANCER took control at once, widened on the turn and into the stretch and remained well clear under urging. DIVINE PROMISE lacked speed,
moved very wide in the stretch with late energy to easily gain place. BOUNTY KILLAH flashed speed three wide down the backstretch and came up empty
in the stretch. VANA BRIGHT outrun early, faded on the turn and failed to menace. BEST WORST IDEA split rivals with a brief bid on the turn then
weakened. BELIEVE IN LOV broke a step slowly and was never in contention. SAVANNAH'S SUGAR prompted the winner into the far turn, tried to bear out
and stopped. MEDB was urged close up inside then gave way readily.

LOOSE ENDS trailed on the first turn, advanced very wide after half a mile, rallied clear in the final furlong and lasted driving. DREAMING OF GERRY
outrun early in the two path, split rivals in the stretch then surged too late. DEE JAY angled inside setting the pace, resisted when collared and tired while
finishing gamely. FAST BREAKIN CASH raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued willingly late while no threat. TUNE IN moved closer four
wide into the far turn then lacked a rally. SUPER CONSTITUTION saved ground off the leaders and failed to menace. LAST ROMANCE raced off the pace
in traffic, faded on the final turn and was no factor. STONECOLDWARRIOR eased back and to the outside after quarter mile, steadied into the far turn and
retreated.

PROVE MY LOVE dueled outside, took over midway on the turn, moved clear and lasted holding off inside challenge. MAINLINE sluggish early, advanced
inside, split foes rallying in the stretch with a gradual late gain. SYSTEMIC RISK was urged just outside the dueling leaders early and continued gamely to
the finish. FLIRTINI rushed up to contention inside, loomed a stretch threat and continued willingly. KINGDOM QUEEN trailed early outside then continued
wide with some late energy. QUANTICO CREEK dropped back early, raced inside on the turn and was no factor. ALL ABOUT ME dueled inside winner to
the far turn and gave way. GOT ANY steadied between rivals early, raced outside and weakened.

Footnotes
CATALENA pursued the loose pacesetter, bid to the front late, drifted in while pulling clear in the final sixteenth. OJITOS BELLOS angled outside on the first
turn, rallied very wide into the lane then angled back in and gained place. SHE SO COOL trailed early then showed late energy outside in the stretch.
COCO PUFF controlled the pace off the inside, widened on the final turn, kept the advantage then weakened late. DUNE JUMPER dropped back, chased in
the two path and lacked a solid rally. GRAND SPUN was urged close up between rivals then inside and faded on the final turn. LEAPING FOR CANDY
showed brief interest inside then gave way readily. CIRCLE OF COURAGE chased outside and was never in contention. PURRFECT DANI moved close up
inside early then stopped abruptly.
