Footnotes
TIZ A MACHO GIRL was allowed to settle early, moved up three-wide to take the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead and maintained
a safe advantage to the wire. BLAZINGBELLABLU saved ground while reserved off the pace, rallied behind TIZ A MACHO GIRL, angled in entering the
stretch to offer her bid, drifted out behind the winner inside the eighth pole, angled back in and finished well for second in a game try. DAFFODIL SWEET
was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. OUR LYLA GRACE dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and was
gaining late. NAN ELIZABETH lacked early speed, came six-wide into the stretch and improved her position. IN THE RED prompted the early pace, took the
lead before going three-furlongs, set the pace to the five-sixteenths pole and tired. BRILLIANT BIRD set the pace for three furlongs, then chased the pace to
the five-sixteenths pole and gave way.

PRINCE ABU DHABI was reserved off the early pace, moved forward along the outside nearing the three-eighths pole, was five-wide at the quarter pole,
brushed with DESHAMBEAU leaving the three-sixteenths pole then came in to brush with DESHAMBEAU again nearing the eighth pole and edged clear
late. DESHAMBEAU was allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, brushed with PRINCE ABU DHABI leaving the
three-sixteenths pole then was brushed by that one at the eighth pole and was in tight along the inside while finishing well for second in a game effort. J C'S
A LEGEND was unhurried early, moved up 2-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, split rivals during the drive and was gaining late. KAHALA dropped back
early, came five-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. LLOYDS LOGIC vied with OWHATARUSH for the lead from along the inside, shook
that one off after a half mile, set the pace into the stretch and weakened. LANGSTON ROAD stalked the issue while racing three-wide but lacked a rally.
ROYAL HALO settled in the middle of the pack while racing two-wide but was unable to seriously threaten. OWHATARUSH vied for the lead for a half mile
then tired and was eased up on in the late stages. MANGIA PANE saved ground while being close up early, gave way and was eased in the late stages. JIN

rivals, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. AVANTI LEAH dropped back early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, angled out for
room nearing the eighth pole and finished fast for second. PEPPER MILL chased the early pace, moved up along the outside to gain a slight lead at the
quarter pole, came four-wide into the stretch and held on well for third. CARMEL BY THE SEA was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the
stretch but lacked the needed late response. DADS ESTRELLA saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out for room nearing the quarter pole but
lacked a rally. DRIVEWAY lacked early speed, came four-wide into the stretch and improved her position. ALOHA BREEZE vied with STEPUP for the early
lead while two-wide, shook clear before going three furlongs then set the pace to the quarter pole and tired. YOGYA settled in the middle of the field while
racing two-wide but failed to threaten. STEPUP vied for the early lead from along the inside and gave after a half mile. YOUNG LIFE LAURA was prominent
for six furlongs while racing three-wide and gave way.

FIVE STAR GENERAL stalked A MAN'S MAN while racing two-wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, opened clear and maintained a safe
advantage. IL BELLATOR was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, offered a bid entering the stretch, was
unable to reach the winner but closed strongly for the place. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late.
ARMA D'ORO was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. A MAN'S MAN saved ground setting the pace to
near the quarter pole and weakened slightly late. TOP EXECUTIVE settled in the middle of the field racing between horses, came two-wide into the stretch
and went evenly late. ZESTFUL saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a rally when asked. YOU'RE THE CAUSE dropped back early, came
four-wide into the stretch and failed to threateen. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER saved ground while being unhurried and was not a factor. SEATTLE BOLD was
prominently placed while saving ground, appeared to go wrong nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was pulled up and vanned off following the race.

MOSQUITO FLEET prompted Y VEE R from along the outside, drifted out 4-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole while taking the lead, then came in
during the drive causing interference to HUNTERS GHOST and just last. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A JOCKEY OBJECTION,
MOSQUITO FLEET WAS DISQAULIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH. MARCH ON LINCH saved ground while being allowed to settle, swung
out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished fast to just miss but was awarded the win via disqualification. COOLCROSS was forwardly placed from
the outset, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. HUNTERS GHOST saved ground while being allowed to settle, came two-wide into
the stretch, steadied leaving the eighth pole when MOSQUITO FLEET came over in front of him and then was in tight from the point to the wire. BLAME IT
ON KITTY dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. Y VEE R saved ground setting the pressured pace and tired
during the drive. CLAYTON DELANEY was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROLINGA was allowed to settle while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually
drew clear. MEAN SHARON stalked the pace while racing two-wide, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. BELLS
AND WHISTLES vied with YELLEN for the lead to the stretch, could not resist the top two late but held on fairly well for third. YELLEN vied for the lead from
along the inside into the stretch and weakened late. LAKER JET saved ground while being reserved off the pace, angled out for room nearing the sixteenth
pole but lacked a rally.
