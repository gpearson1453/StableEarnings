RUNNING WATER was bumped at the break and forced inward some, responded to urging to gain the lead and the inside, lengthened command leaving
the bend, received brief urging midstretch and proved much the best ridden out. MOCOWBELL broke well but soon was chasing RUNNING WATER from
just outside, could not stay with that one leaving the turn, floated out some entering the lane and closed the gap some as the leader was allowed to coast in
the waning yards. NATIONS DREAM broke inward, bumping RUNNING WATER, chased running widest and could only make up some ground deep
stretch. TOO MUCH TUESDAY broke well but soon dropped to the back, angled out on the bend, came into the stretch behind NATIONS DREAM and had
no late bid. DANCIN' MOLLY was a step slow then forced in at the start, chased from outside, angled in on the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run.

DEVIL'S RULE was kept close and taken inside, split rivals two wide as he commenced his bid on the bend, brushed with PEACOCK MAN upper stretch,
took the rail with a furlong to go, soon gained the lead and kept the latter at bay under steady handling. PEACOCK MAN forwardly place from outside,
progressed four wide on the turn, angled in some leaving the turn, brushed with DEVIL'S RULE upper stretch ad he vied for the lead, angled out some, had
the advantage with a furlong to go but did not have enough left in the waning yards. PACHI in contention early, saved ground taking the bend, angled out
midstretch and gained third inside the final sixteenth. STEPPIN SHEP prompted the pace between rivals on the backstretch, was three to four wide through
the turn, began to fade in the lane, was forced out some by PACHI midstretch then continued to yield. GREAT PLAINES displayed early speed just off or
along the rail for a half mile then gave way.

R H SMOAKEM waited for room just off the inside on the backstretch, gained the rail on the bend, rallied leaving the turn, soon had a clear lead, drifted out
some under left-handed pressure in the waning yards but kept STOSH at bay. STOSH well placed between rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned
out further for the drive and rallied belatedly deep stretch. READTHETRANSCRIPT vied for the early lead from inside, did not stay with MADE TO FIT into
the bend, came off the rail some as he retreated between rivals on the turn, came two wide into the stretch and also found best stride too late. MADE TO
FIT shared the early lead from outside, moved clear into turn, stayed just off the rail, floated out some entering the stretch, was no match for R H
SMOAKEM and gradually wore down inside the last furlong. CARL G a step slow at the break, was hustled along early, went for the lead widest on the bend
but could not sustain his bid through the lane.

Footnotes
IT'S BELLAMY TIME was quickly clear, showed the way from inside in hand, was challenged on the backstretch, roused with two furlongs to go, floated out
to path three as he drew away from the rest again, began to wear down in the waning yards but held sway under steady handling. PRINCE OF MAYHEM
prominent just outside IT'S BELLAMY TIME, angled outside CAMPAIGN SPY when that one took his path midway on the backstretch, was three wide on
the second turn, lost ground staying outside CAMPAIGN SPY entering the lane, lugged in some upper stretch, brushing the latter, rallied the last eighth,
came up short but was easily second best. CAMPAIGN SPY advanced three wide on the backstretch to vie for the lead outside IT'S BELLAMY TIME, began
to yield leaving the second bend, stayed outside the latter into the lane, was crowded and altered in some upper stretch, continued to gradually fade but was
unchallenged for third. SHOBIZ STAR soon trailed, ran widest of all and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ENVEY N ICE without early speed, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, split rivals two wide on the bend, fanned outside TINA'S TAPIZAR for the drive
and swept past DESTINY'S DREAM inside the final sixteenth. DESTINY'S DREAM was hustled to contest the pace from just off the inside, gained the rail
into the turn, jostled repeatedly inside TINA'S TAPIZAR as she slowly edged ahead in the stretch but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. BRIANA
HARPER also without early speed while running widest, came into contention three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run, rallied belatedly
but caught TINA'S TAPIZAR for third late. TINA'S TAPIZAR was also urged early to dispute the pace outside DESTINY'S DREAM, jostled repeatedly with
that one in the lane then slowly yielded the with a sixteenth left. HARPER BRIANA raced closest to the pacesetters on the backstretch but bolted through
the bend and had little to offer along the outside fence in the stretch. HURRYUPANDBYE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
U S HONOUR NAP stalked the leaders from outside on the backstretch, stayed in path three through the bend, rallied under urging in the lane, floated out
slightly as he took the lead with a sixteenth left, held a straight path in the late going and was drawing off. BRIANS WAY hustled between horses early, was
two wide on the turn, fanned out behind U S HONOUR NAP entering the stretch, angled outside the latter soon after, drifted out to path five, rallied inside
the final eighth, lugged in under right-handed urging with a sixteenth to go, was steadied behind U S HONOUR NAP then drew clear for second the last
seventy yards. LAGRUE shared the lead from outside from the beginning, was two wide through the bend, moved clear upper stretch but did not have
enough left the last furlong. KEEN RESPONSE hesitated then broke inward, chased from outside, was also two wide on the turn, angled out to path four
upper stretch and made up minor ground in the late going. TOWN CRIER displayed early speed from inside but flattened out for the drive. THACKER
FROMM void of speed, though urged along, saved ground taking the turn, came off the rail for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. The rider of
BRIANS WAY lodged an objection alleging interference from U S HONOUR NAP deep stretch. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of
foul.

Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY jostled with KIANA'S LOVE several times while in close quarters leaving the chute, was just off the rail on the bend, lost some ground
staying outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS entering the lane, was caught in a narrow path again upper stretch, leaned on KIANA'S LOVE as they approached
the furlong marker, engaged LIFE OF SATURDAYS with a sixteenth left, was all out and slowly edged ahead. LIFE OF SATURDAYS edged ahead for the
lead after the first sixteenth, moved clear and took the rail into the turn, drifted out to path three into the stretch, did not have enough left inside the final
furlong but was clearly second best. KIANA'S LOVE jostled several times with BEIRUT BEAUTY while in close quarters leaving the chute, was steadied for
nearly a sixteenth of a mile while in traffic midway on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the bend, lost further ground fanning outside BEIRUT BEAUTY
entering the lane, was crowded by the latter upper stretch, altered out some with a furlong to go, was no match for the top pair in the late going but was
unchallenged for third. WITCHING in contention early from inside, failed to keep up on the turn, came again upper stretch but could not sustain her bid the
last eighth. TWO MORE TIMES chased from paths two or three, closed the gap some upper stretch then leveled off in the late going. BAILESTON LASSIE
prominent from outside on the backstretch, faded three wide on the bend.
