Footnotes
PRINCESS RUNAWAY dueled to deep from the outside of Made to Hustle and edged clear late to prove best under steady handling. PAGEANT
PRINCESS dropped back off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled to race from the outside through the
stretch run and closed in belatedly. MADE TO HUSTLE dueled for the early lead along the inside and gave way grudgingly. WEST ABBOTT chased the
pace from the outside, raced four deep near three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive. ASUE coaxed along early, raced along the inside around
the far turn and had no final winning bid. BECKON coaxed along early, raced near the rail past the five sixteenths pole and was even late with no closing run
racing four deep. RAINAS ROLLIN raced off the early going, raced from the outside in the lane and lacked a bid. ELL GRAY raced mid pack early, was
three to four wide in the drive and lacked a rally. FROSTED WILD RIDE was off slowly, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. GOOD
SOURCE bolted into the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
FINISHING TOUCH rated along the inside down the backstretch, angled through the upper stretch to race from the far outside and finished well to get up
under strong handling. DESI'S REWARD sprinted clear early on, dug in late and gave way grudgingly. LA NEBLINA stalked the pace three deep, took aim
into the upper stretch and was outkicked. CHALCOLITHIC settled off the early going, raced three wide into the upper stretch, angled out through the drive
and raced even late. HOP TO A DECISION settled off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. LIL H was
forwardly place three deep to lay off the top pair and failed to sustain a bid. ESTA CHUCK was off the early going, swung wide into the upper stretch and
had no late rally. TUDOX ROADSTER raced up close early on and tired readily.
