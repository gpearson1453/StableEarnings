WOMANONTHEWARPATH set the pace from just off the rail, responded to a challenge from FASTESTGIRLINTOWN, edged away at the head of the
stretch, and held under a late drive. QUEEN RHONDA tracked the pacesetters from the rail, lodged a rail bid entering the stretch but lost her path then
angled out and missed after a late surge. SHAKEITFORMEGIRL sandwiched leaving then was gapped, gained closer order into the final turn, and closed
late under mildly handling. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN broke in bumping inside foe, chased wide through the backstretch, moved up alongside
WOMANONTHEWARPATH to challenge the lead near the three-eighths marker, and lacked the rally needed in the drive. SHAKINOFFTHERUST broke out
into WOMANONTHEWARPATH, stalked five wide leaving the backstretch, and lacked a closing response. LUCKY HALO pressed the early pace, was
unable to move on with the eventual winner, and outrun.

STONE CARVER broke sharply then took command while five wide, responded to a looming threat from WALKTHELINE at the head of the lane, was
roused through the strech, and drew clear. DRINKING AGAIN gave chased inside then took back near the half marker, angled out sharply driving between
foes, and was along in time for a second-place finish. RUMOHR REIGNS sat just off the pace, chased into the final turn, rallied inside, and edged clear for
show. WALKTHELINE hustled outside, chased five to six wide in the backstretch, moved up menacingly near the five-sixteenth pole, but was no match for
the eventual winner and weakened in the final sixteenth. SLEW'S BAK settled in the three path, was steadied in traffic into the far turn, and finished evenly.
BON PRIX sat in range and failed to threaten in the drive.

COUNT ON IT sat in striking range while three to four wide, crept closer nearing the quarter pole, was headed into the stretch, and won driving. IT'S
ALEXUS saved ground inside early, was asked to quicken leaving the final turn, experience traffic at the head of the stretch, angled out to the three path
when running room became available, and dug in, in the final yards to score place honors. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE away well, pressed the pace outside of
DAZZLING MIST leaving the backstretch, rallied at the top of the lane and was bested deep stretch, settling for show. STOLEN JEWEL brushed leaving the
gate, raced wide leaving the final turn, drifted in through the stretch, and closed gradually. MAGICAL LADY jostled away then trailed the field, rallied mildly
through the stretch, and gave way. DAZZLING MIST vied inside for the early lead, took pressure from EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE in the far turn, and yielded
inside late stretch.

PRESS GANG vied four to five wide for the early lead, dueled inside of BIG AL'S VISION into the final turn, disposed of rival then turned back a challenge
from TAPIT TO THE WIRE and drew away. EXAMINER hurried inside, dropped back in the far turn, and finished gamely under light handling to score
second place. TAPIT TO THE WIRE lacked early speed, then hustled up into contention angling out to the five path, pressed the issue while three wide into
the far turn, was unable to stall the winner and was outkicked for second. DUNE D'ORO outsprinted early and offered a late rally. BIG AL'S VISION
prompted the pace while four wide, dueled between foes in the far turn, was unable to move on with rivals into the stretch and flattened. FROBISHER BAY
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ONE FOR CHAP raced four wide through the opening turn, was carried out entering the backstretch by KAUAI DAN, roused five wide into the final turn, dug
in at the head of the stretch, and took over the final yards. NICE GUY EDDIE raced three wide into the opening turn, sat just off the early pace from the two
path, chased three wide at the head of the lane, came under heavy urging but was outkicked. KAUAI DAN raced five to six wide into the first turn, shifted
outside under a stronghold, moved up alongside MIDNITE CHILL to contest the front, and weakened late stretch. PACHECO fanned four wide early, found
himself wide into the backstretch, angled down to the rail then gave chase, and missed. CALI CONQUEST settled inside, and closed late. HANDSOME
HENRY raced in close quarters in the first turn, chased outside and showed a mild interest late. MIDNITE CHILL contested the early pace from the three
wide, and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
CHICA HERMOSA broke sharply then settled in striking distance, took closer order leaving the backstretch, took over willingly at the quarter pole then
kicked away once given her cue under a confident ride. MINE ME saved inside early, gained closer order in the far turn then was checked sharply after the
five-sixteenth marker, drove five wide, and kicked on to secure place. PLUM BLUE raced near the back of the field, lacked running room inside near the
quarter pole, found room in the three path entering the stretch, and was outkicked settling for show. ORANGE THEORY reared leaving the gate, chased
leaving the backstretch, and rallied belatedly. TONE IT UP rated well off the pace, found seam inside at the head of the lane, and lacked the closing
response needed. PRETTY ARIA raced wide through the backstretch, and lacked a rally. MISSCZECH was outsprinted in the opening turn, pressed the
pace from the four path, dueled outside of FLORAL and came up empty in the drive. FLORAL emerged the leader into the backstretch, responded to a
challenge from MISSCZECH, and wilted into the lane.

Footnotes
JODEYS LIL PAIN chased three wide, gained the lead at the quarter pole, drew clear, and was geared down late. CAPE'S LEGACY vied hard for the early
lead but was outsprinted to the turn, angled out to the two path, and then came along to take second in the later yards. SUDDENLY FAMOUS broke out into
KULSUM, contested the early pace, was no match for the eventual winner in the stretch and was caught late. LACE ON A CAPE gained closer order in the
final turn, drifted in at the head of the lane, and flattened late stretch. KULSUM bumped leaving then hustled up, and lodged a late bid. CHICKS DIG CAPES
lacked early speed needed, and improved late. WHY NOT DANCE showed some early speed, was under a stronghold in the turn, and lost interest.
LIGHTERANQUICKER offered little. SIZZLIN ROSE flashed early speed and tired.
