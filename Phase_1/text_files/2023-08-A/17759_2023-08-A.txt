JAMAICAN JIMMY stalked the early leader, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. SOUP SPOON set a
pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn, vied to mid stretch and held place. NO MORE was in touch, had a good position on the turn, angled outside in
mid stretch and finished evenly. C BY THE SEA settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. JUNGLE TIGRESS was in range and
hustled along on the turn but faded late.

Footnotes
RADCLIFFE tracked the early leaders from the outside, had a bid on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. BEND IN THE
RIVER was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. GUNZIG STINGER was up close, a
factor on the turn and had the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch but gave way. NAVAL OFFICER forced the early pace and dueled on the turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ROYAL BIZ showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but had nothing left.
FOREST SELECTION was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

the leader, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. MONASTERY LANE was well back, trailed the field on the
turn and finished well. AWILDAS TREASURE was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path a the top of the stretch had no late kick.
MIDNIGHT MEADOW was in touch and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no response. FANCYSOUL was unhurried
early, in tight on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally.

the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SEVEN IS A BREEZE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch needed more. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch weakened. ONE MORE RING was in touch but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact. BODIE tracked the
