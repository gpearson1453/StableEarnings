Footnotes
MYSTIC STORM set the early pace on the inside, then was headed and passed on the turn, made a rebid leaving the turn to draw clear leaving the quarter
pole, then remained clear to prove best, driving. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER was rated along the inside, then was blocked and steadied by the three sixteenths,
then had room leaving the quarter pole and finished well to be clearly second best. STORMY EMPIRE chased the pace three wide and made a four wide
bid leaving the three sixteenths but flattened out, got show award. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was bumped at the start, settled early, three wide by the quarter
pole and had no rally. KITTY MACLEAN prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain the lead but came up empty off the turn.
RUNNERS HEAT was settled early three to four wide and was not a factor.

BOURBON SPIRIT was well rated early, made a four wide move off the turn to take over leaving the quarter pole, then drew clear and remained clear under
mild urging to prove best. CHAD'S FLASH was allowed to settle early, angled out in the lane and rallied well to be clearly second best. GALLANT BUCK
stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid off the turn to vie for command between rivals but weakened, bested rest. TABLE MONEY was allowed to
settle early, advanced two wide on the turn and swung out three wide leaving the turn but was empty in the drive. MAD DRAGON set the pace on the inside
and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SAWYER FOX was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, drew out on the turn, then drew off in the lane under hand urging and was
wrapped up late to prove much the best. EL MUCHO tracked the winner two wide, then chased that rival on the turn and proved to be no match for that rival
while saving the place award. J J'S SOLUTION was reserved early on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to just miss the
place award, bested rest. GOD GUNS N GUTS stumbled at the start and was far back early, improved position late. FLYING CRICKET chased the early
pace in between rivals and then saved ground on the turn and weakened. LONE RETURN was reserved early, failed to menace. ROCKET MAN ATTACK
chased the pace three to four wide and stopped.

BOCA BOY dueled for the lead on the inside and had a long drive in the lane then edged clear late to prove best under a drive. GUN RUSH dueled for the
lead on the outside, two wide on the turn but was out-kicked late by the winner, second best. MOMENT broke outwardly at the start bumping a rival, then
rated early, made a three wide move on the turn but flattened out. SOUL COAXING was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn but
flattened out. JEFF THE LION lacked a serious rally. COALMINER'S KITTEN was sandwiched at the start, then failed to menace. MILLARD'S SMILE was
bumped hard at the start, then was not a factor.
