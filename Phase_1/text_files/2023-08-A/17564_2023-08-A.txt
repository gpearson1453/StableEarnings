Footnotes
OHANA HONOR was well rated early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn, made a three wide bid off the turn between rivals, then hit the front and
was clear by the furlong marker and then drew out in the final furlong to prove much the best under a mild drive. SHERIFF RONNIE vied for the lead on the
outside and then made a four wide bid on the turn to be dueling for command midway on the turn, then came four wide into the lane and proved to be no
match for the winner while staying on to be second best. MORE THAN FIVE was rated three wide early, came five wide into the lane to be in contention but
flattened out the final furlong, was up for the show award. EL CERRITO vied for the lead in between rivals made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole to
be dueling for command but weakened in the drive. FAR FROM HOME vied for the lead on the inside and stopped. XCELLENT MEN vied for the lead in
between rivals three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
ERLAN unhurried early to be at the rear of the pack, circled four wide turning for home to engage the leaders and drew off through the lane. SMALL FIELD
reserved off the pace to the turn, split horse in the turn while steadily rallying and made a mild late bid to be second best. MINE RUN prompted the pace to
the head of the lane, loomed up and lacked a closing response. CESAR tracked the pace from the rail in striking distance and failed to gain ground. DAGDA
sped off to open a clear advantage entering the main track, held his position to the quarter pole and tired. FEUILLETON stalked the pace for the first half
mile and faltered coming up empty.

Footnotes
MANABI pressed the pace three to two wide, then made a bid on the turn to gain a short advantage, drew clear off the turn, then raced a bit green in the
lane while maintaining a clear advantage to the wire under crop urging. HANALEI BAY was settled two wide on the first turn, then was coaxed along on the
turn and eased out to be four wide by the quarter pole, then shifted in off the turn and finished well to be gaining, second best. BLUE CREEK was settled
back early, advanced on the turn three to four wide, came five wide into the lane and offered a late rally to gain the show award. COBBLESTONE BRIDGE
was well placed on the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid, lost show award late. PIRATE RADIO tracked the pace and made a three wide bid nearing
the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. MASTEROFHISCRAFT was reserved early, then passed the tiring rivals. KISTLER set a pressured pace on the
inside and weakened the final quarter of a mile. IMMORTAL LION was rated on the inside, between rivals on the turn and weakened. SAINT HELIER was
reserved on the inside and failed to respond. IRON STREETS was three wide into the first turn, settled on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
CHICKAHOMINY unhurried early saving ground along the fence, slid out to the five path at the head of the stretch and closed with a rush to be much best.
ABSTRACT MOMENT stalked the pace from two wide throughout, loomed in upper stretch and kept on to be up for the place. CALL ME PENNY sped to the
lead in rapid fraction,s responded when challenged at the top of the lane and could not hold on late. LA BEFANA saved ground in a clear pocket along the
fence to be well position in upper stretch and failed to close ground in the stretch. RUN AROUND SLEW rated in mid-pack through the turn and showed
good late interest to be gaining in deep stretch. BLUE HOUR prompted the pacesetter through the turn and faded through the lane. PRACTICAL MISS
tracked the pace from between horses on the turn and had no rally when called upon. OUR BREW raced wide throughout and failed to menace. IMAGINE
RITA trailed early on and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CLARIFICATION was never a factor. BEE MOUNTAIN chased the pace from the fence for half a
mile and tired.

Footnotes
CAINUDOTHETWIST was reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn, then closed up the inside and edged clear late to prove best under a
drive. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM set a pressured pace two wide early, then dropped to the inside on the backstretch, then shook clear off the turn two wide,
but could not hold off the winner late, clearly second best. KOBE'S SMILE was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had a late gain to best the rest.
PARTY DREAM was settled early and three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. SWIGERT was well placed on the inside and two
wide on the turn and faded the final furlong. REBEL CONSORT was rated early on the inside, made a four wide middle move to be in contention entering
the far turn but tired. IN OPEN COURT was settled early between rivals and lacked a rally. APRIL FIRST was reserved early on the inside and failed to
menace. AMOR SALVAJE was three wide into the first turn and never threatened. PALACSINTA pressed the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
DETERMINED JESTER broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, drew off when called upon and finished
convincingly unthreatened in the lane. NEXT EPISODE settled in hand along the rail early on, swung out five wide at the head of the stretch and finished
willingly to gain the place. LOST MY SOCK slow early to be at the back, shifted to the outside in the clear down the backside, and rallied belatedly six wide
down the lane to be closing late. CIRCLE HOME saved ground though the turn while racing near the rear of the field, and closed well through traffic in the
stretch. ASKNOTWHATYOUCANDO raced two wide through the turn to be prominent at the head of the stretch and lacked a late response. DETERMINED
CHARM pressed the pace from three wide to mid-stretch and weakened late in the drive. MELIPONINI BEE was never a threat. CAROLINA SUN well
placed in the early going and lacked a closing kick when called upon. BABA sent early to press the pace while racing from between horses and stopped
turning for home.

Footnotes
COPAZO prompted the pace from between horses down the backside, took command in upper stretch and held in a determined drive. PRINCE OF
PORTLAND reserved in mid-pack to the far turn, cut the corner turning for home and finished willingly in a good effort. FINGAL rated mid-pack down the
backside, circled four wide turning for home to loom up and finished evenly without excuse. ASSERT DOMINANCE pressed the pace to the far turn from
three wide and lacked a closing kick. NICKY BEAR reserved off the early pace, rallied into the turn and showed late interest. HOMETOWN HERO raced
three wide and never menaced. KNOCKHOLT unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, was set to an early drive and passed weaker rivals in the lane.
IT'S ME AGAIN set the pace through moderate fractions and tired turning for home. AUCHINCRUIVE well positioned for a half and came up empty.
TRANSFER THE FUNDS was never a factor.

Footnotes
NAKED AND FAMOUS was well placed on the inside, eased off in the inside nearing the quarter pole, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid,
hit the front leaving the furlong marker and was clear by the sixteenth marker and then held sway late to prove best while on the left lead. FOLE'S NOTION
was reserved early on the inside, angled out by the furlong maker, then continued to angle out by the sixteenth marker and closed well but too late.
CAPITAL CONQUEST dueled for the lead three wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn to gain a short advantage, then was confronted by the winner
and dug in gamely but faded late, bested rest. LAMARVELOUS was settled early, coaxed along on the inside on the turn, angled off the inside nearing the
furlong marker and had no punch. MY MAMBA was reserved early, four to five wide on the turn and had a belated rally. BOMBOLONI chased the pace and
was three wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and weakened. SPRITZER dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive.
AKINGISALWAYSKING was bumped at the start, no early speed and showed some late foot while being no threat. TAPIO tracked the pace and was
between rivals on the turn and weakened. COVERT KAT stalked the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and stopped.
