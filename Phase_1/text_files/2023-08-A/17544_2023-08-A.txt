PROTECTTHEWITNESS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch and held sway without challenge, then increased her
margin in the lane under mild urging. CALVARY KAT mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch,
lugged in and got up for the place. VACCINA stalked the pace on the outside, tracked that one through the second turn, then flattened and held the show.

LORD OF LEGENDS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, then held under steady pressure. LEBASI hopped at the start,
saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that one and held the place. CHARLIE CHARLIE
tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and evened out. WHISTLE ME HOME unhurried, looped
three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and got up for a share. SILVER TOKEN well placed, held position three wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. R BOY BODE stalked the pace on the outside and faded on the two path through the turn.
