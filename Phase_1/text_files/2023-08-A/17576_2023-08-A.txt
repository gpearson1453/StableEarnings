STAR ENTERTAINER had his head turned at the start, trailed for over a half mile, closed rapidly three wide through the stretch under left handed urging
and was along in time. CENTSOFWANDER never far back, surged to the lead with a quick move three wide on the far turn, battled the balance of the trip
and just missed hanging on. CYCLONE pressed the pace three, two wide then along the inside, dueled the length of the stretch but was outfinished. R
CARDINAL PRINCE close up, drifted to the six path entering the stretch giving up ground then came on again late. BOSS BEAR pressed the early pace two
wide, dueled through the far turn then weakened. SCRATCHOFF broke in front, set a pressured pace along the inside for nearly five furlongs then stopped.

ACROSS THE AISLE never far back, closed willingly five wide into the stretch, gained a slight lead before the furlong marker and proved best under right
handed urging. MASTER OF WAR trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed determinedly in the middle of the racetrack to finish clear for second. NOT
YET CHARLIE close up from the start, offered a mild bid four wide on the far turn, matched strides into the stretch then was outfinished. MY TWO AUNT
JOANS unhurried early, loomed boldly four wide in upper stretch then leveled off. JACK'S ADVANTAGE vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn,
checked when in tight nearing the quarter pole, came on again rapidly along the rail before the furlong marker but was outfinished. WHISKEY ROAN chased
the pace into the stretch then weakened. WAR NOVEL away alertly, set the pace in the two path past the quarter pole then folded. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
