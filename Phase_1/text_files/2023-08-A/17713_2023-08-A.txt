down the early stretch, then found more at the very end to be up at the wire just in time. WHOSFORJUSTICE broke outwardly and bumped rival then vied
for the lead with inner foes throughout the turn and into the early stretch, cleared on rival then dueled grudgingly down the lane in two path before being
outfinsihed by HEALING WATERS. ROCKET DOCKET raced along the inside towards the back of the pack, then came out five wide leaving the end to
surge down the lane and be up for the show prize. DOSSIER race at an even pace from the inside throughout the early furlongs then rallied in late stretch
and needed more in the end. KNIGHT'S MOVE was bumped at the start, then raced behind the field, rallied in the upper stretch and was closing well in the
end. FRUITCAKE was bumped hard at the start, then raced in the two path before swinging six wide leaving the turn to rally in the stretch but came up
empty. BARN STORMER raced in the middle of the field while two wide, was in a mild bid throughout the turn then flattened in the stretch. OH SO SOCIAL
led the way briefly at the start, then vied throughout the turn with outer foes to try and maintain the lead, was hard used and tired in the stretch.
