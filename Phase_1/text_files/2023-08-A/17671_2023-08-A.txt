Footnotes
XTREME DIVA pressed the early pacesetter from a two path stance, gained command mid turn, then drew off unchallenged. HONORABLE MISCHIEF was
boxed in while rating in the second flight along the backstretch, trekked the two path at upper stretch, and finished a clear second to the runaway winner.
ISLAND JIVE was unhurried in the early going, travelled the widest of all around the bend, and earned the show with a good response to urging. SASSY
MAMA stalked the pacesetter along the backstretch from a three path pose, angled out and was within striking distance at upper stretch, but weakened in
the final furlong. BLUES CROSS trailed the field through the opening half and passed tiring foes in closing strides. ROSALINA broke alertly, lost ground to
front runners along the backstretch, floated wide at upper stretch, and steadily faded in the homestretch. MIDSHIP MOLLY showed reserve through the
opening half, trekked the two path around the turn, rated id pack at upper stretch, then failed to match strides in the final furlong. LIL SASSY JONES flashed
early foot and gained first command, relished command near the five sixteenths pole, then rapidly eclipsed.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY READY trekked three wide early, rated between rivals and close up at upper stretch, engaged in a stretch duel inside the three sixteenths pole,
and got up in final strides for the score. KID'S INHERITANCE rushed from outset to gain first command, tucked to inside to save ground, led the field into
homestretch, locked into a stretch duel and was nailed at the wire. TWOKO BAY stalked the pacesetter from a two path stance through the opening half,
swung to three wide at upper stretch, then finished evenly behind the dueling duo to secure the show. INESPERADO established an inside stance shortly
after the start, stalked the frontrunners while maintaining that pose, and lacked a response to urging in the homestretch. NOBLE PURSUIT gave chase from
between foes through the opening half, rated three wide near the three eighths pole, then tired in the closing stages.

Footnotes
GO LEE ANN GO settled into mid pack along the backstretch, closed gap on leaders by circling foes at head of turn, trekked the three path at upper stretch,
then dug in for the score in final sixteenth. RUN WITH PRIDE rushed from outset and gained first command, led the field through the bend from a two wide
pose, but was unable to fend off the rally of eventual winner in closing strides. ROCKINMYFEATHERBOA was unable to match strides with top pair after
pressing the pace from an inside position through the opening half. CLOUDLESS BLUE pressed the early pace from between rivals, trekked the three path
through the turn, and was gaining on leaders at finish. SINGSINGSING settled into the second flight as the inner most rival of three abreast, lost ground to
front runners at the midway point, then finished evenly. RETIRED KATHY was unhurried from outset and rated back in early strides and through the bend
before finishing with a good late kick. ISLAND BENDER showed early speed by leading the second flight along the backstretch, tucked to save ground
through the turn, was on the heels of leader at upper stretch, then tired in final furlong. CHUCK'S EVERY WISH gave chase from a three path pose and was
of little threat to frontrunners. REAL AWESOME failed to menace and trailed from outset.

WITHHERBOOTSON tucked behind early pacesetter to save ground through the opening turn, rated in the second flight along backstretch, trekked the two
path at upper stretch, then proved best in duel for the score. MA FRANCE (IRE) rushed from outset to gain first command, led the field into the homestretch,
was headed midstretch and outdueled in final strides. MO SMOKING settled into mid pack through the opening half, advanced on leaders three wide
entering the second turn, then proved best of rest for the show behind dueling duo. SHEZONEZESTREET finished willingly after rearing at the start and
taking a two path journey. ICYWILBURNYEH showed reserve in the early stages, angled out to be widest of all at upper stretch, and was gaining mildly in
the end. DURA THE EXPLORER broke alertly and stalked the frontrunner from a two path stance through the opening bend, rated between horses entering
the final turn, and tired in closing stages. TANTIMA finished evenly after showing reserve in early going and losing ground to leaders with a wide journey.
GIVE EM SHADE steadily faded while saving ground.

SWEET CURALINA was unhurried in the early strides, came under rousing approaching the bend, showed a strong response, circled rivals at upper stretch
as the widest of all, and drew off in final sixteenth. KAMIKAZE BLUE settled as the lone rival in the second flight along the backstretch, trekked the three
path around the bend, but was no match for winner in the end. MIZ MCCOY gave chase from mid pack along the backstretch, closed the gap on leaders
through the turn, was four wide at upper stretch, and finished willingly. ALLOTROPE failed to sustain bid after rushing to first command and saving ground.
RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE pressed the pace from two path, rated close up between rivals at upper stretch, then faded in the final furlong. SHEZA REAL
DEAL steadily faded and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BEAT THE HEAT settled into mid pack through the first turn, advanced on leaders inside the half pole with a rail rally, angled out at upper stretch, split foes
near the three sixteenths pole, and got up in final furlong for the score. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) stalked the pacesetting duo while trekking the two
path, rated four wide at upper stretch, was steadily urged inside the eighth pole, and dug in to be second best. NORTHCUT pressed the pace from a two
path stance through the opening half, had a slight advantage on all rivals at upper stretch, but could not fend off the late charge of top pair in closing strides.
KING NATE was unhurried early, angled out to be widest of all at upper stretch, and finished willingly to improve placing in late strides. MOVE OVER (GB)
settled into second flight and chased the pacesetters from an inside position through the opening half, then was forced to three wide at upper stretch, and
came up empty in the end. IMA HARLEY TOO failed to sustain bid after rushing from outset to establish a ground saving stance and leading the field
through the half. UNBROKEN SONG showed reserve through the opening turn and tucked to the inside to save ground before tiring in crucial stages.
