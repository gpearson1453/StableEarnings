Footnotes
NENE ROMANO broke out, weaved early and bumped with AROUSING LOVER, contested pace three wide on the backstretch, shook clear early on the
turn, entered lane clear, kept to task and won with a diminishing margin. AUNTIE BEV vied for lead along the inside with a pair of rivals, continued to hold
the rail on the turn, entered lane in range and kept to task, and gained on leader to the wire. LADY RANGER vied in between rivals for the lead on the
backstretch, continued two wide most of the turn, unable to match strides with top two in the lane, but kept on to hold show. ASYLUM stalked trio of leaders
on the backstretch, continued to save ground throughout and bested the rest while never threatening to improve. COUSIN NIECEY stalked trio of leaders in
between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and failed to rally in the lane. FOR MY BROTHER reared and came away slow, cantered
along after losing all chance and never threatened. AROUSING LOVER bumped by weaving rival exiting the chute, kept well of the rail on the backstretch,
took turn four wide and kept wide through the turn, and came up empty approaching the lane.

EMPRESSUM away cleanly, floated out two paths early by SCOOPS DYNASTY, took the lead after SCOOPS DYNASTY was straightened out, kept under
a stiff drive, lightly tapped on right should late and just held on in a tight photo. SCOOPS DYNASTY away best, asked right handed early, drifted out, asked
again right handed, drifted out another path, finally straightened out with an eighth to go, asked right handed again, gamely dug in to the wire and just
missed. JETTZ away cleanly, drifted out two paths early, asked right handed midway, drifted in late and bested the rest. CHARLIES FAST MAN away
cleanly, drifted out early, asked right handed early, and asked lightly right handed late in an even effort. APOLLITICAL FAMOUS V rubbed outside part of
the gate, quickly in tight, lugged out to get out of tight spot and kept under a hand ride to the wire.
