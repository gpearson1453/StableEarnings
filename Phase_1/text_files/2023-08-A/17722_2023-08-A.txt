Footnotes
BEE BEE THE KING broke out at the start, took control from the onset setting the pace down the back straight, opened up on rivals running well in hand
through the turn, was unchallenged in upper stretch and comfortably cruised home for the front running victory. CHICAGO TYPHOON broke in at the start,
chased the winner down the backside, could not match strides with the winner losing ground on the turn, continued to chase but to no avail in the stretch
and gamely held for the place share nearing the wire. SEATTLE POINT settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, took closer order on the rail
running on the turn, determinedly finished up on the fence to the wire and just missed getting up for the place share in the end. GIZMO'S MISSION stalked
four deep outside horses in midpack at the half, was shuffled to last running three wide outside horses throughout the turn, swung out widest in the five path
for the stretch run and passed leg weary runners for a minor role in the end. FAJARDO was pinballed between foes at the start to trail down the backstretch,
advanced with rivals on either side commencing his run at the three furlong marker and could not find more turning for home and showed little through the
stretch to the finish line. LEGAL STEPS stalked in midfield three wide between runners down the backside, gained position tracking the leader three wide
outside through the turn, shifted four wide for the drive to the wire and levelled off in mid stretch.

Footnotes
TEMPO MADNESS caught a flyer to clear to the lead with ears pricked at the start, was uncontested setting an honest pace down the backside, continued
to be left alone on the turn dictating the pace, was finally urged right handed at the furlong marker and prevailed comfortably holding safe at the finish.
SOUPED UP was content tracking the frontrunner two wide outside down the back straight, chased the loose leader making no gain on the turn, crept a little
closer in mid stretch but needed more late to pose a threat at the finish. CRUMLIN LAD rated on the rail behind the pacesetter keeping watch down the
backside, was roused midpoint on the turn, kept pace with the leaders and finished up evenly in mid stretch holding for the show award at the wire.
MIDNIGHT ARKLE was bumped at the break, travelled at the back between runners with a half left to run, made little impression inside through the turn,
rallied up the fence in the stretch and lost the battle for the third money nearing the wire. ORPHAN HALLIE stalked near the rear on the rail in the beginning,
was check mildly on the fence with three furlongs to go, lost a little ground inside and could not get involved outside running to the wire. SOUPER RUSH
broke inwards at the start, settled in midfield three deep outside at the half, offered a mild turn of foot three wide at the three eighths pole until the top of the
stretch, was in the mix for a small share in upper stretch but stalled four in the four path at the furlong marker. THREE SONNY SIDEUP was bumped at the
start to trail early in the backstretch four deep outside, was nudged for more run at the three furlong pole, could not offer a rally through the turn and did not
reach contention driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
SOUPER CLASSY took this field down the backside on the rail, set the fractions with a narrow advantage running on the turn, was collared outside at the
quarter pole losing the lead momentarily, surged when roused right handed at the furlong marker and began to draw away in deep stretch. DETERMINED
FURY prompted the pace outside down the back straight, continued to hound the frontrunner through the turn, poked his head in front to have a slim lead at
the quarter pole, could not hold off the inside rival in mid stretch and narrowly held on for the place share at the finish. GRAND ALLIANCE broke out at the
start, settled on the rail in the second flight tracking the leaders with a half remaining, was looking for a seam behind running turning for home, had a clear
path at the furlong marker and gamely finished up inside to just miss for the place share at the wire. SMALL TALK was off slow to trail in the early going,
travelled three deep outside foes keeping tabs on the front duo through the turn, rallied around horses three wide at the three eighths marker, loomed the
threat in the four path straightening out for the drive and stalled in the last eighth. GENDRAGON tracked the top two down the backstretch, was in between
runners watching the front pair at the half mile marker, angled widest in the five path to be in the thick of things at the top of the lane but could not find more
to quicken with others in the final eighth.

Footnotes
TOMCAT BLACK was well-placed stalking the leading pair into the turn, went four wide on that bend coming into upper stretch in range and five to six deep,
took a narrow advantage in mid-stretch then edged clear. COMMANDER TOM moved straight to the lead, set the pace racing inside on or just off the rail,
was pressured by an outside foe through the turn, edged away from that one while drifting four deep turning for home, was challenged by a new runner in
mid-stretch, proved no match but just held second. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was bumped at the break then lacking speed, brought up the rear well back of the
leaders, rallied strongly from off the inside while altering outside runners in late stretch, just missed the place. SILENT LUCIDITY broke outwardly bumping a
rival at the start, tracked in behind racing off the rail on the turn, was forced in a bit in mid-stretch, ran on late. UPSTART GENTLEMAN settled off the pace,
went four wide on the turn, shifted eight to nine deep in upper stretch, ran on mildly while forced out just a bit late. CHELSEA DAGGER raced off the pace
about mid-pack four then five wide on the turn, swung out seven to eight deep in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick while coming out a tad very late.
SUPREMEACTION was mid-pack about in the three path into and on the turn, came out six to seven deep, failed to rally. AWESOMECREST pressed then
prompted the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn, drifted in nearing the eighth pole, faded. FIFTH SEASON chased briefly from off the inside,
was never able to threaten.

Footnotes
SPRING MOUNTAIN took control from the onset, rated kindly setting the fractions with a slim advantage down the backside, was headed outside at the two
furlong marker, stubbornly fought on and kept to the task late to hold on for a narrow victory at the wire. NIKKI NOOTS prompted two wide outside on the
first turn, was content to just sit off and outside the pacesetter down the backstretch, was head to head battling for the lead at the quarter marker, chased
determinedly down the lane gaining in deep stretch but just missed in a gritty effort besting the rest comfortably at the finish. PERFECT PLAY travelled on
the rail near the back of the pack in the beginning, advanced smartly on the fence down the back straight under a good hold, waited behind the leaders on
the final turn, was scrubbed on for more at the quarter pole and settled for a non threatening third at the wire. STRONGER TOGETHER settled in midpack
in the early stages of the race, showed some late energy on the fence in the stretch drive and passed tired runners to the finish late to get up and capture a
small share of the prize in the end. DEFOGGER stalked four wide in the beginning, made an early move advancing four deep outside rivals at the half,
angled out six wide for the drive to the wire to be in the hunt for a share at the top of the lane and stalled with an eighth left to run. GIANT ONE tracked three
wide outside on the first turn, travelled in midpack three deep down the back straight, was roused outside horses three wide on the far turn when the field
was bunching up and could offer an even finish in the last furlong. JOLENE JOLENE tracked on the rail on the first turn, had good spot alone watching the
engaging twosome down the backstretch, was roused midway on the far turn trying to keep up with the leaders, was in the mix at the top of the lane inside
and tired late losing positions with seventy yards from the finish. ROBITAILLE was fractious in the stall just before the start, broke slow to trail into the first
turn, could see the field down the backside, was not interested on the far turn and made no impact in the stretch run.

Footnotes
GUILDSMAN (FR) was in the middle of the pack outside two wide, rallied to keep position from advancing foe at the five sixteenths marker to be in the hunt
in the five path at the top of the stretch and wore down runners through the lane to edge away for the win in the last sixteenth in workmanlike fashion.
MASTER SPY travelled in the second flight two wide outside in the early going, crept closer to the leaders three wide on the turn, cruised to take the lead in
the four path in upper stretch, could not hold off the oncoming winner late and held for the runner up placing between at the finish in a solid effort. SEA
SCOUT tracked in the second flight on the rail through the backside, kept pace to the leaders on the turn waiting to pounce running on the fence, was
looking for room in the three path behind the leaders straightening out for the drive, shifted to the rail for clear run in mid stretch and closed in to capture the
show money in the end. TIMESKIP stalked on the rail near the back of the pack, started to pick up runners going around four wide with three eighths
remaining, swung out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane and finished up willingly to garner a small share at the finish line. MAXIMUS
MOMENTUS settled near the rear on the turn, moved between foes at the three furlong marker, shifted out six wide for the stretch run, could not quicken
with others on either side losing its path in mid stretch and could not get involved to the wire. WENJACK pressed outside down the backstretch, tracked the
frontrunner throughout the turn, bid three wide in upper stretch between foes and levelled off with runners around in the last furlong. DOCTOR UPTOWN
was unhurried trailing down the backside, could not catch up to the field running on the turn, angled six wide turning for home and passed stragglers through
the lane. LION'S GOLDENHEART travelled in mid field on the rail in the early stages, could not match strides with others running inside at the three furlong
pole and was not a presence driving to the finish line. MOBILIZER set the pace down the backside on the rail, continued up front throughout the turn, was
swallowed up by outside runners in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH took control clearing to the lead on the rail early on, was unchallenged setting the pace down the backside, opened up on rivals in hand
through the far turn and cruised home under mild urging for a dominant win. H C HOLIDAY sat alone in third watching the top two down the backside, was
coaxed for more run midpoint on the far turn, could not pose a threat to the long gone winner in the stretch but ran on gamely to best the others at the wire.
EMBRACE MY UNCLE stalked near the back on the rail in the early stages, was hard ridden at the three eighths marker, started to gain on fellow horses up
the fence with a quarter to run and closed on the rail through the lane to just miss getting second money at the finish. FULL EXTREME travelled in midfield
three wide in the beginning parts of the race, was scrubbed on with runners on either side gaining on the far turn, shifted out to the five path turning for
home and was one paced to the wire for a small share in the end. ARGENTIUM trailed two wide in the beginning, could see the field down the back straight,
had no room to advance on the fence in the final turn, had clear run at the top of the lane and showed some late interest passing foes in the final sixteenth.
SALVATOR MUNDI tracked the leader two wide on the first turn, was content to watch the frontrunner down the backstretch, had little response when
roused to go after the loose pacesetter at the three furlong pole and faded between rivals in the final furlong. KIDDIE HOLIDAY travelled in the middle of the
pack down the backside, put in a mild run circling five wide midway on the far turn to be in range for a share at the top of the stretch and could not offer a
rally in the six path though to the finish. RELIABILITY was in tight between foes at the break, settled near the back four wide on the first turn, offered a mild
run four deep outside horses at the half mile marker until the midway point on the final turn and tired at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
STEAK AND CHEESE gained forward position to stalk the leader about three deep through the first turn, eased back a bit as an outside foe moved forward
racing in behind, switched out from three to four wide coming to the quarter pole commencing a bid, took the lead near the furlong grounds, edged clear and
held. LION KINGDOM was reserved at the rear, bided time till the far turn racing in the four path into that bend, fanned seven wide, was gaining late but
missed. ROCKET JOE COPPER was in just a bit tight and keen early heading to the first turn, moved out from three to four deep and advanced outside
foes early up the backstretch to apply pressure to the leader, bid and took a narrow and brief lead at the top of the stretch, had no extra. SUNRISE DRIVE
settled three to four deep between runners toward the rear early, moved out from four to six wide on the far turn beginning to advance, switched outside a
rival in upper stretch, showed late interest. SAILOR'S PASSION was in just a bit tight in the early stages racing outside a foe who steadied, moved to the rail
entering the first turn settling off the pace, saved ground inside, came out a path for the stretch run then was guided back to the rail for room, improved
position late. DIXIE GIANT moved quickly to the lead, shifted in bothering a rival, set the tempo into the first turn, was pressured early up the backstretch
racing just off the rail, faded in late stretch. SOLAR was forced in not long after the start, hitting the rail and steadying early, switched off the inside racing
about two to three wide off the pace, came into upper stretch about four deep, ran on between foes but needed more. NATIVE PRINCE raced up close
tracking near the rail, came into upper stretch three deep, needed more. DESOLATOR raced outside four to five wide, lacked the needed late bid.
