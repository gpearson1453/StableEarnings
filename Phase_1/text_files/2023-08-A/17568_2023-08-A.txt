through the stretch and proved best. PACIFIC VIEW vied inside to the second turn, inched clear briefly, responded when challenged to duel through the
stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. VOSTRA broke slowly, dropped inside to save ground, bid inside on the second turn, closed willingly, was
gaining late and earned show. WICKED SKY raced mid pack along the inside, shifted out on the turn, swung wide into the stretch and lacked a late
response. LIL CARRIE D broke out, stalked the pace, rallied four wide on the second turn to loom a threat, fell back and leveled off. JOYZELLA was carried
out on the first turn, raced in the back, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bidd. THEMISCHIEVOUSONE vied two across to the second turn, tired
and stopped. The rider of PACIFIC VIEW claimed foul against the rider of MIRUS for alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made.

SAMARITA vied two across to the turn, drew off and extended her lead while kept to task. JULIAISON was slow early, advanced inside on the turn, offered
a mild bid only and got up for place while no threat to the winner. STOPSHOPPINGAMY vied inside to the turn, fell back, leveled off in the drive and was
caught for second. WAR COLORS was steadied leaving the gate to be off slowly, trailed the field and improved position in an even effort. BLOODY MARY
MORNIN was taken off the rail, settled off the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. EMITYAAZ was not a factor.
