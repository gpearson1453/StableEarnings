ROCK ON KITTEN was in tight a few strides out of the gate, saved ground through the turn, closed rapidly two wide to make the lead between rials in mid
stretch and shook clear under a strong hand ride. CUMBER never far back, rallied through the stretch in the five path and got up for second. MONTAUK
COVE was forced out at the start, chased the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, loomed boldly three wide nearing the furlong marker
then was outfinished. CUGINE passed tiring rivals. UNCAPTURED PULSE broke sharply then drifted out for several strides, had good early speed two wide
then weakened on the turn. UHAVETOBEKITTENME sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch and stopped in the final

stretch, dug in gamely to put a head back in front near the furlong marker, matched strides to the wire, was bumped late and just missed hanging on.
MANDOLIN BREEZE bore out badly bumping rivals at the start, stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then was.

tree wide. APPEALING SENORITA stalked the pace into the far turn, drew closer three wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. BOSSY LADY
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and gave way late. CALI DREAM stalked the pace along the inside for six furlongs then weakened.

lead late and just missed hanging on. ALSANAH trailed into the stretch then closed a gap late outside. CANDYMONIUM stalked the pace two wide into the
stretch, angled out and finished determinedly four wide. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside until mid stretch and
weakened late. WORTHINESS moved up four wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened. SICILIAN STYLE TWO offered a
strong bid three wide before a half, had speed into the stretch then came up empty.
