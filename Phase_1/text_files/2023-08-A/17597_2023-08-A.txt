put to a right-handed crop while off the rail in upper stretch and held under steady urging. WICKED AGAIN broke in then was hustled, chased the pace
down the backstretch, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop, drifted
out some inside the three-sixteenths then was switched to a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, went back to a left-handed crop while still in pursuit of
the winner at the sixteenth-pole and clearly secured the place. OPPORTUNITY SET bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled towards the rear,
was urged along in the two path on the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and was along for the show. INDEX FUND was bumped at the start
then taken up in tight quarters, settled well off the pace under some urging, gained three then four wide on the turn, drifted out some in upper stretch and
flattened out. MACHO VILLA broke out and bumped with an opponent, was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven five
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. METALLURGIC chased the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch
and tired. PARTY WITH SMARTY dropped back while urged along, fell further back while traveling a bit awkwardly leaving the backstretch, went three then

Footnotes
HONEST AL bumped at the start by RUDY RUDY RUDY, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, then got floated out to the seven path as YAQUI VALLEY came out along his inside, dug in under a drive
rallying to take command a furlong from home, dug in under growing late threat to the outside and held safe to prevail. PICCATA PRINCE traded a lean at
the start with STUCK ON YOU, chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide at the
quarter pole, floated out to the seven path straightened away and closed well to just latch on the winner as he hit the finish. YAQUI VALLEY broke in at the
start under hustling and bumped CROWN THAT SAINT, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two
to three wide at the quarter pole, then floated out five wide straightened away carrying out HONEST AL, dug in and was collared by that rival a furlong out,
ran on to preserve the show honors. CPTBOBSBTWENTYNINE struck the off side stall at the start when breaking outwards and conceded four lengths to
the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, tipped out briefly before angling inside of STUCK ON YOU a sixteenth out and kept on to the finish. UNCLE EDDIE grew fractious
in the gate rearing up and forcing the rider to abandon his perch momentarily, lunged at the start conceding two to three lengths before settling into stride,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position. STUCK ON YOU traded
a lean at the start with PICCATA PRINCE, pressed the leader from the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. CROWN THAT SAINT got bumped at the start by YAQUI VALLEY breaking inwards, raced four wide and
steadied at the five-eighths losing about a length of ground, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung
four wide into upper stretch, got floated out to the eight path by rivals straightened away and weakened. RUDY RUDY RUDY broke in brushing the near
side stall before bumping HONEST AL and conceded two lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SKY AND SAND disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three the two path on the turn, shook clear inside the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage
under a brisk hand ride into upper stretch, was put to one pop of a right-handed crop while drawing off into the final furlong and proved much best under a
solid hand-ride from that point to the finish. MAJOR BLUE was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped from the two path
to the rail on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. PATIENT CAPITAL was urged along on
the outside, chased five then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened while able to get the show. LAUGHING BOY was urged
between foes early then on the outside, advanced four then five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and came up empty. PERFECT DAY
came outward leaving the chute, pressed the pace on the inside of two opponents, came up empty along the rail on the turn and retreated. BALTASAR
jostled with a foe outside the three-quarter pole, was urged along off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
capitulated. CARMICHAEL jostled with a foe outside the three-quarter pole, was urged at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor.

HAPPY BOB tossed his head and broke out at the start and was taken in hand conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final sixteenth and was just up in the shadow of the
wire. CREATION OF ADAM a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, chased three to four wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, dug in under threat to the outside and was nailed at the finish.
FAST BOAT TO SKYE coaxed from the gate, got coaxed along the inside in closest aim of the leader, swung three wide into upper stretch taking over
command, dug in under threat coming out to look the challenger in the eye a furlong out, got collared near the sixteenth pole, kept on well clear of the rest to
garner the show honors. FIRE BARON chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, tucked inside through the turn, continued in the
inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid, then flattened out in the late stages. ERIDROMOS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. RUN DIEM Z fractious in the gate prior to the start, showed the way in hand
just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure and yielded the front near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch
and tired. HINENI hustled from the gate, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the
half mile pole, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE PRINCESS (FR) was reserved on the inside under restraint while into the bit, shifted to the three path while roused late on the far turn, came out
towards the outside fence while rallying about eleven to twelve wide into upper stretch, took over on the grandstand side coming to the furlong marker,
kicked clear outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady handling. AMERICAN SONJA (GB) went four wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside without cover, engaged the leader in the three path on the final turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, brushed with
PAPILIO while drifting eight to nine wide into upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the eighth-pole, rubbed saddles with PAPILIO while drifting out some
in the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner. PAPILIO (IRE) moved from the two path to the four path while eager on the first turn,
was reserved off the pace, went three wide while asked on the far turn, gained coming to the quarter-pole then made a bid, brushed with the runner-up while
carried nine to ten wide into upper stretch, rubbed saddles with that opponent in the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then missed the
place but was well clear for the show. CAROLINE STREET was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, shifted to the
two path outside the quarter-pole, was driven four wide into upper stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and weakened. STRIKINGLY SPUN moved in early,
went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on the final turn and lacked the needed
response. XIGERA rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace under a tight hold, dropped back two then three wide on the far turn and
capitulated. ALLAMERICANBEAUTY made light contact with a foe on the initial straightaway, was taken in hand between horses nearing the first turn,
traveled three wide around that bend, settled in the middle of the field, came up empty in the two path on the final turn and dropped out. SELENAIA (IRE)
moved in while going to the front, went around the opening bend in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far
turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and faded. SOLO ALBUM dropped well behind early, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear while off
the rail on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn and showed little. HONOR D LADY bumped lightly with a foe while under tight restraint early,
went four then five wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came up empty in the four path on the far turn and faltered.
