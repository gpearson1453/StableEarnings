Footnotes
AROUND THE DIAL tracked trio along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, launched bid along the inside and edged away in the final
sixteenth. EPIC DRAMA vied in between rivals on the backstretch, bumped a couple times by inside rival heading into the turn, headed into lane in the lead,
quickly headed by rival in upper stretch, bothered mildly by rival but it did not affect the outcome while being a clear second. NEAH BAY vied for lead three
wide on the backstretch, bumped by rivals entering the turn, continued two wide on the turn, proved no match for leader and rallying rival, kept on to save
show. ELUSIVE VIRTUE stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, had to alter out a couple paths to avoid troubled rival,
altered back in entering the lane and launched mild rally to the wire. WATER'S FOR FIGHTN tracked trio of pace setters on the backstretch, very minorly
affected by rival who took up on the turn, continued three wide on the turn and offered little in the lane. WE MISS GENO away well, sent to vie for lead with
a pair of rivals, rider chose to stay in the three path and force the issue with EPIC DRAMA, bumped a few times and had to take up sharply early on the turn,
coasted in after that rough event. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH
