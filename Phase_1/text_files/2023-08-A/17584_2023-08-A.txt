and weakened late in the stretch but held place at the wire. COLONEL BARTON chased the early duo, raced in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the
stretch but did not have enough for place in the final stages. PRINCE OF PENNIES broke out at the start, set the pace early on near the rail, was in the two
path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. LIAMS LAD raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane with a minor gain late in the stretch

Footnotes
CANDY OAK lunged outwardly and exchanged contact with an outer rival at the start, allowed a pair of outer foes to dictate terms before shifting to the four
path and outside of them entering the backstretch, inched closer to offer a three wide bid at the half mile pole, gained an advantage from an inner ISLE OF
HOPE approaching the three furlong pole, led in the three path turning for home but failed to kick away from the aforementioned rival in upper stretch as an
outer foe joined the fray, sparred with his inner counterpart through the closing stages and narrowly prevailed via a head-bob. ISLE OF HOPE prompted
outside of the leader and from the three path while tugging strongly in the bit entering the backstretch, vied before gaining an advantage at the half mile pole
as an outer rival bid, got headed by that one while tucking to the two path at the three furlong pole, fought on while chasing under all-out urging turning for
home, rebid in upper stretch, battled neck and neck through the final furlong but missed the bob on the wire. VINO VELOCE broke inwardly and bumped
with an inner foe at the start, trailed down the backstretch, gained in the five path entering the far turn, pressed outside of the top pair while coming under
coaxing at the three furlong pole, crept closer to offer a bid in upper stretch, but hung in the final furlong, gave way late and held show. INDY LABEL laid off
of the pace along the inside, took closer order to stalk approaching the far turn, surpassed an inner tiring rival while among foes approaching the three
furlong pole, pursued before checking subtly and altering course three wide at the quarter pole, swung five wide entering the lane and ran on one paced
through the lane. CLEARLY COPPER laid off of the pace in the three path, chased between horses around the far turn, then lacked a bid through the lane.
INCREDIBLY CHICKI set the pace along the inside, but weakened while inside of a pair of rivals nearing the far turn and was eased through the lane.

PROMISE ME A RIDE was last away but recovered quickly to prompt outside of the pace setter and from the three path, vied into the far turn, assumed
command at the five sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. BILLY JACK set the pace inside of pressing rival, sparred with that one into the far turn, but
quickly proved no match with five sixteenths to go and held place thereafter. BERRETTINI stalked along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with the
top pair before being roused to the four path around the far turn, lacked a bid through the lane yet lasted for show. SINGLE RULER laid off of the pace in the
two path, made little impact and failed to reach a tiring outer rival for show late. DUAL MONARCHY tracked in the four path and gave way in the three path
into the far turn.

Footnotes
RAINING SUGAR tracked along the inside, grazed an outer foe while tipping outside of the embattled leading pair entering the turn, took aim on the now
clear leader ASTERNIA in midstretch, drove past that lugging foe at the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. ASTERNIA dueled for the lead outside of a rival
while in the three path, forged an advantage turning for home, drove clear nearing the furlong grounds as an outer RAINING SUGAR pursued, but lugged
inwardly when the rider changed to a right handed crop at the sixteenth pole, was bested as the rider was required to take hold to avoid scraping the rail in
the process and held place. DESPO'S DREAM pressed the top pair from the four path and between horses into the turn, chased under urging around the
bend, shifted away from an inner rival and brushed an outer foe entering the lane, ran on to vie for show with that foe through the final furlong and held.
GALLOP D'HERMES broke a beat slow at the start, stalked in the five path, inched closer approaching the lane before taking mild contact from an inner foe
at the three sixteenths pole, dueled for show with that one through the final furlong but was denied. HIGH FASHION KATE laid off of the pace in the two
path under moderate coaxing, improved while tipping to the four path entering the lane and ran on mildly for a minor share. FIELD LASS dueled for the lead
inside of a rival while a path off of the inner rail, got headed by that one passing the five sixteenths pole and weakened leaving upper stretch. TIPSY
RUNNER chased two wide and between horses but gave way nearing the lane. GOLDEN STORM leaned on the inner part of the gate at the start and made
little impact in the three path. MISS PEARL HART broke outwardly and drifted multiple paths into open space, lacked speed while taking the turn in the six
path and faded. SUCRE CECILE tracked three wide and weakened. HOT MOCHA raced far back in the five to six path and never got involved. MAUI
MISTRESS got rank while towards the rear among foes and dropped back approaching the turn, trailed around the bend and got outrun.

Footnotes
POBLANO came out at the start, set the pace while remaining off of the rail, showed the way uncontested while in hand in the two path, kicked away when
let out nearing the lane and drew off under moderate urging. METHODOLOGY was floated out by inner rivals and squarely bumped an outer foe soon after
the start, stalked the leader from the three path, chased under urging around the far turn, yet sustained stride to secure place while proving no match for the
winner. EYES OF GOLD got herded outwardly by an inner rival upon leaving the gates, chased along the inside, vied for place behind the eventual winner
around the far turn, but yielded that position to his outer counterpart in the final furlong and held show. QUEEN OF MISSOULA broke slowly, pursued from
midpack in the three path and among foes, forged fourth entering the far turn, was urged along in the four path while kicking away from the rest of the field
around that bend and only managed to slowly close in on show late. LACIE BE GOOD raced towards the rear two wide and between horses, improved
position with three furlongs to go, but failed to threaten and saved a minor reward. SALSALITA VERDE took square contact from an inner rival soon after
the start, lacked speed along the inside entering the backstretch, awaited racing room behind foes in the early stages of the far turn, picked up stride and
split rivals while shifting to the five path turning home, but flattened out without reaching contention. FLIRTING GIRL made little impact four to three wide.
EMPIRICAL VIEW lacked speed in the six path and never got involved. POOL NOODLE pursued from the four path but faded in the five path around the far
turn. CANCERFREE KIDS broke slowly, chased from midpack in the two path and weakened with three furlongs to go.

COMMUNICATION MEMO bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, came under urging to sustain position into the far turn, chased
turning for home, closed in slowly inside of the outwardly-drifting leaders entering midstretch, offered a bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled through the late
stages and forged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. ENDPOINT set the pace in the two path, came under all out coaxing to maintain a short
advantage from an outer bidding WINNEMAC AVENUE with three furlongs to go, drifted outwardly and shouldered that one while clinging to a margin
through upper stretch, repelled that foe while shifting down to meet an inner challenge at the sixteenth pole, sparred with that one through the closing stages
but was bested. WINNEMAC AVENUE pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, bid at the three furlong pole, but was brushed and herded
outwardly by the aforementioned rival entering the lane and through upper stretch, then got turned away at the sixteenth pole. WHAT A BLAST leaned
outwardly and bumped with a rival at the start, tracked along the inside before shifting out to the four path entering the backstretch, ranged up outside of the
leading pair turning for home, but was floated to the six path entering the lane deterring her bid and only managed to chase thereafter. BASELINE BEATER
took an awkward stride and bobbled approaching the backstretch, laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. PIKE PLACE pursued from off of
the pace in the five path and tired.

GULFSTREAM WAY came out at the start and bumped an outer rival in the early stages, tracked two wide and between horses, chased behind the leader
entering the lane, committed to a charge inside of that foe in the final furlong, edged a bid in the final sixteenth and forged an advantage in the shadow of
the wire. VULCAN vied two wide, showed the way inside of a prompting foe while in the two path into the turn, led from a pair of outer rivals nearing the
lane, shook free of them in upper stretch, dug in to resist an inner rival's challenge while flopping to and from his left lead in the final furlong and got bested
at the wire. BROKEN RIB saved ground off of the pace entering the turn, picked up stride off of the fence turning for home, brushed an outer rival while
shifting to the five path and between horses entering the lane, then rallied to gain show in the final sixteenth. CHATTALOT bobbled outwardly at the start,
stalked in the four path, bid outside of the top pair at the quarter pole, but was turned away in upper stretch and yielded between horses in the final furlong.
LUGAN KNIGHT took contact from an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, got brushed to the six path by an inner rival
entering the lane and gave way. UNPREDICTABLE BAY lacked speed in the four to five path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and failed to factor.
WILLTORUN bumped with an outer rival at the start, trailed in the four path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. OLAZABAL
transferred contact from an inner foe to an outer rival soon after the start, prompted the pace along the inside, chased around the turn and weakened at the
five sixteenths pole. INSOLITO bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied three wide, then two wide while in the three path around the far turn, but
weakened between horses entering the lane.
