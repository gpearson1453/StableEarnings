TWO GUNS prompted the pace from two wide through the turn, took command in upper stretch and drew of as much the best. TEXTPECTATION unhurried
in the early going, rallied through the turn to close the gap, angled wide at the head of the lane and closed well for the place. JUPITER BLUES sped to the
lead shortly away from the gate, set the pace under pressure to upper stretch and weakened down the lane. NO ME DIGAS tracked the leaders to the
quarter pole and failed to respond when called upon for the stretch drive. COLONEL MIKE showed brief speed to the turn and came up empty.

best. GAMBLING TZAR stalked the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane and weakened, bested rest. RECONVENE was off a step slow,
reserved early, came seven wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals while being no threat. BOFFO KID chased the pace three wide and tired. HONOR

NO SHOW prompted the early pace from between horses, ranged up at the head of the lane to take the lead, drifted out down the stretch eventually causing
MON CHOU CHOU to clip heels causing that one to fall nearing the wire. ELOPER chased the pacesetters from the rail through the turn and lacked a
closing kick. IDA BOSS trailed to the quarter pole and made a mild bid in the stretch. FIFTH CIRCUIT sped to the a clear lead for the first half mile and gave
way at the head of the lane. JANKA raced at the rear of the field early, moved up into the turn and flattened out in the stretch. TRANQUILA RUBY tracked
the leaders from three wide for a half and came up empty. MON CHOU CHOU (FR) stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, angled out for the
drive to duel with the leader down the lane who drifted out into his path in deep stretch causing him to clip heels and fall nearing the wire, and walked off.
THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER FOR INTERFERING WITH
MON CHOU CHOU IN THE LANE.

SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD was rated early three to four wide, made a four wide move on the turn and took over off the turn, then drew off smartly to prove
much the best, ridden out. VAX A NATION was settled early on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled off the inside by the furlong marker but proved
to be no match for the winner, second best. CENTURION was reserved early, five wide advance on the turn, came six wide into the lane and was along for
the show award. MASTER OF NONE was settled early, between foes and four wide on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. LOOKINASSAH was void of
early speed, came wide into the lane and improved position late. HASN'T HAD ENOUGH set a pressured pace two wide, then shook clear on the turn and
gave way in the lane. STOP THE SPREAD was hard held early between rivals and weakened. MOON SIGN chased the pace in between rivals and
weakened. DEFINE pressed the pace on the inside and tired. TAPADINE stalked the early pace four wide and stopped.

ATTACHE reserved in hand to be off the early pace, circled five wide at the head of the lane and found his best stride late to be up in time. CHILDERS
broke alertly to open a clear lead into the turn, widened his advantage in upper stretch and finished willingly in a good effort to just miss. CATALINA
EXPRESS well placed along the rail to the top of the lane and failed to mount a closing bid. PARK PLACE prompted the pace to upper stretch and faded in
the lane. STUDY COMMITTEE prominently placed at the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. LORD OF MISCHIEF was never a threat. DITHER
was never a factor.

CONTINENTALCONGRES prompted the pace three wide while in hand, then made a three wide bid off the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then drew
off impressively to prove much the best under a hand ride. SIX THE HARD WAY was settled early, advanced on the turn three wide, came four wide off the
turn but proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. DON'T TELL DEREN was rated along three wide and made a mild bid nearing the
upper stretch but lacked a late response while besting the rest. BODE'S HERITAGE tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. SAL'S BLUE JACKET
set a pressured pace two wide and then gave way the final quarter of a mile. MELITZA stumbled at the start, reserved early, saved ground on the turn, not a
factor. WOODS HOLE chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
STEPPER stalked the pace through the turn, swung out wide at the head of the lane, took control mid-stretch and pulled clear late. PLEASE MARRY ME
broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set a well measured pace to the top of the lane, drifted wide in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable
to hold. REACHING STRIDE was caught wide the entire trip racing in the four path and wider to the stretch and closed well to gain the show. SUWANNEE
CHICK saved ground along the rail while in hand off the pacesetter, cut the corner coming for home and could not make up ground late. LA BRODY tracked
the leaders from the rail to upper stretch and flattened out. HOT CHOICE raced four wide while pursuing the pace from between horses through the turn and
failed to mount a closing rally. INSIDE THE BOX raced mid-pack through the turn, rallied to the head of the stretch and faded in the drive. WICKED INTENT
broke a step slow giving the field open lengths and showed late interest. REYNA DE VERANO was never a threat. DAISY BEE pressed the pace for the first
half and stopped. BIONDA SUPRISE was never a factor.
