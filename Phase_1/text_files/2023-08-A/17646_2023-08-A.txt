OZARA (IRE) tucked inside soon after the start and settled in pursuit along the inside from mid pack through the first turn, pulled a bit keen near the
nine-sixteenths, moving to be just off the pace into the far turn, remained along the inside through that bend and spun just off the inside into upper stretch
briefly awaiting clearance as SMOOTH WAVES drifted in slightly, got clearance with three-sixteenths to go and was roused on through splitting foes to take
command nearing the eighth pole, inched away before coming under growing late threat to the outside, came out slightly to look her main danger in the eye,
the rider flashing the crop to the off side and repelled the challenge to the wire. WEIGH THE RISKS brushed the near side stall at the start getting away
slow and conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced two to three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide down the
backstretch before tucking inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied with
good energy through to just inside the sixteenth marker, then had the crop of the rider of OZARA getting flashed out in front of her and finished with more
trepidation getting rebuffed at the end. IT'S HOT IN HERE (IRE) coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three then two
wide down the backstretch, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and raced just off the inside through the far turn, went five wide into upper
stretch, ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors. LATER DARLING dwelt at the start getting away last and conceding seven to eight lengths
to the front before settling into stride, raced along the inside through the first turn before taking to the three path into the backstretch, tucked to the two path
midway before heading back inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied and was forced
to pause and alter out slightly near the sixteenth marker and foes in front drifted, kept on with good courage to secure the last major share. SMOOTH
WAVES three then two wide through the first turn, prompted the leader from the two path coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun two to three
wide into upper stretch, took over narrow and brief command at the three-sixteenths, got headed near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages.
GOLDEN GHOST (GB) four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late going. BACKSTRETCH ROSE reluctant to load prior to the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn, chased four
then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. KINGDOM COME broke slow
conceding five lengths to the front, chased along the inside, pulled keenly midway down the backstretch and continued along the inside through the far turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CARINA NEBULA coaxed
from the gate, chased just off the inside through the first turn, then chased three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home, weakened in the stretch. SANDS OF WAR coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along
the inside under some pressure from SMOOTH WAVES to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch
and yielded near the three-sixteenths, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
WAYS AND MEANS broke in and bumped hard with a rival, was rated just off the pace while into the bit, drafted in the two path early on the turn then
shifted to the four path, rallied coming to the quarter-pole, closed fast in the five path to take the lead into upper stretch then was shaken up briefly, kicked
clear impressively shortly thereafter with the rider becoming motionless in the saddle and powered away in the final furlong with the rider poised like a statue
in the irons to win handily. CALLE AMADA was carried in at the start, moved up under urging to race just off the pace then was taken in hand, saved ground
just behind the leader on the turn, tried to come through along the rail into upper stretch but didn't have enough room, steadied in tight against the rail then
altered out significantly near the furlong marker and safely secured the place. VALUE AREA was carried in at the start, moved up to get the lead outside the
five-eighths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, vied inside of two foes on that bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch and weakened while
able to hold the show. BENTO settled just the pace on the outside, made a bid while four then three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and
tired. MANAGING MISCHIEF broke fast then angled in while sent hard, lost the lead outside the five-eighths pole then chased the pace, engaged the leader
in the three then two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. NORISKIT NOBISCUIT was ridden along on the outside, moved in leaving
the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, moved out in the drive and failed to threaten. SHORE WAR broke in and
hit the gate, dropped back between foes then climbed outside the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SIX PACK SENORITA was
reluctant to load, came away at the rear while bumped hard and forced in, drifted out inside the five-eighths pole, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and also was no factor.

before chasing just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, angled four wide into upper stretch, seized command just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in
under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors. DUFRESNE chased three to four wide until tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ROJA LIGERA chased
three wide until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper
stretch, weakened. CROWDING OUT coaxed from the gate, briefly tussled with CHROMEPLATED HEART before taking over the front with nine-sixteenths
to go, showed the way in hand along the inside, got let out under challenge spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front just inside the
three-sixteenths and tired.

WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE stalked the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was asked on the final turn, took the lead in upper stretch and drew clear
under good handling. FEDERALIST PAPERS dropped well behind early, settled at the rear while inside to the two path, was asked on the final turn, paused
to avoid a fallen foe outside the quarter-pole, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead at
the sixteenth-pole and got up for the place. MYRISKYAFFAIR settled while inside to the two path, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked on the
third turn, steadied while near the fallen foe outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and lacked the
needed kick. ENSEMBLE (IRE) was hustled to the front, showed the way in hand while inside to the two path, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner in upper stretch and gave way. EVER SUMMER settled on the outside while traveling three to four wide, was asked on the final
turn, suffered an injury outside the quarter-pole and fell then was euthanized on the course. FRIVOLE (FR) was taken in hand nearing the first turn then
reserved on the inside, pulled up on the second turn and was vanned off.

three wide into upper stretch under challenge to the outside, dug in dueling through the stretch to the finish in game fashion to prevail at the end. DURKIN'S
CALL four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the top pair and was set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the stretch to

EMPIRE ISLAND was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the leader into the
final furlong, gained to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling to prevail. LADY MOSCATO tracked the pace on the outside,
made a bid in the three path on the turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, inched clear under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, remained on her
inside lead while clinging to the front into the final sixteenth and was caught while clear for the place. BEFORE YOU GO GO was urged along on the
outside, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole and
weakened while able to get the show. RUBY QUEEN was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, pursued the leaders into the final
furlong, drifted in late and lacked the needed kick. HELCIA was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. GYPSY
TALES broke in at the start, went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged while in the two path on the turn, came under
urging outside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead approaching the quarter-pole and faltered. AMERICA'S VOW was ridden along off the pace, went four wide
on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. PHILANTHROPY broke a step slow then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths,

needed response. PRINCESS INDY bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind early, went around most of the turn in the two path, angled four

at the quarter-pole then carried out , remained on her inside lead past the furlong marker and failed to respond. BECKY'S JOKER leaned out at the break
and was last away, settled on the outside, was urged four then three wide on the turn, came under stronger encouragement outside the five-sixteenths,
spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out and also failed to respond. COPPER EM was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside,

Footnotes
FORWARD MOVE bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival while inside to the two path, was asked on the
far turn, came under a right-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, continued on his inside lead under the crop until just before the
sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while best. UNAFFECTED was bumped hard early, went three then two wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn, angled three then four wide later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and got up for the
place. SILENT RUNNING stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, was forced out early, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled well off the
pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and improved for the show. PRIX DE WEST shied out early, dropped from the five path to the three
path on the first turn, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
MUNNY FOR NUTHIN checked sharply at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, moved from three to five wide under urging on
the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position but just missed the superfecta. FAST STUDY was bumped on both sides at the start, went
six then five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, traveled three wide under urging on the far turn and lacked the needed response. ZAPRUDER
bumped with a rival at the start, was carried out early, dropped from the six path to the three path on the opening bend, moved closer midway down the
backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. STOW ON THE WOLD bumped with a rival at the start,
saved ground under urging on the first turn, settled in fourth position, moved out inside the five-eighths pole, chased four wide on the far turn and weakened.
IN MY SHADOW broke out and bumped with a rival, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no
factor. GIO'S MAJESTICNESS was hustled from the gate, came out and bumped hard with a foe early, went three wide on the first turn, dropped back on
the backstretch and retreated then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
