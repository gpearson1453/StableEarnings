SHAKE IT BABY stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, bid while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, then led at
the furlong grounds before changing over and kicking clear. LITTLE MUSIC leaned out and bobbled very slightly at the start, pressed the leader from the
three path, bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering midstretch and edged place. SUMMER DANCE
leaned in a touch at the start, set the pace inside of a prompting foe while a path off of the rail around the turn, resisted that foe's challenge turning for home,
but got headed by another outer bidder in midstretch and yielded late. MISSY BEE lacked speed in the two path and got outrun. TONIC AND GIN tracked in
the four path and weakened nearing the lane. ROSE DARLING broke slowly, lagged behind around the turn and cut the gap on weakening rivals late.

DRE ME LESS prompted along the inside, stalked down the backstretch pursue two wide and between foes around the far turn, bid along with an outer rival
at the quarter pole and drove clear at the furlong grounds. HASHTAG WINNER trailed, gained in the four path and outside of foes around the far turn,
fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, then stayed on wider through the final furlong to reach place at the wire. MUSIC AMORE stalked four to three
wide around the opening bend, vied two wide at the five furlong pole, led into the far turn, cleared to the rail around that bend before meeting a pair of outer
challenges turning for home, got headed at the quarter pole, chased the clearing leader through the final furlong, but was nailed at the wire for place.
PRIDDIS tracked two wide, shifted out down the backstretch, inched closer three wide around the far turn to bid at the quarter pole, but drifted out and failed
to keep pace with an inner foe entering the final furlong and weakened thereafter. LA TOURISTA laid off of the pace along the inside, was urged in pursuit in
the three path around the far turn, spun into the lane in the six path and lacked a bid. PRINCESSTAPITURE showed speed three to two wide, then inside at
the five furlong pole, then got headed into the far turn and subsequently weakened.

SMILE MON set the pace a path off of the inside, drew clear of an outer presser while well in hand approaching the three furlong pole, then widened under a
drive in midstretch before being put to wraps in the final sixteenth. CHIRON tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, chased them under strong
urging around the far turn, then surpassed a tiring rival to gain place in the late stages. ELEGANT TRIP prompted inside of SMILE MON early on, backed off
and shifted out to the three path entering the backstretch to re-engage outside of the leader with five furlongs to go, but failed to keep pace approaching the
three furlong pole, weakened through the lane and lost place late. MY SANCTUARY was outrun.

Footnotes
NORMANDY HERO broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, met an outer challenge turning for home, shook free of that
one nearing the furlong grounds and held sway. COACH JIMI D pressed outside of the leader while pursuing from the four path, prompted in the three path
around the turn, bid approaching the quarter pole, but was turned away nearing midstretch and kept on to keep the leader honest. ASTRONOMICO tracked
the leaders from the five to four path into the turn, gained show at the three furlong pole, then chased the top pair home while pulling away from the rest.
PATCH O'BRIEN broke a beat slow and transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, improved to track two wide and between horses
into the turn, but chased turning for home before fading. LIQUOR TALK took contact from an outer foe just after the start, trailed the field, lagged behind in
the two path before shifting to the five path entering the lane and surpassed tiring rivals. MOR JAZZ failed to factor from the three to four path. HOT N
LUCKY rushed after a flat footed beginning, but was restrained back to an inside stalking position leaving the chute, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
ODE TO BALIUS tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, paused behind the leaders in upper stretch, smoothly tipped three
wide and outside of them at the furlong grounds, then sustained a grinding rally to offer a late bid and gained an advantage in the shadow of the wire.
THOMAS AQUINAS prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied around the turn, led in upper stretch while battling with his inner game
counterpart, fended off that foe through the final furlong but was caught by an outer bidder in the closing stages. BERNIN HOT set the pace inside of a pair
of pressers, vied with those bidders around the far turn, dueled while narrowly headed in upper stretch, fought on gamely in the final furlong, but was
outkicked in the final sixteenth and yielded late. HEY JOE JOE tracked in the four path, chased under urging around the far turn, delayed changing leads
until the furlong grounds, but lacked the needed punch thereafter. DIRBAS was slow into stride leaving the gates, laid off of the pace in the five path, lacked
a response to urging around the far turn, yet ran on mildly for a minor share. CRUSADING was rowdy in the post parade, then leaned in at the start before
exchanging early contact with an inner rival in the opening stages, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then lacked a bid while one paced.
WARNING SIGNS pressed three wide, vied around the far turn, but yielded in upper stretch and weakened between horses. FORT THOMAS exchanged
contact with an outer rival in the opening stages, then was outrun along the inside.

LA V. pressed the leader from the three path, vied around the turn, assumed command passing the quarter pole and held sway from a pursuing foe through
the late stages. STANLEY MARKET leaned in at the start, tracked along the inside, gained place from an outer rival in upper stretch, shifted out in pursuit of
the clear leader in the final furlong, then slowly closed in while only second best. SHE DAZZLE trailed in the five path, then stayed on to surpass tiring rivals.
CAMI CAT set the pace inside of the eventual winner while in the two path around the turn, proved no match for that one at the quarter pole and weakened.
TAP N SWAY chased in the three path and faded. SHOW ME GRACE broke a bit outwardly, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around
the turn, but weakened nearing the lane.

gained place entering the lane and was second best. HONEY RUN broke a step slow before shying from an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path,
improved between horses while tipping to the five path turning for home, then caught a weakening rival for show at the wire. CHARLEY RUDE dueled for
the lead inside of the eventual winner, proved no match for that one nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened. MASSARD chased along the inside and

Footnotes
SEARCH ENGINE set the pace inside of a pressing rival while tucking to the inside around the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, shook free of
his outer pursuer entering the lane and held sway thereafter. KING'S OVATION checked around the first turn to settle into an inside tracking position, then
sustained a grinding charge along the rail to gain place from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. ROMAN CENTURIAN trailed in the three path, crept closer
four wide around the far turn, bid for show entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, yet ran on in the closing stages to
gain that position at the wire. GROUP EIGHTEEN prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane and yielded
between horses. ICARUS laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued from the three path while between horses around the far turn and lacked a bid. HE'S
GOT THIS tracked three wide then faded between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BE HERE NOW stalked two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, drew off entering the lane and was ridden out under mild urging. WINDY BAY set the pace
along the inside, vied with an outer bidder turning for home, proved no match entering the lane and held place. C C CRUISE CONTROL tracked thee wide,
chased around the far turn, cut the corner nearing the lane but lacked a bid. UNSTABLE PRINCESS trailed, entered the lane in the four path and failed to
factor. MISCHIEVOUS GAL was fractious in the gate, stalked along the inside while pulling under firm restraint, then weakened around the far turn.
