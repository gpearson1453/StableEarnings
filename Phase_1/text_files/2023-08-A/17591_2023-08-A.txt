Footnotes
LEO MONTE broke a step slow, then pulled on the inside, steadied nearing the first turn, settled into a tracking position while saving ground, angled out past
the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside of ONE TIME WILLARD and wore down that rival in deep stretch to prevail. ONE
TIME WILLARD stalked close up two wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled, took over, edged away in upper stretch, dug in gamely to the finish
and yielded grudgingly late. JESTERS HONOR stalked the leaders, saved ground going into the far turn, went two wide at the quarter pole, four wide into
the stretch and rallied mildly. WOLFE 'N HAWKE raced off the pace inside, between rivals at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. QUIBERON BAY raced off
the pace with an inside trip and had no rally. HIT ME I'M LUCKY raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide at the quarter pole and gave way. BUSTIN
LOOSE set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and faded in the stretch.

kept to the task in the final furlong. BUCCHERINO was sent early on the rail, set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in
the stretch run and continued willingly to the finish. IDLE UNION was off slowly, outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole, rallied in the two path and got up
for third at the wire. BO VALENTINE chased the pace, raced inside into the stretch, rallied mildly inside and lost third at the wire. EL ALACRAN chased the
pace, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ROCK N ROLL BOLT chased close up early on the inside, chased on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
MAJOR CAM tracked close up on the inside, angled out on the far turn, made a strong three wide run midway on the turn, took charge turning for home,
drew clear under urging and held on late. LET IT FLOW JOE stalked two wide, then chased two wide, came three wide into the lane, angled in, rallied on
the rail and dug in gamely on the rail to the finish. GOING IN STYLE raced four wide early, stalked three wide, vied three wide on the backside, dueled on
the far turn, briefly dueled with the winner, then weakened and stayed on for the show spot. THE BEARRISH ONE raced off the pace inside, chased on the
far turn and lacked a rally. DAD'S ON A ROLL trailed the field and passed tired rivals. SMART AND FAST pulled early, vied two wide, dueled on the far turn
and gave way. ANTONOV was off slowly and steadied, raced off the rail, off the pace, went four wide at the quarter pole and failed to respond. MIDNIGHT
STRIKES raced three wide early, two wide off the pace and did not factor. FIRE KING vied inside for the lead, chased on the far turn, gave way and stopped
in the lane.
