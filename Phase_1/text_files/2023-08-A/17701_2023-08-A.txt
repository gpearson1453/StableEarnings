the lead, stayed to stretch, battled hard no match. SMOKEY LEE close up off rail to far turn, stuck a head in front, weaken late. ROGUE ELEMENT raced
along evenly while never a menace from quarter pole while vanned off following the race.. LEVEE PROUD tried to keep up early from inside first turn, gave
way readily. WEEKENDER never factored throughout. Race 6 was hand timed due to a computer error.
