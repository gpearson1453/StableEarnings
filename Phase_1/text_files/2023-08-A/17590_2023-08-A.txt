THE CAIRO KID set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the turn, shook clear, in early stretch and was best. SEANOW tracked the early pace,
raced four wide though the turn, made a run on the winner, could match strides in mid stretch, re-rallied late and finished second best.
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO was allowed to settle early, shifted out five wide through the turn, passed tired rivals, was no match to the top two finishers and
was along for third. OUR HOISTED MAST was void of any early speed raced six wide through the turn and offered no late rally. MUNGO MAGIC was
unhurried early, angled out to race between rivals and never fired. LANTAU pressed the early pace from the inside, dropped back through the turn and was
finished early.

GREAT IDEA raced in mid pack early, advanced four wide through the turn, was gaining steadily through the stretch, took control final strides and edged
clear. KENNER chased the early pace from the inside, angled out while looming three wide through the turn, made a bid on DARK AND FITZY, dueled to
late stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. DARK AND FITZY set a clear early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, met the bid of
KENNER, dueled to late stretch and finished a game third. EVENLY DIVIDED was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the turn, lugged in
through the stretch, shifted out late and offered a mild late rally. RAGTIME RICHES was unhurried from between rivals and finished belatedly. WAR AND
ROSES was unhurried early, went four wide and never fired. ALOTTACENTS was taken back early, raced along the inside and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
IRON RANGER was allowed to settle early, saved ground into the home turn, angled out through the turn, was gaining steadily, took control late while
drifting out and was best. MARYLAND MOON tracked the early pace, raced six wide through the second turn, was no match late and finished second best.
HAY CHIEF was squeezed at the start, was void of any early speed, raced along the inside into the home turn, tipped out late and finished belatedly. TIO
TONY was bumped at the start, loomed seven wide through the second turn and was closing late. LUNAR DASH was reserved from the inside into the
second turn, angled out and offered some late gain. SNEAKING SUSPICION was keen early, pressed the early pace from the inside and faded.
SCORESTOSETTLE set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the second turn and gave way.
