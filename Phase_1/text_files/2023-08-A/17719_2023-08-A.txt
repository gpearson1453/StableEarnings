Footnotes
DANZ TILL TEN was prominent in the early running and was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, was
given his cue entering the far turn and collared the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker while two wide, took command into the drive, was kept to task to
mid-stretch, drove clear into deep stretch and was geared down in the final stages. FANTASTIC DREAM was unhurried in the early going, maintained a
three wide path into the backstretch run then slipped to the rail heading into the second turn, was guided off of the rail nearing the top of the lane and came
four wide into the stretch, could not impact the winner in the final stages but closed well late and held safely in the end for the place. BALLROOM PRINCE
broke a step slowly and settled outside of rivals in the early running, raced widest into the backstretch run then was steered two wide into the far turn, was
coaxed along three wide into the lane, could not muster the needed late response and was outfinished for the show. UPDRAFT settled off of the moderate
pace while saving ground, saved all of the ground to the far turn and did not offer a late rally. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was hustled leaving the break and
assumed command in the early stages, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure along the far turn and was overtaken by
DANZ TILL TEN, chased the winner to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

LUCY TREASURE was sent to be prominent in the early running, contested the early pace with HER PERFECT VISION then ceded the lead to that rival
into the turn, raced close to the solid pace along the bend then took command nearing the top of the stretch, drew to a clear lead approaching the furlong
marker, was kept to task into deep stretch and maintained a clear advantage to the wire. AUSTRIAN NAVY chased the early pace from the rail, saved
ground along the bend then was angled three wide for the drive, rallied inside of the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in the final stages and
stayed on to best the rest. DON'T TELL HYDEE chased the solid early pace while between rivals, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker, ran
evenly to the furlong grounds, failed to produce the needed late kick and was clear in the end for the show. PERFECTLY JULIE chased outside of rivals in
the early stages, raced three wide into the turn, drifted out to the four path nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not offer a
late response. HER PERFECT VISION showed good early speed, contested the pace outside of LUCY TREASURE then took command nearing the turn,
drifted out along the bend and came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, lost the lead to LUCY TREASURE approaching the top of the lane, chased
from the four path to mid-stretch and faded in the late stages.

two wide nearing the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead while under moderate urging to the furlong pole, pulled away nearing the sixteenth-marker and was

in the final stages and bested the rest. REALLY SATISFYING chased the solid early pace while inside of an outer rival, was coaxed along three wide into
the stretch, lacked a final response and held clearly in the end for the show. DIVINE PASSAGE bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the

QUEEN MOLOTOV broke out a step at the start, showed speed and took command in the early going, set a quick pace into the turn then opened to a clear
lead along the bend, was given a few reminder taps at mid-stretch, drew away in the final sixteenth and was geared down late as much the best. AIR
FORCE WOMAN broke alertly, contested the early pace with QUEEN MOLOTOV but could not go on with that rival in the early going and chased to the
turn, ran in pursuit of QUEEN MOLOTOV to the quarter marker, was not able to make headway on the winner in the drive and held safely for second at the
finish. MISS LIZZY chased the fast early pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster the needed late response and was outfinished for
the place, while holding clearly for the show. CITY GLITTER lacked early speed, was coaxed along three wide into the turn, swung four wide for the stretch
drive and did not factor. TIP TOP GAL chased the solid early pace while outside of a rival, lost position into the turn and gave chase while two wide nearing
the quarter marker, weakened in upper stretch and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
LILA AT THE BEACH broke well and engaged in a speed duel outside of MO TOWN GAL, was well handled to the far turn, got the better of that rival
passing the quarter pole then was challenged to the outside and briefly passed by THREAD COUNT at the top of the stretch, gamely came back on in the
final furlong and prevailed in a gutsy effort. THREAD COUNT bumped by TIME TO SMILE after the break, settled to the rear of the compact field for the
backstretch run, made steady forward progress through the turn, bid for and took a brief lead at the top of the stretch then was outfinished by a resurgent
LILA AT THE BEACH in the final furlong. MO TOWN GAL was aggressively handled from the break, dueled with LILA AT THE BEACH through the turn,
gave way near the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive. TIME TO SMILE broke out at the start, making light contact with THREAD COUNT, raced
close up in the early stages then dropped off the pace going past the half mile marker, was passed by THREAD COUNT going into the turn then could do no
better than chase the field home in the stretch.

Footnotes
SEA OF LIBERTY settled off of the solid early pace, tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run while outside of GROWTH ENGINE, raced in
tandem with that rival into the far turn, came three wide for the drive, overtook the tiring pacesetter in upper stretch and met the bid of GROWTH ENGINE at
the furlong marker while inside of that foe, dueled gamely to the final sixteenth, responded to firm urging in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed at the
wire. GROWTH ENGINE rated off of the solid early pace, tracked from the second flight and raced outside of an inner rival through the backstretch run, was
coaxed along three wide into the far turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, drew to even terms with SEA OF LIBERTY nearing the furlong marker,
dueled with the determined winner into deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides. WELLSWORT (IRE) was squeezed leaving the start and
was away a bit slowly, settled in the second flight along the first turn and tracked the solid pace while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, raced
three wide to the quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch and came within aim approaching the furlong marker, could not offer a final response in deep
stretch and was outkicked, while well clear for the show. SUGAR BEETS bobbled leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early
running, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run, improved position along the far turn, offered a bid approaching mid-stretch but could not
sustain that run in the final stages and weakened. GALLANT WARREN was unhurried in the early running and lagged through the backstretch run, saved
ground into the far turn then swung four wide for the stretch drive, gained ground heading to the furlong marker, finished evenly in the final stages and
passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. MO THEM DOWN was asked for early speed and assumed command leaving the break, drew to a clear lead into the
backstretch run and dictated terms while carving fast fractions to the half-mile marker, held a long lead to the quarter pole, was overtaken in upper stretch
and faded through the final furlong. BRONZE WARRIOR tracked the solid early pace, saved ground through the backstretch run, lacked a response along
the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
STORMING MACHINE broke well, pressed the pace outside of ATTA BOY LLOYD while always traveling well, took command passing the quarter pole,
drew off to an open lead, finished strong and was never threatened. GODSEND was under a ride from the break, found a good rhythm heading to the three
furlong marker, gradually cut into the leading margin of the dueling leaders then finished up well under left handed urging to gain second while slowly
gaining on, but never a threat to the winner. ATTA BOY LLOYD got squeezed at the start then was being leaned on by STORMING MACHINE for a few
strides, recovered, then set off for the lead, was joined by that foe to the outside, dueled through the turn racing away from the rail, jumped a rough patch in
the turn near the five-sixteenths pole causing a slight loss of momentum, weakened in the stretch but ran on well enough to hold the third spot. GALLO DEL
CIELO was outrun from the break, chased the field through the turn, tipped out a path into the stretch and finished with some late interest while racing
greenly. MAVERICK ROSE veered out from the break and was extremely wide in the early stages, moved closer going into the turn then drifted out, came
under pressure from the quarter pole but could not make up any ground late and was tiring before the final furlong.
