Footnotes
WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was unhurried and raced off the early pace, steadily edged up closer late on the backstretch, launched a bid for command midway
around the far turn, came three paths wide into the lane, kicked clear under a drive then finished ridden out. OSCAR WINNER WALLY rated off the early
pace, picked up the tempo entering the far turn, hustled up four wide nearing the quarter pole, sustained outside bid through the lane and finished clearly
second best. ALLEN'S ROCKET steadily edged up closer running through the backstretch, challenged JUST JOHNNY for the lead entering the far turn, vied
for the lead to the quarter pole, led the way in upper stretch, got overtaken by the winner and weakened to show. JUST JOHNNY set the pace through early
stages, challenged for the lead late on the backstretch, vied inside of ALLENS ROCKET around the far turn then faded through the lane. COBYMEISTER
failed to move into contention. COLORFUL NATIVE was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not keep pace around the far
turn and continued to tire in the drive.

SHADE sped to the lead entering the first turn and led the way up the backstretch, held clear still unleashed around the far turn, came two wide into upper
stretch, tapped once past the furlong marker, responded willingly and pulled away. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM raced four wide heading into the first turn and
remained unhurried off the pace, hustled along four wide into the lane and captured place in final strides. WATERS OF MEROM stalked the pacesetter up
the backstretch, launched a bid mid-way around the far turn, was no match for pulling away rival but kept on and got edged for place. MINNESOTA NICE
raced in range sitting just off the top trio through early stages, made a move with three furlongs left to run, saved ground entering the lane, cleared the
runner up spot then weakened late. KIRBY KAYE got bumped at the start but recovered quickly and was forwardly placed around the first turn, continued to
track the leader up the backstretch then came up empty around the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
MARSHSIDE MAMA sped to the lead in opening stages and set the pace up the backstretch, held a slim lead over stable-mate around the far turn, cut the
corner entering the lane, continued to find more under pressure, held off the outside bid from RUNNINTHESTREETS and finished clear.
RUNNINTHESTREETS steadily edged up closer mid-way up the backstretch, raced in aim for the lead around the far turn, sustained outside bid through the
lane and finished clearly second best. LOVE AMPLIFIED secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the top pair though early stages, edged
closer along the rail near the half mile marker, sustained an inside bid around the far turn, was no match for the clear top pair in the lane but churned on and
cleared the rest. JILL'S LEMON DROP prompted the pace up the backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and steadily retreated. SUPER CINDY
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NEW STRIPE tracked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, sat patiently along the inside around the turn, gamely slipped through a narrow opening
to take command at the head of the lane, quickly opened up to a clear lead, tapped once in the final furlong then finished wrapped up. NORTH SIDE sped to
the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around the turn then got collared by rail running winner at the head of the lane and had
to settle for second best. BLUESKIESANDANGELS tracked the leader up the backstretch, chased two paths wide around the turn, ran on three wide
through the lane and held show. HOLIDAY TICKET raced off the second flight and saved ground up the backstretch, urged three wide near the quarter pole
and needed more for late impact. TOUGH COMPANY raced two wide in the last flight through early stages, swung four wide into the lane and had no
response.
