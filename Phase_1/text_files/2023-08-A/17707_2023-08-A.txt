Footnotes
BAYTOWN PARFAIT set the pace inside of a pressing foe, showed the way in the two path around the far turn, vied with bidders on either side nearing the
lane, gamely sparred with an outer MASTER SWITCH while drifting out in midstretch, came out again and brushed that foe in the final seventy yards and
clung to an advantage to the wire. MASTER SWITCH hopped slightly at the start, tracked three wide, ranged up in the four path to bid at the quarter pole,
dueled with an inner BAYTOWN PARFAIT while being herded outwardly by that one entering the final furlong, took contact in the final seventy yards and got
narrowly fended off while saving place. HAWKS CREEK tracked along the inside, tugged two wide and between horses as the pace slowed entering the
backstretch, rated along the inside around the far turn, awaited racing room behind the leading quartet leaving the quarter pole, altered course outside of the
top pair at the furlong grounds, shifted further out as those rivals drifted in the final furlong, yet kept on to range up and offer a late bid but needed more.
SAVE THE KING steadied out of crowded quarters between horses soon after the start, saved ground off of the pace and moved up inside of foes. ACACIO
stalked along the inside, bid through a vacated rail to vie at the quarter pole, but gave way at the furlong grounds and weakened. MIDNIGHT TIL DAWN
was fractious loading and got outrun two wide. BOLD FORCE pressed two wide, but was outmoved by bidders on both sides at the quarter pole and faded.

ON A SPREE set the pace along the inside, showed the way while well in hand as his outer counterparts pressed around the far turn, drew away from them
nearing the lane and opened up handily. SUGOI pressed two wide, was urged along to sustain pressure between horses around the far turn, proved no
match for his inner counterpart leaving the quarter pole and was second best. SHORTLIST tracked three wide, pursued from within striking range around
the far turn but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BARBRATINA leaned out at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, took the turn in the three path, tipped outside of the leading trio at the quarter
pole, spun into upper stretch five wide while making up ground, sustained progress to bid leaving the furlong grounds and kicked clear. UP ON THE EDGE
bobbled slightly at the start, vied for the lead two wide and between horses into the turn, led entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer bidder inside
the final furlong and was second best. WEE BIT O MISCHIEF tracked along the inside, pursued inside of rivals while in the two path around the bend,
smoothly tipped three wide to take aim between horses leaving the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a bid and only managed to chase place home.
NAUGHTY MISS trailed in the four path, faded after getting floated five to six wide entering the lane, yet surpassed inner tiring rivals in the final furlong for a
minor reward. AARALYN vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, sustained pressure entering the lane but yielded through the final furlong.
CHOCTAW GRACE tugged outside of foes leaving the chute to prompt the leading pair at the five furlong pole, vied into and around the turn, but weakened
four wide and between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN CRUSH prompted outside of the leading pair and from the four path, vied before leading from an inner presser while in the three path around
the far turn, clung to advantage from that one to the sixteenth pole while hanging on his left lead, changed over late before an outer challenger offered a bid
and narrowly lasted to the wire. FIRST PLAYER tracked along the inside, drifted to the six path while shifting outside of the top pair entering the lane,
grinded away in pursuit through the final furlong, ranged up to attempt a late bid at the wire but just missed. SIX MISSIONS vied with a pair of outer rivals
while a path off of the inner rail around the first turn, pressed inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, sustained a battle through the final furlong but
needed more. CAIRO'S GHOST broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, awaited racing room behind rivals at the five sixteenths pole, moved up in upper
stretch, ran on, but encountered traffic late. SENSICAL vied two wide and between horses while in the three path, but yielded into the far turn, chased from
the three to four path around that bend, got floated out by an inner foe entering the lane and gave way. GO CATS lacked speed two to four wide and failed
to factor. QAADER laid off of the pace in the three path and faded.

Footnotes
SISTER KISSES pressed two wide, assumed command entering the lane and drew off under driving pressure. WITCH OF NOVEMBER tracked two wide
and between horses, then ran on to gain place inside the final furlong. DIVINE GRACE leaned out at the start, chased along the inside, lost position around
the turn, yet kept on after shifting out in upper stretch and gained show at the sixteenth pole. I GOTTA BOLT lacked speed three wide and moved up late.
ISABEL DE CLARE failed to factor four to three wide. GET BY set the pace, vied with an outer rival turning for home, proved no match entering the lane and
weakened. ELEGANT MOVES broke slowly, trailed into the turn, but was outrun and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
COUNTERSTRIKE brushed with an inner rival knocking his own hind quarters from underneath him early on, lost position between horses at the nine
sixteenths pole, tracked along the inside into the turn, progressed two wide and between horses turning for home, tipped outside of the top pair and loomed
a danger in the four path entering the lane, completed a bid at the furlong grounds and kicked clear. WESTERN COMMAND rushed forward after a
flat-footed beginning to set the pace along the inside, dug in turning for home, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and maintained
place thereafter. CUSTOM BOBBY'S brushed with an inner rival soon after the start, pressed two wide, vied turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer
bidder in upper stretch, was denied place in the final furlong and saved show. ZARTOWNIS tracked three wide and ran on to miss reaching show. GOOD
HEART broke a step slow, brushed with an outer foe in the opening furlong, stalked along the inside, but lacked room behind the leaders coming to
midstretch and only managed to chase through the final furlong. MUMAYAZ leaned in and brushed a foe at the start, trailed, shifted out in upper stretch and
moved up between horses. B D VALESKI lacked speed, tucked to the two path entering the turn, shifted out to the four path entering the lane but failed to
factor between horses. SANTORINI laid off of the pace four to five wide andyielded. GHENT broke a step slow while transferring light contact from an outer
rival to an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace four wide into the turn, tucked to the two path turning for home and faded. HOCUS raced off of the
pace five wide and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
FLASHY GEM pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, drew clear nearing the lane and held sway. SHE'S GONE settled off of the pace two wide, shifted
four wide entering the lane, ran on to bid for place passing the furlong grounds and edged that position. AALIYAH EZRI tracked along the inside, pursued
from the two path around the far turn, got brushed three wide by an inner rival entering the lane, chased the clear leader while vying for place between
horses in the final furlong, but was bested by her outer counterpart. MANUCA (BRZ) saved ground off of the pace, split foes while brushing an outer rival
two wide entering the lane, vied for place with an outer pair while chasing in midstretch, but yielded late. MUSIC STREET trailed in the two path, tipped to
the four path around the far turn before getting floated six wide while attempting to circle foes entering the lane and failed to factor. JUMP INTO THE FIRE
set the pace, got headed by the eventual winner's bid around the far turn, proved no match nearing the lane and weakened. REAGAN'S DECISION stalked
three wide, chased around the far turn, but weakened five wide and between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
FOXTROTANNA set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path into the lane with two foes on the outer flank, repelled both bids and shook away late in
the stretch under a steady drive. CUORE SACRO pressed the pace early on two wide, made a bid three wide into the lane, continued the bid once in the
stretch but lugged in a bit and was no match for the winner late in the drive. COMMAND' ORO was a tad slow and bumped at the start, raced back early on,
was in the six path into the lane and coming on late in the stretch run. MONT MERCOU tracked the pace early on near the rail, made a bid from between
horses into the lane but weakened late in the stretch drive. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS stalked the pace early on, raced three wide into the lane and faded late
in the stretch. KING OF KENTUCKY raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. MOUNT KISCO chased the
pace early, raced from between horses into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. MY ROAD was never a factor. MISTER
MOSCATO was a tad slow at the start, raced near the rail down the backstretch, shied from the rail near the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the two path
into the lane and altered around foe down the lane while empty. BAYOU SPIRIT chased the pace early, raced near the rail into the lane and eased late in
the stretch drive, was walked off.
