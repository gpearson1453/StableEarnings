Footnotes
WITHEE was prominently placed from the outset, raced three-wide on the turn, was brushed by MOONLIGHTNWINE leaving the three-sixteenths pole, then
came out near the wire to brush with that one again while being up in the final sixteenth to prevail narrowly. MOONLIGHTNWINE was allowed to settle in
stride, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, came in to brush with the winner leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly to just miss
after brushing with winner again near the wire. THE THIRD RING saved ground prompting CONTEJAS into the stretch and finished well for third in a steady
effort. CONTEJAS set the pressured pace to deep stretch while racing two-wide and weakened late. VALIDATE was unhurried early, swung out to come
five-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS OF WITHEE AND
MOONLIGHTNWINE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED THERE WAS MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
LUCKY CODE vied with BRANNIGAN for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off after three furlongs and increased his advantage from that
point. A SKIP IN THE PARK was reserved off the pace, moved up two-wide to split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, came three-wide into the stretch
and finished in a mild rally. BRANNIGAN vied for the early lead from along the inside, dropped back after three furlongs to stalk, could not reach the winner
but held on fairly well for third. CAPIAT was off a step slow to get away behind the field then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining
late. CHARLIE'S MAN saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a rally when asked. WESTERBERG bobbled shortly after the start, then moved
up to be forwardly placed while three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and weakened. MY DAD IS THIRSTY was four-wide on the first turn, then raced
three to four-wide the rest of the way and failed to threaten.

PEARL RIVER DELTA was brushed at the start, then dueled with BIG FASHIION for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off in the stretch and
proved best in a stiff drive. GOLD COAST GIRL was fractious in the gate, then dropped back early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished full of run.
BIG MAMA THORNTON dueled for the lead from along the outside and held on gamely during the drive. MS LYNN was unhurried after being brushed at the
start, found room along the inside nearing the stretch and finished in a mild rally. BIG FASHION was prominent placed while racing two-wide but lacked a
rally. SLICE OF PIE was close up early racing along the inside, lacked room on the turn, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch but had no response
when asked.

THUNDER broke in to bump MS PARKSIDE, then dropped back, came five-wide into the stretch and showed some interest late. BRILLIANT BIRD was

SHEMAKESCENTS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead from LADY BRETT nearing the sixteenth pole and gradually
edged clear. RODEO ROSE saved ground while being allowed to settled, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly to earn
the place. LADY BRETT saved ground setting the pace and held on well when headed nearing the sixteenth pole in a game effort. FOR YOU ONLY was
close up early racing along the inside, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and then went evenly late. EASY DOES IT saved ground while
dropping back early and failed to seriously threaten. TED'S CANDY GIRL was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.
