steadied briefly in the late going, then drifted in and edged up for the place. ROUND OF APPLAUSE rated inside, saved ground through the turns, angled
out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then switched lead and paths under left hand urging, edged ahead and could not maintain the bid. MAGIC
WIZARD allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, then closed willingly to get up for a share. HUNTIN' THE
RUT vied for the early lead on the inside, took command into the second turn, then faded the final furlong. CITY TRIPPER set the early pace off the rail,

KOTYLOS veered out at the start, rushed up outside the leader, edged ahead on the two path through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to
the task. GRUIT mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place.
HUMBLE JOE broke sharply and drifted in after the start, tracked the pace through the turn on the two path, came three wide into the stretch and evened
out. CHIEF CRAZY MOON sprinted away from the field quickly, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a
share. OVERTIME CHARLIE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, angled in and came through on the two path into the stretch and had no
rally. CALL ME NOW hopped at the start, moved up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain. COSMIC CONNECTION
was never involved, inside.

NINJA STAR led in the early going, settled for a stalking position through the turn, edged ahead at the quarter pole, then came again inside the furlong pole
and drew off under steady pressure. CALLER tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, split foes, veered
in, edged ahead, then lacked the needed late kick to maintain sway. EXPRESS STAR allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn,
came four wide into the stretch, then closed willingly to finish on equal terms with SO CLOSE SO FAR. SO CLOSE SO FAR well placed and outside, held
position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, veered in from right hand urging, straightened and angled out to finish on equal terms
with EXPRESS STAR. METRONOME set the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong.

BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway without challenge and was kept to the task through the stretch.
BREEZY CONNECTION well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten
that one, while clearly best of the rest. SOUTH HOUSE rated off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
flattened out. CHARGINA unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and could not gain. LIGHTNING ROUND was
never involved.

into the stretch and closed well for the place. WILLIE WANDO unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. DAWGMENTALITY broke a step slowly from the gate, moved up on the two path through the
second turn, came three wide into the stretch, evened and held a share. SHY DA RUNNER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then faded late. MCSTEAMY mid pack and inside, faded into the second turn, then angled out in the stretch and passed a tiring
foe. JUSTICEOFTHEPEACE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and had no rally.

Footnotes
NATHANIEL'S HOPE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain,
edged ahead late and held. DAD'S LIL SPARK tracked the pace well back, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, was blocked,
then found room late and missed. FLAT BUSTED unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened
and missed the place. MR. YASUDA allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up
for a share. FREDDY'S MUSIC set the pace on the inside, came again to reclaim the pace, shook clear, then weakened late and missed a share.
KVETCHING MAW stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead into the second turn, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then
faded the final furlong. THREE O ONE was never involved. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF FLAT BUSTED AGAINST THE RIDER OF
NATHANIEL'S HOPE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
