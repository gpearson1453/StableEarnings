Footnotes
SURELY SHIRLEY was steadily gaining ground from the two path down the backstretch and into the far turn, then dueled with an inner rival heading into the
homestretch, then kicked clear in the final furlong and kept on to prevail. FANCY stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, then moved up on
the far turn to duel from the inside entering the lane, continued to battle gamely but was outkicked at the end and was second best. SUPER LUXE stalked
the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters then menaced in the upper stretch from the three path and was best for show in the end. MADLY
DANCING stalked the pace while two wide, then settled back on the backstretch before bidding gamely on the far turn and into the stretch and still had more
in the end. HARD TO PLEASE was moving up while three wide at moderate pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied in the upper stretch
before giving way in the end. IMAGE OF LOVE was unhurried early, then raced behind the field down the backstretch, came out three wide on the far bend
to bid too little much too late. ROCKABILLIE raced in the middle of the field along the inside in the early furlongs, then lost momentum after the half and had
no final bid in the end. BRISBANE ROAD then pulled away to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, was used up
and faltered in the stretch.

KITTEN hesitated at the start, then improved position late. MYGALJUSTICE stalked the pace in the four path, racing evenly. FOREVER BLESSED was not
a factor. LILMISS SASSYPANTS broke outward, stalked the pace in the two path, then faded. The Stewards disallowed a claim on foul from the rider of

RUNAWAY STORM set the pace heading into the first turn, then lead the way down the backstretch and into the far turn, was challenged by an outer rival
heading into the stretch, kicked clear of that rival and drew off to prove best in the end. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN was reserved on the inside throughout the
first three quarters, then urged from the four path on the far turn to close fastest down the lane and be up for second place. TAKE CHARGE GENT chased
the pace from the inside under a steady drive and against outer rivals down the backstretch, then dug in gamely on the far turn and into the stretch and was
best for show. DEGREE OF RISK chased the pace while three wide, then menaced from the two path on the far turn to close belatedly down the lane just
missing show in the end. ON PALM SUNDAY was unhurried early, then raced along the inside behind the field throughout the early furlongs, then rallied at
the top of the stretch but came up empty. ROCKIN JUSTICE chased the pace while two wide and between rivals then rallied on the far turn and into the
stretch but came up empty in the end. MENDENHALL stalked the pace while two wide throughout the first half, then continued to move up gamely on the
turn and was in close to the leader, but was used up in the stretch and tired in the end. ROMAN GIANT was in a hard drive while chasing the pace outside
of rivals and four wide, was used up after the half and stopped.

SECRET'S IMAGE stalked the pace inside, rallied in the three path at the eighth pole and was up in time. CHA CHA LARRY pressed the pace in the three
path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of a rival, was clear and then was caught late. STARSPANGLEDIMAGE raced in the three path, shifted
inside in early stretch and had a mild late bid. STAR REVIEW improved position late while racing four wide. WE MISS OTIS saved ground but had no late
bid. FOREVER LASTING dueled inside to the stretch and gave way. LOGAN ATTACK pressed the pace to the turn before giving way. SPARKY THE

then took the lead at the top of the stretch, was in a gamely bid but was caught in the end. MR MANNING vied for the lead early and between rivals, then
settled back heading into the turn, bid three wide in the stretch and held onto the show prize in the end. ROYAL CONSORT vied for the lead while three
wide, was in a hard drive then gained command heading into the turn, then was out bid at the top of the stretch by an inner rival before giving way in the
end. JACKSON STRONG chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then rallied at the top of the lane to close willingly. MATERS N TATERS chased the
pace while four deep then began to steadily urge heading into the turn to bid in the stretch but came up empty. HIGHEST PRAISE settled along the inside
throughout and was no threat. POUR ME A DOUBLE raced at the back of the field while two wide and was no threat. LAKE TAHOE raced towards the back

NOBODY LISTENS dueled with an inner rival down the backstretch and into the turn, then kicked clear of that rival mid stretch, then held on grudgingly till
the end to prove best. LATIGO was moving up while two wide on the backstretch, then bid from the inside on the turn, rallied in the upper stretch and closed
well in the end. STOP HAMMERTIME saved ground from the inside throughout the early furlongs, then rallied in the stretch to close willingly and had more
to go. HUNGARIAN PRINCESS chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn then flattened in the stretch. CLASSIC MAX dueled
with NOBODY LISTENS from the inside, was in a hard drive throughout the turn and into the stretch then weakened in the end. SCOTTY'S ON EDGE raced
from the towards the back of the field then made a mild bid heading into the stretch and was no threat. SPOKE chased the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, then lost momentum after the turn and had no final bid.
