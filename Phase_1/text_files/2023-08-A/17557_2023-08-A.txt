Footnotes
HINDENBURG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off the final furlong and was kept to the task.
THOUSAND LOVES tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner,
while clearly best of the rest. PUNX unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong
and held the show. JAMA DILLON allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, then lugged in and got up for a
share. SCIENCE TO WIN well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. GOLDEN OAK well placed and outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
PROPER MANNERS sent from the gate, chased the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain
and drove clear late. LADY MARVEL sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway to the final sixteenth, then was no match for the winner and
held the place. MONGOLIAN MISSION never far back, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, came again in the
late going and edged up for the show. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then
evened and missed the show. AMAZON LIZZIE unhurried, looped two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved
position. MONEY AND HONEY well placed, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had no rally. THE TWO NANCY'S
was no factor. YES IT'S ERIE was never involved.

Footnotes
ADIOS BOBBY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. SIDE TRACKED
mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place. LEAVE
'EM LOADED tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show.
FARAT well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in and weakened. C THE KING
unhurried, looped up three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and flattened out. KUMAR was never involved, inside. PHARAOH
FANCY PANT moved up down the backstretch, then faded through the second turn.
