Footnotes
JULIAS DREAM quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled some outside pressure around the turn, responded when nudged on in
upper stretch and spurted away, eagerly increased her advantage and was only under mild hand asking through the final sixteenth. AVOIR , two wide early,
dropped in to chase around the turn, eased out when advancing into the stretch, could not impact the winner leaving the three sixteenths but stayed on well
to the inside of NEXT RIGHT THING to earn the place. NEXT RIGHT THING edged up three wide into the turn to prompt the winner, came under pressure
past the quarter pole and continued on with effort. ELLIE MOORE (IRE) broke a step slow, advanced three deep to a stalking spot after a quarter mile,
chased the leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide into the lane but went evenly through the final furlong. DOUBLE BAY (IRE) saved ground while
in range into the turn, came out in upper stretch, altered back in leaving mid stretch but came up empty. DON'T BRING CRAZY , between runners into the
turn, was lightly steadied soon after, angled five wide and lacked a serious run. PACIFIC ROSE was rated back to the inside of runners in the opening
furlong, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled out six wide for the drive but failed to menace. PETITE ANGE , off the pace, raced three wide mid turn
and failed to menace. CERTITUDE (FR) broke inward and was a step slow, took up sharply when in clear soon after, dropped well off the pace while saving
ground and failed to recover. POPPY'S JOY broke a step slow, steadied, swerved out sharply soon after, dropped far off the pace, pulled up when
distanced and walked off.

Footnotes
JALEN JOURNEY broke a step slow, edged up off the rail nearing the turn, advanced between runners nearing the lane, altered to the rail and surged
through to take over from HAND'SDREAM a furlong out then kicked away under a solid drive. HIGH PRESS settled off the hotly contested pace while about
four wide, commenced a run under pressure past the five sixteenths, ranged up five wide past the three sixteenths, kept on willingly and was clear for the
place. HANDR'SDREAM moved up three wide between rivals to contest the pace, battled on two wide between foes leaving the three eighths, shook clear
two wide into the lane, was headed from his inside near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. DESOTO'S WAR edged up between runners leaving the
far turn then tracked the embattled leaders, checked off heels in upper stretch, altered out and came back on late. MIKE OPERATOR hard used towards the
inside, came out on the turn, shifted out to be about seven wide near mid stretch but failed to seriously go on. AFTERNOON HEAT angled in nearing the
half mile marker, raced under rating into the lane, waited briefly before altering out in mid stretch then rallied between foes. SCARY FAST SMILE edged up
five wide to prompt the pace into the turn, forced the issue four wide around the turn, could not go on with the leader in upper stretch and faded. SECRET
TOUCH lagged back, swung very wide for the drive and offered a mild response. DR. TROUTMAN pulled his way forward four wide and to the inside of
rival, was under pressure mid turn and faded. DEBT MONGER , four deep vying early, battled three wide between runners around the turn then weakened
in upper stretch. RALLY CAT vied inside a trio early, eased back nearing the turn, dropped back around the turn and came up empty. MAJESTIC WIND
dueled two wide between runners early, stayed on to the inside of runner leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and faltered. PER
RULING FROM HIWU, SCARY FAST SMILE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS DANZING broke sharply, set a rated pace towards the inside, spurted away when given her cue in upper stretch then held firm while kept to
task. RHYME OR REASON was sent up between rivals soon after the start, prompted the pace outside the winner, kept on well through the final furlong and
held down the place. BAJAN BASHERT drifted in at the break, corrected and edged up to stalk the pace, gave hard chase to the inside of foes past the
quarter pole, continued in range past mid stretch but finished evenly. DIAMOND BAR GAL , in mid pack with pursuit off the inside, gained between runners
while coaxed into the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch and churned on. SATOSHI broke a bit slow, raced between foes into the turn, angled out with
some run into the stretch, straightened to be four to five wide and kept on with some interest. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS , away alertly, stalked the leaders
three deep and faded in the drive. HOT THIRST TRAP , off the pace and inside runners into the turn, failed to drum up a solid kick. SMILING AMY , three to
four wide, was under a hustling ride mid turn, failed to kick on entering the lane and gave way. JESSEBEAR , three deep into the turn, moved out wider mid
turn, shifted very wide in upper stretch and lacked a run.

CHEEKY GAL vied three wide outside NOTHING LIKE YOU, moved to a short lead leaving the three sixteenths, dueled under energetic handling past the
furlong grounds and proved resolute to the wire. NOTHING LIKE YOU moved to a slim lead leaving the chute, dueled inside the winner into and around the
turn, dug in after being headed and fought valiantly to the wire. GREER MY DEAR , in close attendance four wide, was pushed along three deep pursuing
the duelers past the five sixteenths and closed well through the final seventy yards. AUTUMN CHILL , brushed at the break, edged up some leaving the far
turn, moved between runners then angled four wide into the stretch, exchanged a brush near the three sixteenths, shifted back in a bit and kept on willingly.
BOSSY BRUIN GAL broke a step slow, saved ground pursuing the pace and came up empty. DISCREPANCY checked when pinched back about a
sixteenth of a mile after the break, made a five wide run from the five sixteenths to the furlong grounds then failed to seriously sustain. GREAT FORTY
EIGHT prompted the duelers while saving ground, was under a hearty ride pursuing past the quarter pole, altered out in upper stretch, stayed on past mid
stretch then faded late. GIRL OF MY DREAMS , brushed at the break, raced off the pace and three deep mid turn, checked nearing the lane and came up
empty. CANDY AISLE broke awkwardly and was away last, pulled her way forward between rivals and stalked past the half, failed to kick on nearing the
lane and tired.

BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) rated in range off the contested pace while off the rail, advanced between rivals into the lane, eased out to be about three to
four wide, closed stoutly under right handed encouragement and forged ahead in the final yards. WESTWARD LOOK dueled inside a trio of rivals while
nicely rating, kicked clear and was guided a bit off the rail in upper stretch, widened under a drive near the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but just couldn't
contain the winner. MY SUMMER DREAM saved ground, worked outward in mid stretch straightened and closed nicely between runners. INCH , brushed at
the break, was shuffled back early on, regrouped and rated, angled out around the turn, swung seven wide for the drive and rallied. HOT BOX broke through
the gate pre race but did not go far, stalked the leaders five wide into the turn, dropped in a bit past the three eighths to chase, shifted back out for the drive,
moved up past the sixteenth marker then hung late. FRATELLI had speed to the inside, rated back off the leading quartet past the half, awaited room while
saving ground into the lane but came up empty when afforded a clear run. MOLTO VIVACE , off the pace two to three wide mid turn, came out some in the
lane and finished with interest. SUPER BRADY broke inward and brushed a foe, corrected and moved up to dispute the pace four deep, stayed on to press
around the turn then faded in the final furlong. TOOK CHARGE dueled two wide between runners into the turn, battled outside WESTWARD LOOK into the
lane, remained a presence pursuing past the eighth pole then tired a sixteenth out. LAW ABIDING sparred three wide between runners, could not go on
entering the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PUSHINESS broke inward but quickly recovered and eagerly cleared, drafted in towards the rail leaving the far turn and set a rated pace, turned away a
challenge from CRAZY HOT past the quarter pole, kicked away after being put to a ride soon after, had her rider briefly drop his right rein inside the furlong
grounds, was kept alert with a right handed ask leaving the sixteenth pole then held firm under a steady hand ride. GRAND SLAM SMILE , bumped at the
break, moved up towards the rail and stalked past the half, shifted out from behind a rival leaving the three sixteenths and closed willingly. CRAZY HOT ,
soundly bumped and steadied leaving the gate, regrouped to advance four to five wide heading to the turn, dropped in and tracked the winner past the five
sixteenths, briefly threatened nearing the lane, remained on her left lead giving chase past the eighth pole then finished evenly. PUTT FOR DOUGH stalked
off the rail, was under pressure between rivals mid turn, shifted out some in upper stretch and faded. FLY A FANTASY , bumped at the break, saved ground
off the pace, eased out in the drive but failed to menace. STAY QUIET broke a step slow, lagged back around the turn, angled four to five wide but lacked a
bid. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT broke inward and bumped with CRAZY HOT, straightened and tracked four wide early on, failed to kick on leaving the far turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
MALTESE FALCON (IRE) secured the rail exiting the chute and rated kindly well within range, took advantage of an inside path and responded to a right
handed ask in mid stretch, forged through to take over near the sixteenth marker then kicked clear under steady hand encouragement. PANIC ALARM (IRE)
settled off the pace while three wide, eased out and worked five wide between rivals advancing past the three sixteenths, straightened away for the drive
and finished well to nab the place at the wire. AGENCY grabbed command soon after the start and set a rated pace towards the rail, came under coaxing
past the quarter pole, straightened away two wide and under a drive past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted past mid stretch, kept on gamely but
was nipped for the place. JUSTIN'S LEGACY , fractious behind the gate, was loaded without his rider, prompted the pace two wide, shifted three wide
pursuing into the lane then gave way grudgingly between foes. KID AZTECA rated towards the inside and in range, eased out then steadied briefly near the
five sixteenths, moved back in through the final furlong and kept on with effort. HENRY Q stalked the pace three wide, shifted four wide for the drive and
faded late. SMART MO was taken in leaving the chute and saved ground, crept up past the five sixteenths, briefly steadied soon after, remained inside for
the drive and lacked a bit of room near the sixteenth pole. ZALAMO (FR) broke outward, settled early while inside, angled six wide for the drive but failed to
respond.

up nearing the turn, angled four wide to work between runners into the lane, straightened away to give willing chase and out kicked MT. ZEROR for the
place. MT. ZEROR vied between rivals early, chased the leader three wide nearing the stretch, came back on between foes in mid stretch and kept on trying
to the inside of SNAPP DADDY. WHISKEY VISION , off the early pace, came out mid turn, circled six wide with a run into the stretch then flattened out
through the final furlong. BYE EVERYBODY roughed badly at the break and found himself far back after a quarter mile, continued well off the pace mid turn,
saved ground into the stretch, came out for the final furlong and finished with good energy. MY BROTHER MIKE dueled inside rivals, moved away mid turn,
was overwhelmed by the winner soon into the lane and tired. HARD TIMES , rated between rivals leaving the far turn, checked when in tight near the
quarter pole, came three wide for the drive but lacked a solid recovery. BLUEGRASS RYDER bobbled at the break, raced between runners around the turn,
shifted out well wide in upper stretch but failed to rally. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS bore out the break and bumped with a rival, straightened and rolled up towards
the rail, stalked the leaders leaving the far turn, chased to the quarter pole and faded. DIAMONDS PREFERRED broke awkwardly, raced off the pace and
four wide past the quarter pole, angled wider for the drive but failed to make an impact. MISSING THEM vied three deep, failed to keep pace past the five
sixteenths and faltered. IT WAS A GOOD DAY , well wide with early pursuit, dropped back around the turn.
