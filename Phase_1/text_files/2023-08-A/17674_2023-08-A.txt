Footnotes
GHAALEB'S DREAMS vied inside to the second turn, drew clear entering the stretch and held well while kept to task. MARIA'S GIFT vied two across to the
second turn, swung out entering the stretch, fell back, continued willingly, couldn't gain and finished second best. C C'S WORLD was never far back, rallied
into the second turn to loom a threat, angled in mid stretch, bid, came up empty and settled for show. ZENCHUA SKY raced in the back, went widest in the
drive, lacked a stretch response and failed to threaten. MAIDEN ROCK went four wide on the first turn, fell back to trail the field and passed a tiring rival.
TWELVE RED ROSES broke slowly, dropped inside to save ground, settled off the pace in a good position, had nothing left for the drive and stopped.

AQUACAT set a pressured pace to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. LAWMAKER was in tight entering the first
turn, stalked the pace along the inside, angled out for the drive, bid, hung, was no match late and held for place. MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY rallied into the
second turn, came in, crowded his rival and finished well inside to earn show. BRODY'S FLY was in tight entering the first turn, pressed the pace to the
second turn, swung wide, fell back and leveled off. PAYNT BY LETTERS was never far back, bid and came up empty. KINGSBURRY ATTACK raced mid
pack, saved ground, was crowded and checked on the second turn and stopped. STRIKE PRICE raced inside, was impeded and checked on the second
turn and dropped back. STOLICH was unhurried early, saved ground and lacked a bid. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN raced outside and was outrun in an even
effort. Following a rider's objection, MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY was disqualified and placed sixth for causing interference on the turn.

Footnotes
ROCKET HOTSHOT was unhurried early, saved ground, got through along the rail on the turn, closed willingly, shifted out late and got up in the final
strides. UNCLE NICK stalked the pace while racing inside, bid three wide leaving the turn, closed steadily, was gaining late and got up for place. BEEASY
broke out, pressed the pace, angled in late, assumed command, continued to drift in and was caught near the wire. SOVIET STANDARD was sent to the
front to set the pace, shied from the whip and bore out in the stretch, fell back, came again once straightened and was outnodded for show. SANTINO'S
FANTASY broke in the air to be off a step slowly, advanced outside, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed rally. TEA AFTER BALLET stalked
the pace while racing between horses, fell back into the turn and went evenly late.

Footnotes
BLURT set the pace, drew off on the second turn for a clear lead and extended the margin under left handed urging. CHRISTMAS PRESENT broke out and
bumped at the start, stalked the pace to the second turn, fell back and was no match for the winner. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE raced close to the pace,
swung wide leaving the turn, finished evenly and earned show. GOLD BUCKLE was rated early, raced mid pack, saved ground, bid inside and came up
empty. PISTOL BOX was pinched back at the start, fell far back to trail, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to improve position. CAMARGO
broke in and bumped at the start and was outrun in an even effort. KRAMDEN was never far back, tired on the second turn and gave way.

SHE'S WANDAFUL was away alertly, set the pace with a clear lead, was under pressure late and held on gamely. BELPERRON pressed the pace, bid
willingly, couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a good effort. PRANCIPANTS raced close to the pace, lacked a late response and held safely for
show. BALI BABY broke in the air, saved ground, was steadied slightly entering the turn and closed well inside. CAT ROYALE was slow early, raced
outside, advanced on the turn to get within range and lacked a rally. TAR HEEL GIRL broke out, was in traffic and steadied repeatedly early and failed to
menace. RARE ACTION ATTACK raced in the back, swung wide leaving the turn and was outrun in an even effort. WILDWOOD POSSE was a bit reluctant
to load, raced inside, was getting out on the turn, checked and stopped. The rider of BELPERRON claimed foul against the rider of SHE'S WANDAFUL for
alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made.

TEE BURNS bumped start, assumed command early, set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging.
RICHIESONAROLL stalked along the rail, shifted out on the turn, bid willingly and was no match for the winner. CORTESE stalked the pace while racing
between horses, fell back into the turn, closed inside, altered course mid stretch and leveled off and settled for show. TWIRLING ROSES lagged while
racing outside, lacked a stretch response and failed to menace. DASH TO THE CASH broke slowly and bumped at the start, was unhurried early and
improved position in an even effort. PLAUSIBLE DENILE was not a factor. FEVER NATION led briefly early, stalked three wide to the turn, fell back and
gave way.

Footnotes
DYNABLUE came in at the start, was unhurried early and raced in the back, swung wide entering the stretch, closed with a rush, got up late and was all out
at the wire. COMMAND CENTRAL rallied between horses on the turn, closed willingly, led briefly late and was outfinished in a game effort. IOYA AGAIN
was off a step slowly, was unhurried early and raced inside, angled out for the drive, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up for show.
DRIVEN ONE lagged early, closed mid track and was caught for show. LAVENDER EARL set the pace to deep stretch, faltered and lost position. SON OF
GRACE broke slowly and was crowded at the start, was unhurried and saved ground, went widest in the drive and finished well. CLEAR N CONVINCING
rallied inside on the second turn, bid off the rail, loomed a threat, hung late and lost position. STORM BORN was never far back, raced inside, bid willingly to
threaten, came up empty late and fell back. WHERE'D THE DAY GO advanced outside to the turn, rallied five wide and flattened out. FULL MAGAZINE
stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way.
