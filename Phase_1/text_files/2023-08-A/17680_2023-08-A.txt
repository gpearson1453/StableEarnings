CARBON coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command in the final jumps to the finish to
prevail. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS coaxed from the start, led early on four paths off the inside before being displaced on the front by AERON WARRIOR five
furlongs from home, prompted that rival to the outside before advancing to take back the front near the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive under challenge from flanking rivals a furlong out, rebuffed the inside foe while collared in the final jumps to the finish from the
outside rival and was along for the place honors. HARLAN'S BOND chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch forcing AERON WARRIOR to pause briefly
in behind, offered up a bid to issue a challenge inside the leader a furlong out but was ultimately repelled in the late stages. SUSIE'S SAVER seven paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. HANDLE THE TRUTH bobbled at the start, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SWEET SENSATION
stumbled at the start recovering inwards and conceded six to seven lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. AERON WARRIOR broke out at the start, chased just off the inside before advancing to take
command five furlongs from home, tucked inside through the turn and came under pressure getting displaced from the front just outside the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch pausing behind HARLAN'S BOND straightened away, then weakened to the finish. JOEY THE FISH broke a beat
slow, then got steadied at the start conceding eight to nine lengths to the front before settling into an awkward stride, chased three then two wide detached
at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper stretch, drifted out under left handed crop, then drifted in
under a right handed crop and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TRICKY TEMPER broke a bit slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled out while hustled then chased the pace on the outside, went four wide on the
turn, gained in the five path into the stretch, took over under one pop of a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, disposed of two foes into the final
furlong and drew away under a solid hand-ride ride to prove much the best. MY KINDA MISCHIEF was recalcitrant and reluctant to load while being backed
in from the front of the gate, came away in good order, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch
and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. RED BURGUNDY was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the
two path on the turn, moved closer to the rail coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened but held the show. CALL HER BLUFF hit the inside of the gate and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, was coaxed
along at the rear, moved from the three to four path early on the turn, gained some while making a brief run late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. DORTH'S SOL DANCER was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two
path on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed response. PLAY FREE BIRD was hustled from the start, chased the pace
on the inside, dropped back late on the turn and reteated.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CATCH bumped at the start by MOLIERE, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
advanced on the leader in tandem with COSTA TERRA and took over command near the three-eighths and quickly opened up in tandem with that rival on
the rest of the field, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the stretch to the finish in game fashion putting a head in front a sixteenth
out and holding that advantage to the wire. COSTA TERRA tossed his head at the start and came inwards bumping and pinching OUSTER against ROYAL
TRYST, raced four then three wide through the first turn before chasing five paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn advancing to
knock heads with the aforementioned foe from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch taking narrow advantage, dug in dueling through to the
wire getting headed a sixteenth out and gamely fought on to the end but was ultimately bested at the finish. OUSTER got bumped at the start by COSTA
TERRA and was pinched back against ROYAL TRYST, chased just off the inside and then along the inside through the opening bend and down the
backstretch, went three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. ROYAL
TRYST chased five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. TRIDENT HIT showed the way
in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got headed near the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch in retreat and faltered in the drive. MOLIERE broke out at the start bumping CLASSIC CATCH, chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

JODY'S PRIDE pressed the pace of MIA MARCELA from the outside in the three path, advanced to duel with that rival midway on the turn and took over a
narrow advantage near the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. MIA MARCELA
coaxed from the start, established the front shortly after the break and showed the way lightly coaxed along in the two path under pressure from JODY'S
PRIDE to the outside, dueled with that rival midway on the turn and was headed for the front with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. SOLVE THE PUZZLE hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. LYRICAL PARDON hustled from the start, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home and weakened. SUGAR N SPICE coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, tired. TAP THE KEG leapt up at the start and then outwards getting
away last and conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE leaned out at the start but broke towards the front, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took
the advantage in upper stretch and drew away while kept to the task under a solid hand-ride. TOMMY GUN broke in then was corrected by the rider and
hustled, moved in while showing the way, came in then shut-off and bumped MODERN MIDAS near the five-eighths pole which caused that opponent to
check, vied between foes in the two path under urging on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the
place. PRESSURE moved out early, settled just off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the
show. MODERN MIDAS veered in sharply at the start then bumped with a foe, was grabbed with the right-rein and corrected under a long hold, moved up
while hustled, was shut-off by TOMMY GUN near the five-eighths and bumped by that foe then checked, came back under strong encouragement while
pushed up inside the aforementioned foe, vied inside of two horses while along the rail on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. BASIS
RISK broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow then was forced in and checked, spotted the front many lengths, went two to three wide on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
INTO HAPPINESS broke out at the start, then was devoid of speed when settling at the tail of the filed just off the inside early on before tipping six paths off
the rail down the backstretch, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well
to issue a challenge through the final furlong stacking outside a trio and was just up in the shadow of the wire to score. COPPA GIRL chased four to five
paths off the inside early on, tucked to the two path five furlongs from home before heading four wide into the far turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive loosely between foes taking narrow command a sixteenth out, then got nailed on the
line and forced to settle for the place honors. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. RAGING SEA got bumped between foes at the start, showed the way in hand
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a trio clinging to
command until overwhelmed a sixteenth out, kept on to the finish well clear of the rest. VIENNA CODE forwardly placed four wide early on, chased four then
three wide before tucking to the two path placed to coaxing at the half mile pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. IN MY OPINION
broke out at the start bumping RAGING SEA in tandem with FANCY AZTECA, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and tired. FANCY AZTECA broke in at the start bumping RAGING SEA in concert with IN MY OPINION, then got bumped
between foes herself and was briefly just off the inside before tipping out to be five paths off the rail into the backstretch taking shortened awkward strides,
began to climb nearing the three-quarter pole in the absence of any kickback and was placed to a protective hold when striding awkward, got guided outside
and was pulled up and subsequently vanned off.

VENTI VALENTINE broke out and hit the gate soundly then bumped with a rival, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, was
roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn then was driven five wide into the stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong,
drifted out under a left-handed crop shortly thereafter, was placed under a strong hand-ride outside the sixteenth-pole, gained the advantage into the final
sixteenth and prevailed under strong handling. TIMELESS JOURNEY traveled four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on
the final turn, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead in the four path into the stretch, drifted out between the eighth-pole and
sixteenth-pole, was headed at the sixteenth-pole and missed while just able to get the place. BETSY BLUE went three wide between horses on the first turn,
settled on the inside of a rival, dropped back some near the five-eighths, was roused outside the half-mile pole, went three to four wide for most of the far
turn, paused slightly while moving to the five path late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch, chased outside while remaining on her inside lead into
the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead at the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage but missed while clear for the show. KNOW IT ALL
AUDREY was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside of the leader in the two path, took the advantage approaching the seven-sixteenths,
vied in the two path on the final turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SUNSET LOUISE stumbled at
the start then was bumped by a foe, moved up under urging on the inside to take the lead, showed the way while inside of an opponent down the
