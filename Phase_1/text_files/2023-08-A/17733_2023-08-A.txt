Footnotes
LAPUSH moved up along the inside to take the lead before going a quarter mile, saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win as much the best.
COASTAL GIRL was prominent from the start while racing three-wide and finished well for second in a good effort. SHELBY SHORTSTOP raced four-wide
while being forwardly placed and picked up the show in a steady effort. DREWY bobbled at the start, then moved up between horses to prompt the issue to
the stretch and tired. CHIRISCA was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. TRES VITE was close up early while
saving ground but gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
DYF saved ground stalking the pace, angled out four-wide nearing the quarter pole to launch his bid, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and then was all
out to hold off TWO PRINCES late. TWO PRINCES was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, dropped back slightly on the turn then came five-wide into
the stretch and finished fast to just miss. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and held on well for third when headed.
SILENT DECLARATION disputed the pace to the stretch while racing three-wide and finished fairly well in a steady effort. UNION BLISS vied for the lead
from between horses for a half mile and tired. STREET DEMAND was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

SAILING IN saved ground setting the pace and drew clear during the drive to win with something left. ANOTHER TEN hopped in the air at the start, then
moved up between horses on the turn, prompted the pace from along the outside, was unable to match strides with the winner during the drive but held on
well for second. GOIN' COASTAL was close up early while racing between horses, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. BABY
MARTINI was unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch and improved her position late. FOREVER AMBER dropped back early while saving ground,
came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to seriously threaten. NOW SAY SO saved ground while being allowed to settle and tired during the late
stages. PISTA GIRL was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and gave way.
