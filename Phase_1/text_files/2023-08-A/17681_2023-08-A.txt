WEEKENDING was hustled out to a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, was headed briefly near the furlong
marker then fought back gamely under mild left handed urging to get back up in time. STARLITESLEW vied for the lead three wide into the stretch, gained a
narrow advantage over the winner near the furlong marker then finished second best. DANES LAST SONG pressed the pace two wide into the stretch,
angled outside the top pair past the eighth pole and was outfinished. TV TIZ GORGEOUS went evenly. GHOSTLY REVIVAL hopped at the start and was no
threat. HEART OF RUBY hopped at the start and lacked the needed response.

DANCE DRAMA sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under mild right handed
urging to win as much the best. THELMA LUCILLE never far back, rallied three wide into the stretch and finished second best. EXTRA CRAFTY inside
early, angled out to the five path past the quarter pole and closed a gap late outside while drifting out. HAUGHTY PRAISE was bumped hard at the start,
offered a bid along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. ANGEL'S DESTINY failed to menace. HOLLYS SUPER STAR chased the winner three wide,
loomed boldly two wide midway on the turn then came up empty. WICKED REESE bore out at the start bumping hard with HAUGHTY PRAISE then was no
threat. GOLD APPEAL bore out at the start and was no factor. SEE YA SISTA was through early.

TOYI never far back, closed willingly in the four path through the stretch, made the lead late and won under strong handling. MISTERCHILLIWILLI chased
the early pace, rallied two wide to make the lead near mid turn, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner in the late going. NAPA DUDE
trailed into the stretch then found his best stride late in the four path. MINDSHIP Q well placed, failed to respond. ARMOR PIERCING had speed into the
stretch then faded. GUN FACTOR sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside past mid turn then was used up.

CHANNEL FURY prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, assumed command then widened the balance of the trip while drifting out to the five path
under left handed urging winning as much the best while getting a rapid final time.. WICKED WARRIOR stalked the pace three wide into the far turn,
dropped inside, gave up position the came on again late to gamely gain second. BEER CHASER allowed to settle, offered a mild bid three wide into the
stretch then was outfinished for second. STRIKE APPEAL failed to menace. AYE AYE SIR set the pace along the inside past the quarter pole then gave
way. STAR HAWK trailed.

Footnotes
MERE BAG OF SHELLS chased the pace into the turn, began to advantage two wide before a half, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, made the
lead before the furlong marker and drew off under s strong hand ride. CANELA FINA with the second flight inside, altered course to the six path in upper
stretch and finished clear for second. HALO EFFECT stalked the pace two wide and went evenly. SNAZZY failed to menace. BROKEN JEWEL away alertly,
set the pace along the inside into the stretch and weakened late. POLLY PRISSY PANTS passed tiring rivals inside. VAMONOS PIACENTE was no threat.
MY TWO JAKES was no factor. C MORE PRIDE was outrun and raced widest on the turn. ONE RICH KITTEN with the second flight three wide, was
through after a half. Z B READY was never involved. HAPPYBDAYMRPREZ had brief speed outside.
