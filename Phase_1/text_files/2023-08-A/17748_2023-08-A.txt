Footnotes
TALL PAUL broke alertly and went straight to the front, moved in early then showed the way on the inside of the runner-up, drew off in tandem with that foe
while in the two path on the turn, was put to a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker, was given a pop of a down-turned
crop near the sixteenth-pole and extended the advantage under steady urging to the finish. QUIET WISDOM broke in and hit the gate, moved up to press
the pace on the outside of the winner, opened up in unison with that foe while in the three path on the turn, drifted in some while battling outside that
opponent under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, lost touch while weakening outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while able to safely secure
the place. STRAWBERRY KWIK moved out while hard ridden, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths then shifted further out, went three then two wide on
the turn, kept on while dropping to the rail in the final furlong and earned the show. APOLLO CODE chased the pace under strong urging, dropped back
while climbing some leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. STORMY'S
DREAMING broke in and was slow into stride, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. MAMA'S MIDDIE broke out at the start, was urged along off the
pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GUCCI MAN
broke a step slow, was hard ridden near the back on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to impact.

final furlong overhauled the leader a sixteenth out in tandem with the runner up, then edged away from that rival in the late stages to prevail. SMOKEY
SMOKEY tucked to be just off the inside in closest aim of the leader forcing both GOOD LORD LORRIE and ALL ABOUT TONITE to steady after the start,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on with good energy to overthrow the leader in concert with the
aforementioned foe, then got shaken off in the late going to the finish while clear for the place honors. OCEAN MERMAID (GB) established the front shortly
after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got let out taking the two path into upper stretch, inched
away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was overhauled a sixteenth from home, kept on to preserve the show honors safely on the wire.
REVEREND MOON coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from the pocket, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the inside
straightened away, dug in under a drive tipping out to the three path a sixteenth from home and weakened in the late stages. ALL ABOUT TONITE got
steadied after the start conceding two lengths of position when SMOKEY SMOKEY tucked in front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and passed tired rivals. BETTER LUCK coaxed from the start, chased
four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. KING JULIEN a bit reluctant to
load prior to the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. REVELATORY chased
just off the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
made no impact. FAST STRIDE broke in a step at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home,

rail bid when the pacesetter came off the inside into upper stretch, fought inside of three foes under strong handling into the final furlong, took the lead
outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed while drifting out at the finish. FREUDIAN was reserved in the two path on the first turn, settled near the rear on the
backstretch, moved closer while shifting from three to five wide on the final turn, was roused late on that bend, rallied to make an outside bid outside the
furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole, fought outside of three foes to the finish and missed but earned the place. JOLLY
MISS JILL broke out and bumped soundly with a foe, went to the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was asked near the quarter-pole then

Footnotes
TEN CENT TOWN four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the leader, tucked three wide advancing to latch on the leader with
seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under
a drive to inside the eighth pole, then got geared down late with the race sewn up and held on to prevail. THUNDERIAN chased two then three wide coming
under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside but missed at the end. DANGEROUS RIDE coaxed from the
gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the
show honors. KUPP was inspired by GABE growing fractious in the gate and grew fractious himself busting open the stall door and attempting to run off
save for the strong hold of the assistant starter, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, offered
up a bid but was outkicked. COMMERCE COMET hustled from the gate intent on the front, got coaxed along on the pace just off the inside coming under
pressure from the eventual winner seven-sixteenths from home, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, got flashed the crop to the off
side when used up and weakened to the finish. GABE grew fractious in the gate leaping up and inspired a pair to do so to his outside, chased three wide
forwardly placed early on, got shaken off near the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

RICHIES PRINCESS established the front just after the initial stride from the break and spurted away two to three wide down the backstretch, went just off
the inside through the turn holding clear command and swung three wide into upper stretch, drifted in a path near the three-sixteenths, then shied out inside
the eighth pole three to four paths before being corrected with a stiff left rein a sixteenth from home and held safe to the finish to prevail. NOLITA chased
just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, drifted in slightly
straightened away, then followed the shying out leader out two paths inside the eighth pole before altering in a path a sixteenths from home and finished
willingly to latch on that rival as she hit the finish. FOXY CARA hustled from the gate, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, offered up a mild kick to secure the show
honors. BETTER HUMOR ME coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went four to five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish and just got bested for the show honors in the

Footnotes
L J'S EMMA broke out a bit at the start, settled on the inside of a rival, went two then three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, rallied outside
while swapping leads back and forth multiple times and closed well to get up late and prevail. STONE SILENT moved in while going to the front, showed the
way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, led under the crop into
the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead late and was denied while clear for the place. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) was well placed just off the
pace, raced between horses in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while
just able to get the show. LOVE APPEALS moved out while under tight restraint just off heels, settled more kindly late on the backstretch, went three then
two wide on the turn, bumped with a rival inside the five-sixteenths, moved out while still on her inside lead in upper stretch, came between foes into the final
furlong, swapped to the proper lead late and just missed the show. REDIFINED was last away then taken in hand while in tight between foes after the start,
settled near the rear, went two to three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide and improved position while unable to threaten then was reported to
have bled. REFLEXIVITY (IRE) angled in then settled on the outside with some cover, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. LOVE REIGNS (IRE) settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn and failed to
impact. BEAUTY OF THE SEA broke in and bumped with an opponent then was hustled, chased the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn and
came up empty. MY SWEET AFFAIR tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased the runner-up under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. DREAM CONCERT bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up in traffic near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn,
bumped with a foe inside the five-sixteenths then checked in tight against the rail and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
RHYME SCHEMES broke in at the start bumping EDIFIED solidly into HAUL, raced four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced on the
front under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch taking over command, went clear under a light drive before being
placed back in hand inside the eighth pole and prevailed well clear and comfortably to the wire. MARKET STREET established the front shortly after the
start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from WOODCOURT to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and was overhauled from the front by the top one, proved no match through the
stretch while running on determinedly to preserve the place honors. HAUL broke out at the start bumping EDIFIED into RHYME SCHEMES, then had that
middle rival reverberate off that foe and was bumped and steadied conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five then four wide
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to secure the show honors. LASSO chased
along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and weakened. EDIFIED got bumped solidly at the start by HAUL breaking out and bounced into RHYME SCHEMES breaking inwards,
bounced off that rival and bumped again solidly with HAUL getting pinballed around at the start and forced to steady, conceded five to six lengths to the front
as a result, chased three wide under hustling, went four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. WOODCOURT away sharply to the front, prompted
the pace of MARKET STREET to the outside four then three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under brief
coaxed five-sixteenths from home before being eased up on to back away between foes taking the two path into upper stretch, folded and was eased home
to the finish.

Footnotes
CASA CREED went three wide on the first turn, was carried out onto the backstretch, settled outside without the benefit of cover, was roused with three
furlongs to run, traveled three wide on the far turn, was put to the crop in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed determinedly to make a
bid outside the sixteenth-pole, took the lead in the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. ANNAPOLIS established a forward position between
foes down the initial straightaway then was eased back, saved ground on the first turn, came out entering the backstretch, settled outside without cover,
ranged up in the two path on the final turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch then took the lead at the three-sixteenths, led
under a drive to the sixteenth-pole but was caught while just able to get the place. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) was taken in hand while outside foes early,
steadied while carried out by a rank rival into the first turn then dropped to the inside, was unhurried at the rear, saved ground while roused on the far turn,
moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch, angled out at the three-sixteenths then drifted further out before being
straightened, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished fast to just miss the place while clear for the show. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) was hustled
to the front, showed the way on the inside, was roused late on the far turn, lost the advantage to the runner-up in upper stretch, battled inside that foe under
a drive into the final furlong and weakened. EMMANUEL rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the inside on the backstretch, was asked while two
to three wide on the far turn, came under the crop in upper stretch and failed to rally. FULL SCREEN became rank when taken under restraint early, tossed
his head nearing the first turn then swerved out, went three to four wide going around that bend, was reserved towards the rear, moved from the two path to
the four path under urging on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the three-sixteenths and was no factor. SO HIGH (GB) was
hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, came up empty under urging along the hedge on the far turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
CHILENO chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command seventy yards
from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. ICE ROAD four then three wide early on in mid pack, bumped WHAT'S UP DOC twice pushing that foe
to the rail in behind the leader and took over sole possession of the two path, advanced to prompt the front five furlongs from home, took over command at
the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared seventy yards from the finish, kept on to preserve
the place honors. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE broke a half a beat slow and lost his lane to rivals, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping
three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the
show honors. MISTICAL CURLIN hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. FORREST CITY forwardly placed three wide, got taken hold of and was eased off the pace of GUT FEELING
six furlongs from home, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened
in the late going. CICCIOBELLO five wide in pursuit throughout, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, continued five wide into upper stretch, came up
empty. WHAT'S UP DOC coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside early on, got bumped twice and was nudged to the rail in behind GUT FEELING by
ICE ROAD who wanted the two path more, chased along the inside coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. MEMPHIS chased four to five paths off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six
wide into upper stretch, made no impact, and was eased home to the wire. GUT FEELING coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside
initially under some pressure from FORREST CITY before that rival backed off six furlongs from home, and then came under pressure from ICE ROAD with
five furlongs remaining, got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths when headed for command, took the inside route into upper stretch, folded, and was
eased home to the finish.

ground on the far turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, gained into a good striking position, chased into the final furlong and flattened out
