Footnotes
CLOUDS OF WHITE stalked the pace around the turn, raced in the two path through the stretch, closed determinedly between horses, bid late and got the
bob. GATITA SUAVE , in the three path on the turn, floated four wide turning for home, drew alongside the winner in mid stretch and just missed in a game
effort. SWEET SHUGS sped to the early lead, opened up along the rail on the turn and weakened late. MELIPONINI BEE , four deep on the turn, floated to
the five path entering the stretch and rallied. KENTUCKY REIGN saved ground on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. MYSTIC MALIBU was not a
factor. JANE STREET , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn. THUNDER BOSS , outside horses on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then
gave way. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY was outrun.

Footnotes
GRAND ESCAPE bobbled inward at the break, corrected and was sent clear soon after, set the pace two wide under some coaxing around the turn, opened
up a bit leaving the three sixteenths and held firm under a solid drive. RASCALLY REBEL edged up from between rivals early and gained a stalking spot,
pursued three wide under a ride around the turn, exchanged a brush with LUV YA BYE BYE soon into the lane, straightened and kept on well to be second
best. HOP AND SCOTCH , off the pace, was guided inside leaving the far turn, swung back out in upper stretch and closed steadily. LUV YA BYE BYE , off
slowly when rank and hopping in the air, recovered and gained along the rail into and around the turn, came out a bit brushing with RASCALLY REBEL near
the three sixteenths, pursued inside that one past the eighth pole then faded late. SLOE GIN BIZ failed to keep pace. POLITICAL DECISION , three deep
nearing the half, could not keep up and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
EIDIKOS (GB) , alertly taken to the inner rail early, stalked the pace while remaining along the rail down the backstretch and around the far turn, eased out
to the two path in upper stretch, took command approaching the sixteenth pole and drew off. STERN CHASER stalked the pace down the backstretch,
steadied in close quarters between horses near the three eighths pole, was in hand waiting for room approaching the stretch then rallied between rivals.
YOUENS lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE offered a mild, four deep advance on the far turn
and failed to sustain the move. LIGHTRESS set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in the drive. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE , two wide chasing the
pace to the stretch, gave way. SISTER CLOUDY , always outrun near the inner rail, swung to the five path in upper stretch. NICOLAR trailed.

TAKE CHARGE TOO took over between foes nearing the five eighths, handled some inside pressure then cleared heading to the turn, set a rated pace past
the three furlong pole while inside, turned away an outside threat from BILL OF RIGHTS near the quarter pole, kicked away when set down soon into the
stretch, wandered outward past mid stretch, was corrected with some right handed encouragement then was fully extended to fend off SUPREME LAW.
SUPREME LAW broke a bit slow, regrouped and advanced to the inside of the winner to prompt, rated back off that one near the half, came out for room
entering the lane, made a grinding run through the final furlong but had his bid fall short. ROAN BURGUNDY rated behind rivals heading to the half mile
pole, moved out and was put a solid ride past the three eighths, shifted five wide for the drive and closed steadily. BILL OF RIGHTS , under a firm hold
tracking three wide early on, moved to engage the winner past the five sixteenths, could not quicken with that one soon into the stretch then weakened
through the final sixteenth. MY MAMBA , urged off the pace and off the rail past the three eighths, angled six wide for the drive and came up empty.

SPORTS EDITOR set the pace along the inner rail, turned back a rival in mid stretch and drove clear. ST. JOHN'S chased the winner, challenged in mid
stretch and tired. THE JACKAL , lost ground racing outside horses around the turn and rallied gamely between rivals. HAY CHIEF , unhurried down the
backstretch, circled foes five wide leaving the final yurn and rallied. SLEIGHT OF HAND raced inside horses most of the trip and passed tired ones.
PIETRELCINA raced outside horses down the backstretch, offered a mild move in upper stretch and weakened. CINDER HILLS was no factor. NONNA'S
TIRAMISU , always inside horses, steadied near the wire the first time by, steadied on the second turn, steadied entering the backstretch and was not a
factor. AMANI'S TIGER , wide the final turn, weakened. CRIPPLE CREEK , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
BOLIVIE (IRE) broke a step slow, rated inside early then was taken off the rail for the backstretch run, took closer order past the five sixteenths, swung out
five wide into the lane, closed outside rivals under left handed asks, drifted in a bit past the sixteenth pole, gained a slim lead in the final yards and narrowly
prevailed. SPEIRLING BEAG (IRE) rated outside a rival, crept closer under some coaxing approaching the quarter pole, exchanged a bump with CECILE as
that one angled out near the three sixteenths, worked her way between runners past the furlong grounds, shifted out a bit inside the sixteenth pole, kept on
gamely between foes and had her surge just miss. CECILE , taken to rate while saving ground, bided her time past the three eighths, came out and bumped
with SPEIRLING BEAG (IRE) when maneuvered for room in upper stretch, advanced between runners, altered back past mid stretch, forged through and
brushed LIFELOVENLAUGHTER when vying on near even terms in deep stretch and kept on valiantly to the wire. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER quickly went
clear and set the pace, remained clear two wide while under a ride in upper stretch, was confronted from both sides leaving the sixteenth marker,
exchanged a brush soon after and gave way grudgingly. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) settled off the pace and towards the inside, steadied briefly leaving
the far turn, worked outward in the final furlong and had belated interest. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE tracked the leader, moved up to take aim near the five
sixteenths, stayed on with strong pursuit past mid stretch, failed to kick on near the sixteenth marker, steadied when put in a bit tight and faded. APPLE
PICKER saved ground stalking the pace, advanced under coaxing leaving the three eighths, remained in touch past the three sixteenths, checked sharply
when put in tight near mid stretch and came up empty. NAVAL EMPIRE , four wide nearing the first turn, rated three wide outside foes through the
backstretch run, gained under asking past the five sixteenths, failed to go on leaving mid stretch and faltered through the final seventy yards.

Footnotes
DOUBLE CROWN stumbled at the break, was three wide the first turn, moved to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail around
the far turn, eased out at the head of the stretch, took command approaching the finish and edged clear. ALL THREES set the pace along the inner rail
under comfortable rating, opened up leaving the far turn, finished willingly but failed to with stand the winner. ARMANDO R lacked speed, swung four wide
leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. AIN'T DA BEER COLD stalked the pace down the backstretch, had a mild, three deep move mid way on the far
turn then gave way. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY prompted the pace outside ALL THREES and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DATAMAN rated forwardly while saving ground, took closer order under some coaxing nearing the lane, eased out for room leaving the three sixteenths
marker, closed determinedly under right handed asks, reeled in ARI GOLD with about a sixteenth remaining, switched over to his left lead when taking over
in deep stretch and was edging away at the wire. ARI GOLD was nudged clear soon after the break, angled in and secured the inside and set a rated pace
while shadowed by SIRTAKI (FR), responded when set down soon into the lane, held a clear advantage under a hearty ride past the furlong grounds, dug in
when confronted nearing the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly through the final yards. CIRCLING THE DRAIN broke a touch outward and brushed
with MENDELSSOHNS MARCH, moved up three wide to a tracking position early on, remained outside with aim leaving the far turn, ranged up under a ride
to loom near the five sixteenths, gave hard chase to mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on from there. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH , brushed at the start,
was taken to rate early on, raced off the rail into the far turn while getting a bit closer, circled four wide into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. ELDEST
SON saved ground off the pace, mild a mild rail advance in upper stretch then flattened out. ENGLISH PAINTER settled in the clear, edged up off the rail
into the far turn, pursued under a solid ride past the three eighths, failed to go on in upper stretch and faded. SIRTAKI (FR) shied inward as the leader was
crossing over in the opening sixteenth, was corrected and angled out a bit, pulled his way forward to prompt ARI GOLD from his outside, remained in touch
to the far turn, came under asking near the three eighths, could not keep pace approaching the stretch and retreated through the final three sixteenths. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CORA'S CHOICE went clear soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail and was under urging in the drive. SUPER MONEY , four deep on the
turn, rallied slightly. HEY RIRI lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. AZTEC BAY , in the two
path inside horses around the turn chased the winner to upper stretch and gave way. CELTIC WAR CRY , never a threat, was three deep leaving the turn
and bore in near the sixteenth pole. WAVERLEY was no factor. LILY MOR hugged the inner rail and weakened. DATS A SUPERSTAR , a forward factor on
the turn, checked in close quarters between horses approaching the stretch then fell back. An objection by the rider of DATS A SUPERSTAR against
SUPER MONEY for alleged interference leaving the turn was not allowed.
