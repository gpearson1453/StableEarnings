Footnotes
TWO ITEM SAVER prompted the pace three wide on the turn, made a three wide bid off the turn, then had a long drive with SOUPER EXPLOSIVE and
edged clear late to prove best under left handed crop urging. SOUPER EXPLOSIVE was rated early, made a four wide move off the turn and had a long
drive with the winner but could not go with that rival late, second best. P J'S RIDER set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the three sixteenths
and weakened the final furlong, held show award. APPLE EVER AFTER tracked the early pace on the inside and weakened. WAITTILMIDNITEHOUR was
off a step slow, then showed brief speed between rivals and weakened while three wide. PRINCESS DAMIAH was away alertly and saved ground and was
not a threat while racing green.

Footnotes
AIR RECRUIT rated early to be mid-pack off the pace, ranged up three wide turning for home and wore the pacesetter down in a determined drive.
SHARDS prompted the pace into the turn, assumed command at the top of the stretch, responded when challenged by the winner but was out-finished late
to be second best. CIGALE checked out of traffic when in tight shortly away from gate, dropped back when taken in hand, circled wide coming home and
finished well down the lane despite failing to switch leads. ST JAMES THE GREAT reserved off the pace, rallied in the lane splitting horse making a late
gain. MAINTAIN sped off to a clear lead and gave way turning for home. SHAM'S PRIDE flashed brief speed and flattened out. AGAPEE MOU was never a
threat while racing three wide. AURORA KUMA was never a factor trailing throughout.

Footnotes
MASSIF was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move nearing the upper stretch, took over off the turn and drew off smartly to prove much the best
while being kept to crop urging. SAISIR LE JOUR was settled early making way to the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide into the
lane and rallied well for the place award. KINGDOM FORCE was well placed early between rivals, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to gain a
short lead, then weakened in the stretch while saving the show award. UNCLE KENNY set the early pace on the inside, then moved off the inside nearing
the three eighths marker, then dropped back to the inside on the turn and weakened, bested rest. GRAND KINGDOM was reserved early, three wide by the
quarter pole and passed the tiring rivals. CHACHACHING was well placed on the inside, angled out off the turn and was empty. BIG TAP was settled back
on the inside and saved ground on the turn and had no rally. WHERE'S CHARLIE was taken back early to trail the field, swung out six wide leaving the turn
and was not a threat. WEEKEND CONCERTO tracked the pace three wide and was four wide by the quarter pole and tired. DISCO PREACHER prompted
the pace two to three wide and stopped.

FUTURE IS NOW pressed the pace from two wide to the top of the lane, took command and edged away down the stretch. RENNIE unhurried early to be
near the back of the field, made steady progress in the turn, angled out for the drive and closed well for the place. CHEATIN SONG rated in mid-field from
between horses and rallied down the lane showing good late interest. BAND LEADER dueled from the rail to the head of the stretch and weakened. CECIL
THE GREAT unhurried in the early going and showed a mild late bid. KAMIKAZE FOX went evenly failing to mount a rally. THEOLOVESAWINNER trailed
to mid-stretch and passed tired rivals in the stretch. LOTHARIO chased the pacesetters for a half mile and faded. GAMERUN stalked the pace from four
wide to the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
CARMELINA fractious at the load flipping before entering the gate, stalked the pace from three wide in the turn, engaged the front-runners in mid stretch
and was up in time in a determined drive. BEACHFRONT BREEZE sped to the lead from the fence under constant pressure, dug-in gamely when
challenged turning for home and yielded yards from the wire. REMEMBER ME pressed the pace through the turn, moved up to challenge for the lead in
upper stretch, took a short, brief lead down the lane and came up just short in a valiant effort. RAN OUT OF TRAINER tracked the leaders from a clear
pocket around the bend, angled out at the head of the lane and kept on in a good try. LOW MILEAGE shuffled at the start when pinched back and showed
good late interest rallying in the stretch. BUCKIN' GREAT raced near the rear of the field to upper stretch and passed tired horses in the lane. KELLAN
chased the leaders and flattened out in the stretch drive. TROUBLED DREAMS well placed along the fence early and gave way. MAINSTREAM SELLOUT
was never a factor.

GOING UP dueled for the lead two wide, made a bid leaving the turn to take over and dropped to the rail, then drew off to prove much the best, driving.
JUBAWITHATWIST was settled early, came four wide into the lane, split rivals and was bumped hard by the three sixteenths, then finished willingly to gain
the place award. KING KONTIE dueled for the lead on the inside, in tight on the turn, angled off the rail by the three sixteenths and weakened, lost place
late. TWO BRONZE STARS was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the inside on the turn but lacked a late rally. IRISH BANDIT chased the
pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and came in and bumped a rival by the three sixteenths and weakened. STREET TOUGH tracked the pace
three wide and then was bumped by the three sixteenths and weakened. SURFBOARD failed to menace. WILD WEST JUSTICE was settled early, came
six wide into the lane and was empty. There were two jockeys objections in the running of this race, KING KONTIE claimed foul against the winner for
interference around the five sixteenths, and IRISH BANDIT claimed foul against JUBAWITHATWIST for alleged interference at the three sixteenths, after
the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the objections were not allowed and the race was left as is.

Footnotes
GIRLS HOUSE taken in hand to settle at the back early under patient handling, circled three wide while rallying in the turn and was up late in the lane under
a drive. MOMENTOUS MISS prompted the pace through the turn from two wide, took the lead in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable to hold off
the winner. YOU'RE AVOIDING ME slow early to trail through the turn and mounted a good belated rally. MEETMEATTHEBEACH broke alertly to take the
lead on a well rated pace to the top of the lane and lacked a response when challenged. LUNA WEST tracked the pacesetter from the rail in striking
contention, weakened through the drive and was shut off late by a rival taking up sharply after the outcome had already been determined. LITA unhurried
near the rear, rallied in the lane, angled in causing rival to check in deep stretch and was not persevered with.
