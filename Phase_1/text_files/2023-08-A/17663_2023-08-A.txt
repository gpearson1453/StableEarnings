FINSTER vied for the lead while three wide, then steadied off the heels of rebid along the inside on the turn, came out four wide then dug in gamely in the
early stretch to draw off and prove much the best in the end. LEMON MERINGUE chased the pace from the inside in the middle of the pack, then urged
steadily on the turn to close well in the stretch and was up for the place position. MR. MELO was unhurried early then bid four wide on the turn, then closed
with eagerness down the stretch, drifting in and brushing rivals on the way to be up for the show prize. BOZAANO moved down the early furlongs while four
wide, then was gaining gamely on the turn to vie for the lead from the three path into the stretch then gave way in the end. MOON CHARGER settled in the
two path, then bid on the turn and was no threat. KOLTEN'S PRIDE chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then stopped and had no final bid in the
stretch. IT'S LAST CALL was sent to the early lead, then vied gamely with an inner rival into the turn, was met with another rival on the outside around the
quarter pole, was used up and weakened in late. DREW D'ORO was bumped at the start, then battled for the lead under a hard drive with an inner rival into
the turn, was hard used and tired in the stretch. JUST THE OAKS was bumped at the start and no factor.

LOUDER THAN WORDS stalked the pace down the backstretch while three wide, then moved up to duel with an inner rival throughout the far bend, kicked
clear around the quarter marker, then drew off in the stretch to prevail in the end. CAPELLA lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the early
backstretch, then dueled with an outer rival throughout the far turn then was outkicked heading into the stretch and was best for second place. ROC'S
PRINCESS settled along the inside throughout the first three quarters then bid on the far turn and into the stretch but needed more. BLUSHING BELLE was
well placed while two wide heading into the first turn, then prompted the pace down the early backstretch, settled back throughout the far turn, then bid at
the top of the stretch before flattening out in the end.
