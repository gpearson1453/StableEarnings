Footnotes
ROSIE'S ANGUS away in good order, allowed the leader to go early, chased that one up the backstretch, lost some position while covered up through the
second turn, lodged an inside bid while between horses when straightened for home, drew well clear under steady handling. SIKARA SIKARA lacked early
foot, began to move far turn, came five wide into the turn to lose considerable ground to the winner, could not get to that one while finishing up willingly to be
clear for the place. ATHENAIS broke back, raced in mid pack early, closer before a half, lodged a bid between horses second turn,held a narrow advantage
between calls in upper stretch, could not contain the top two late while narrowly saving the show. SANTANGELO back off the pace and the inside, lodged a
bid on the outside midway on the final bend, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, weakened, outfinished for the show. ELMO'S SECRET fell
back to trail, devoid of speed for six furlongs, improved position through some traffic with some belated interest through the lane, not a serious threat. FITTS
N STARTS settled off the pace, came up empty for the stretch run. KHOZY TAP broke back, quickly moved up to be well clear before a quarter, showed the
way the next half mile, began to weaken when headed late in the final turn. WORLD OF HURT broke back and remained there in failing to menace.
SARATOGA PASODOBLE began a steady retreat after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
NOSY BANKER chased the early leader out of the chute and up most of the backstretch, lodged an inside move to duel into and through the turn, shook off
the other speed nearing the furlong marker and drew clear under pressure. DRAFT CHOICE broke on top, clear out of the chute, continued to hold a
daylight advantage most of the backstretch, allowed the winner the inside into the turn, dueled with that one through the bend and into the stretch then could
not keep up, narrowly lasted for the second spot. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS in the second flight while racing off the inside, within striking distance into the
lane, could do little with the winner the final furlong, narrowly missed the place. WIN YA WIN in mid pack, raced three wide through the turn, did not have
enough late to challenge for the place. GUITAR TRIBUTE void of speed out in the strip, displayed a mild amount of late interest to better his position. IZZY'S
BABY BOY broke forwardly, raced within striking distance for a half while saving ground, had little for the drive. ARCTIC ROSE back off the pace toward the
inside, continued to save ground through the lane, failed to respond when called on for the drive. SCHNELL last to leave, void of speed, moved out, four
wide into the stretch, made little impact in the run to the wire. HOT LE ROY in the main body for a half, tired through the stretch. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN fell
back after the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HUSHED COURT ROOM broke in but forwardly, showed the way into the first turn, continued to show the way backstretch while rating, clear into the lane,
held several rivals safe late under firm handling to prevail. ANGEL OF VERDUN lacked speed off the inside, angled out a bit when advancing late in the final
turn, came five wide for the drive, finished well to be in time for the place while closing the gap on the winner. KATIE'S KARAT carried out five wide into the
first turn when forwardly placed, vied on the outside backstretch, four wide exiting the final turn, could not get to the winner in the run to the wire, caught late
for the second spot. CAVE CREEK carried out four wide into the first turn, remained forward, challenged between horses late in the final turn and into the
stretch, flattened out late. GOODNIGHTLOVING broke a step slow, lacked speed for six furlongs, continued to lag into the stretch, improved position with
some belated interest. SAINT KENNEDY settled back off the pace in mid pack, failed to muster a response in the drive. CASHEW broke in, lacked speed in
trailing early, six wide into the lane, never dangerous. GLANCE fell back after the start and failed to menace. EXACTA got out entering the first turn to carry
a couple of rivals outward, dueled off the inside the middle half mile, gave way in the drive.

MISS ST. CLAIRE broke well, raced with the pace along the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire while being
kept to task. CAROLINA JACY broke back, improved toward the inside into the lane, continued to advance and edged clear late for the runner up position,
no threat to the winner. BROADWAY STAR in mid pack while racing well out in the strip, came five wide into the stretch, up late to earn the show. BRIELLE
EVANGELINE moved up to contest the pace after the start, dueled late in the turn outside the winner then began to give way entering the stretch. LUCKY
BEAD LADY prompted the issue up front fur three furlongs and faltered in the turn. FAST OUT hopped at the start to be last away, remained back in failing
to menace. TOP CON in the second flight for a half, also backed up through the stretch. MAGIC GRAY was finished early.

Footnotes
PARROT HEAD chased the winner in heading up the second flight inside, continued to be that one's closest pursuer the middle half, shifted out a bit for the
drive, took aim on that same foe a furlong out, late bid, up final strides. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) broke on top, sprinted well clear past the wire the first time,
extended that advantage before a half, continued to lead by daylight with a furlong remaining, could not contain the winner, remained well clear for the
place. SILENT POWER last to leave, void of speed while saving ground, continued along the inside second turn, angled out when straightened for home,
rallied for the show while not a serious threat to the top pair. FIRST GLIMPSE four wide into the first turn when with the second flight, remained toward the
front the middle half mile, came up empty for the stretch run. INTIMIDATION in the second flight while between for six furlongs, weakened through the
stretch. PEACOCK KITTEN settled off the pace, continued in even fashion in lacking a closing response. PACIFICISLANDTIME remained always back in
failing to rally. ENTERTAINMENT moved up on the outside to be five wide early in the first turn, gave way early in the second bend, continued to weaken
stretch. SEVEN FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FOUR DICE off a step slow, lagged back in trailing for a half, angled five wide into the lane when beginning to advance, closed with good resolve to kick
down the leader in the waning strides. BUD WON broke alertly, set a pressured pace in the run up the backstretch, shook clear in the turn, maintained a
daylight advantage past the furlong marker, nailed late. WHISKEY RED forwardly placed behind the two leaders, remained within striking distance into the
lane, proved no match for the top two late while up for the show. GROSSE TETE IAN in the second fight while racing off the inside, lacked a closing
repsonse. NEPHI broke back, lacked speed, improved into the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. POPPA BEAR remained back while racing outside.
MECKES PRIORITY pressed the inside, chased the winner through the turn, gave way through the stretch. CALL ME FIREY steadily faded to finish well
back.
