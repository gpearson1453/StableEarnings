order in the final turn, dug in from along the rail to earn the place spot. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER set the pace from just off the rail, was overtaken, and was
edged out deep stretch. JOY IN GRACE chased outside, and came up empty in the drive. LIGHT FAST FEET tracked the pacesetter while three to four
wide, and lacked a closing response.

PERDITION steadied out of close quarter while inside, trailed through the far turn, rallied inside entering the stretch, shifted out to the two path, came under
a strong hand ride, and was edged clear. REDNECK REMARK vied inside, slipped to the front in the far turn, produced a mild rally when challenged by
PERDITION and conceded. HARD TO COME HOME vied between for the lead, chased the leader into the stretch, and flattened. SILVER SPUN settled five
wide and offered a late bid. YORKTOWN vied outside then crossed over quickly to the three path, and had nothing left for the drive. POKER TABLE
squeezed out in the early stages, and kept on near the back of the pack.

BORKAN hustled outside, moved up alongside COMMON KNOWLEDGE near the three-eighths marker to challenge the lead, secured the lead and won
going away. TUCKER TIME unhurried early, drove five wide in the final turn, closed steadily outside, and got up in time for the place spot. ESTIFRAAD
tracked the pacesetters early, rallied through stretch, and was outkicked for second. AWHITESPORTSCOAT lagged early, roused inside through the
stretch, and improved late. COMMON KNOWLEDGE zipped to the front, lacked the rally needed when joined by BORKAN and faded inside. SMARTY
RIVER PANTS chased three wide in the far turn, and was outrun. SHARP DRESSED BEAU reared then started bucking losing the rider, did not finish and
was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but made no change.

Footnotes
ESCROW STYLE sat in range while three wide, angled out to the five path nearing the stretch and won driving. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR vied into the
opening turn, set the pace from the two path, rallied four wide at the head of the lane, was outkicked and held for place. HIGH FLYIN TIGER vied inside,
dueled in the far turn, was unable to match strides into the stretch and finished third best. MAKE'N TRACKS trailed the field, and lodged a mild bid into the
stretch. TRICKY SPEEDSTER went four wide through the opening turn, tracked outside, then asked to quicken through the far turn, but failed to threaten in
drive. BETTIN ON BELLE fanned three wide into the opening turn, tracked four wide through the backstretch, and was done early.

Footnotes
H K RAPPER was outsprinted in the opening turn, waited for running room in the far turn, drove between a seam between foes, and edged clear. OUR
SUNSHINE raced from the back of the pack, drove five to six wide at the head of the lane, and closed with good energy getting up for place. COUNTY
WINDS contested the pace from off the rail, gained a slim advantage in the far turn, was brushed just after the three-sixteenth pole and was bested in the
final yards. ALBERTA BERBON fanned three wide in the opening turn, disputed the pace from the four path, and came up empty in the drive. SMART
DECISION hustled outside, raced wide through the backstretch, and had nothing left in the reserve late. BRYNN'S DREAM stalked the dueling pacesetters
from the four path, and lost interest with two furlongs remaining. CAROSWAY chased wide through the backstretch, and tired early.

HENRY'S GAMBLE stalked SHE LOVES WINNIN from the three path, pressed the issue near the quarter pole, overtook the lead and held under steady
handling. ADDYDIDIT sat in range while three wide, angled out to the four path at the head of the stretch and was gaining on the leader steadily but missed
after a game effort. SHE LOVES WINNIN secured the lead quickly under a snug hold, was joined by HENRY'S GAMBLE but lacked the rally needed and
weakened in the late stages. GO MAMA settled outside in the early stages, roused at the quarter pole, and rallied belatedly. SKY DESTINY unhurried early
then traveled the widest through the backstretch, and rallied late. SUDDENLY MISTY stalked from the rail, and faded inside. MIDNIGHT GARDEN offered
little. FLORIST reserved well off the pace, and lacked a bid.
