navigated the far turn from the three path and kept on in the lane. SILVERA raced in the two path early, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and improved position in the stretch. IMPULSUS raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the four path and gained ground mildly in the stretch but never truly threatened.
