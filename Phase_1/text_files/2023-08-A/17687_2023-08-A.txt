Footnotes
PINK ACE stalked the lone leader inside a rival to the turn, tipped out to the two path around the bend, challenged into the final furlong, got floated out a bit
by HOUSE OF MAGIC in the final sixteenth but dug in late to prove best. HOUSE OF MAGIC broke well and cleared quickly before steering over to the
inside, showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, met the challenge from PINK ACE in the drive, came out some in deep stretch and could not
hold off the winner. SONG OF SHADOWS bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival into the turn, came three wide into the drive,
lacked a bid but stayed on to secure the show. BLONDE BOMBSHELL chased from off the pace, went two wide into the turn, eased out and came four wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. QUICKLIKEABUNNY bumped with SONG OF SHADOWS in the the beginning, went three wide into the turn, moved out to
the four path for a bit before angling back in some on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DES DOIGTS stepped to the front and crossed over to the inside, gained pressure from a pair of rivals up the backstretch, shook free midway around the
bend, began to open up at the top of the lane under hand urging, asked left-handed midstretch and was ridden out to the wire. NESSO'S LASTHARRAH
chased four wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and bested the rest. SOUTHERN SLANG looked to show early speed from inside but was
impeded by DES DOIGTS crossing over, shifted out and went up to press the pace between rivals, failed to go on with the winner approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane two wide and churned on to regain the show. FACT OR FICTION broke a step slow then lost his path early when DES
DOIGTS steered into his path, regained stride and move up to prompt the pace three deep to the turn, chased the winner past the five-sixteenths pole,
came three wide into the lane and flattened out. ROJO PEQUENO was off slow to begin, climbed early at the back, saved ground through the turn and
failed to rally. VERITAS AEQUITAS was off slow and broke out, chased three deep at the rear to the turn, rounded the bend four then three wide and failed
to make an impact. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL dropped back off the pace, traveled three wide into the turn, moved into the two path while between rivals
and proved no menace.

MORNING ADDICTION bobbled a bit leaving the gate but recovered and cleared quickly before steering across to the fence, opened up around the
clubhouse turn, padded the lead in the middle stages, remained well clear into the stretch, was shown the stick midstretch, held a diminishing lead entering
the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed under hand urging. AGREETODISAGREE chased two wide then between rivals early, was closest in pursuit from
the three path into the lane, closed from outside in the final sixteenth and drew alongside the winner approaching the wire but was too late. BEACHGRASS
settled inside near the back, advanced up the backstretch and far turn, saved ground into the lane and showed a mild rally to earn the show honors. PENS
STREET traveled in mid-pack on the inside, went two wide into the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ROSES R BLUE broke a step
slow then brushed and steadied shortly after, traveled near the back early on, chased two wide leaving the far turn and failed to threaten. LUCY L chased
three wide around the clubhouse turn, three then four wide on the second bend and could not rally. JACRODRA'S DEVIL broke a step slow then brushed
with ROSES R BLUE before becoming rank early on, chased three wide around the first turn from off the pace, moved out on the backstretch, entered the
stretch five to six wide and came up empty. DALLAS ALICE tracked five then four deep around the clubhouse turn, rounded the far turn in the three path
and could not rally. B B GUN BULLSEYE raced four then three wide at the back early, saved ground through the second bend and failed to make an impact.
BLOSSOMING chased three wide early, started to weaken up the backstretch, trailed off the inside into the stretch, eased in the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
IMPEACHALOT forwardly placed early on, closest in pursuit two wide around the turn, drew alongside the leader and quickly took over in upper stretch,
kicked clear in the furlong grounds and remained unchallenged to the wire. STOLEN TREASURE broke a step slow and bumped at the start, chased out of
range early, drifted out to bump rival early on the turn, bumped inner rival late on the bend, rallied in the drive and earn the place honors. BURAQ'S
REFLECTION hit the gate and broke slow, chased from off the pace early, went two wide around the bend, tipped out entering the stretch, rallied and got up
for third. SPECIAL CLUB was off slow and bumped with STOLEN TREASURE at the start, saved ground around the bend, angled out then back inward in
the lane, closed well but was outkicked for the show honors. MR. CHIVAS chased off the inside, got bumped while three wide approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, chased three deep into the drive and lacked a rally. GANTRY took control from inside, cleared outer rivals, asked right-handed entering
the lane, offered no resistance in upper stretch and tired in the furlong grounds. HALO UNCLE broke a step slow and brushed with inner rival, got blocked
behind CUSSIN N FUSSIN up the backstretch, raced at the back three wide into the lane and failed to menace. CAPITAL OUTLAY became fractious in the
gate, raced up close early, started to weaken around the turn and faded out of contention. CUSSIN N FUSSIN broke a step slow and brushed at the start,
raced greenly up the backstretch, traveled two wide inside a rival at the back into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

POST FACTO stalked the top pair early, bid three deep into the far turn, dueled from outside past the five-sixteenths pole, carried a short lead into the final
furlong, cleared midstretch and was kept to task to the line. NAUVOO took control early and set the pace outside a rival, dueled into the far turn, vied
between rivals briefly then got crowded a bit and lost some ground, tipped out and chased the leaders into the lane, finished willingly in the final furlong but
had to settle for second best. THIRSTY PAPPY prompted the pace from inside early, dueled into the far turn and took over at the three-eighths pole, fought
inside a pair of rivals then dueled with POST FACTOR, relinquished the lead but fought back to the eighth pole, then flattened in deep stretch. WRONG
SPOT raced along the inside then a bit off the rail at the back on the clubhouse turn, swung out late on the far turn, summoned a mild response and
rounded out the superfecta. STAR PROSPECT traveled in the two path in mid-pack early on, drifted out and bumped rival at the three-eighths pole, asked
right-handed with a quarter mile left to run and could not rally. DOS VICIOS tucked inside off the pace, also asked near the quarter pole and failed to
respond. JERRY JEFF WALKER went four then three wide while at the back on the first turn, advanced inside rivals then a bit off the rail on the second
bend and proved no menace. TRUSTY RUSTY raced three wide in mid-pack, got bumped while four deep at the three-eighths pole, exited the far turn four
to five wide and failed to menace. GOLDENSPA settled in the three path, under a drive through the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and failed to make
an impact. CIRCLE THE MOON stalked three wide early, got knocked into outer rival at the three-eighths pole and weakened.

his head then got bumped and bobbled at the start, tracked two to three wide then tipped out in the lane and lacked a bid. RACHEL'S COACH stalked the
leader outside rivals into the turn, asked two to three wide into the stretch and faltered. SILENT SUNDAY broke in and bumped PLEASE FOCUS, trailed
into the turn, saved ground around the bend, steered out at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. MARKS HIP had to pause early when lacking room then
chased out of range up the backstretch, steadied off heels at the quarter pole, went two wide into the drive and lacked a rally. MENDEZ MILE sat off the
pace early on, rounded the bend two to three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHE'S BULLETPROOF broke a step slow, settled inside, gained while easing off the rail to the three path around the turn, moved out a bit further at the top
of the stretch, launched a bid in the furlong grounds and dug in to edge DANZING CAT in the closing moments. DANZING CAT forwardly placed four wide
early, vied three to four wide into the lane, cleared in upper stretch, met the challenge from outer pair but was edged by the winner. EVERLYS GIRL broke a
step slow from outside, raced in range five wide into the turn, moved into the four path around the bend, continued wide into the drive, bid three deep past
the eighth pole but was outkicked by the top pair. FRIED ASPARAGUS chased four to five wide into the lane and kept on while failing to threaten.
FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY moved in some stalking the pace early, went up to press the pace from between foes on the backstretch, had to check early on
the turn, steered to the inside and weakened. TROUBLE N PARADISE sped to the front the set the pace outside rivals, dueled into and around the bend,
lost command leaving the turn and weakened down the lane. STAY AND SCAM came away a bit awkwardly, unhurried after then went up to challenge from
inside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, then faded out of contention. ROUBAIX brushed with inner rival then had his path taken shortly after,
trailed four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
DOMINANT SOUL stalked the leader int the two path, took aim entering the stretch, drew alongside the leader outside the eighth pole, took over in
midstretch, got brushed late by DERECHO DANDY and held that rival at bay. DERECHO DANDY tracked two wide early, spun three wide into the lane, bid
three deep with a furlong remaining, drifted in and brushed DOMINANT SOUL in the final sixteenth and got denied. LIGHT FURY broke inward and was
quickly corrected, settled inside then moved into the two path, rounded the far turn two then three wide, rallied and gained the show. CANE CREEK ROAD
sped clear and moved inside, set all the pace to the top of the lane, resisted to midstretch, then relinquished the lead and flattened to fourth. CHASIN
MUNNY chased three deep off the pace through both turns and needed to find more in the stretch run. OUR SILVER OAK was off a bit slow to begin, trailed
two wide early then moved inside, tipped out on the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, lacked room and had to check midstretch, tried to rally
again but lacked room in deep stretch and was ridden out to the wire. DANIEL SUN broke a step slow, raced between rivals off the pace early, looked to
gain ground but got boxed in at the midway point, continued in the two path on the far turn, angled inward in the lane and lacked a rally. NEW YORK
DREAMS (GB) stalked from inside, cut the corner into the lane and weakened. MONGOLIAN WIND settled along the rail inside a pair of rivals, got crowded
near the three-eighths pole, dropped back to last on the far turn and came up empty.
