Footnotes
DORITA'S LEMON stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid in between rivals and closed best to prevail.
MY SWEET MARY tracked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid four wide and finished a game second. TIZ A
MASTER tracked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, launched bold bid on the rail and outkicked in deep
stretch. TRUTH PREVAILS away well, asked for speed early, had to settle off the pace in between rivals, entering the turn had to steady off heels,
continued two wide on the turn, bid and finished willingly in the five path. NICE AND TRUE hustled clear, continued clear into the turn, entered lane clear,
kept on gamely until faltering in the final sixteenth. LIBERTY LIBERTY off slow, settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn,
launched a brief bid along the rail in the lane before fading. BLUE BUTTERFLY hopped and came away slowly, settled off the pace three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and lacked finish.
