Footnotes
GET SPOOLED broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled, was bumped hard early and forced into another foe then checked, muscled his way to
the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, swapped back to his inside lead when put to a right-handed crop at the furlong
marker, switched back to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole then was put to a left-handed crop and held sway under strong urging. DANCING
MISCHIEF came away from the gate awkwardly, was bumped and forced into another foe early then checked, tugged rankly on the bit into the first turn then
checked again in the two path early on that bend, shifted to the three path shortly thereafter, settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the far
turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, gained to loom a threat in the final furlong, drifted in while on his inside lead late and missed but was able to get the
place. FROZEN FOUR leaned inward at the start, moved in while taken under a tight hold early, was reserved towards the rear in the two path, came under
urging on the far turn, dropped to the rail and cut the corner into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead
late and finished with good courage for the show. B D SAINTS was bumped hard against the rail early then checked, became extremely rank and threw his
head high in the air nearing the first turn under steadying restraint, checked again along the rail early on that bend, was rated on the inside, shifted three
wide at the quarter-pole, was carried in then bumped with a rival near the three-sixteenths, clipped heels and checked yet again at that point, altered out for
room in the final furlong, bobbled while lugging in some late and lost all chance in a horrific trip. UNAUDITED moved in early, traveled four then three wide
on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths
and bothered multiple foes, had B D SAINTS clip his heels at that point, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SPECIALAGENTJONSON drifted in
significantly after the start then bumped with a foe and bothered several opponents, was pulled off that skirmish to the outside by the rider, went three then
two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was bumped
near the three-sixteenths then checked and weakened. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE broke out then was corrected by the rider, went three then four wide on the
first turn, settled outside without cover, tucked in near the eleven-sixteenths then came back out, lugged out some while moving from the three path to the
five path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SCOOP THE POT angled in towards the rear early, settled on the inside, was roused on the far
turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. DILLON was bumped at the start and in a bit tight while last away, rounded the first turn in
the two path, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the final turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
INVISIBLE WAR hustled from the gate, raced along the inside through the first turn before taking to the four path down the backstretch while lightly coaxed
along, advanced on the top pair five and a half furlongs out, chased just off the pace four wide through the far turn, went five wide into upper stretch, rallied
to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command nearing the sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. UNION LIGHTS coaxed
from the start, prompted the pace just off the inside through the first turn and then from the three path thereafter, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes through to near the sixteenth marker, then got shaken off by the top one while
engaged head to head to the finish with the former leader and kept on to secure the place honors in the final jumps. CUMBERLAND BLUES hustled from
the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from UNION LIGHTS to the outside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, then kept on head to head to the
finish but was ultimately bested at the end for the place honors. BERT BERT BERT chased just off the inside coming under prolonged coaxing at the half
mile pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired. CENTRAL PRIDE three then two wide through the first turn, chased four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far turn losing ground and growing detached at the tail of the field, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home through to the finish.

Footnotes
SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN saved ground near the rear of the field, steadily advanced along the rail, was unable to go up the inside and tipped out to be two
then three wide just inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and collared the leg
weary leader seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. ITS COLD IN DEHERE five wide through the initial dog legged turn,
chased five wide down the backstretch until tucked three wide at the half mile pole nudging R TENDERONI to the two path, advanced through the far turn to
issue a challenge and take command inside the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug
in under lone growing threat to the outside and grew leg weary and was caught in the final seventy yards to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place
honors. RUN DEVIL established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from TRADE SECRET to the outside, tucked
inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front inside the five-sixteenths with the rider peeking back behind him when
a pair of rivals threatened outside, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the show honors. TRADE SECRET broke out at the
start bumping R TENDERONI, prompted the pace of RUN DEVIL from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two
to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. GREATEST LOVE chased three wide early on before tipping four to five wide down the backstretch, came
under coaxing four to five wide three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. R TENDERONI got bumped at the start by
TRADE SECRET, who broke outwards, chased four wide until nudged to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. THISLADYIS THE LAW chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the finish.

LET'S GO BIG BLUE came away in good order, was placed under a snug hold while towards the front on the opening straightaway, set a joint pace on the
inside of a foe while along the rail, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, fought under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a
right-handed crop at the furlong marker, continued to battle inside of the runner-up, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and gamely
prevailed under strong urging. GEM MINT TEN set a joint pace on the outside of a foe while in the two path, was given his cue on the final turn, dueled
outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. MR. KRINGLE bumped with a rival at the start, was reserved on the inside, shifted
three wide late on the far turn, swung five wide at the quarter-pole, was driven between foes in upper stretch and earned the show while no threat to the top
two. THETHRILLOFVICTORY became keen when taken under restraint early, pulled hard while eager and inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated
off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the path and lacked the needed kick. TIMBUKTU
was off a step slow and last to commence, went two then three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside but with some cover, went three then four
wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ONE HEADLIGHT rounded the first turn in the three path, was rated
just off the pace, came under urging while between foes in the two path on the far turn, bumped with a rival and was steadied briefly while three wide into
the stretch and also lacked the needed response. BLAME IT ON DADDY broke in and bumped with a foe, traveled three then four wide on the first turn,
settled at the rear, was roused two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rallly. EDDIE THE GREAT was hustled from
the gate, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside without cover, chased three wide on the far turn, bumped with a foe into the
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. NO REGARD traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused
between foes in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond.

GALA BRAND saved ground near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled and swung four wide into upper stretch briefly paused, got roused
straightened away at the three-sixteenths, tipped out a path from in behind HIDDEN CLASS, then got carried out two paths by that rival coming out before
tipping further out to be eight or nine paths off the inside nearing the sixteenth marker while offering up a good finish to overhaul the leg weary leader
seventy yards from home, then edged away to the end kept to task. HIDDEN CLASS got steadied at the start when LESLIE'S LOOT broke inwards and
bumped SHORESY, chased just off the inside from mid pack coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, drifted out
two paths before being corrected and closed well to get up for the place honors in the final jumps to the wire. LESLIE'S LOOT broke in at the start forcing
HIDDEN CLASS to steady and brushing with SHORESY after that rival was bumped by HIDDEN CLASS, spurted away on the pace just off the inside, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole but under growing threat
to the outside, grew leg weary a sixteenth out and was overhauled by the top one seventy yards from the finish, then got caught by the runner up in the final
jumps while able to salvage the show honors. DESTINY STAR got brushed at the start by SHORESY due to pressure outside from LESLIE'S LOOT, chased
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. KHOZY COLBY three wide in pursuit isolated between the spurting away leader and the rest of the field in behind, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish and was outfinished in the late stages. TEMPTING
LADY brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled seven to eight wide for home and improved
position to the finish. GOATS ON A TREE struck the off side stall at the start, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two
path through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and made some ground while making no positional headway. MO TWILIGHT coaxed from the
gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BAYTOWN KITTY
CAT coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SHORESY
got bumped askew at the start by HIDDEN CLASS who came inwards and steadied due to pressure from LESLIE'S LOOT breaking inwards, chased along
the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.

asked nearing the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch then kicked clear, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up while
much the best. SECURITY CODE broke a bit awkwardly, was taken under rtght restraint early then rated off the pace, went three wide while asked on the
turn, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. RIBOT'S VALENTINE was hustled from the gate, showed the way under pressure to her
outside, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was asked under threat on that bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch and weakened
but held the show. TEMPERMENTAL was reserved off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, was let out three wide on the turn then driven five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. OK HONEY was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, moved closer near the
nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. DIVA BANKER bumped with a rival at the start, settled off
the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the two path through the turn and tired. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE was hustled from the gate then
ridden along on the outside, went five then six wide on the turn and failed to respond. HAPPY SOPHIA was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back
late on the backstretch, came up empty while four then five wide on the turn and faltered.

BOLD ENDEAVOR chased four then three wide advancing on the top pair three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and swung
four to five wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and inched away under a drive to prevail. GUNTOWN chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, angled out and ran on in tandem with MYSTIC NIGHT and just
bested that rival for the place honors. MYSTIC NIGHT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the aforementioned foe offering up a mild bid through to the finish but was ultimately bested for the place honors
while along for the show. RUGGS showed the way in hand from the three path, tucked to the two path and vied between foes through the far turn getting
headed for command with five-sixteenths to go, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. GALT brushed the near side
stall at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. PIPELINE
prompted the pace of RUGGS from the inside in the two path, tucked inside into the turn and advanced to vie taking command narrowly over a pair
five-sixteenths from home, spun along the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened.

approaching the sixteenth-pole and got up late to prevail. WAR LIKE GODDESS became extremely rank along the rail on the opening bend, threw her head
high in the air under steadying restraint, remained very rank for the opening half-mile pole, was rated under a vigorous hold along the rail on the second
turn, raced off the inside down the backstretch, steadied off heels at the three-eighths while dropping back to the rail, moved back to the two path outside
the quarter-pole, was let out into the stretch, made a bid outside of the leader at the three-sixteenths, gained a short lead inside the furlong marker, led into
the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. AMAZING GRACE (GER) was asked some leaving the gate, settled on the inside through the
first two turns, remained towards the back down the backstretch, bumped with a foe in the two path while between horses at the three-eighths and checked,
lost lots of ground on the leaders in the process, was roused in the two path on the final turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly to just
get the show. SOPRAN BASILEA (IRE) was reserved in the two path while given cover, was asked four wide on the final turn, chased under a drive in the
stretch and just missed the show then suffered an injury on the gallop-out and was euthanized on the course. VERGARA was taken under a tight hold early,
stalked outside in the three path through the first two turns, took the lead outside the five-eighths pole, dropped in leaving the backstretch, vied inside on the
final turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead to the runner-up inside the furlong marker and weakened
then was just caught for the superfecta. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, moved out midway down the backstretch,
was asked with a half-mile to run, chased two then three wide on the third turn, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and tired. ELEGANT
TASTE moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was headed outside the five-eighths, dropped back late on the
backstretch, bumped with a foe at the three-eighths pole and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

P MONEY knocked heads with BANKINGONACHANCE from the two path before shaking off that rival to establish sole command near the
seven-sixteenths, showed the way through the turn tucked to the inside and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat a furlong out, repelled that challenge to edge clear to the finish kept busy to the end. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to challenge a furlong out, then
got rebuffed by the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. WHISKEY AND WINE broke last when getting away to a hesitant start and
conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside patiently handled until let out angled three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to
secure the show honors. BANKINGONACHANCE dueled inside of P MONEY early on before easing off near the seven-sixteenths to chase along the inside
through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SPOOFY stumbled after
the start and conceded three lengths to the front, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late going. ACADEMY CHOICE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch, weakened. SINALOA coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path into the turn, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. THE GOLDEN ONE got bumped after the start by SPOOFY when that foe
recovered from a stumble and was forced to take hold as SINALOA took over the lane in front, conceded four to five lengths to the leader before settling into
to stride, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and weakened.
