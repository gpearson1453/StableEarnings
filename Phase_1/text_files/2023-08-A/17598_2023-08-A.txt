Footnotes
GLENHOLME was taken back to trail the field into the first turn, was on hold while eager to go on when straightened out to the backstretch, rated kindly four
deep outside at the half, offered a bold move five wide at the three furlong pole and wore down multiple rivals down the stretch and was edging away for the
win at the finish. MIGHTY PELE broke out but was quickly corrected at the start, prompted outside on the first turn, continued to hound the frontrunner down
the backstretch, had a narrow advantage two wide with three furlongs to go, bid three wide with others turning for home, finished gamely through the stretch
on the wrong lead, was no match for the winner late but held for the place share at the end. MANETKA was nestled behind the front pair in the beginning,
tracked on the fence down the backside watching the leaders, was on hold inside when the field bunched up at the three furlong marker, shifted outside for
run at the quarter pole, rallied six wide at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly to capture third money nearing the wire. MOMENT OF ZEN was in a
good position tracking the top pair early, kept a close eye on the contesting duo at the half, engaged for the front three wide in a four horse battle at the five
sixteenths marker, was in with a shot four wide straightening out for the drive and faded in the final sixteenth. OPEECHEE took this field into the first turn
inside, had a slim advantage on the rail down the backstretch, was headed outside by a few rivals midpoint on the far turn, hustled to keep pace at the
quarter marker, was in the thick of things at the top of the lane but yielded in the last sixteenth of a mile. DOC FISHMAN was in tight between rivals in the
three path into the first turn, travelled in midpack three deep down the backside, could not quicken with others three eighths from the wire and could not be a
factor running to the wire. RIVER OF BABYLON was pushed out five wide entering the first turn, could see the field down the back straight, put in a mild run
inside midway on the far turn and could not get involved running on the fence through the stretch. PASSIONPLATE settled near the rear on the rail, made
little impact close to the back of the pack down the backstretch, was coaxed for more to keep up with runners at the three furlong marker, offered no
response and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SOCIETY'S THUNDER bobbled at the start, recovered to lead this field down the backside, set the fractions comfortably through the turn with a narrow
lead, was nudged on for more on the fence at the three sixteenths pole, quickly opened up and cruised home unchallenged in the final eighth. TREBUCHET
settled near the rear three deep early, started to pick up runners three furlongs from the wire, angled out in the five path turning for home and closed in
strongly for second place besting the rest comfortably at the finish. STREET SERENADE was void off speed early trailing down the backside, began to
lengthen stride at the three furlong pole, swung out widest in the seven path for the drive and was full of run outside in the final furlong to close in and
capture third at the finish line. HARPER CITY stalked in midfield down the backstretch, was roused outside three furlongs from the finish, angled out seven
wide for the drive gaining on foes, drifted in at the three sixteenths pole and was one paced to the wire settling for a minor role in the end. BARTICA stalked
near the rear four deep down the backstretch, lost path when near the back of the field trying to offer a run six wide at the three sixteenth pole between
runners and finished up passing tiring foes in the final furlong. YORKVILLE pressed the winner outside on the turn, was asked left handed but could not get
by the winner at the quarter pole and stalled on the fence at the furlong marker. DISCOVERY CHART settled near the back on the rail in the beginning, took
some awkward steps on the fence losing action at the seven sixteenths marker and could not regroup to pose a threat in the stretch drive. SECRET
CAMELOT prompted on the rail early on, was shuffled back on the fence throughout the turn, shifted five wide off tiring rivals in mid stretch and levelled off
at the furlong pole. WONT FORGET YOU tracked in the two path in the beginning, continued to watch the top pair running on the rail throughout the turn
and could not find more at the top of the lane and gave way on the fence in mid stretch. FOUR K FORCE was off slow to begin, tugged the rider four deep
outside down the back straight to track the top pair through the turn the turn and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LUV TO WIN chased the frontrunner two wide between in the early stages, was urged at the quarter pole to go after the pace setter, pounced to the lead
with three sixteenths to go and won going away in deep stretch. BOXER BRIEF was asked early on the rail to get better position on the turn, kept pace with
the leaders on the fence midway on the turn, shifted out three wide straightening out for the drive and closed in late to win the photo for place. ALLEN
DIGGS dictated the pace from the onset, continued up front on the turn, was collared by the winner at the top of the lane and faded in deep stretch chasing
the winner losing second at the wire. STYLISH GENT travelled three deep close to the back of the field down the backside, started to commence a run three
wide on the turn keep up with others, shift out six wide turning for home and showed late interest to win the battle for the minors at the finish. HIGHLAND
SOCIETY stalked near the back of the pack four deep, tried to offer a rally four wide on the turn, angled out in the seven path for the stretch run and finished
evenly to the wire. SOUPER RIVER travelled in midpack two off the fence at the half, was ridden with rivals on either side trying to keep pace with others on
the turn, shifted in to the rail for the drive but could not reach contention through the lane. SUGAR IS GOLDEN prompted three wide in the beginning, could
not match strides with the top pair when quickening at the quarter marker and weakened between rivals in the final furlong. SWATH was away poorly to
begin, trailed the field five deep down the backside, could not make any headway five wide outside rivals on the turn and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO got away well, settled just off the leading pair and inside foes but removed from the rail, tracked those leaders into the turn, began to edge
forward while moving out a tad, bid four wide turning for home taking the lead in upper stretch, was clear into mid-stretch, drifted out late and just held from
outside challengers. LAPOCHKA settled off the pace, advanced on the turn racing off the inside, came to the top of the stretch four wide, moved out in
upper stretch, rallied widest and was gaining but missed. HONEY WON'T shifted in racing mid-pack saving ground near the rail through the turn, came out a
bit turning for home, angled out further for room, rallied inside LAPOCHKA, bid between that one and the winner in late stretch then steadied as the latter
drifted out. DECIMATOR settled toward the back racing off the inside, weaved through traffic in the stretch near but off the inside to be best of the rest.
READY HERO was bumped sideways at the start, settled at the back near but off the rail, shifted out seven wide through upper stretch, ran on with mild late
interest. RACE FOR PINKS raced outside at the back, went four to five wide on the turn, kicked on evenly. MARTEN RIVER moved forward to set the pace
racing inside, was hounded by an outside foe, had no extra late. CHANCEL broke just a half-step slowly, was coaxed forward stalking between runners in
the second flight, weakened in the stretch. BIG INVESTMENT broke outwardly, pressed the pace two to three wide, weakened. STRIKING MOON bumped
a rival hard at the start, raced inside about mid-pack, had no rally. TAKE A CHANCE stalked from outside the second flight three to four wide, came up
empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF HONEY WON'T AGAINST HALLIE'S HERO ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
C R HOT SHOT got away well, settled off the leading pair tracking in behind just off the fence, advanced leaving the backstretch having moved out a bit, bid
three wide and took a narrow lead by the five-sixteenths, put away the inside rival by mid-stretch but faced an outside threat, dug in to hold that rival at bay.
AIR FORCE RESERVE settled at the rear racing well off the inside in the three to four path, advanced outside foes four then five wide on the far turn,
engaged the leader by mid-stretch while drifting in a bit, couldn't get past that one while appearing to hang. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER broke a half-step
slowly and in just a bit tight, raced outside toward the rear four wide early, moved up early in the backstretch, was within range three to four deep heading
into the far turn, kept on evenly, got up for show honors. SUNYANI was urged forward from the break, prompted the pace two to three wide, led about the
seven-sixteenths, was overtaken at the five-sixteenths, fought on well but ultimately needed more. NGABE settled at the back just off the fence, was ridden
along on the far turn moving out from three to five wide, was one-paced in the lane. GOOD SKIP INDEED shifted in saving ground racing inside, advanced
up the rail midway through the backstretch, was held up in behind the leaders lacking room, continued to save ground on the far turn, lacked any late kick in
the lane. BLASITO raced outside three to four wide throughout, failed to rally. HAPPY FELLA shifted in early, ran up behind a tiring foe about the
five-sixteenths, saved ground but failed to menace. KINZHAL moved forward under mild early coaxing, set a pressured pace inside, dropped back from the
seven-sixtenths and faded.

Footnotes
SECRET GIZMO made an early move for position on the fence entering the turn, took command inside midway on the turn, spurted clear on the rail at the
eighth pole and had enough left late to hold safe at the wire. GOLDEN SUZIE was pinched back at the break to be near the rear down the backside, was
looking for running room behind foes through the turn, found a clear seam in the two path at the top of the stretch and came with a late rush inside to win the
place photo at the finish. SWEEPING PASSION had a good spot tracking the top four outside at the half mile marker, rallied four wide at the three furlong
pole, loomed the threat five wide at the top of the lane but needed more late to threaten for the win but held for show between runners at the wire. SMILES
FOR DAVID could see the field at the half, started to pick up horses five wide three furlongs from the finish, swung out widest in the six path turning for
home and finished up willingly to be involved in the photo for the place share at the wire. SNOW LAKE was bumped shortly after the start, took closer order
into the turn, had to wait behind rivals with five sixteenths to go, angled out in the five path for the run to the wire and was one paced in deep stretch passing
tiring foes. CRIMSON NIGHTS broke out at the start, had a good position watching the contesting foursome at the half, offered a mild turn of foot on the turn
to be in range if good enough at the top of the lane and stalled between horses in mid stretch. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE broke in at the start but lead the field
in the early going, tracked three wide outside on the turn, was in the hunt in the three path at the top of the lane, continued on the wrong lead through the
stretch, was steadied at the seventy yard marker between runners and faded. DELAWANA PRINCESS pressed in the two path down the backside, was
steadied in tight quarters inside the seven sixteenths pole, could not regroup inside through the turn and stopped on the fence turning for home. KRYPTO
GAINS had a narrow lead down the backstretch, was headed inside by the winner midpoint on the turn, could not find more between runners at the quarter
pole and backed away in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TIDAL FORCES had a perfect tracking trip all by himself watching the contesting twosome down the back straight, commenced reeling in the battling
frontrunners midway on the turn, took command at the top of the lane and stubbornly dug in the entire stretch to prevail in a hard fought victory. POINT TO
THE STARS settled in the middle of the pack two wide between horse early on, took closer order to the leaders outside with three furlongs remaining, posed
the threat outside at the quarter marker and determinedly dueled the length of the stretch just coming up short in a tough loss at the wire. LIL BIT GANGSTA
co-trailed outside fellow rival down the backside, started to pick up runners outside midturn, shifted out in the seven path turning for home, shifted inwards in
mid stretch finding running room and closed in to be a non threatening third at the end. ENCHANT ME co-trailed on the inside in the beginning, shifted
outside at the three furlong marker, swung out eight wide for the drive to the line and showed late energy to be all alone for the minors at the wire. PRINCE
OF AYRSHIRE stalked on the rail in midfield, was asked left handed to keep up with others at the three eighths marker, shifted out to the five path to be in
with a shot for a smaller share but had little to show down the lane. JUST START ME UP dueled for the lead inside down the backside, began to edge away
from the early pace rival at the three furlong marker, was swallowed up by the field at the top of the stretch and was empty at the furlong marker. OCTOBER
FROST travelled in midpack three deep down the back straight, could see the field at the top of the lane running inside and could not find another gear
through the stretch to get involved at the finish. COPINSAY pressed the pace outside down the backside, continued to hound the frontrunner on the turn,
started to give way with three furlongs to go and stopped in upper stretch.

GIZMO'S B F F settled mid-pack outside, moved out from two to four wide on the turn and a bit wider for the drive beginning to advance on the leaders,
struck the front a sixteenth out and edged past. FOXY LADY shifted in to save ground and advance inside a rival late on the turn, was guided out at the top
of the stretch, struck the lead at that juncture, drifted out a bit late, was outfinished. CLEOMENES settled toward the rear, saved ground inside on the turn,
came out a bit at the top of the stretch, secured show honors while no threat to the top pair. LOADED QUESTION lacked early speed despite some
encouragement racing outside foes at the back, fanned seven wide into upper stretch while advancing, evened out late. GABBY SQUARED was a bit slow
into stride, brought up the rear inside, had decent late stride but with far too much to do. ISHIYAYA exchanged a very light brush at the start, tracked in
behind the leaders from just off the rail, went two then three wide on the turn, faltered in the lane. TAKOTA exchanged a light brush at the start, went to the
front to set the pace, faced outside pressure, edged just clear about the quarter pole, was soon tackled by other foes, faltered and faded.
HALFINTHEWRAPPER pressed from outside three to four wide into the turn, ridden along past the five-sixteenths, came up empty. HATMAKER HOLIDAY
pressed from between runners, came up empty.

Footnotes
JAZZ HANDS forced the issue inside down the backstretch, narrow dictated the pace on the turn, began to inch away between rivals in mid stretch and was
pulling away nearing the wire for a gritty front end performance. RED RIVER REBEL had a nice trip on the rail keeping close tabs on the contesting pair
down the backside, advanced smartly on the fence three eighths from the wire, looked to be the one to fear on the rail straightening out for the drive but
could not find more in deep stretch to overtake the winner and had to settle for second best. READY FOR A FIGHT was near the rear all alone at the half,
started to pass runners on the fence three furlongs from the prize, found more in the final furlong and closed in the capture a clear third at the finish line.
ARMS was void of early speed to stalk near the back in the early stages, angled out six for the stretch drive gaining momentum, shifted inwards to the rail in
mid stretch and finished up willingly for a small share at the wire. EMICRACK (CHI) tracked in the second flight three deep outside, could not close the gap
on the frontrunners on the the turn and finished up only evenly in the final furlong. COTTON took the lead down the backside, was relegated to hound the
pace outside throughout the turn, rebid three wide turning for home, gave way to the leaders at the three sixteenths marker and tired in deep stretch.
ROMANTIC GAMBLE trailed the field on the rail in the early going, still could see the field in the five path at the quarter pole and could not be a player
through the stretch. HAPPYMAC watched the pair of frontrunners engage down the backside, was roused at the three furlong pole to keep un with runners,
offered little response and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
INFINITE PASSION rated well in hand behind the front group down the back straight, was on hold on the fence behind runners waiting to pounce through
the turn, found clear running room in lane five at the top of the stretch and found her best stride at the eighth pole closing strongly to get up in time for the
victory. SPEEDY BUBBLES prompted the pace three deep down the back straight, took command with five sixteenths to go, opened up on the field at the
top of the lane but could not find another gear late and was caught nearing the wire. TELLTALE was bumped outside at the start, tracked three deep down
the backstretch, was in the hunt three wide straightening out for the drive and determinedly finished up between foes to just miss capturing second money at
the wire. MISS BIKINI travelled three deep near the front pack down the backstretch, was urged three wide in the mix of things near the lead on the turn,
was in contention in the four path turning for home, faded some late between rivals but held for a small share crossing the line. FANCY PHYLLIS settled on
the rail near the back at the half mile marker, advanced smartly on the fence throughout the turn, angled seven wide to be in with a chance for a small share
turning for home and finished evenly in the final furlong. WANT TO GO DANCING chased on the rail at the half, was in tight behind the top pair with runners
on either side midpoint on the turn, found a clear path to run two wide turning for home but could not produce a finish to be in the mix at the end. LULU'S
LULLABY was bumped inside on the break, offered a good turn of foot three wide around runners on the turn, shifted out in the six path for the drive but
stalled in the final eighth. GUNNAWIN leapt at the start spotting rivals many lengths leaving the gate, finally caught up to runners midway on the turn inside,
swung out six wide for the stretch drive, shifted inwards to the rail in the final sixteenth but could not recover from the poor start to be a presence at the
finish. SLOANS SKY stalked close to the back at the half, could no make up any ground on others through the turn and passed a straggler in the stretch.
MISS BRIANNA took this field down the backstretch on a slim lead, was collared outside three eighths from the finish, was ridden for more trying to keep
position and backed away on the fence in upper stretch. SAKE AND SUSHI was away a bit slow to begin, stalked near the rear down the backside, offered
a mild brief spurt three wide around horses three furlongs from home and could not find anymore to be involved in the stretch run.
