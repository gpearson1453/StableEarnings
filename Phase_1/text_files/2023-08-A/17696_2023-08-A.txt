Footnotes
LIKE MOULIN ROUGE was two wide on the backstretch and moved up to assumed command, drew off while bearing out on the turn, drifted out to the
middle of the track in the stretch and was kept to task in the end. FOUR HUNDRED PROOF AA showed good early speed then was taken in hand to set the
pace, was over taken then chased the winner from the inside on the turn, stayed inside then failed to respond in the stretch but was second best. UPTOWN
RINGOFFIRE was unhurried early then raced three wide in the stretch and was no threat. UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA raced three wide on the backstretch
then failed to menace in the stretch. RB HASHTAG stumbled badly at the start to his knees and unseated his jockey then ran off the course back to the barn
area. The steward's inquiry was held concerning the start. After reviewing the film's, no action was taken. This race was hand timed.
