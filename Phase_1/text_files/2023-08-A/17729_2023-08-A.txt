Footnotes
FREE AND HUMBLE stalked the pace along the rail inside a rival early, saved ground while closest in pursuit on the far turn, asked right-handed nearing
the stretch, tipped out in the lane, drew alongside the runner-up midstretch, took over with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. HAVANA ANGEL (IRE)
cleared early and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged by FREE AND HUMBLE in the furlong grounds and could not match that rival in
deep stretch. LUMINIFEROUS away quickly from outside, took a stalking position in the two path, stayed in range through the far turn while still two wide,
could not produce a bid in the stretch run but churned on for a clear third. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER unhurried in the beginning, traveled two wide then
moved over to the rail around the clubhouse turn, angled three wide on the second bend and passed tired rivals. SHERLYN GO GO settled off the pace and
steered to the fence, took closer order in the middle stages, coaxed along through the far turn but weakened in the lane. IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE)
tracked two wide then outside a rival out of range, continued in the two path through the second bend and also weakened.

Footnotes
MASTERING pressed the pace from outside early, took over past the five-sixteenths pole, put away inner rival late on the far turn and held safely under
urging. REDLINE stalked the leaders along the rail inside a pair of rivals, tipped two wide past the quarter pole, finished willingly down the lane and edged
CYBERVIKING for second. CYBERVIKING stalked outside a pair of rivals early, stayed three wide through the far turn, chased willingly through the final
furlong and got outkicked for second. MOTOWN MUSIC settled inside, trailed into the far turn, asked right-handed at the five-sixteenths pole continuing to
save ground and kept on through the drive to earn a minor share. DIRECT LINE took control from inside and set the pace with MASTERING alongside, lost
command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner into the lane and weakened. BRAZENLY broke a step slow then bumped with inner rival and
steadied shortly after, chased two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, moved out four wide on the backstretch, took the second turn three wide and
lacked a rally. KINGMEISTER broke a step slow and bumped shortly after the start, stalked between foes to the five-sixteenths pole, chased four wide into
the lane and came up empty. TAISHAN raced in the four path at the back on the first turn, remained wide through the far turn, entered the stretch six wide
and never got involved.

GENTLE (GB) was off slow to begin spotting the field a few lengths, moved inside and became rank and began to pull entering the stretch for the first time,
went between rivals approaching the clubhouse turn, continued to fight the rider around the bend and early backstretch, was finally turned loose and rushed
to the front from outside clearing at the seven-sixteenths pole, showed the way through the far turn along the inside, remained comfortably in front with a
furlong remaining and held well under a drive. DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) was off a bit slow to begin, stalked along the rail through both turns, finished willingly
through the lane under left and right handed encouragement, whittled the gap on the winner late but had to settle for second best. IRISH ROSE cleared
early from inside, set the pace to the half-mile marker, lost command shortly after, chased the winner into and around the turn, could not summon the
needed late kick in the late stages but managed to hold third. LA PEER tracked outside a rival early then moved to the inside on the clubhouse turn,
remained near the fence through the second bend, came out a bit in the lane and improved position. STRIKINGLY was closest in pursuit of the pacesetter to
the half-mile pole, chased the new leader two to three wide around the far turn and flattened in the stretch run. IRISH MYTH broke a bit slow, raced two
wide at the back early, moved to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and made no impact. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) stalked outside a
rival, rounded the far turn three wide and could not respond when called upon. THE FLYING PHAROAH broke a bit slow, unhurried after and moved inside,
moved off the rail on the backstretch, chased between foes at the quarter pole in the two path and failed to menace.

FAST DRAW MUNNINGS set a pressured pace a bit off the rail, continued to dictate terms two wide around the second bend, cleared outer rival entering
the lane and drew away. FINNEUS stalked in the two path, waited for room on the far turn then angled out into the clear at the quarter pole, spun four wide
into the lane, could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but bested the others. TELOS stalked the top pair from inside, saved ground through the far
turn, finished willingly in the furlong grounds but got outkicked for second. OVIATT CLASS broke a step slow, chased three then two wide off the pace
around the first turn, inched closer in the middle stages, put to a drive four deep on the far turn and kept on to earn a minor award. SIR LONDON pressed
the pace from outside to the quarter pole, chased the winner three wide into the lane and flattened. LOW EXPECTATIONS broke a step slow, stalked three
deep, roused at the seven-sixteenths pole, driven three wide into the stretch and weakened. EVER A REBEL lost his footing and stumbled at the start,
trailed to the quarter pole, passed a rival late on that bend and made no impact. INDULGE reserved early on the inside, asked two wide on the far turn and
failed to menace.

TALENT FOR GOLD away quickly to take then front then dueled outside SMILE BABY SMILE, fought with that rival three wide around the bend, cleared at
the top of the stretch and held well over HAYLEY AMBER through deep stretch. HAYLEY AMBER chased out of range early then moved into striking
distance up the backstretch, challenged the top pair from inside at the quarter pole but got outkicked by the winner in the stretch run. HOT DANZING stalked
off the inside, waited for room behind the leaders on the far turn then was given her cue at the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane three wide and finished
willingly for the show. LIGHTING AND REIGN settled off the inside, angled four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally. SMILE BABY SMILE
dueled for command from inside up the backstretch, fought in the two path through the turn, lost touch with the leader at the top of the lane and flattened in
the final sixteenth. SAFA broke a bit slow then lost her path at the start, stalked between foes then three deep into the turn, came five wide into the drive and
lacked a rally. SIGNORA VITTORIA broke a step slow, trailed on the inside into the turn, looked to start a run around the bend but faltered in the stretch.
PEPPERTINI stalked three deep then four deep entering the turn, rounded the bend four wide then angled into the three path trailing into the stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
DREAMFYRE sped clear and set the pace the pace up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
drew away under a drive. BENEDETTA tracked widest up the backstretch, drew closer around the turn and took aim at DREAMFYRE three wide into the
lane, steered inward when that rival came out in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner in the furlong grounds but was clearly second best. DUA
forwardly placed in the early stages, asked along the rail at the quarter pole, weakened in the lane but managed to hold third. MOTET broke slow and lost
her path at the start, raced near the back off the inside into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, showed a mild response to asking and earned a minor
award. UR IN TROUBLE broke in and bumped with KYTHIRA leaving the gate, chased off the rail to the turn, lost ground two then three wide around the
bend and weakened. VINOS ANGEL stumbled leaving the gate, dropped back then trailed into the turn, got put in tight briefly by MOTET at the
three-eighths pole and was not a factor. KYTHIRA broke out and bumped with UR IN TROUBLE, lost her path behind DUA early, chased along the rail then
two wide around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
STRESSED chased the lone leader outside a rival into and around the bend, drifted out when asked left-handed midstretch, reached the front inside the
sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed. HOTITUDE saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch, had to alter out when STRESSED came out
midstretch, launched a late bid and just missed. BENEDICT CANYON sat off the pace outside a rival, tipped out in the lane then got floated out midstretch,
unleashed a rally and got up for third. CARMEN MIRANDA tracked out of range two wide around the bend, got floated out midstretch, rallied between and
got edged for the show honors. SECRETS TOLD forwardly placed along the inside into and around the bend, moved off the fence in the lane, bid between
rivals with a sixteenth remaining but got bumped and halted her late momentum. RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ raced outside a rival near the back early on,
rounded the bend two wide, steered out in the lane, rallied eight deep but was not enough. READY JET GO saved ground near the back, started to gain
under hand urging in upper stretch, asked right-handed approaching the sixteenth pole, tried to split foes late but got sandwiched and was too late to
recover. BABY KRISTEN sped clear and crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final furlong, yielded in deep stretch and drifted out to
bump READY JET GO late. ACT OF SERENDIPITY lagged behind early, trailed on the inside into the stretch and never got involved. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH WHERE STRESSED DRIFTING OUT AND RULED THAT SINCED THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST
ANY RIVALS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PASTOR T stalked five deep up the backstretch, brushed with POINT DUME at the three-eighths pole, launched a bid from outside at the quarter pole, took
over at the top of the lane under left-handed encouragement, put away I WIN AGAIN past the eighth pole and drew off under steady handling in deep
stretch. I WIN AGAIN took control early and set the pace inside rivals, cleared briefly at the three-eighths pole, challenged by PASTOR T with a quarter mile
left to run, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane, fought to the eighth pole then failed to kick on in deep stretch but was clearly second best. MR
FABRICATOR was off slow to begin and lagged behind in the early stages, trailed three wide into the turn, angled over to the inside then tipped back out
approaching the stretch and finished well through the lane for a clear third. ARIO prompted the pace from between rivals, could not stay alongside I WIN
AGAIN around the turn, chased two wide into the drive and flattened while churning on for a minor award. SIR MAXIMUS came in at the start, stalked from
inside, ridden along while hugging the rail around the bend and weakened in the lane. POINT DUME broke a step slow, chased four deep to the turn, got
put in tight and brushed with the winner at the three-eighths pole, exited the bend three to four wide and weakened. IN SUSPENSE attended the pace three
deep to the turn, chased the top pair three wide into the lane and weakened.

CLOSING REMARKS stalked along the inside, waited for room behind the top pair on the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, launched a bid
approaching the eighth pole, took over midstretch and held SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) at bay through the final sixteenth. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) settled
inside early, brushed with SCHOOL DANCE nearing the clubhouse turn, raced up on the heels CLOSING REMARKS around the bend and had to steady
entering the backstretch, continued to save ground through the far turn, bid inside GANADORA with a furlong remaining, fought with CLOSING REMARKS
in the late stages and lacked the needed late punch. GANADORA jumped out to the front quickly and moved inside, led clear early then set the pace under
pressure up the backstretch, dueled with AWAKE AT MIDNYTE into and around the far turn, put that rival away in upper stretch but was soon confronted by
rivals on both sides at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on to hold the show. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) traveled three wide leaving the
chute then tucked inside at the back, went outside a rival on the backstretch, rounded the far turn two wide, steered out in upper stretch and summoned a
mild rally but could not get up for the show honors. TURNERLOOSE stalked two wide leaving the chute, became rank first time through the stretch then
settled into stride, began to pull around the clubhouse turn, stalked between up the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, challenged in upper stretch
but was outkicked in late stages. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE closest in pursuit from the two path early, applied pressure from outside up the backstretch, dueled
around the far turn and into the lane, fought to upper stretch and weakened. SCHOOL DANCE settled two wide early, brushed with inner rival nearing the
clubhouse turn, altered three wide around the bend, stalked three deep then came four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
BAG'S GOLD dueled for command from outside to the turn, put away inner rival at the quarter pole then fought with JAMES GANGE late on the bend,
cleared into the stretch and powered away under urging. CATHEDRAL LIGHT got forced in and crowded by JAMES GANGE early, traveled in mid-pack well
off the rail up the backstretch, rounded the bend four then three wide, rallied and got up for second. JAMES GANG broke out then came in early, attended
the pace three deep, challenged for command at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with BAG'S GOLD at the top of the lane, churned on through
the stretch run and got nailed for second. MISSED CALL chased four then five wide around the bend and kept on to round out the superfecta. SIR
FLATTER tossed his head leaving the gate, saved ground near the back through the turn, had to pause in traffic in upper stretch, then steered off the inside
in the drive and summoned a mild response to improve position. KISLOVODSK chased along the inside then moved into the two path around the bend and
flattened down the lane. AURELIAN MAN lost his path in the beginning, chased off the pace two then three wide around the turn and could not rally.
WARRIOR ROAD brushed with outer rival early, chased three wide into the turn, asked around the bend, came four wide into the drive and weakened.
REIGN OVER ME brushed with inner rival at the start, raced outside a rival at the back well off the inside, went three deep into the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and proved no menace. HARBOR THUNDER hit the outer stall in the beginning, raced in second flight early and had to alter inside
ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide into the lane and was not a factor. RAKA RAKA CRUZ dueled inside BAG'S GOLD
to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with outer pair with a quarter mile remaining and gave way in the stretch run. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT chased
in range briefly then dropped back early, traveled four to five wide around the turn and had little left for the stretch run.
