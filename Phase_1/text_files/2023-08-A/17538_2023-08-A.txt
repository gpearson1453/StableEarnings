Footnotes
MY BLUE VALENTINE pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted out to the three path down the backstretch, gained between horses into the far turn
to present a bid inside the five sixteenths pole, quickly assumed command approaching the quarter pole, drew off while hanging on his left lead through
upper stretch, changed over while resenting two strikes of a right handed crop leaving the furlong grounds and held sway from an outer purueser thereafter.
LITTLE GIA tracked along the inside, got outmoved by the eventual winner passing the three furlong pole, tipped out nearing the lane before gaining place
in the three path in upper stretch, and rallied into the clear leader's margin through the final furlong but was only second best. DEE DEE B saved ground off
of the pace, improved inside of rivals entering the lane, paused briefly behind traffic before shifting out at the furlong grounds and stayed on late to gain
show. KING'S MISTRESS vied inside of a pair of rivals early on, showed the way down the backstretch, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's
bid approaching the quarter pole and gave way through the lane. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL laid off of the pace two to four wide, but was floated to the
seven path by inner rivals nearing the lane and failed to menace. KEEN CONTENDER broke slowly and trailed the field early on, improved between horses
entering the far turn, shifted out but encountered traffic behind rivals while in the five path turning for home, remained blocked in upper stretch, shifted
inwardly at the furlong grounds and ran on mildly. GOLDCREST broke a bit outwardly while off a step slow, tracked in the four to three path around the first
turn, inched closer four wide into the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid with an inner rival around that bend, drifted to the six path entering the lane and tired
on her left lead. TAKE IT SOUTH lacked speed along the inside, shifted out to the four path around the first turn, then faded in the six path around the far
turn. MRS. SPEAKER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, yielded turning for home before getting floated to the four path entering the lane and
weakkened. PROUD PERFORMER prompted the pace three wide, chased down the backstretch and weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE NIGHTS broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, kicked away from an outer presser leaving the three sixteenths pole and drew off under
moderate hand urging. TONIC AND GIN stalked two wide and between horses early on, inched closer into the turn to press the leader, prompted in the
three path around the bend, but failed to keep pace with the pace setter in upper stretch and maintained place thereafter. WRECK IT RUBY chased behind
the leader and from the two path, claimed show while shifting out to the four path entering the turn, bumped an outer GONE WITH THE WYN in upper
stretch knocking his own hind quarters out from underneath him, came out and brushed that foe again at the sixteenth pole and ran on willingly. GONE
WITH THE WYN leaned outwardly at the start causing the rider to take a firm hold and steady his mount, raced off of the pace along the inside into the turn,
shifted out to the five path approaching the five sixteenths to inch closer between horses turning for home, brushed an outer rival entering the lane before
taking firmer contact from an inner foe in upper stretch, then lacked a bid before taking lighter contact from that one at the sixteenth pole. READY FOR
TROUBLE was last away while off slow, raced at the rear in the five path into the turn, got floated to the six path inside the three furlong marker before
advancing outside of rivals at the quarter pole, but took a brush from an inner rival entering the lane, yielded subtly while hanging on her left lead, then shied
from inner rivals at the sixteenth pole. AUTISM COMPASSION tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path into the turn, but was driven along to
sustain position around the bend before giving way between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
INTEGRATED DESIGN stalked from the three path, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led leaving the quarter pole, kicked away in upper stretch, tired in the
final sixteenth but lasted safely. MY HAPPY HOLIDAY was void of early speed, raced far back in the four path into the turn, fanned to the six path while
picking up stride nearing the lane, rallied outside of rivals while hanging on her left lead to gain place in the final sixteenth, then continued to close in on the
clear leader but ran out of ground. STANDOUTSENSATION tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out to the four path entering the lane, gained
place at the furlong grounds while chasing the clear leader, but was outkicked for that position in the late stages. BELLA CRUELLA was outsprinted down
the backstretch, trailed into the turn, took the bend in the three to two path, picked up stride nearing the lane, encountered traffic behind rivals through upper
stretch, altered course outwardly at the furlong grounds and stayed on to narrowly reach fourth. BIKINI BOTTOM pursued from midpack in the three path
while between horses, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. PRAY FOR CHAMPAGNE was urged along in the two path while off of the
pace around the turn and failed to menace. CAT ONE broke outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, stalked outside of the leader while pursuing inside of
the eventual winner, failed to offer a bid along with that one at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. ANORIA pursued from midpack in the four path and
failed to factor. PRINCESS MITOLE broke outwardly towards open space, set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenger's bid while just off the
fence at the five sixteenths pole, yielded to that one at the quarter pole and folded through the lane. WHITE DOVE took light contact from an inner rival
before being taken in hand between horses at the start, dropped back quickly soon after, was pulled up approaching the half mile pole and got vanned off.

Footnotes
LAMASCO vied two wide, gained an advantage into the turn, showed the way before being let out passing the quarter pole, drew off under a drive through
upper stretch and was put to wraps with the deal sealed in the final sixteenth. SHELL SHOCK chased in the three to four path and outside of rivals, gained
place at the five sixteenths pole while under a drive, but failed to keep pace with the leader while drifting to the five path nearing the lane, sparred for place
with an inner rival through the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. SUNDAY GRACE vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner down the backstretch,
but failed to sustain pace pressure entering the turn, chased along the inside turning for home, dueled with an outer rival for place through the final furlong
but just missed. ROCK THE NILE tracked along the inside, came under urging two wide into the turn and failed to factor. BALL GOWN trailed in the five
path around the turn and got outrun before being eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SONG OF NORWAY broke outwardly, crossed over sharply while dictating the pace early on, set the pace along the inside around the turn, drew off
entering the lane and opened up in hand as his rider searched for competition. SALTWATER TAFFY stumbled at the start, stalked four to three wide and
outside of foes into the turn, ranged up to gain place at the five sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader entering the lane and fended off
an inner bidder for place in the late stages. CANDY LANDY chased along the inside, shifted out entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge before
tipping inwardly in the final furlong to attempt a bid for place, but was kept at bay. JOKE MASTER failed to maintain tracking position approaching the turn,
laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and ran on. SHE'S ALL ELLIE lacked speed in the four path, fanned to the six
path entering the lane and ran on mildly. MIDNIGHT ANGEL pressed two wide and between horses, chased the leader from the two path while inside of a
rival around the turn, yielded at the quarter pole and weakened. SOTONA broke outwardly requiring a strong left rein to be corrected, then failed to maintain
forward inside position and steadied hard at the five furlong pole, raced far back in the two path around the turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch
and failed to menace. PUCKERED broke slowly, lagged behind in the two path and cut the gap late. EVERMORE raced forwardly three wide and between
horses early on, but yielded at the seven sixteenths pole and faded around the turn. THE RIDER OF SOTONA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SONG OF
NORWAY FOR INTEREFENCE IN THE OPENING STAGES; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
PAT'SCHROMECOMPASS stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the leading pair at the quarter pole to offer a bid entering the lane, drove clear at the
furlong grounds and lasted safely from an outer on-charging foe late. HAPPY CHARGER broke a step slow and lacked speed in the three path into the turn,
picked up stride in the four path turning for home, altered course outside of rivals and to the six path entering the lane, then produced a good kick in
midstretch, closed strongly in pursuit of the clear leader late but ran out of ground. RUBY TAP set the pace inside of a prompting foe while remaining a path
off of the inside, got headed by her outer counterpart while an inner foe offered a bid, failed to keep pace with that one while reclaiming place on her left lead
at the furlong grounds, changed over shortly after, but was outkicked for place in the final sixteenth. PORT TOWNSEND prompted outside of the pace setter
and from the three path, vied around the turn, led briefly turning for home, but was outkicked by a rail bidder nearing the furlong grounds and gave way.
MUSICAL MISCHIEF tracked in the four path, lacked progress while chasing in upper stretch, got outkicked for fourth by an outer rival at the furlong pole,
then ran on but missed regaining that position at the wire. FLASHY LASS broke outwardly, pursued from midpack under urging in the four to five path
around the turn and lacked a bid. RITA'S ONTHE BEACH broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, shifted to the three to four path turning for home
and failed to factor. HOCKADAY GIRL came out at the start, chased in the two path, but faded entering the turn. RENDEZVOUS broke slowly, lagged
behind around the turn and got outrun. FIESTA BESTA chased in the three path and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and caved

Footnotes
AUTISM COMMUNITY trailed in the two path around the first turn, launched a four to six wide rally turning for home, sustained progress outside of rivals to
bid outside of new leader in the final sixteenth and edged past. THEROANRUNNER tracked along the inside, tipped out to the three path approaching the
ane, advanced to bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, led nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the late stages.
PELICAN LANE dueled for the lead outside of a rival while in the three path, cleared that foe while drifting to the four to five path entering the lane,
maintained an advantage while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, but was headed by an inner bidder while changing over at the furlong
grounds and yielded between horses at the sixteenth pole. SUN VALLEY ROAD pursued from midpack along the inside, came under coaxing around the far
turn, but lacked the needed rail punch and chased evenly through the lane. MIDVALE broke a bit inwardly, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far
turn in the two path, improved inside of rivals entering the lane before tipping to the three path, but lacked the needed kick. RETROSPECT pursued from
midpack two wide, chased in the three to four path around the far turn and failed to menace. WORDS OF PRAISE dueled for the lead along the inside, but
yielded to his outer counterpart entering the lane and weakened between horses. CATHERINE BLAZE lacked speed three wide, trailed in the two path
around the far turn and made little impact. MOROCCAN QUEEN tracked two wide, chased under urging around the far turn and weakened between horses
entering the lane. LETTER OF GOLD laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then tired in the three path turning for home.

MISS ARLINGTON set the pace inside of a prompting rival, shook free of that one leaving the three sixteenths pole and held firm through the final furlong.
AMERICAN RETRO stalked three wide, came under urging while lacking a bid turning for home, got floated to the five path entering the lane, kept on in
pursuit of the clear leader and forged place at the sixteenth pole. ERVADEAN pressed two wide, vied around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her inner
counterpart while drifting to the four path entering the lane, chased along with an outer foe thereafter, but lost place to that one a sixteenth from home. YES
DAY trailed along the inside, and stayed on to gain fourth from outer rivals at the furlong grounds. MOTOWN MIKA chased in the two path and faded.
JOKES ON BLUE broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the three path and gave way.
