Footnotes
MIRACLE FIRE showed good early speed and contested the pace while inside of MIRAGE CODE into the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker,
shook free into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, drew off under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker and was hand urged to the
wire in a good debut. MIRAGE CODE broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, contested the solid pace with MIRACLE FIRE while outside of
that rival into the turn, pressed MIRACLE FIRE along the bend while two wide, could not match strides with the winner into upper stretch, was no match in
the final furlong and ran on to be best of the rest. ARTESIAN FLOW was off a step slowly, chased outside of rivals into the turn, gained ground while three
deep on the turn and raced within aim nearing the top of the stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the final stages and weakened, while holding
clearly for the show. GOD IS A GAEL chased the solid early pace from the inside, gained ground along the turn while chasing from the rail, swung two wide
for the stretch drive, could not muster a late response and gave way. WEEPING WILLOWS was crowded by neighboring rivals at the start and was off
slowly, lacked early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TURA LURA raced close to the decent early pace, took back to stalk into the turn, chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker, was given her cue
in upper stretch, was crowded by NAVY QUEEN for a few strides heading to the furlong grounds, responded to firm urging into the final sixteenth, drew to
even terms with CRY ME A RUNNER into deep stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the finish and determinedly won the nod on the wire. CRY ME A
RUNNER disputed the early pace with NAVY QUEEN while outside of that rival, took back to concede the lead along the turn and chased two wide to the
quarter marker, swung three paths wide into upper stretch and re-engaged with NAVY QUEEN heading to the furlong marker, took a narrow lead and was
confronted by TURA LURA heading to the sixteenth-pole, dueled gamely under steady urging to the finish and was nipped on the wire for the win. AIRKITA
tracked the decent early pace while outside of an inner rival, raced two wide to the quarter marker then was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, gained
ground at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the top two in the final stages and outfinished NAVY QUEEN in deep stretch to secure the show.
NAVY QUEEN broke a half step slowly and was hustled to be forwardly placed, contested the solid pace into the turn, shook free along the bend and set the
pace from the inside to the quarter marker, drifted out a path in upper stretch then was guided back in and crowded TURA LURA heading to the furlong
grounds, could not keep pace with oncoming rivals into deep stretch, weakened and was outfinished for the show.

TIGER QUEEN broke alertly and showed good early speed, set decent fractions while outside of rivals into the turn, was engaged along the bend by
MAYCEE JO and disputed the pace to the quarter marker, set down for the drive and shook free heading to the furlong grounds, was kept to task under
steady urging to the sixteenth-marker and drew away under hand urging in the final stages. TIZ A TIGER broke a step slowly, stalked the decent early pace
while three wide then chased from the three path along the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages while
running on the left lead and outfinished MAYCEE JO in deep stretch to secure the place. MAYCEE JO was prominent in the early running and attended to
the decent pace, advanced along the turn and pressed inside of TIGER QUEEN to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the winner heading to the
furlong marker and weakened in mid-stretch, battled with TIZ A TIGER for place honors into the final sixteenth and was just edged for that position, while
clear in the end for the show. TAKES A VILLAGE chased the decent pace from the inside, saved ground to the top of the stretch and lacked a response in
the drive.

SIPPIN WHISKEY settled off of the early pace while not far back into the first turn, tracked the decent fractions from a ground saving position through the
backstretch run, came two wide into the second turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, closed to come within aim at the furlong marker, battled with
TRIBUTE TO M into the final sixteenth, was carried out by that rival in deep stretch, dueled to the wire with the runner-up and determinedly won the nod on
the wire to prevail. TRIBUTE TO M paused at the start and was off slowly, spotted the field in the early running and trailed into the first turn, improved
position along the backstretch run while saving ground, continued to gain ground while along the rail into the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive and
rallied to come within aim at the furlong marker, battled with SIPPIN WHISKEY into the final sixteenth, drifted out under firm urging in deep stretch while
dueling with SIPPIN WHISKEY and just missed for the win, while getting up in the final strides to secure the place. WAY TOO HOT was forwardly placed in
the early running and saved ground while stalking the pace into the first turn, shifted to the two path into the backstretch run and tracked the decent fractions
to the half-mile marker, advanced two wide along the far turn, was given his cue and confronted APPLE WARRIOR in upper stretch, battled with that rival to
the furlong marker, was kept to firm urging to the final sixteenth while dueling with APPLE WARRIOR, took a slim lead in deep stretch, was caught in the
final strides by the oncoming top two and was edged for the win and place, while holding for the show. APPLE WARRIOR was sent leaving an alert
beginning, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch
and met the bid of WAY TOO HOT to the furlong marker, fought back from the inside into deep stretch, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in the
final stages and was outfinished. VINNIEBOB showed speed and was prominent in the early running, stalked the pace while widest into the first turn and
was floated out to the four path heading into the backstretch run, recovered and tracked the decent pace while outside of APPLE WARRIOR into the far
turn, raced three then four wide to the quarter marker, lacked the needed response in the stretch run and weakened in the final stages. MOVIETIME was
forwardly placed while between runners into the first turn, drifted out leaving the seven-furlong marker and floated out VINNIEBOB, tracked the decent pace
along the backstretch run while outside of rivals, chased four wide into the far turn, came three wide into the drive, could not keep pace in the final stages
and tired. SILENT BULLET was a bit slow away from the start, settled outside of an inner rival into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run and did
not factor in the stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH INVOLVING SIPPIN WHISKEY AND TRIBUTE
TO M AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ELEGANT BOY was hard sent for speed leaving the start, disputed the solid early pace while three wide into the turn then cleared midway through the bend
and showed the way from the rail heading into the stretch, drew to a clear lead in upper stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, felt pressure from
CORAL CAT nearing the sixteenth-pole, drifted out under firm handling in deep stretch, made contact with CORAL CAT in the final strides and just held for
the win. CORAL CAT broke alertly and showed good early speed, contested the solid early pace while between runners into the turn, lost ground to
ELEGANT BOY heading to the quarter marker and chased into upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of ELEGANT BOY in
the final sixteenth, continued to close into deep stretch, was carried out then bumped approaching the wire and just missed for the win, while well clear of
the rest for the place. SPIDER PIG lacked early speed, was steered two wide into the turn, swung widest for the drive and mounted a five wide bid into the
stretch, was not able to impact the top pair in the final stages but closed to be clear in the end for show. EL CANELO chased the solid early pace while
outside of rivals, improved position while three wide on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a late rally. SPEEDANDGREED was slow away from
the gate, chased the solid early pace from the rail, swung two wide into the drive and did not threaten. OM FIRE showed early speed and pressed the quick
early pace from the inside, lost position on the turn and chased to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH INVOLVING ELEGANT BOY AND CORAL CAT. IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ELEGANT BOY DRIFTED OUT IN THE FINAL STRIDES, MADE CONTACT WITH CORAL CAT AND IN
DOING SO COST CORAL CAT THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. ELEGANT BOY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED
SECOND. THERE WAS ALSO A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CORAL CAT AGAINST THE RIDER OF ELEGANT BOY.

Footnotes
THE LITTLE H MAN settled behind the pace while always traveling well, bided time on the inside through the turn, took advantage an opening near the
quarter pole, tipped out to the three path for clear run down the stretch and won under a confident hand ride. SATANTA lacked speed from the break but
was encouraged to stay close to the pack, raced at the rear of the compact field while always close, tracked the pack through the turn then worked out to the
four path into the stretch and finished up well to gain second while never a serious threat to the winner. GREAT STORY broke sharply and was sent to vie
for the early lead, settled just off the flank of QUANTUM QUEST and pressed that rival through the turn, went for the lead near the three-sixteenths pole,
took a brief lead but was quickly passed by THE LITTLE H MAN before the furlong marker, kept on well enough to hold third. QUANTUM QUEST was sent
and gained the early lead with a pair of rivals pressing the issue to the outside, was still going well into the stretch then weakened and gave way in the final
furlong. ASANO'S BACK had his head turned as the gates opened and got away a step or two slow, rushed up to join the early pace by the half-mile pole
while racing in the four path, began to struggle to keep up with the field approaching the five-sixteenths pole, swung extremely wide into the stretch and
trailed the field to the wire.

Footnotes
HONOS MAN settled off of the moderate early pace while saving ground, was well placed through the backstretch run and improved position heading to the
half-mile marker, chased from the rail along the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, rallied and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, responded to firm
urging approaching the sixteenth-marker, found more in deep stretch and edged away in the final stages. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was forwardly placed in
the early running, stalked outside of the pacesetter into the backstretch run and tracked from the three path into the far turn, raced within aim heading to the
quarter marker, was steered three wide into upper stretch, was given his cue and battled for the lead nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace with the
winner into deep stretch and was outkicked, while holding safely at the finish for the place. MEMO DADDY (CHI) was allowed to settle in the early running,
tracked outside of an inner rival into the backstretch run, came two wide into the far turn while not far back, swung widest into the drive and mounted a six
wide rally in the lane, closed well inside of the furlong marker but could not reel in the top pair and was up in the final strides to secure the show. ENOS
SLAUGHTER was forwardly placed leaving the break and tracked the pace while three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside position while tracking
the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, chased the pacesetter three wide along the far turn and swung four wide for the stretch drive, gained ground at
the furlong marker but could not sustain that bid into deep stretch and flattened out. TOM AND JAZZY was sent to establish the early lead, dictated terms
along the first turn and set moderate fractions into the backstretch run, controlled the pace into the far turn and extended the lead approaching the quarter
marker while off of the rail, came under pressure into upper stretch and battled for the lead to the furlong marker, could not match strides with oncoming
rivals into deep stretch and weakened. ATTENZIONE a bit slow into stride, saved ground into the backstretch while unhurried and not far back, advanced in
upper stretch but failed to sustain the rally and did not threaten.

Footnotes
GERLACH'S came away in good order, settled in striking position through the turn, moved to challenge TRIP TO SPAIN at the top of the stretch then
engaged that one in a spirited stretch battle, got the advantage in the final yards and prevailed over a stubborn rival. TRIP TO SPAIN broke well and was
part of the three horse speed duel through the early stages, took over sole command of the lead from the three furlong marker, continued to lead into the
stretch, met the challenge of GERLACH'S, battled gamely then gave way grudgingly in the late stages in a good effort. TALBOT BAY broke out a bit and
was a bit slow to get going but found his stride quickly and moved forward to join the crowded pace scenario, raced four wide through the turn, came into the
stretch on the outside of four horses chasing the top two and finished best to gain the third spot. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM settled behind several horses
contesting the early pace, responded when asked to pick up the pace passing the three furlong marker, swung four wide into the stretch and finished up
well. LITTLE CASINO broke well, pressed the early pace from the inside, had to steady just past the three-eighths pole, moved out to the two path for the
stretch run then finished with some interest but came up short of a minor award. COUNTING CARDS had the lead briefly from the gate, dueled inside of
TRIP TO SPAIN to the turn, had to check near the five-sixteenths marker and lost some momentum, had clear run on the rail through the stretch and kept
on for a bit then tired in the final furlong. BOBBY'S ALIBI was outrun from the start, chased the field through the far turn, swung extremely wide into the
stretch and never made an impact.
