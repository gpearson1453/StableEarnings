Footnotes
OSCAR ECLIPSE stalked outside of the clear leader, bid in the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, assumed command leaving that marker and
drew off under a drive. MO'S TREASURE tracked three wide, chased the eventual winner's bid in the four path around the far turn to gain place while failing
to keep pace with that one leaving the five sixteenths pole, then fended off an outer challenger for place through the lane. QUATERNION broke a step slow,
then drifted in and bumped a rival in the opening stages, settled off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride while shifting to the five path turning for
home, but was denied reaching place while hanging on his left lead through the lane. MIACOMET bobbled slightly and took shouldering from rivals on both
sides at the start, dropped back and took a bump from an outer rival in the opening stages, raced off of the pace in the three path, got floated to the five to
six path while getting outmoved by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, then surpassed tired rivals. CAN'T HUSH THIS brushed an outer rival before
clearing and shifting across that one's path at the start, set a clear pace in the two path, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid at the five
sixteenths pole and weakened. FUNNY UNCLE trailed in the four to six paths and failed to factor. TAKE THE CHARGE brushed an inner rival before shying
from a different inner foe soon after the start, tracked along the inside but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
MAKE THE BOYS WINK settled at the rear along the inside, shifted out approaching the far turn, advanced in hand four wide around the far turn, took aim
on the new leaders from the five path entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, then kicked clear in the final sixteenth. ROBIN SAGE
tracked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole as an outer ENGLISH TREASURE forced her hand, vied between horses entering the lane, forged an
advantage nearing the furlong marker, but was outkicked by an outer bidder approaching the final sixteenth and fended off an inner challenger for place.
MINDFUL stalked along the inside under firm restraint behind the leader around the first turn, got outmoved by outer bidders while awaiting racing room
turning for home, continued to encounter traffic entering the lane, but then only managed to chase after finding clear sailing two wide in midstretch,
attempted a bid for place inside of a rival, but was kept at bay. ANIMAL FRIES pursued from midpack along the inside, but retreated towards the rear while
awaiting racing room behind traffic around the far turn, tipped two wide turning for home, shifted out to the five path while between horses entering upper
stretch and ran on to narrowly gain a minor reward. ENGLISH TREASURE broke outwardly, settled off of the pace three wide, offered a swift four wide
move outside of rivals with three furlongs to go to produce a bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, led briefly leaving that station, vied entering the lane,
but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the furlong grounds and weakened. MO DIVINE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, floated four
wide around the far turn before fanning six wide into the lane, but lacked a bid. JENNIFER MY LOVE set the pace while crossing over to the inside around
the first turn, but got headed while inside of a trio foes at the five sixteenths pole and faltered leaving the furlong grounds. GUNS N' LILIES pressed two
wide, but was outmoved by outer rivals turning for home and weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
LIBERAL ARTS stalked four wide, ranged up in pursuit of the new leader entering the lane, bid outside of that one approaching midstretch, sparred through
the final furlong and edged a margin late. OTTO THE CONQUEROR prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied with the inner pace-setter into
the turn, led turning for home, dug in while embracing an outer challenge nearing the furlong grounds, battled gamely into deep stretch, but was bested late.
ALLIED VICTORY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, grinded away on her left lead in the five path in upper stretch, changed over while producing
a bid for show at the sixteenth pole and prevailed between horses at the wire. LEAD FOOT laid off of the pace in the two to three path, fanned to the six
path entering the lane, delayed changing leads until the furlong grounds, then stayed on outside of rivals but missed reaching show. COLLINS bumped an
outer rival before having that one clip his hind heels soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside, got headed by at the five sixteenths pole,
gave way to the top pair in midstretch and lost show late. B WAYNE lacked speed in the five to seven path, shifted inwardly in midstretch and lacked a bid.
BRIAN pressed three wide and between horses into the turn, but chased those foes turning for home before yielding. WARP NINE lacked speed along the
inside, paused behind traffic at the quarter pole, shifted out between horses in upper stretch and failed to factor. NEW BERN took contact from rivals on
both sides, floated in behind his inner counterpart and clipped that one's heels in the aftermath, then trailed in the two path around the turn before
surpassing tired rivals. GOTTANEEDFORSPEED tracked along the inside, chased around the turn and weakened. NUEVO AMANECER bumped an inner
rival at the start, tracked two wide and weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
AUSTERE tracked three wide, ranged up four wide entering the lane, drove past the leader at the furlong grounds, kicked clear and held sway. PLUMERIA
pursued from midpack in the four path early on, tracked two wide and between horses around the far turn, awaited racing room turning for home, then
chased the clearing leader from the three path and between horses leaving the furlong grounds, ran on to vie for place with an outer rival in the final
sixteenth and prevailed. WEIGHTED AVERAGE rated unhurried two to three wide, fanned six wide entering the lane and offered a mild rally to miss
reaching place. FUN LOVING was gazing inwardly as the gates sprung, dwelt and spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, pulled three to four wide
around the first turn before settling off of the pace two wide down the backstretch, shifted five wide entering the lane, stayed on to vie for place in the final
sixteenth, but missed between horses at the wire. MOONLIGHT GAMBLER steadied hard inside of rivals at the thirteen sixteenths pole, raced far back
along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and rallied. CAIRO STREET stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, led entering the lane, but was outkicked
by the eventual winner passing the furlong grounds and gave way. CRYSTAL SYMPHONY settled off of the pace under a firm hold in the two path around
the first turn, moved down to the inside entering the backstretch and failed to factor. KESSEL raced forwardly along the inside, checked repeatedly while
tugging in tight quarters just behind the pace setter around the first turn, tipped outside of the top pair and pressed three wide around the far turn, but was
outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and weakened between horse through the final furlong. LADY OF DEVON pursued from midpack along the
inside, shifted out while chasing in upper stretch and failed to menace. ROCK STAR DOCTOR saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. GLOSSY LIFE
cleared off around the first turn, showed the way from an outer vying rival into the far turn, but was headed by a trio of outer foes entering the lane and
weakened. MENDEE reared while very fractious in the starting gate, trailed the field in the seven path around the first turn, then was done early and eased
through the lane.

HOT BEACH stalked four wide, bid three wide at the three furlong pole, led at the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead and
lasted safely while tiring in the closing stages. RIPERTON tracked along the inside, shifted to the five path in midstretch and stayed on late to gain place in
the shadow of the wire. YOUALMOSTHADME stumbled at the start, advanced to about midpack leaving the chute, chased in the four path and outside of
rivals around the turn, ran on to vie for place entering the final sixteenth, briefly gained that position in the closing stages, but was caught by an outer rival.
TX WOMEN FOR ARTS stalked three wide and between horses, chased around the turn, sustained stride to bid for place along with an outer rival at the
sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by an outer pair late. TWIRLING QUEEN bumped with an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, led into the
turn, but was headed by an outer bidder at the quarter pole and gave way. EDISTRUDIS trailed, moved out of last in the five path into the turn, then
continued mild improvment. GRACE GIVEN raced towards the rear in the three path and between horses into the turn and failed to factor. EASY RED
bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, retreated to trail the field into the turn and was outrun from there. INTERMITTENT

Footnotes
BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX leaned in and brushed an inner rival soon after the start, then shifted down crowding inner foes at the nine sixteenths pole,
tracked in the three path into the turn, chased the top pair entering the lane, took aim while creeping closer leaving midstretch, then drove past them at the
sixteenth pole and drew clear. COULDITBEMAJIC broke a step slow, got floated in and forced to crowded quarters by an outer rival at the nine sixteenths
pole, raced off of the pace in the three path into the turn, tipped to the four path at the three furlong pole before fanning to the six path entering the lane, but
got brushed and herded outwardly by an inner rival passing the furlong pole, yet sustained a late rally outside of rivals in the closing stages to gain place.
CALL ME ANDY vied along the inside, fought on while headed through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and lost place
again late. OMEX was floated inwardly at the nine sixteenths pole, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but brushed
an outer rival while drifting outwardly leaving the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. BALTA prompted the pace three wide, bid into the turn, vied with a
narrow advantage two wide leaving the three furlong pole, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, succumbed between horses at the sixteenth pole and
faltered. HAM SANDWICH raced towards the rear along the inside, trailed into the turn, improved inside of rivals at the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a bid
while one paced. LET'S GO MARK brushed an inner foe before taking light contact from an outer rival at the start, chased in the four path, but faded in the
five path at the three furlong pole. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed in the five to four path into the
turn and was outrun. DUNPHY vied two wide and between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole and wilted between horses soon after. THE
RIDER OF COULDITBEMAJIC CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX AT THE NINE SIXTEENTHS POLE; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
POSITANO SUNSET laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path and between horses entering the lane, loomed a danger while searching
for racing room behind the leaders at the furlong grounds, split foes approaching the final sixteenth and drove clear. FLAMAND bobbled very slightly at the
start, tracked two wide and between horses, took aim outside of the top pair and from the five path entering upper stretch, ranged up to attempt a bid at the
furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner bidder leaving that station and edged place late. SANTA FE GOLD pressed two wide, bid turning for home,
vied in the four path entering the lane, sparred between horses entering midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival approaching the final sixteenth and
was bested by an outer foe for place. MERLAZZA pursued from midpack in the three path, shifted out to the five path at the furlong grounds, sustained a
chase between horses, but needed more. MAGICAL LUTE trailed in the three path, entered the lane in the six path before tipping to the eight path in upper
stretch, and stayed on outside of rivals. TOPSY chased three wide under strong urging, pursued in the four path around the turn, but drifted to the seven
path entering the lane and yielded between horses. PADMA made little impact from the two path. BLACK FOREST set the pace along the inside, dug in in
the two path turning for home, but was headed at the furlong grounds and faltered. RUTHLESS RUA stalked along the inside, chased into the lane, but
lacked room while yielding in the final furlong.

TUMBARUMBA tracked along the inside early on, pursued in the two to three path around the far turn, inched closer in the four path turning for home,
sustained a bid after being floated to the five path entering the lane, wrestled an advantage entering the final sixteenth and edged ahead. TRANSECT broke
outwardly, tracked three wide, vied around the far turn, led entering the lane, gamely resisted a pair of outer bids approaching the furlong grounds, but was
bested passing the sixteenth pole and tenaciously held place. LOYAL COMPANY settled off of the pace in the two path, gained between horses turning for
home, took aim in the four path entering the lane inside of TUMBARUMBA, bid along with that one coming to midstretch, but was bested in the final furlong
and failed to gain place. DENINGTON trailed along the inside, picked up stride turning for home, fanned to the six path while within range of the leaders
entering the lane, but leveled off. BLUE LIGHT stalked two wide, vied between horses into the far turn, but gave way to a trio of outer rivals in upper stretch.
HOW DID HE DO THAT broke out and was off slow, lacked speed in the five path and failed to factor. RELEASE MCCRAKEN pursued from midpack four
wide and faded. OLAZABAL set a pressured pace, vied with a pair of outer bidders into the far turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
STAGE RAIDER tracked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the front-runners passing the quarter pole, split those foes two wide at the furlong
grounds and surged clear. BIG BLUE LINE rated at the rear in the two to three path, fanned six wide entering the lane and rallied to reach place in the
shadow of the wire. SEIZE THE NIGHT settled towards the rear in the four path, gained in hand around the far turn, ranged up in the five path entering the
lane, but leveled off while chasing between horses in midstretch and ran on to narrowly gain show. BEST ACTOR prompted the pace while tugging in the
four path early on, struck the front at the three quarter pole, showed the way in side of a rival while a path off of the rail, got headed by a wider bidder at the
three furlong pole, fought on through upper stretch, but was bested by another bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded and was surpassed by a pair of place
bidders late. HERE MI SONG broke a step slow, settled off of the pace in the five path, steadily closed in down the backstretch, bid for the lead outside of a
pair of rivals at the three furlong pole, led leaving that station, gradually tucked down to the three path while unable to clear entering the lane, hung on his
left lead while getting outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds and yielded between horses. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) set the pace in the two
path early on, but allowed a pair of outer rivals to dictate terms leaving the three quarter pole, tracked two wide and between horses into the far turn, but
chased under urging around that bend and faded. KUPUNA prompted the pace in the five path, vied with an inner rival while in the four path down the
backstretch, but was outmoved by an outer foe at the three furlong pole and folded entering the lane.

a long drive and cleared from the field in the final stages. HIDDEN CONNECTION tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was in
the seven path into the lane, took over and led the field in the stretch five wide but yielded late in the drive and held place at the wire.
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM was well placed early on, steadied back along the backstretch to trail the field, fanned into the seven path entering the lane,
rallied widest down the lane and missed place at the wire. ICE ORCHID chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and moved up late in the
stretch run. COASTAL CHARM pressed the pace early while two wide, stuck a nose in front while between horses nearing the lane, was in the five path into
the lane, raced four wide down the lane and weakened late in the drive. BE LIKE WATER raced back early on, was moved up along the inside down the
backstretch, raced in the two path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. NON VIOLENCE set the pace early, was in the three path into the
lane and gave way down the lane.
