Footnotes
SWEET SODDY J tracked the early pace from the inside, shifted out on the turn and made a three wide bid off the turn to duel for command by the quarter
pole, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under right handed crop to prove best. COPPERLITE tracked the early pace from between rivals,
then chased the pace three wide leaving the turn, shifted in leaving the furlong marker and was up for the place award on the inside. IMPERIALTY was
away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole, and faded the final furlong, bested rest. TIZZY INDY chased the early
pace three wide and in between rivals, then was four to five wide off the turn and had no rally. HONG KONG BOY was void of early speed, then passed the
tiring rivals late. JACK CLOUD was settled and dropped to the inside on the turn and had no response. IRON STREETS was reserved early, came five wide
into the lane and was not a threat. SEEKER chased the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SHEILAHS WARCLOUD reserved off the pace while saving ground in the two path, angled to the clear when called upon turning for home and closed well
to draw clear in deep stretch. CANDY DOLL raced on the early pace from between horses, backed out to settle into stalking position, circled three wide at
the quarter pole to loom boldly in upper stretch, failed to change leads in the drive and kept on well to be second best. STREETCORNER set the pace on a
well rated lead to upper stretch, responded when challenged but could not last down the lane. STILL TEMPER unhurried through the turn and made a mild
late bid in the stretch. VARIEGATE pressed the pace from the rail to midway on the turn and faded in the lane. THURSDAY GIRL chased the leaders while
three wide around the bend and never mounted a rally. EDEN'S GIGI tracked the pace for a half mile and came up empty. BOSSY BOOTS was never a
factor.

Footnotes
STARSTREET stalked the leader from the rail to the head of the lane, angled well wide in upper stretch and closed well as a convincing winner. CITY
HUMOR broke alertly to take command from the gate, opened a clear lead while well rated, responded well down the lane but was no match for the winner
while a clear second best. GAMING SOUL saved ground while racing toward the rear of the field in the turn, angled into the clear down the lane and made a
mild late bid to be best of the rest. XKUZ reserved along the fence to the top of the lane, cut the corner coming home and made a grinding rally in the
stretch. WATERMELON CRUSH chased the pace from three wide to upper stretch and weakened. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE unhurried early to be near the
back and passed tiring rivals down the lane. SOUR PATCH GIRL well placed for the first half mile and lacked a response when called upon turning for
home. RECTANGLE never menaced. HEAVY WEIGHT tracked the leaders for a half mile and came up empty. OUR DARK COURAGE showed little.

Footnotes
SELECTO tracked the pace from the fence through midway on the turn, commenced a rally mid-turn while angling three wide, engaged the top pair in
mid-stretch and drew clear late in a drive. STORM TRAPPE stalked the pacesetter through the turn, reeled that on in at the head of the lane, dueled with the
winner to deep stretch and finished willingly while second best. MOSLER SAFE chased the pace through the turn while racing two wide, lugged in early in
the turn, corrected course and showed good late interest in the lane. SEIZE THE BREEZE sprinted clear to take control shortly from the gate, responded to
challengers in upper stretch but weakened late. STEELE MONEY never seriously menaced while passing weaker rivals in the stretch. LOVE ME ARCHIE
flashed brief speed and came up empty. ROAD MINISTER was never a factor.

settled early two wide, eased out nearing the turn and came four wide into the lane and offered a late rally to best the rest. LILLY SIMONE was steadied
shortly after the start to be reserved early, eased out and came six wide into the lane but had no serious rally. ALL ABOUT KATHERN was settled on the
inside and was not a threat. AWESOME APEAL chased the early pace in between rivals and weakened. ADABEL tracked the pace on the inside and

Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN sped to the lead in rapid fractions while under steady pressure, shook free of the pace pressers and dug-in gamely when engaged by
the runner-up in the stretch and prevailed in a determined drive. REBEL POSSE tracked the pace through the turn, rallied four wide at the head of the lane,
engaged the leader in mid-stretch and dueled with that one to the wire. BY THE SEY SHORE reserved off the pace near the rear of the field and found his
best stride late to rally up for the show. SAN COSTANTINO in tight from between horses early, rated in midfield through the turn and finished willingly.
VALIANT VINNY stalked the pace in striking position to upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. KINGPIN well placed tracking the pace through the turn
and failed to gain in the drive. CASANOVA KITTEN never menaced throughout and passed tired rivals in the stretch. BOSS IS A PAL was never a threat.
THATSAFACTJACK pressed the quick pace for a half mile and faded.

lugged in by the three sixteenths, shifted out leaving the furlong marker and made a bid under left handed crop to edged clear late. GIANTSBANE was four
