Footnotes
LIZZIE'S RAYNE broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the
final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and drew clear late to prove best. WEEKENDINDELMAR was off a step slow, and found herself trailing the
field into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, raced into a stalking trip from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid three
wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. DONNA WYN away alertly and rushed to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, battled from the inside of LIZZIE'S RAYNE through the final
turn, was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, and was outfinished late for the place. BAKBURNER chased the leaders three wide
entering the first turn, dropped back to trail entering the backstretch, began to lose touch with the field in the run to the final turn, and was eased over the
final furlong.

INFINITE PATIENCE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering he first turn, eased off the pressured pace of BAYAKOAS IMAGE to
gain a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the second turn, swept to the lead two wide approaching the final turn, battled through the turn from the
inside of WE BE THREE while racing out from the rail, and held that determined rival safely at bay in the stretch drive under confident handling. WE B
THREE was off a step slow and settled off the early contested pace while racing just out from the rail through the stretch the first time, took up the chase
three wide midway down the backstretch, rallied three wide from the outside of INFINITE PATIENCE entering he the final turn, and finished gamely three
wide in the drive to prove easily second best. BAYAKOAS IMAGE away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide entering he first turn, assumed command
from along the rail entering the second turn, was quickly overtaken in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
MAKEITORBREAKIT raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch the first time and
through the second turn, opened a clear advantage through the stretch the second time, continued to show the way in the run down the backstretch the final
time, and widened his advantage over the final furlong while confidently handled. GORKY PARK stalked the leader into the backstretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip throughout, launched his bid three wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and finished
willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch the first time,
continued to bid his time at the back of the pack through the stretch the second time and into the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the
final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the drive to get up for a share. GOOD BYE PUTIN stalked the early pacesetter while racing two out
from the rail entering the backstretch the first time, maintained a stalking trip through the backside the final time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and
closed five wide in the drive in an even effort. DON WITH THE WIND tracked the leader into the backstretch the first time while racing one out from the rail,
continued to track the pacesetter down the backside the final time, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but weakened in the late stages.
MOUNT LOKI settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside the first time, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and
had little to offer in the late stages. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of GOOD BYE PUTIN lodged a claim of
foul against the rider of GORKY PARK for alleged interference entering the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was
made to the original order of finish.

AUGUST RAIN broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of PISCO in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, got
the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and was all out to fend off a late surge from DIOCLES to prevail. DIOCLES settled well off the contested early
pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and shifted two wide in deep
stretch while splitting rivals to just miss. HORATIO stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid two
out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to just miss. PISCO away alertly and vied for the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with
his pace rival entering the lane, and faded in the late going. HIGHLINER rushed up along the inside entering the first turn while clipping heels with
BECKETT'S BEST entering the turn, settled off the early pace while saving ground in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. BECKETT'S BEST away well and settled off the early pace while racing along the inside in the run to the
first turn, was ran into from behind entering the first turn and briefly knocked off stride, settled three wide in the run down the backside, rallied two out from
the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. RICK'S DANCER settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. FRASER LANDING was off awkwardly, and settled well off the
early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to launch a serious late bid.
NORTHERN FORCE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

SUNBIRD away well and vied for the lead from the inside of BAK TO LIBERTY through the stretch the first time, continued to fight for the lead from along
the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, took control through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. LEGACY SQUARE
lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, was shuffled back to trail entering the second turn, launched
his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly five wide in the drive to get up for the place. ACCIDENTAL HERO lagged well off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, steadied briefly shortly after
entering the lane, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. SPACE stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail
through the stretch the first time, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive in a solid effort. LUCKY
FORCE tracked the leaders through the stretch while racing one out from the rail, maintained his tracking trip two wide in the run down the backside, tipped
three wide to loom a danger approaching the final turn. PURSUE lagged well off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time,
commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. TAPITS CHOICE settled off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon. ROCKCLIFFE settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail , dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, but was unable to make a serious late impact. BAK TO LIBERTY away alertly and raced to the lead two wide through the stretch
the first time, forced the issue two wide into the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong. WICKED NIGHT broke sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, struggled to maintain his
position racing into the final turn, and had little to offer late.

AT ATTENTION tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground along the inside, maintained his position in the run down
the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted two wide into the lane, and ran down SOARINGFORTHESUN late to prove best.
SOARINGFORTHESUN away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE tracked the leaders through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, commenced his rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three
wide in the drive to just miss the place. PAY MY WAY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced
his bid two wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing five wide in the drive. BOITANO settled off the early pace while racing
two wide through the stretch the first time, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, but was unable to make a serious late impact three out from the
rail in the drive. BIG UNION tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, dropped back to trail approaching the
final turn, rallied two wide into the turn, but needed more when called upon. FLORIDA GATOR away well and pressed the pace three wide through the
stretch the first time, continued three wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. ROOKIE YEAR broke
sharply and dueled for the lead from between rivals through the stretch the first time, continued to press the pace in the run down the backside, rallied two
wide into the final turn, checked when in tight quarters midway through the turn, and had nothing to offer late.
