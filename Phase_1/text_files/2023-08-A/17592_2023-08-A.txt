Footnotes
DON DIVA stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved up the rail around the turn, angled out to two wide in upper stretch then ran down the leader
late in the stretch and drew clear. MY HUNNY BUNNY tracked the leaders through the turn then made an inside stretch run and gave a late surge but was
not enough. TWO SIDES OF LOVE went to the front to an unchallenged lead to set the pace but was collared in the final sixteenth but held on for the show.
DENIM N LACE had no early speed but moved up around the turn and moved between horses at the eighth pole for a late rally. TEMPTRESS CALLING
chased the leaders and was not a factor. PRINCESS WIGGY prompted the early pace while under wraps on the inside then shifted out to two or three wide
going around the turn and tired. TICK ALERT saved ground but was not a threat.

Footnotes
SHE'S DANCING went to the front to set the pace and pulled away on the turn and was an easy winner. MY THOUGHTS stalked the pace down the
backstretch from the three path and moved up around the final turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch to make a late run but was no match for the
winner. EIGHT DANZAS tracked the leaders through the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch and fought gamely but was outfinished.
ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM saved ground from off the pace but failed to menace. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES vied for the lead from the two path for the first
quarter then chased the leader through the final turn and gave way. DOCTOR ABBIE trailed through the final turn and passed tired one in the stretch.
INSTINCTIVE raced wide down the backstretch but was always back.

Footnotes
FED CHAIR sprinted away to a clear lead to the middle of the final turn then was headed by outside rival but came again, dug in to edge away in the stretch
and held on for the win. SILK WAR was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a bid on the turn to engage the leader midway through and
dueled down the stretch and missed but proved to be second best. SAKETUMI floated out slightly going into the first turn then settled off the pace down the
backstretch and around the final turn but lacked room on the inside in the stretch and moved out to three wide at the eighth pole but was too late. LACCO
AMENO was unhurried through the final turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch and made a late rally. HOLY MOLY MOSES tracked the leader
down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn, moved out to four wide in upper stretch and was outfinished. CONDITION ONE bumped
with rival going into the first turn and was shuffled back and finished evenly. SACHMO bumped with rival going into the first turn and lost action, tracked
leaders down the backstretch and made a three wide mild bid on the final turn but faltered. TIME TO CRUISE remained back. BAVARIA raced in the middle
of the pack and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MINISTER QUINN went to the front to an unchallenged lead and pulled away into the turn to prove best. BEAST OR FAMINE was off the pace in the three
path then moved up on the turn but couldn't catch the winner and proved second best. BUCK WILD was allowed to settle through the turn then moved out to
four wide in upper stretch for a late rally. LIONESQUE was off the pace on the inside and lacked a late response in the drive. MR. TUTTLE raced in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn and flattened out. SCYNTZ raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground
around the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch and made a mild bid but faltered. LONG TOM passed tiring rivals. ON THE EDGE was not a
factor. DYNAMITE DUKE stalked the pace from four wide through the turn and retreated. MR. AGRO was forwardly placed on the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
FIELD LETTERS pressed the pace from the three path then the two path, engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and matched strides to deep
stretch and edged away late. RUN LAURA RUN went to a pressured lead from the two path then the inside, dueled from the three furlong marker to deep
stretch and fought gamely but was second best. ONE TOUGH ROSE prompted the pace from the inside, angled out to three wide in upper stretch and was
gaining late but was not enough. HIT A HOMER HONEY was close up on the pace on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn while racing evenly.
LONDONDERRY was last away, saved ground through the turn but never made a bid. HALLIGIRL was off the pace from the three path to the turn and
faded. PER HISA RULING #ECM2023-111, FIELD LETTERS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
U U STAR prompted the pace from the two path then took command at the top of the stretch and drew clear. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN raced in the middle of
the pack through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch to be second best. TOMATER GATOR hustled to a clear lead to the quarter pole and was over
taken but fought gamely for a furlong and faded. VIOLENT PASS reared as the gates opened and trailed the field early the was hustled along, made a two
wide bid on the turn to improve position. SUPER DUDE passed tiring rivals. WILD CARAMELO was off the pace to the turn then moved out to three wide in
upper stretch but failed to menace.
