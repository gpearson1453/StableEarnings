Footnotes
MCTIGUE (IRE) tracked the front from the two path early on jumping well to maintain position, took to the inside after flight three and remained inside until
tipped out after clearing the seventh fence, jumped well over the final flight and advanced on the leader to take over command in the fourth and final turn,
came under urging midway on that bend, edged clear under a drive in the flat and was kept to task to the finish. AWAKENED tracked the pace along the
inside, jumped late at flight five, came under urging after the final fence and improved position to be in closest pursuit of the aforementioned foe midway on
the last turn, ran on willingly to chase that rival home well clear of the rest and along second best. MERRY MAKER (IRE) saved ground in pursuit from mid
pack, jumped late at five landing with more pressure towards the hind end, came under urging once in the flat after clearing fence eight and improved
position to secure the show honors. BARBADOS (IRE) just off the inside near the rear of the field, landed just off the heels of SOLOMOON at flight five and
was briefly taken hold of, came under urging after clearing fence seven and jumped well to maintain position, passed tired rivals in the flat. CARAMELISED
(GB) a bit washy, pulled keenly early on along the inside of REALIST who matched strides in the early going, widened away as a team jumping well to
maintain the front under some pressure from the presence of his early pace rival, shook off that foe after flight four and showed the way now clear of the
field through to fence seven, came under challenge after the final flight and got placed to urging into the final turn, got displaced from command nearing
three furlongs to go, faded in the flat and tired in the stretch. SOLOMOON (GB) tracked just off the inside from mid pack, jumped late at fence five and
placed BARBADOS off his heels at that station, came under urging at the flight seven, tired in the flat and was eased home to the finish. REALIST (GB)
pulled eagerly from the two path early on matching strides with CARAMELISED to the inside, got shaken off at the fourth fence and chased in closest aim
steadily in retreat to the main flight in behind, came under urging at fence seven now entirely engulfed by the rest of the field, dropped back folding to last
into the flat, and was eased home to the finish. RESTITUTION (FR) three wide through the first two turns when tracking three wide, came under urging and
under the crop after fence six, failed to quicken and was guided to leave the course prior to fence seven, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
FAST BUCK FREDDY was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, showed good speed then pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the
two path on the turn, gained the advantage outside the quarter-pole, inched clear under the crop in upper stretch and proved best under steady urging.
FLYING IN STYLE stumbled at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the
stretch and was second best. NOBILIS dropped back early then was urged along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and improved for the show. BUSTINO SANTINO broke out then lost his footing slightly, dropped back early then settled towards the rear, was urged
two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CHALKY CAT broke out then was quickly corrected, moved up while
hustled then chased the pace, climbed late on the backstretch and into the turn, chased in the two path through that bend and tired. STAVROS bobbled
slightly at the start then was hustled, was taken in hand while in tight between horses early, raced on the outside under urging, went four wide on the turn,
dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, failed to swap leads when thrown in by the rider in the vicinity of the furlong marker and
came up empty. FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE broke out and bumped with a foe, moved up to set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the
turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC DREAMS prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, gained the lead late on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came in a
path at the three-sixteenths then was put to a right-handed crop, battled outside of the runner-up to the finish and proved best under strong urging. UN OJO
went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage late on that bend, came under a left-handed crop
in upper stretch, fought on with the winner to the finish and missed while clear for the place. WILD BANKER moved in into the first turn, tossed his head
while rank in the two path on that bend, settled more kindly on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch,
pursued the top two under a drive into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. SHADOW DRAGON moved from the rail
to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, shifted out near the five-eighths pole, was roused late on the backstretch then angled in, dropped from
the two path to the rail early on the far turn, shifted three wide outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty.
MASON MANIA was caught in the five path on the first turn, raced off the pace under urging, traveled four wide under strong encouragement going around
the final turn and failed to respond. EL HERMANO moved in entering the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was urged along while outside on the
backstretch, raced five wide early on the far turn, dropped to the three then two path later on that bend and was no factor. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES was
hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the four path, settled on the outside, came up empty in the three path on the final turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BROCKNARDINI lunged slightly at the break, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five wide at
that station, was on the wrong lead and lugged in to the two path when offering a strong bid straightened away overhauling the leader just inside
three-sixteenths to go, then edged clear to the finish corrected and kept to task. COACH SESSA just off the inside tracking the front from near the rear of
the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch, lugged in straightened away and ran on to chase the winner
home clear of the rest and along second best. BERNIETAKESCHARGE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled three wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors getting up in the very last jump to the line. RUN FOR YOUR HONEY
dueled in hand along the inside with FIND YOUR JOY to the outside, widened away from the rest as a pair, had the field take closer order into the far turn
and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got overhauled just inside the three-sixteenths and weakened to the
finish. BELVOIR coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. ONCE AN EAGLE tracked the pace along the inside coming under brief coaxing near the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, was paused in behind foes through to the sixteenth marker, moved to the rail at that juncture given a
tap with the crop to the right side shoulder twice while finishing without making an impact. ALOTTA JAYS brushed the off side stall at the start, chased just
off the inside until tucked inside placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. CHARITY FIRST two to three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch and tired. FIND YOUR JOY dueled in hand from the
two path widening away in concert with her main pace foe, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack,
tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch rallying to take command with
three-sixteenths to go, then dug in under threat to the outside and held gamely to prevail. PORTOS saved ground in pursuit from near the rear early on,
steadily made progress to mid pack when tipped off the rail to move around the retreating former leader and went three wide at the three-eighths, tipped four
wide placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, following the aforementioned foe before swinging seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying through the final furlong to latch on the leader to the outside, tussled through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. SALTO DE TIGRE
broke in at the start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to
secure the show honors. LORD CAPTAIN three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide into upper stretch, flattened out in the late stages. BOBBY G coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. LOST IN ROME coaxed from the start,
chased three then two wide advancing on the leader to take command seven-sixteenths from home, showed the way through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home clinging to command, yielded near the three-sixteenths and weakened. HANG TIGHT three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. KING OF HOLLYWOOD coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand along the inside spurting away early on, had the field take closer order near the half mile pole and yielded the front at the
seven-sixteenths, retreated through the turn and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, faltered and was eased home through the stretch to the
finish. CENTAVO chased just off the inside until tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into
upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the wire. JUST CALL RAY chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and was eased home through the final furlong.

Footnotes
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) was hustled from the front then moved in, showed the way on the inside, was asked some on the far turn then roused for
more near the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch then dropped in a bit while straightening, shook off a foe under one tap of a right-handed crop
into the final furlong and extended the advantage under a brisk hand-ride to prove much the best. WHITE FROST was taken up some while rank along the
rail early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved on the inside, raced inside on the final turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, pursed the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. REGAL REALM stalked the pace on the outside in the two path
while tugging on the bit under restraint, was let out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then dropped in a bit, chased the winner into the final
furlong and weakened then just held the show. HAUGHTY was taken in hand between horses on the initial straightaway, went two then three wide on the
first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path while between foes, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response then just missed the show. EMINENT VICTOR dropped back early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back,
went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the needed response.
EVVIE JETS was beaten to the front, shifted from the rail to the three path on the first turn, settled outside without the benefit of cover, was given her cue in
the three path on the far turn, chased five wide into the stretch and tired. RUNAWAY RUMOUR angled in at the back, saved ground while reserved at the
rear, spun into the two path entering the stretch and failed to rally.

offered no response. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,

Footnotes
FULIGNI was taken in hand between foes early then settled off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide, rallied four
wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was put to a
left-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best. LA AGUILILLA settled well back on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn
then driven six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. MO TOWN MADISON was carried in after the start, settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came off the rail outside the eighth-pole, chased into the final furlong and weakened but just held
the show. PERPETUAL PRAISE was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive in
upper stretch and tired then just lost the show. MADDIE'S SURPRISE angled in early then was straightened before making any contact with a rival, chased
the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. DEVILLY was urged along on the outside, went four
wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. INTO TOURING settled at the back while inside of a foe, saved ground on the turn and
was no factor. BABY SOX was hustled from the gate then came inward early, chased the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn and tired.
