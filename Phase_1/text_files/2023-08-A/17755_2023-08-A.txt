Footnotes
NORTHERN JEWEL saved ground inside, found running room along the rail at the head of the lane, and narrowly prevailed after a long hard drive. FOUR O
SIX CREED broke alertly, sat in striking range of the pacesetters from the three path, drove three wide to challenge the front, dueled outside of
READYTOTAPNSING into the stretch, inched clear of that rival then rallied determinedly outside of NORTHERN JEWEL but was lost the bob.
READYTOTAPNSING prompted the early pace under a snug hold, gained the lead approaching the final turn then was soon joined by FOUR O SIX
CREED, was unable to match strides in the late stages and gave way. LIFES ADVENTURE held a slim advantage entering the backstretch, was overtaken
in the far turn and faded steadily through the stretch. SHURAZ chased outside and was outrun.

Footnotes
ROSE ROSE ROSE pressed the pace from the rail, dropped back in the far turn, swung four wide at the head of the lane, took over, and was kept to task.
TENDER LOVE raced at the back of the pack while three wide, drifted in under right-handed encouragement then met traffic, and finished well done the
lane to edge out QUEENS OVER JACK'S for second. QUEENS OVER JACK'S chased the pace from the five path, dueled through the far turn outside of
MILITARY SASS, was overtaken into the stretch and was edged out for second. WISH ON A STAR contested the early pace between rivals, and came up
empty in the drive. MILITARY SASS attended the pace while four wide, dueled inside of QUEENS OVER JACK'S in the far turn, and wilted entering the
stretch.

reminders. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK bumped away, tracked inside, chased entering the final turn but was no match for the winner and finished second
best. TIMELY LIFE dueled from the three path, was unable to keep pace with rival and kept on evenly through the stretch. PRENTON chased three wide
leaving the backstretch, and faded. INVENTION FACTORY bumped leaving, chased from the back of the pack, and gave way.

PUMP THE BRAKES chased the pace while three wide, kept the pressure on FAST EH into the stretch and got by in time. FAST EH set the pace from just
off the rail, was under steady pressure through the stretch and was caught in the final yards. JULIUS THE GREAT tracked four wide, lacked the kicked
needed and held on for show. DUNE D'ORO trailed the field early, and closed late missing out. ISLE OF SKYE stumbled leaving the gate, chased four wide
leaving the backstretch, and flattened out.

Footnotes
MANFORALLSEASONS stalked inside, angled out to the two path setting his sights on MR. KALYPSO, closed steadily overtaking the front deep stretch,
and just held under a late closing LITTLE CHICAGO. LITTLE CHICAGO allowed to settle early, dropped back leaving the backstretch, swung out five to six
wide, closed steadily then dug in, in the final strides and narrowly missed. MR. KALYPSO hurried outside then cut the corner heading into the backstretch,
showed the way while saving ground, was showing signs of tiring nearing the stretch, and was caught deep stretch. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR fanned three
wide leaving the opening turn, moved up into striking position, and lacked a closing response. TAPIT TO THE WIRE chased in range while outside, and
yielded in stretch. MAJESTIC CAFE stalked three to four, and had little left in the stretch run. CARSON'S LEGACY settled in range but failed to produce a
bid.

Footnotes
AGENT C rated off the pace from the five path, went in pursuit of the front then overtook the lead at the quarter pole, and pulled away under handling.
SAYGE'S SPIRIT reserved off the early pacesetters from the six path, advanced quickly in the final turn, closed gamely but was no match for the winner and
finished up clearly second best. AMEER raced widest through the backstretch, closed gradually under steady urging, and dug in late to earn show. CLEVER
CONNECTION chased inside, shifted out to the two path in the far turn, drove inside at the head of the stretch and was edged out for show. WIDE EYED
WILEY trailed the field early, closed late, and finished on the wire at the same time as CHARMING VINTAGE. CHARMING VINTAGE showed the way from
the two path, was overtaken at the quarter pole and yielded in stretch finishing alongside WIDE EYED WILEY for fifth. MAMA'S PROUD JOKE reared at the
start, chased wide and gave way. CARRERA CABALLO sat just off the pace while four wide, and faded steadily inside. RUN ROSSCO RUN stalked two to
three wide, was through early, and was eased.

SMILIN EVIE vied inside from the three path, gained the advantage in the far turn, moved clear under steady handling, and was geared down late. TAKE
CHARGE GWEN brushed away from the gate, shifted outside in the backstretch, rallied four wide at the head of the stretch, and inched up to earn place.
CHATTY GAL was reserved off the early pacesetters, angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, rallied inside through the stretch and was bested late.
CUVEE TEE bumped leaving the gate, and closed well late. EDGE OF OKOTOKS vied hard outside, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, chased
rival into the lane, and yielded in the stretch. LITTLE ROSALYN broke inward into CUVEE TEE, trailed and launched a late bid. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY
brushed leaving, raced wide through the backstretch, and gave way. DAZZLING CHIC lacked early speed, and failed to threaten. WITHIN REASON
