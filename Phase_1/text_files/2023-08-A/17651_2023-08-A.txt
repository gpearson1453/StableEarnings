Footnotes
CASHEL KITTEN Broke sluggishly, vied for the lead along the two path and under pressure proved best. PEANUTBUTTERTOAST Broke slow, rushed out
to contest the lead along the rail, battled inside and finished well. POT OF GOLD In hand along the two path, asked, gained, lacked room while trying to split
rivals late and checked. MACLYRICAL Close up four wide into the turn, three path out of it and faded. TRITON'S CREED Saved ground and weakened.
HONOR MR. BABY Close up along the three path early, continued on that path and tired. KHALI BULLET Four wide into the turn trailing, five wide leaving it
and tired. DARK MARKET Broke in the air, lagged back inside and tired.
