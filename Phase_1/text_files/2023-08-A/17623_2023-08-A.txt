Footnotes
SUE GENEROUS assumed command leaving the break and dictated terms into the first turn, drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run and was well
handled through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, held a clear lead to the quarter marker, felt pressure inside of the furlong pole, dug in while all
out into deep stretch, was fully extended in the final strides and gamely lasted for the win at the wire. BIG GIFT was unhurried in the early running, tracked
the modest pace from a ground saving position through the backstretch run, came two wide into the far turn, was roused three wide into the drive, closed
inside of the furlong marker, vied for the lead while widest nearing the sixteenth-pole, drifted in a bit inside of the sixteenth-marker and made contact with
MOONSHINE CAT, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while just holding for the place. MOONSHINE CAT tracked the modest early pace
while outside of rivals, moved up heading to the half-mile marker and ran in pursuit of SUE GENEROUS to the quarter pole, rallied nearing the furlong
marker, continued that bid while between runners heading to the sixteenth-marker, was bumped by BIG GIFT in deep stretch and just missed for the win
and place at the finish, while holding clearly for the show. BIG FAME lost her path at the start and was off a step slowly, stalked the modest early pace into
the backstretch run, tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, lost ground along the far turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and
weakened in the final stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT BIG GIFT DRIFTED IN, MADE CONTACT WITH MOONSHINE CAT AND IN DOING SO COST MOONSHINE CAT THE
OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. BIG GIFT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
JAYS ANGEL pressed the solid early pace while outside of DANCING BONBON, drifted out a path along the turn then was steered back to the two path
nearing the quarter marker, chased DANCING BONBON to mid-stretch, rallied in the final furlong, collared DANCING BONBON in deep stretch and held in
a drive in the late stages. MORO FIRST CLASS chased the fast early pace while outside of rivals, was a bit hard to place while entering the turn, drifted to
the four path before correcting and chased two wide to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, shifted out a path inside of the furlong marker, closed
with a rush in deep stretch and missed for the win, while getting up in the final strides to secure the place. DANCING BONBON was forwardly placed leaving
the break and was sent to establish the early lead, set solid fractions while pressured into the turn, extended the lead along the bend while drifting out a bit
nearing the quarter marker, was steered back to the rail and drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, was kept to task while holding safely to the
sixteenth-marker, was collared by the winner in deep stretch and was just edged for the place, while holding clearly for the show. JERSEY BIRD chased the
solid early pace from the inside, improved position on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a final response. RIVIERA SUNRISE chased the
solid early pace from the rear, was outrun along the turn, trailed into the drive and did not threaten. WESTERN TOWN broke alertly and was prominent in
the early stages, pressed the pace while outside of rivals into the turn, lost ground while four then three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun to
mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
OAT MILK LATTE was allowed to settle, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run while outside of an inner rival, shifted to the four path along
the far turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, was asked for run in upper stretch, chased HAPPY IS to the furlong marker, overtook that
rival inside of the sixteenth-marker and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. ZAFFERANA was unhurried while saving ground in the early stages,
moved to the three path approaching the quarter marker, swung widest into upper stretch and mounted a five wide bid into the drive, finished well in the final
sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not get by OAT MILK LATTE in the final strides and bested the rest. AMANDA ROSE hopped at
the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit rank in the early stages and pulled on the rider while three wide into the first turn, was content to trail through
the backstretch run, chased two wide along the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, shifted out a path at mid-stretch and raced widest into the final
furlong, closed willingly in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure the show. HAPPY IS was sent to be forwardly placed in the early running,
contested the pace with WHATWASTHENISNOW into the first turn, shook free along the backstretch run and set decent fractions to the half-mile marker,
came under pressure again from WHATWASTHENISNOW nearing the quarter marker, repelled that bid and extended the lead at the furlong grounds, was
all out approaching the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final stages and faltered, while just being edged for the show. BIG JOLT
stalked the decent early pace from the inside, maintained her position through the backstretch run while well placed, gave chase while saving ground along
the far turn, made a mild gain at the furlong marker but could not sustain that run into deep stretch and lacked a final response. WHATWASTHENISNOW
broke alertly, contested the early pace with HAPPY IS while outside of that rival into the first turn, attended to the pace along the backstretch run then
pressed HAPPY IS along the far turn, was turned away heading into the stretch drive and weakened in the late going. ELEGANCE CODE settled in
mid-pack while saving ground, saved all of the ground to the far turn, made a mild gain at the furlong marker but could not sustain that run in the final stages
and did not threaten. HERSABIGGIRL settled outside of rivals along the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid along
the far turn, could not keep pace into the drive, weakened in the final furlong and did not factor. NOBLE HEARTED was forwardly placed into the first turn,
tracked the decent pace while off of the rail through the backstretch run, was well placed while two wide and between runners approaching the second turn,
was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, failed to respond to firm urging in the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
UNION COACH showed good early speed leaving the break, contested the solid pace while outside of a rival into the turn, came in a bit while outside of BIG
CATTY and crowded that rival midway through the turn, took command nearing the quarter marker and extended the lead into upper stretch, responded to
urging inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the final stages in a good debut. STREET TIGER chased the solid early pace, maintained a two wide
path to the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and
just held for the place. CRYPTO CRUSH chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, lost ground while three wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch, raced widest into the final furlong, closed in deep stretch and just missed for the place, while getting up in time to secure the show. BIG CATTY was
prominent in the early running and pressed the decent pace while inside of UNION COACH, was bothered a bit by that rival along the turn and steadied
while in tight nearing the quarter marker, lost position nearing the top of the stretch, gave chase to the furlong grounds, weakened in the final stages and
was outfinished for the show. CANDY LITZ chased the decent early pace while widest into the turn, raced four then three wide into the bend and lost ground
nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and did not threaten. ABOVE THE FOLD lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn and
made a mild gain nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the stretch run and did not factor.

WESTWARD BREEZE was off a step slowly, settled while saving ground into the turn, made a mild gain nearing the quarter marker, was guided to the
outside and swung widest for the drive, improved position at the furlong grounds, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth, came within aim in deep stretch
and was up in the final strides to prevail. HARBOR'S ROSE was forwardly placed in the early stages then rated off of the fast pace into the turn, chased the
decent pace while two wide along the bend, tipped three wide for the drive and closed to come within aim at the furlong marker, overtook BLUEBERRY
MUFFIN in deep stretch to take command, was just nipped on the wire for the win and held for the place in a good effort. SWEET LAYLA RAE tracked the
solid early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground while three wide on the turn, maintained that three wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong marker, closed fast in deep stretch, vied for the lead in the final strides and just missed for the win and place, while getting up in time to secure the
show. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN showed good early speed, disputed the solid pace while outside of rivals into the turn, took a narrow lead while two wide along
the bend, battled with ANNA'S MUSIC to the furlong marker, shook free then was caught by HARBOR'S ROSE inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not
hold off oncoming rivals in the final strides and was outfinished. ANNA'S MUSIC was prominent in the early running and pressed the pace while inside of
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, saved ground to the top of the lane and battled with BLUEBERRY MUFFIN to
mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and weakened. ASSUREDLY chased the early pace then took back approaching the turn, came two
wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and did not mount a late rally. BET DE VRON bobbled at the start, recovered to be
prominent in the early running and raced close to the decent early pace, chased from the rail along the turn, checked while in tight nearing the quarter
marker, lost position into the stretch and faded. TWO TWELVE was fractious prior to the start, raced in tight quarters in the opening furlong, steadied and
was shuffled back heading to the half-mile marker, recovered and chased outside of rivals into the turn, raced within aim while two wide nearing the quarter
marker, swung four wide for the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

ASCENDANCY took back off of the early pace and tracked while outside of a rival into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, continued that gain
into the far turn and was given her cue while three wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied in mid-stretch and confronted EVER SMART approaching the
furlong grounds, responded to urging and took command into the final sixteenth, put away EVER SMART in deep stretch and drove clear in the end. EVER
SMART was prominent in the early running and stalked the pace while three wide along the first turn, advanced position along the backstretch run and
prompted the pace to the half-mile marker, confronted the pacesetter along the second turn and took command approaching the top of the lane, was set
down in upper stretch and was confronted by ASCENDANCY at the furlong grounds, met that bid to the sixteenth-pole but could not hold off the winner in
the final stages and was outfinished, while holding for the place. ASSIGNATION was unhurried in the early running, saved all of the ground through the
backstretch run, came in tight while along the rail nearing the three-furlong marker and shifted two wide into the far turn, gained ground at the quarter pole,
came two then three wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, shifted four wide into deep stretch, closed well in the final stages and just
won the nod on the wire for the show. UNDISTURBED stalked the decent early pace from the inside, tracked the leaders while outside of a rival through the
backstretch run, gained ground along the far turn while two wide, was steered four wide into upper stretch, lost position at the furlong marker, finished
evenly in the final stages and just missed for the show. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled along the rail in the early running, was well placed through the
backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, made a mild gain into upper stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and was
outkicked in deep stretch. MADEIRA WINE was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions while on a clear lead into the backstretch run, showed
the way to the half-mile pole while carving out a solid pace, was confronted along the second turn and was overtaken nearing the quarter marker, chased to
the furlong pole and faded in the final stages. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY broke in the air at the start and spotted the field in the early stages, trailed to the
second turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals late but did not threaten. BELLEO'S FOREST settled in the second flight
while outside of a rival in the early going, lugged out and raced four to five wide along the bend then recovered into the backstretch run, maintained her
position to the half-mile marker, made a mild gain while three wide along the far turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and did not factor in the late
stages. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL was forwardly placed while two wide in the early stages, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, lost ground
heading to the quarter marker and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ELCONDOR was sent hard from the start quickly angled over to the rail, gained the early advantage then was clear of the field by the half mile pole, held
sway through the turn with four rivals in close pursuit, came into the stretch in the three path then veered sharply to the six path at the top of the stretch, had
enough left to fend off a fast closing MY BUCKET LIST and just lasted. MY BUCKET LIST stumbled slightly at the break then was carried out very wide
when DRAW SOME impeded his path after the break, altered course to the inside then raced three to four wide throughout, tipped out to the five path for the
stretch run and rallied nicely to just miss despite being carried out some in mid-stretch when MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE altered course. MISCHIEVOUS
PIRATE came away well despite some contact with LUCKY DIABLO from the outside, contested the early pace, checked briefly down the backstretch run
when ELCONDOR cut across his path, then moved out a path to re-engage the leaders going into the turn, had to alter course at the top of the stretch to
avoid ELCONDOR once again when that one veered out, ran on to the finish but could not find another gear when needed in the late stages. BEGIN AGAIN
stumbled at the break then while off-balance bumped hard into LUCKY DIABLO, recovered, then made some steady forward progress on the leaders to
move into serious contention by the three eighths marker, stayed to the inside through the turn and entered the stretch with a chance and finished up well
but was not quite enough to crack the top three. NORDIC SEA got a clean break then was not pressed for speed and was outrun down the backstretch, kept
to task with encouragement from the rider and managed to pass a few in the final furlong. WESTERN SIERRA broke well then set out to contest the early
pace, got put in a bit tight near the seven-sixteenths marker then shifted out out a path but was then forced to duel between horses while in tight quarters
going into the turn then dropped back off the pace near the quarter pole and was unable to recover from there. DRAW SOME ducked out after the break
and bothered MY BUCKET LIST, raced three wide and in the middle of the pack early on, struggled to keep up with the pace from the turn and struggled
home running one-paced to the finish. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY ducked in sharply at the start, saved ground and came under heavy pressure early but was
unable to make an impact. LUCKY DIABLO got pinballed into MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE when bumped hard by BEGIN AGAIN from the outside at the start,
steadied, then fell well behind the field and trailed throughout. THERE WAS A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF MISCHIEVOUS
PIRATE AGAINST THE RIDER OF ELCONDOR FOR THE INCIDENT IN UPPER TO MID-STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT THE OBJECTION WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
