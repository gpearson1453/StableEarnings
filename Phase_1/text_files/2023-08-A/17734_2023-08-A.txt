Footnotes
GRACE'S SOLDIER broke with the leaders, allowed the early pace to go in the run up the backstretch, between horses in the second flight through the turn,
came three wide for the drive, closed with good late energy to win going away. EARLY DAWN broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded in good
order, away well, set a pressured pace for three furlongs closest to the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, extended that advantage past the furlong
marker, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. PINTORA bothered at the start to be away tardily, improved toward the inside turn, in
striking position upper stretch, lacked a closing punch while saving the show. KASENS TRIBE off slowly, remained devoid of speed for three furlongs,
lodged a willingly rally inside and through traffic to be gaining for the show. SPARKLE CITY raced in mid pack off the inside, roused when angling out five
wide into the stretch, improved a bit past the furlong marker then was flat the final sixteenth. SUNSET FLASH lacked speed for three furlongs off the inside,
five wide into the lane, improved position and also went a bit flat late. GLITZ AND GLAMOUR broke out but alertly to bother PINTORA, was straightened
and pressed the runner up off the inside for three furlongs and gave way. LUCCA'S LILYBY broke back, raced four wide through the turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. TIZ A BREAKUP failed to menace. NIKLAUSIA was finished early. SHARE THE DOE forwardly placed early
outside, tired while four wide into the stretch. PLEADING GUILTY fanned six wide exiting the turn, also tired.

Footnotes
SIKARA SIKARA settled off the pace, moved closer in the second turn, moved out a bit and challenged between the two leaders approaching the furlong
grounds, edged clear under steady handling. NODAH took control past the wire the first time, dueled the middle part closest to the inside, could not match
the winner late, held sway for the place. BANDIT'S PRIDE pressed the runner up early from the outside, moved up to duel before half, got out a bit into the
lane affording the winner a large opening, weakened a bit to finish up best of the rest. MUCHMORETHANREADY last to leave, lacked speed, saved ground,
displayed a mild amount of late interest to better position. SCARLET STORM in mid pack while out in the course early, pulled in the run up the backstretch,
came up empty for the drive. THE CALLING STONE hopped at the start, back off the pace, failed to muster a closing response. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA
forwardly placed for a half, faded.

Footnotes
CRYPTO BRAVE settled off the pace and the inside, asked along midway on the turn, behind some traffic into the lane, shifted out for room when
straightened for home, closed with good resolve to be up in time. ROADSIDE GIRL forwardly placed inside, advanced on the leader and challenged inside
that one past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner. TROSKA back off the pace, moved out, swung five wide out of the turn, rallied down
the middle of the strip to finish willingly and to be getting to the runer up late. ROARING QUINN in the second flight outside, four wide through the turn,
drifted in behind some traffic midstretch, finished up evenly. MARINA broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, set the pace, allowed the runner up the rail nearing
midstretch, faltered when headed by that one. T J'S SUNSHINE broke back, lacked speed, raced four wide out of the turn, improved position with some
belated interest. RESPECT ALL lacked speed, made little impact. ALL AMERICAN PAT in mid pack off the inside, checked up in some traffic entering the
turn, fell back a bit, came five wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. TALENTS HOT DEAL chased the leader for three furlongs and gave way. BLUE
RIDGE ROMANCE saved ground to no avail in remaining back. ASTRO FLASH broke back, was five wide into the turn, angled in a bit was was finished
early.

MALIBU S S shuffled back a bit out of the chute to trail early, advanced three wide to challenge through the turn, extended duel through the stretch,
narrowly gained the nod at the wire. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, challenged between foes into the lane, dueled
inside the winner to the wire, proved stubborn to the wire to narrowly mis.l. BIND FAITH broke out, closest to the early leader while between foes
backstretch, fell back turn, came four wide for the drive, finished up clear of the rest while not a threat to the top two. JOLLY TOMMY one paced toward the
inside, lacked a serious closing response. JAZZ IT UP broke alertly, sprinted clear, showed the way into the turn, vied inside the top two into the stretch,
faltered soon after. SPECIAL OPERATOR finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
HAL'S DREAM unhurried early inside, crept closer while in hand before a half, slipped through along the rail under clever handling late in the final turn,
challenged with a rail bid upper straight, edged clear late under steady handling. ANGEL OF VERDUN in the second flight while toward the inside,
continued to stalk while in traffic late in the final turn, set down when clear in upper stretch, finished with good determination to annex the place.
HONORARY GUEST settled in mid pack while off the inside, four wide exiting the final turn, displayed some late interest to improve position, not enough for
the runner up spot in the final strides. DOLLY'S GUITAR took command past the wire the first time, set the pace while racing just off the inside, continued to
show the way into the stretch, allowed the winner the inside soon after, gave ground grudgingly to that one until late. FOR REAL ALICE within striking
distance, moved closer in the three path late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. SAVVY SHIPMAN last away, trailed early,
came three wide for the drive, angled in, improved position with some late interest. J Z'S FIRST void of speed, came five wide for the drive, went evenly the
final furlong in lacking a late punch. MSCHITCHATTOUR remained back in failing to threaten. PROUD VICTORIA steadied in traffic soon after the start,
lacked speed, in some additional traffic far turn, four wide into the lane, failed to mount a bid. CRIDER CHASE prompted the issue up front for almost six
furlongs, had little left for the drive in giving way. LAKE RUNNER forwardly placed early, fell back steadily the second quarter, continued to fade and trailed
in.

Footnotes
MARY JACK settled off the pace, asked along three to four wide turn, rallied widest down the lane and closed with good resolve to be up in time. TAYLOR'S
SECRET forwardly placed, roused three wide into the lane, challenged outside the leader with a furlong to run, took over, led late, could not contain the
winner. SWEET BAY lacked speed four a half off the inside, shaken up with a right handed crop into the lane, late rally to be in time for the show, not a
threat to the top pair. BIND ON EARTH moved up to take control after the start, shook clear in the turn, offered brief resistance to the runner up when that
one challenged from the outside past the furlong marker then faltered when headed by that same foe soon after. ITSNOTMYJOB raced three wide most of
the way, lacked a serious closing response. LAURIEANN prompted the issue early, chased the leader through the turn then began to give way in upper
strtch. COUNTRY DREAM was finished early while racing in the two path. BLONDIE LOX BABE fell back to trail after the start and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ROCKET DOCTOR behind the pace early inside, avoided a chain reaction of interference as a result, moved out backstretch, advanced three wide to
challenge second turn, long drive to the wire, showed good determination late to prove best. HARD KINGS broke forwardly, came out to set off a chain
reaction of interference into the first turn, recovered to race forwardly just ahead of the winner, briefly boxed inside that one turning for home, challenged
between horses with a furlong to run, outdueled by the victor late, while edging clear for the second spot. SASSI D closest to the leader early, continued to
pursue that one up the backstretch, challenged second turn, gained the advantage into the lane, was joined by the top two a furlong out, could not match
that pair to the wire, well clear of the others. SYVESTAR in some early traffic past the wire the first time, six wide into the first turn, angled in, dropped all the
way to the rail past the furlong marker, displayed a mild amount of late interest. MARVINS' POSSE carried very wide in that trouble in the first turn, angled
in, went evenly in lacking a closing response. UNCLE HUTCH sprinted clear to set the early pace, continued to show the way up the backstretch, weakened
when headed entering the stretch. SEA OF LIGHT took up across a rival's heels into the first turn, remained back after recovering. POPPA BEAR broke a
step slow, failed to menace in lacking a closing response. INGLIS carried out into the first turn, remained wide, fell back and was well beaten. NOW NOW
SAINT carried extremely wide as another victim of the incident in the first turn, fell back, lost contact with the field, distanced through the stretch.

Footnotes
ONEROLLOFTHEDICE broke back, moved up to race in the second flight, patiently handled toward the inside behind the lead group through the turn,
moved out a lodged a bid between rivals nearing midstretch, spirited drive to the finish, proved game while still between horses at the wire. FLASHY MEG
broke on top, narrowly set a pressured pace early, dueled into the lane, briefly garnered a larger advantage in upper stretch, responded when challenged
not long after, proved stubborn to the end. MY FRIEND AMY back off the early pace, ranged up to a challenging position four wide by late in the turn, lodged
a bid inside the furlong grounds, outfinished by the top two late. MARIAH'S CANDY pressed early between rivals and outside the winner, fell back a bit
through the turn, went evenly through the lane. BROKE FINANCING pressed the issue up the backstretch three wide, moved to challenge and dueled
outside the early leader late in the turn, weakened through the stretch. CAVE CREEK last away, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. HALF PAGE
remained back in lacking a closing bid.

Footnotes
CHAOSMOS moved up after the start to stalk the pace three wide, closest to the leader into the lane, wore that foe down under firm handling, took over then
held the runner up safe late. ONE TIME GEM in the second flight off the inside, came four wide for the drive, set down, slowly getting to the winner late
while outside that one. EGO last away, void of early foot, improved while saving ground into the lane, continued with mild interest to gain the show, not
enough for the top two. STANDING MAN broke on top, set the pace along the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the stretch, responded
briefly when confronted inside the furlong grounds then faltered. JACI'S ROYALTY pressed the issue early, remained in a forward position the middle half,
had little left for the drive. RUN ROCKET one placed throughout while well off the pace and the inside. WISH UPON A STAR broke back, lacked speed,
made little impact while racing outside. PINCH ASSAULT was finished after a half. MORE LIKE IT stopped after four furlongs, finished far back.
