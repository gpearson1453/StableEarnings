rounding the far turn, came three wide into the lane, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. ELNATH settled off the pace along the inside,
advanced two wide between rivals around the far turn, bid inside of the winner in upper stretch, angled out leaving the eighth pole but was unable to gain
late. BOWTIE DIVA stalked the pace three wide and finished evenly to maintain the show. HEAVY TIPPER was in range while racing four wide throughout

Footnotes
UNION RALLY was off slowly, advanced two wide around the turn, came three wide into the lane, lugged in in upper stretch, straightened out under steady
left-handed urging and drove clear. DECO STRONG set the pace outside, angled to the rail once clear nearing the half-mile pole, lost the lead while hard
ridden around the turn, kept plugging away inside of foes and re-bid for the place. MAJESTIC GREELEY was reluctant to load, raced off the early pace,
cruised up in hand two wide around the turn, seized the lead midway around the bend, led to midstretch and weakened. SPECTACULLARI bobbled leaving
the gate, raced three wide and failed to menace. LATIMORE CREEK went in the air at the start, saved ground and played no factor. FULLMOON BAY had
early speed inside and faded after a half.

LUNAR PRIZE dueled between foes down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the turn, edged ahead in upper stretch and held sway.
JEBOLOGIST vied inside of the winner down the backstretch, was shuffled back entering the turn, angled out to race three wide around the bend then
rallied outside to gain the place. FRAY vied four wide down the backstretch, pressed outside of the winner around the turn, stayed on through the lane but
lost second late. YES SIR COLONEL had early speed between foes, dropped back around the turn, drifted out through the lane and lacked a closing bid.

PAGE DOWN set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. NORMANDY BEACH stalked the pace two and three wide, was under a full drive
around the turn, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on for the place. VAUGHAN raced well off the pace three wide and was along for the
show. TWO RED CENTS settled off the pace while racing two wide, made some progress inside in upper stretch but flattened out and lost third late. GET
THE POINT tracked the pace three and four wide and faded after a half. KONKIE had only brief speed inside. SOCAROO was outrun inside.

THE GREAT CASBY settled off the pace three wide, went four wide around the far turn, closed down the center of the track and was up in the final strides.
M G BROKER stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, battled between through the lane and just missed. MIDNIGHT ACT set the
pace along the rail, dug in inside of foes in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. BRONX SANDMAN saved ground in range, lacked room in upper
stretch, got clear at the rail leaving the eighth pole but lacked the needed rally. SEPICATO pressed the pace two wide, battled on between to midstretch
then tired.

A TO Z was bumped between rivals at the start, had speed three wide, seized command approaching the three-eighths pole, drew off around the bend and
remained well clear under a drive. FIELD OFFICER settled off the early pace toward the inside, went three wide around the turn and finished willingly to be
clearly second best. BOLOGNESE set the pace along the rail, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn, was late to switch leads, drifted out and
held third. BULLAGER bumped the winner at the start, had early speed between foes but retreated around the turn. SIDER ON DA MOUND was bumped at
the start, saved ground and played no further factor. BACKCOUNTRY played no factor while racing four wide.
