Footnotes
SCARLET BOW broke readily to gain a narrow advantage racing into the first turn, dictated the pace shifting a bit off the rail entering the backstretch, edged
clear after a half and held sway to the end under firm handling and a few right handed taps. BLAZING BROOKE, in touch with the eventual winner in the
opening stages attending that rival's pace under light rating, conceded some position after a half, came under pressure entering the far turn to advance but
could never regain even terms with that foe. LADY LOVE tracked the leaders along the inside into the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the
far turn but finished evenly through late stages. FLASHY PATCH raced three deep between foes tracking off the first flight into the backstretch and faded
after a half. LAPULGA broke slowly, angled inwards entering the backstretch but never gained contention. MI CUAIMA, caught four deep as part of the
second flight racing through the first turn, retreated early.

Footnotes
DUDE'S SECRET angled inwards a bit racing to the first turn to track the pacesetter from just out of striking distance outside a rival under light rating to the
backstretch, continued under patient handling three deep in that position into the far turn and produced a steady closing response racing through the stretch
to wrest command and kick clear in time under firm handling. RACHIELY'S DREAM shifted off the rail while moving to gain a forward placing tracking just off
the pacesetter in tandem with the eventual winner, continued between foes through the backstretch into the far turn, moved to challenge for command
leaving the quarter mile marker, took over in upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure in late stages and yielded to the winner. AND I KNOW angled to
the inside early to track off the second flight to the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch and advanced through close quarters to prevail for a share.
CASCABELL QUEEN was urged to gain the lead from the outset shifting off the rail, set the pace on a comfortable margin into the far turn but gave way
once headed racing into upper stretch. RED KITTEN tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and offered no rally. REINA LA KELSY,
outpaced in early stages, drifted wide into the stretch while proving no threat. ALL THIS JAZZ, caught four wide tracking off the second flight to the
backstretch, retreated after a half.

UNCOMMON FACTOR, brushed, then carried in a bit at the start, was urged to gain the lead from between foes in the opening sixteenth, dictated the pace
off the rail on a clear margin racing into the turn, then held sway through the stretch under firm right handed encouragement. SAMMY'S TOWN broke
inwards brushing the eventual winner carrying that rival inwards, was righted quickly to track that foe between rivals racing to the turn, shifted out on the turn
while being prompted to advance but couldn't gain even terms while proving best of the others. DIAMOND NEWS tracked off the second flight along the
inside in the opening quarter, shifted to the four path nearing upper stretch and gained some position but lacked the needed late response. CHARGING
RENEE was rated inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, came under pressure to advance on the turn but proved empty in the
drive. ADONAI BLESS, shuffled back avoiding traffic at the start, tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing into the turn and continued evenly while
gaining some position into the lane. COMMANDER OF DEATH tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn, but faded
early. PRINCESS BRIENNE, urged along three deep between foes in pursuit of the leaders, gave way early. EYE ON THE FINISH was settled last dropping
well off the field while angling to the inside but failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
KING DADDIO broke inwards bumping NICOLE MUNNINGS, was quickly righted to gain a position just outside the first flight racing four wide through the
backstretch, shifted in steadily advancing on the leaders three deep nearing upper stretch, took over entering the lane and kicked clear under firm left
handed encouragement. CREDIT CYCLE was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch but
weakened when failing to match the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. WELD angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the
turn and weakened through the stretch. GETTININTOMISCHIEF tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide entering
the lane and gained some position in an even effort. NICOLE MUNNINGS, bumped at the start while ducking inwards exchanging repeated contact with
FOUNTAINSTREETKID, was collected off that rival while shifting out five wide tracking off the second flight, was prompted to make some brief progress four
wide racing through the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. BROWN ESSENCE was settled off the second flight between
foes racing to the turn and offered no rally. KING TIDE tracked off the second flight along the rail and steadily faded into the turn. FOUNTAINSTREETKID
exchanged several bumps just after the start, then was steadied out of close quarters early, switched outside foes on the backstretch and lacked a rally. MR
CHOCOLATE CHIP proved no factor.

DOLLAR BLUE was guided to the rail in the opening stages while reserved out of striking distance, was prompted to advance inside foes after a half,
continued under patient handling awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide leaving the furlong marker and produced a steady late
response to just collar SEGISMUNDO on the wire under firm handling. The latter raced three deep into the backstretch tracking just off the first flight,
continued with a steady bid to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage leaving midstretch, ducked in sharply under right
handed pressure crossing the path of FAST FLYING FRED while shifting into the path of SNICKER KICKER, was corrected by his rider but just lost the
advantage on the wire. SNICKER KICKER moved to the lead along the rail from the break, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend,
dueled for command inside foes past midstretch, then was carried inwards by SEGISMUNDO while being steadied nearing the wire to lose momentum. A
GIRLS BESTFRIEND tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, shifted off the rail after a half to track between foes, angled four
wide into the stretch while being prompted to advance, then was fanned five wide nearing the wire while being outkicked for a share. FAST FLYING FRED,
in touch attending a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn to upper stretch and yielded leaving the furlong marker.
THE KAHN, unhurried between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch
and continued with an even effort inside foes to the end. ATTACK ZONE broke awkwardly, was settled well off the leaders, was prompted to advance while
shifting four wide into the stretch but had no rally. CHARLIES A CHARMER reared at the start, tracked the leaders from well out of striking distance outside
foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane and proved no threat. FAFA FOOEY trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER
OF SNICKER KICKER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SEGISMUNDO FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WHILE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SEGISMUNDO,
PLACING HIM THIRD.

MEILLEUR was urged to the lead inside foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half, met several challengers racing into the
far turn, kicked clear nearing the midway point of the bend and held sway on a widening advantage under steady right handed pressure. THE WAYNE
FACTOR was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced when called upon to split rivals three wide racing into the far turn, gained second
racing into upper stretch but never menaced the winner. NAUTI BUOY, forwardly placed between rivals stalking just off the pacesetter, was prompted to
press the three deep into the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. ONE FINE RIDE, caught five wide racing into the first turn, angled inwards nearing the
backstretch, shifted to the inside after a half, was prompted to gain some position inside foes through the far turn but lacked a closing response. STOCK
exchanged light contact with JAIDEN'S BEST at the start, was reserved last near the inside for five furlongs, then shifted out into the lane to gain some
position three deep between foes while making no real impression. ENTERTAINER was settled between foes near the inside, swung out four wide racing
through the far turn but lacked rally. JAIDEN'S BEST exchanged light contact with STOCK at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing three deep
between foes tracking the pacesetter into the backstretch, was caught four wide between foes after a half while being prompted to advance but gave way
into the far turn. PERFECT JOE tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out after a half to lodge a
brief bid between foes nearing the far turn but soon flattened out. MALEKITH raced four wide to the backstretch while being prompted in pursuit of the
leaders and emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
TRACY ANN'S LEGACY broke readily, angled to the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, then shook clear through the stretch
under firm handling and was taken in hand nearing the wire. BEANTOWN BABY angled inwards to track just off the first flight between foes in the opening
stages,was steadied mometarily in close quarters racing into the turn, exchanged some light contact with IRISH FIX entering the bend, shifted out three
deep nearing upper stretch to loom outside the winner but proved only second best in the closing stages. PINS AND NEEDLES, a bit reluctant to load,
angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, dueled through the turn and weakened in the drive while prevailing for a share. SUNSET
EMPIRE, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, angled to the rail tracking the leaders under light reserve, saved ground through the bend, then shifted
three wide through the stretch to gain some position. IRISH FIX came through close quarters inside foes to track just off the leaders along the rail in the
opening stages, shifted out a bit entering the turn exchanging light contact with BEANTOWN BABY, then was urged in pursuit of the leaders inside foes to
the lane but gave way in the drive. FEISTY CHI CHI, a bit outpaced outside foes in early stages, failed to menace. WINNING QUALITY, bobbled slightly
while being steadied at the start, raced between between foes in the last flight while being prompted to advance but never proved a serious threat.
CHECOTAH gained a forward placing three deep tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
K J'S CAFFE was urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, continued between foes into the turn, was briskly
roused racing into upper stretch to challenge for command, took over midstretch and held rivals on a safe margin under strong handling. LANGUE LIEE
tracked just off the leaders along the inside, saved ground through the turn, switched out three deep to challenge entering upper stretch and narrowly
prevailed for the place honors. KATIE FALOONA, forced in by BEACH LADY at the break, angled inwards while being prompted to advance racing past the
five furlong marker momentarily impeding KOA KANI, shifted to the inside tracking just off the second flight racing into the bend, then split foes just off the
inside late while racing in hand when caught in close quarters approaching the wire. GRANDMARY tracked off the first flight flight between foes on the
backstretch, shifted out three deep to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but finished evenly late. KOA KANI came through close quarters at the start
losing some position, angled inwards in the opening stages, steadied off KATIE FALOONA mometarily racing past the five furlong marker, then continued
with a steady effort to improve position five wide in the closing stages. MIGHTY ELECTRICA was urged to the lead, dictated the pace along the inside into
the turn, briefly resisted the winner but gave way midstretch. ALEXACRAT settled last to the turn and passed only tiring rivals. LEMON WATER broke
slowly, tracked off second flight, angled in late but never gained striking distance. BEACH LADY ducked out at the start into the path of KATIE FALOONA,
was righted to track off the first flight outside foes, made brief progress racing four wide through the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. SHARON'S LAW
was settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. AJ'SLITTLEDANCER settled six deep between foes in the last flight and never seriously
menaced. DISCRIMANATION dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF KOA KANI LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF KATIE FALOONA, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH. AFTER REVIEWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
KATIE FALOONA, PLACING HER FIFTH.
