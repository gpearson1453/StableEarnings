Footnotes
RUN LIKE RHETT was always in good striking position, rallied three wide on the second turn, got to terms in mid stretch and inched clear driving despite not
switching leads. AZTEC WARRIOR chased the pace to the second turn, moved up three wide just in front of the winner to challenge into the stretch, was a
threat to mid stretch then got outfinished while saving second. ZIPPY GROOM set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken and weakened.
DYNAMITE RIDE pressed ZIPPY GROOM to the second turn, was between rivals two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not respond.
UR NOT MY PRESIDNT trailed to the second turn while saving ground then could not make an impact in the drive. MOON HOUSE broke a bit slow, was
outsprinted to the half, raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty. OOPPER WALLAH had no speed and was not a factor.

ZINZAN was outrun to the turn then was put to a drive mid turn, rallied two wide to the stretch then continued on, collared KIND OF GALLANT and won
going away. KIND OF GALLANT scampered clear to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then tired in the final furlong but had enough of a cushion to hold
second. NEAH BAY chased the runnerup from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked in the final furlong by the winner and could not catch KIND OF
GALLANT for the place. JAMASON had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then closed the gap but was not a serious menace. RIDGE ROUTE trailed
from the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. PRAIRIE CREEK had no speed, raced three deep on the turn but was also not a threat. BLAZIN
CELEBRATION chased the leader two wide to the stretch then stopped, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
LA GUAPA VELOS was a pace factor from the outset, dueled two wide, inched away on the second turn, was collared in mid stretch but dug in stubbornly to
best WAVERLY WAY late. WAVERLY WAY tracked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch but was
outfinished late. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME trailed tdo the second turn, shifted three wide then swung out widest for the drive and was gaining late. VONHRA
tracked the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. SECRETLY PARANOIDE had good
speed, dueled the winner to the second turn then was outrun to the stretch and weakened. LITTLE MISS HOTTIE was never a threat.

Footnotes
WILLING TO BURN was quickest, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded and held driving. TORQUAY had no speed, settled to the second
turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then could not catch the winner but bested SHE'S SO PRETTY for second. SHE'S SO PRETTY pressed the winner
for six furlongs while two wide, got outkicked to mid stretch and could not save second. FIRST EVENING had no speed, trailed to the second turn, circled
four wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. ALL MY HOPE chased the pace four wide to the half, was two wide on the second turn
but lacked the needed late response. HEATSKY stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then tired. SWEET SARAH BEAR was
settled to the half then saved ground to no avail.

DRAW ME chased the pace three wide to the stretch, shifted out for room, rallied when set down and closed steadily to be along in time. LADIES LUV
MUNNY set the pace and eased over, saved ground to the stretch, kicked away to mid stretch but was tiring and could not hold. FRIEND OF AUTISM had
no speed, raced two wide on the turn, swung out for room into the stretch and closed with a rush late. WAY TO FIRE pressed the pace two wide to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly inside. ON PURPOSE also was chasing early, raced two wide to the stretch and was gaining
ground belatedly. MISS SKI had no speed, trailed three wide then circled five wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. GIFTY was outsprinted to the
turn then saved ground but was not a threat. VIOLENT SPEED stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BULLETPROOF ONE was used to attend the pace, disposed of HABOBANERO on the turn, pushed away to mid stretch then was under steady hand
urging to the line. PENTEWAN (GB) had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch, shifted widest for the drive and closed willingly for second.
PEARL DRAGON was chasing the winner from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then could not threaten and was tagged late for the place.
WARM SUMMER settled mid pack to the turn, was two wide to the stretch and closed some ground late. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL had no speed, saved ground
to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but weakened in the
final furlong. CAKEWALK also had no speed, was three wide to the stretch and did not rally. ANNA LEE ENCORE stumbled at the start and lost any
chance. HABOBANERO was sent hard to contest the pace inside the winner to the turn, got outrun to the stretch and gave out in the drive.
