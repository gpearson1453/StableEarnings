Footnotes
LENDAR moved up along the inside to contest the pace, took over on the turn, responded when roused, pulled away while drifting wide in the stretch run
and was kept to the task. UNTOUCHABLE U raced close up between rivals, then moved inside on the turn and rallied inside for second. CRYSTAL PIER
chased three wide, continued three wide on the turn, gained mildly outside and got the nod for third. TRAPPE ME LATER rated the early pace between
rivals, chased two wide on the turn, weakened and just missed for third. VELOCITA BRILLANTE tracked along the inside, chased on the turn and faded.
MRS. CREWS chased four wide, raced off the rail on the turn and gave way.

IF YOU ONLY KNEW took the lead between foes, repulsed bids and edged clear under pressure. SWEET BLAME moved her head upward and to the left in
the gate breaking very slowly, recovered and was sent up to stalk outside winner, was unable to gain ground but finished gamely. DEREYA lunged leaving
the gate, raced outside early, moved in after a half and had no kick. MIDDAY PRAYER, racing in the four path, drifted out and tired. TWITTER STORM
saved ground and was finished after a half. ROSE OF DUBLIN bumped repeatedly with PHYLLIS DILLER racing into the first turn, saved ground early,
moved out and failed to menace. PHYLLIS DRILLER bumped with foe repeatedly racing into first turn, raced outside and was being eased through much of
the stretch.

INCENSED moved his head up and to the right as the gates opened getting off slowly, recovered and split foes leaving the chute, took up chase from the
outside and had the lead before entering the stretch, edged away under strong handling. GOOD SAVE, six wide on the backstretch, was three wide into
stretch but was no match. TRULY A MOON SHOT was squeezed back at the start, raced just off the rail, moved out to secure racing on the far turn and
bumped SOCIAL MEDIA into LUNAR ROVER, challenged near stretch then faded. JACK O LIAM came out leaving the gate, sprinted clear inside but then
had little left. SOCIAL MEDIA came in leaving the gate, was bumped and forced out on the far turn and dropped back. LUNAR ROVER was bumped around
racing into the far turn then gave way. FINAL RITUAL, five wide, was also bumped racing into far turn then tired. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND
CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND LUNAR ROVER, TRULY A MOON SHOT WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SIXTH.

BOW TOWN CAT tracked along the inside, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside, closed well to gain command past the sixteenth marker and
drew clear. DOUBLE THE BET raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied between rivals in deep stretch and surged late to get a share of
the place spot. BOURBON HONEY dueled for the early lead on the inside, shook free on the turn, dug in gamely, weakened in deep stretch and held on for
a share of second. KAREN'S GEM raced off the pace between rivals, rallied on the rail in stretch drive and was outkicked late. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT
trailed the field and closed belatedly outside. PROSPECTIVE BELLE chased three wide and tired. BLISSFUL BREEZE raced three wide off the pace, three
wide on the turn and had no rally. AMERICAN ALI dueled two wide for the early lead, then chased and gave way.

Footnotes
PEACH ALLEY, stalking inside, quickly took the lead on the far turn, drifted out in early and held on. SALLY O'PRADO saved ground to stretch, eased out
rallying, moved back to the rail and was gaining. STORMBEAM raced outside and failed to be a serious threat. LITTLEMISSBUSINESS off the rail and just
off the pace, tired. CREATIVE PRINCESS set the pace two wide, drifted out and tired.

Footnotes
WHISTLING BIRDS was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, stalked close up three wide, bid entering the far turn, dueled with DIRT IN YOUR
FACE, took over and pulled away under urging. DIRT IN YOUR FACE set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely and
came up second best. RUBY BLEU tracked close up along the inside, was in tight and checked entering the far turn, then came two wide into the lane and
finished evenly. BOYD CROWDER stumbled at the start and was bumped, raced four wide early, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and
lacked a rally. GRASSHOPPIN raced five wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to respond. TRILOGY stalked close up between rivals,
chased two wide on the far turn and faded. NAVY COMMANDER was outrun early, moved up a bit on the far turn and did not factor.

COLORADO GRANDSLAM set the pace in four path, drifted out entering stretch, raced between foes through stretch and came back to get the decision. J
R JELLYBEAN saved ground just off pace, challenged in early stretch and fought it out gamely. READYHEARTANDSOUL stalked racing wide, took the lead
leaving the turn and weakened slightly. DREAMY MARTINI, well placed two wide, moved out entering the stretch but had no late kick. SECRET SECRET
saved ground to stretch, moved out and closed. SUNRISE SATURDAY failed to menace. R JOLLEY DREAMER raced wide and tired. MY PIRATE, very
wide, was never a threat.
