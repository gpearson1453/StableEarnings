SUGOI broke well, settled in to the turn with a strong drive in the stretch run and cleared. COMPANY CLOWN with the pace to stretch, led at the eighth pole
but proved no match for the winner. CONTRACTOR BILL raced a four-five wide trip with no late gain in the final furlong. NEVERBLINK dueled from inside to
the stretch, stayed game in the drive but faded. BLANKENBAKER never a real threat. PRINCESS POWER never a real factor. RELMBUNKUS SYR never a
factor. VEHEMENT broke sharp, dueled inside to the turn, gave way readily.

DOWN HOME KITTEN shot up inside quickly to battle to quarter pole, urged clear. BRAND NEW KEY off tardy, rough run around first turn, late widest run
for place. KHALFANI dueled with the winner for three quarters but was outfinished for the place spot late. KING BING HAWK raced a wide trip throughout
with late outside improvement through the stretch run. PINKMAN tried hard from between horses to the turn, flattened out inside. PRESSONREGARDLESS
through after half, dropped back. FAT MAKER never a real threat. SUPERCELL through after half. THERMAL SHOCK never in contention. PEGASUS
MOON stayed well to the quarter pole, empty. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR seemed to go wrong at the half, and dropped far back to the wire but walked off.

DANCE THE DAY AWAY stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, drove past the leader in the stretch and cleared the field in the late
stages. SOCIAL CIRCLE set a clear pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and was no match for the winner in the stretch run. ROBOTRON
chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. HYDRA'S HOPE was slow at the start
and trailed the field while far back early on, was very wide into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. PROMISED FAME chased the pace early, was
on the inside into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. POSITIVE VIBES was never a threat. BUTTER UP KATIE was in the three path into the lane
and empty late in the stretch drive. MATT'S HONEY was never a factor. MUSHABOOM had early speed then folded up.
