Footnotes
KEYS TO THE PALACE settled well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied inside under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, moved out just inside
the three-sixteenths then sideswiped GENTILLY STAGE while blowing by that rival, gained fast into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed whip
outside the sixteenth-pole and went by the runner-up to prevail under good handling. SOUL SONG was away alertly then dropped in early, set the pace
under some pressure to his outside, inched away while inside on the turn, was asked near the three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip while
under threat from the winner at the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip while clinging desperately to the lead at the sixteenth-pole then was
overtaken while well clear for the place. FAST VERDICT leaned in then hit the inside of the gate at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few
lengths, settled at the rear, rounded the turn in the three path, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten while along for the show.
HALF AGAIN was coaxed along in third position, chased three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. GENTILLY
STAGE broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back a bit in the three path on the turn, chased into upper stretch, jostled with the
winner while dropping back just inside the three-sixteenths and tired. (Rail at 9 Feet)

into upper stretch and came up empty. DRAGON DRAGON hit the outside of the gate at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, angled

Footnotes
CHA VEZ went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked while making a bid at
the five-sixteenths, took a narrow advantage under a drive in upper stretch and gamely held off a multitude of challengers under strong urging. NASHTRICK
was taken in hand early then reserved in the two to three path, came under urging inside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the
outside and closed well to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. EKATERINOSLAV was taken in hand early then keen under tight restraint into the
first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then shifted four wide
into the stretch, gained on the outside to make a bid outside the eighth-pole, fought on well with several foes in the final furlong and just missed while
narrowly able to get the show. VINCITORE went to the front then was taken in hand, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through tepid
fractions, vied inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and
was out-kicked. MERLIN'S SONG went three to four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. BRIAR JUMPER was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved at the
back on the outside, went three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved out under a drive and lacked the needed response.
DELP broke in and was last away, saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried near the back, saved ground on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the
two path then was asked for his best and failed to rally. (Rail at 9 Feet)

AIN'T NO ELMERS was rated on the outside, stalked four wide on the turn, was asked while six wide into the stretch, closed fast on the outside to the lead
at the three-sixteenths then powered clear, drew away under a solid hand ride into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead seventy yards from
the wire then was eased up while much the best. SCONSIN pressed the pace between horses, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked while on even
terms for the lead at the quarter-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner. AMERICAN LEGEND veered out at the start and was off a step
slow, settled on the outside, moved in outside the half-mile pole, was asked in the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths
and narrowly earned the show. SUMMERS HOPE stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch on even terms for
the lead then came under a drive and missed the trifecta. BET YOUR BANKROLL broke a step slow, moved in at the rear of the field, went around the turn
in the two path, swung five wide into upper stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. HALAMA angled in early, settled off the pace, dropped back along
the rail on the turn and failed to respond. HAILEY'S DAY was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure from her outside, vied in the two path early
on the turn then dropped closer to the rail, lost the advantage just after turning into the stretch and faded.

restraint, ranged up in the three path to make a bid on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch, began to drift out
near the furlong marker, continued to drift out and bothered the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole then finished with good courage to hold sway.
HIDEAWAY HERO went three wide on the first turn, settled between horses, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn then driven four wide
into the stretch, chased the leader past the three-sixteenths, moved out behind that drifting foe into the final furlong then steadied with tugs of the right rein
while continuing to be carried out outside the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked late while clear for the place. CAPTAIN TYREE went five wide on the first
turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, went five then six wide under urging on the far turn, moved out under a

five wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in the stretch and just missed the show. DUTCHMAN bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first
turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved closer under some restraint midway down the backstretch, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was
urged along while inside to the two path on the turn and failed to rally. BEAUTY BOY went three to four wide on the first turn, disputed the pace on the
outside, moved to a solo lead midway down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the far turn, lost the advantage outside the
quarter-pole and tired. CAMERON RULES went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried towards the back, raced three to four wide under urging
on the far turn and failed to threaten. BOSTON BOB was sent hard from the start, raced inside on the first turn, contested the pace, dropped back some
midway down the backstretch, fell further back into the far turn and faded. SHANIKO'S SECRET lagged at the rear while saving ground, swung four wide
into the stretch and showed little. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, OUTOFTHISGALAXY was disqualified from first and placed second for
