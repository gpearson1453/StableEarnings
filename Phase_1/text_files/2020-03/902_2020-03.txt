Footnotes
SHE'S A DIME off a step slow, raced back, split rivals in the far turn when beginning to rally, came four wide into the stretch, collared the leader past the
furlong marker, kicked well clear to win ridden out. FRONTIER WOMAN back off the early pace, raced in the two path through the turn, moved out a bit
when straightened for home, finished willingly to be in time for the place. PERFECT RUSH broke alertly, soon got clear along the inside, continued to show
the way through the turn by daylight, weakened a bit in the drive to prove no match for the top two, comfortably saved the show. STARVANA went one
paced throughout while saving ground. ALMYRA forwardly placed while racing three wide, gave way in the drive. WESTERN ATTIRE broke back, lacked
speed, got out late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. OWE HER ONE void of speed while racing outside, carried out wide turning for home, also remained
back. FIESTA IN VEGAS chased the leader for a half in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
FLASH OF SILVER in the second flight toward the inside early, advanced and challenged in the two path and between rivals midway on the second turn,
drove steadily clear. TRINITY THUNDAH broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, fell back when headed in the second bend, continued to save ground
into the stretch, came back for the place, no match for the winner. LITTLE MARK settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the final turn,
along for the show, no threat to the top two. HIDDEN PROMISE in the second group while in the three path, closest to the winner entering the stretch,
weakened to lose a couple of positions. WILD AND GOLDEN off slowly, raced well back while saving ground, continued inside through the second turn,
moved out for the drive, improved position. THAT DUDE settled off the early pace off the inside, fell back a bit the middle half, improved slightly while never
dangerous. FIRST STRING one paced, moved out three wide turning for home, came up empty. WILSHIRE DIAMOND off a bit slowly, remained always
back. BIG BAD BUD broke out, dueled early well out in the strip, moved out wider onto the backstretch, continued well wide while giving way.

FEELING IT dueled up front while off the inside, shook off the other speed turning for home, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire without feeling
the whip. SOUTHSIDER lacked speed off the inside, came four wide into the stretch, rallied for the place, not a threat to the winner. MONDAY
CONFESSION in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, displayed some minor interest to hold sway for the show. CORRANA EN LIMEN
forwardly placed while racing three wide,had little left for the drive, outkicked for the show. R FAST LIFE went one paced along the inside, also did not have
enough late for the show. DEVILS HALO made little impact while racing three wide. DREAM BABY DREAM remained always back while racing toward the
inside. GREY MASK alternated up front closest to the inside for a half and gave way. KNOCKS BIG THIRST was finished early. TWIN FARMS in tight then
steadied just before a furlong, pulled up midway on the turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
CAMPAIGN SPY within striking distance toward the inside, steered out for the drive, kicked down the leader under firm handling. GLOBUS broke alertly,
showed the way into the first turn, prompted the new leader while off the inside in the run up the backstretch, took over in the second turn, well clear into the
stretch and past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner late. MR. UNUSUAL settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the far turn,
steered out to be four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to finish best of the rest. MAJESTIC DAY void of speed for a half, displayed some mild,
belated interest to improve his position. ALASKAN FLYER well back in trailing early, began to advance in the second turn, also improved position with some
mild late interest. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN went one paced throughout in lacking a closing bid. WITHERSPOON settled off the pace outside, had little for
the drive. GOLDEN RULE HAVEN pressed the issue into the first turn inside, took over onto the backstretch, showed the way into the far turn, gave way
when headed by the runner up. BATTALSTOWN void of early foot, was always outrun. SHAKE IT in mid pack while off the inside first turn, dropped in to
save ground second turn, came up empty for the drive. WILD WORLD was finished after a half. HIGHLIGHT REEL raced four wide most of the way, tired.

Footnotes
FLATOUTANDFOXY lacked early foot, angled out three wide turning for home, roused, responded and finished with good to kick clear. TURNSTONE
settled behind the pace inside, continued to save ground second turn, split foes nearing the furlong grounds, could not match the winner late, dug in for the
place. SUPERSTAR BEA in mid pack while racing outside, moved closer while four wide through the final turn, outkicked for the place. JOY IN THE
JOURNEY bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to race closest to the leader in the two path, took over from that one turning for home, could not last.
SATTERSFIELD off a bit slow, trailed early, advanced four out to five wide through the second turn, failed to sustain that bid in the drive. COUNT UR
BLESS'N stalked the pace while three wide, remained in striking position into the far turn, came up empty for the drive. HISSY MISSY remained back in
failing to menace toward the inside. JEWELED CROWN sprinted clear early, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way when
headed turning for home. TRINTRIN off a bit slow, finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
RECOUNT outrun in the early going, advanced three out to four wide into the lane, engaged the leader with less than a furlong remaining, put that rival
away then held the runner up safe late. LOUDEN'S GRAY lacked early foot, steered out to be four wide into the stretch, finished well while remaining well
out in the strip. I'M CORFU closest to the leader off the inside, challenged from the outside, late in the turn, took over, clear past the furlong marker, gave
ground grudgingly to the winner until late. KNIGHTS KEY settled off the pace inside, continued to saved ground through the turn, made a late run up the rail.
GRAY SKY turned in an even effort while racing off the inside. HERE'S CARLOS void of speed, passed tiring rivals. DINGDINGDINGDING last away, failed
to menace. RAVENS REFLECTION broke sharp, sprinted clear, offered little resistance when challenged turning for home, gave way when headed. SING
HIM A SONG forwardly placed in the two path for a half, backed up through the stretch.

BIG RETURNS stalked the pace while racing three wide, asked for some run three wide turning for home, kicked clear under steady handling. MARVIN in
mid pack while racing outside, four wide out of the turn, could do little with the winner, up for the place. ANCIENT WARRIOR prompted the winner off the
inside, lodged a bid turning for home, could not match the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. LIAM'S PRIDE broke out, forwardly
placed inside, remained in striking distance turning for home, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late punch. RANAAN squeezed, off slowly, trailed early,
inside turn, improved with some late interest inside. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY was never dangerous while racing three wide. TUMBLING SKY brushed at
the start, cleared early, set the pace for just over a half then faltered when confronted for the drive. NO SHIRT NO SHOES raced in mid pack early, steadily
faded. NAUGHTY ALFRED failed to rally. CREEKMORE was never involved.

runner up, gained the nod at the wire. FREEDOM PASSAGE broke in, raced off the early pace well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, challenged
the winner from the outside nearing the furlong grounds, dueled to the wire, missed. TIPAZAR lacked early foot while also well outside, four wide into the
lane, rallied mildly to earn the show while not a threat to the top two. GOT A GOOD NOTION void of early foot, improved position while not a serious threat.
MISS NOTORIOUS evenly paced, in some traffic late in the turn, lacked a punch when clear for the drive. DIXIE NATION lacked early foot, also
encountered some traffic late in the bend, also came up empty in the drive. VOILA BABY narrowly set the pace along the inside, faltered in the drive.
GARDEN AFFAIR pressed the issue for a half, gave way. WILD ESCAPE off a step slow, remained always back. ICAN'TREADTHEODDS forwardly placed
early, began a steady retreat from between horses before a half.
