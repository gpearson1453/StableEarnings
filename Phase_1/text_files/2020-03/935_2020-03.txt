Footnotes
LOVIELEE was urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dictated terms on a narrow margin into the turn, shook clear between
calls nearing upper stretch, then gamely held rivals through the late stages to narrowly prevail under firm right handed encouragement. DYNAPOWER was
settled out of striking distance early while angling inwards, gained some position along the inside racing through the turn, shifted out three deep in upper
stretch and continued with a steady late bid to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire while just failing to collar the winner. HIFALUTIN ducked
outwards slightly at the start, tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch, came through inside the
pacesetter to challenge that rival leaving the three sixteenths marker and contested the issue to the end while just outkicked. PALACES DIAMOND tracked
off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane and continued with an even effort. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, shied at the
break bumping LADY MIDAS while carrying that rival out, was collected to track off the second flight between foes but lacked a rally. LA WAPA, urged
prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way after a half. LADY MIDAS, bumped, then carried out at bit at the start, settled last,
then trailed the field to the stretch. INHONOROFOWENJR was settled outside foes in the opening stages and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TOLLY HO gained a position tracking just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, advanced in tandem with a rival to challenge for
command nearest the rail approaching upper stretch, shifted out once gaining the advantage entering the lane and held U KNOW I B LION on a narrow
margin to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter gained a forward placing three deep between foes, prompted the pacesetter into the
turn, moved to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to contest the issue while failing to gain even terms with the winner.
SONOMA STORM tracked just off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch to advance along the rail into the lane but
lacked the needed late kick. THIRTY NINE SEVEN was settled off the second flight in the opening stages and passed only tiring rivals. GO GIRL GONE
broke sharply, angled in to set the pace on a narrow margin off the rail racing into the turn but gave way into upper stretch. ADONAI LOVE tracked the
leaders along the rail but faded early. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL broke slowly and trailed throughout.

VOLADOR broke readily, was rated along the rail tracking the pacesetter under light reserve to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance on that foe
shifting out on the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and kicked away under firm encouragement. NATOMA was rated between rivals off the
second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, switched outside the winner racing into upper
stretch but proved only second best. NAGINI tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, then continued
three deep on the far turn to late stages while gaining position between rivals to prevail for a share. MOMS LOVE was settled off the second flight racing to
the backstretch, angled inside foes nearing the far turn, saved ground to late stages and gained some position in an even effort. IMAGINARY FRIEND (IRE)
broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside under light rating in the opening half, was prompted to maintain the advantage entering the far turn and
gave way into upper stretch. ETTAPLACE tracked the pace outside the eventual winner as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and came up empty
entering the lane. WEST BURKE angled to the inside early to track just off the second flight while pulling hard against restraint, continued in that position
through the backstretch, was steadied out of close quarters nearing the far turn, switched out while being urged to advance but had no closing bid. LILYS
FROM PARIS, reserved last to the backstretch, failed to menace. THUYA settled well off the field to the backstretch and proved no threat. SIX STRING
KISS, urged to gain a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
GEOGRAPHY broke readily, pulled a bit against rating stalking just outside the pacesetter into the backstretch, was prompted to challenge that foe racing
into upper stretch, then took over in late stages under firm left handed encouragement to prevail. DOPO LAVORO angled to the inside in the opening stages
tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to challenge inside the pacesetter when presented an opening in upper stretch
and was just outkicked. ED'S DOG moved to the lead from the outset while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn, shifted
out while being roused to resist the winner's challenge in upper stretch but yielded to the top pair late. I AINT TELLIN, off a bit slowly, was settled in the last
flight to the first turn, switched out foes racing into the backstretch to gain some position between foes, shifted out four wide on the far turn while steadily
advancing to contention and closed the gap in that path nearing the wire in a belated rally. CHIEF OF JOY tracked off the second flight outside foes in the
opening half, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but flattened out in the drive. SNOW LION angled to the rail early while settling in the
last flight and passed only tiring rivals. MR. MAURICE tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and emptied out into the lane. G FRIDAY
tracked off the second flight three wide between foes into the backstretch and retreated early. MAYBEYESMAYBENO proved no factor. ROMANCING THE
CAT tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and was through after a half.

Footnotes
LIL B QUICK broke sharply, was urged to dispute the pace shifting off the rail racing through the backstretch, continued to press the issue on a narrow
advantage between foes racing through the turn, shook clear entering the lane under firm encouragement and was taken in hand nearing the wire.
ALLURING APPROVAL broke awkwardly losing position at the start, angled to the rail in early stages while being prompted to a contending position, bid
along the rail nearing upper stretch, shifted outside the pacesetter while continuing in pursuit of that foe but proved only second best. DO WHAT IT TAKES
angled inwards in early stages while being prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter between rivals racing into the turn, couldn't maintain position with that top
pair but continued well enough to edge rivals for a share. R SWEET EXCHANGE, urged to terms with the eventual winner prompting that foe's pace into the
turn, continued three deep on the bend, was fanned four wide racing through the lane and steadily faded. MAST COVE settled well off the second flight
while angling to the rail early, saved ground through the turn but lacked the needed late bid. J P'S GIA tracked off the first flight racing five wide to the turn
and faded early. DON'T SPIN ME broke slowly and failed to menace. COCKTAILS OR CANDY flashed brief pace three wide between foes but emptied out
early. MORNING PRINCESS bobbled at the start losing position to the leaders and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX, firmly rated while angling to the inside to track just off the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane, moved to
challenge racing past the furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. VAUNT, pulling against restraint in the opening stages, stalked just off the
pacesetter into the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with that foe to bid for command between rivals nearing midstretch but proved no match for the
winner. ZODIAC PRINCESS sped to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, briefly
resisted the top pair racing to midstretch but gave way late. BIG ANGEL, bumped at the start, settled off the second flight in the three path to the
backstretch, angled inside after a half, saved ground through the far turn and continued evenly while shifting off the inside late. JACKIES DREAM broke
inwards bumping BIG ANGEL, was settled in hand to the backstretch dropping well off the leaders, then displayed some interest to gain position inside foes
racing into the lane in a belated effort. FINEST JEWEL, forwardly placed outside foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, gave way nearing
the lane. MELISSANI, restless in the gate, was settled well off the leaders along the inside early and failed to menace. ONE SLICK FACT tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep after a half while under prompting to advance but faded early. SUDDEN LIGHT
was settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and proved no factor. CELESTIAL ORB, restless in the gate, tracked off the second flight, was caught
five wide racing into the far turn and gave way in that path nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MALIO'S was urged to gain a forward placing three deep racing to the first turn, eased off the leaders nearing the backstretch to track those foes out of
striking distance to the second bend, continued with a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm encouragement.
BIG MONEY MACHINE, forwardly placed along the rail prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, switched outside that rival after a half, was urged to
press the issue into the far turn gaining a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, couldn't fend off the winner late but held rivals for the place honors.
DOX FOLLY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, came under some prompting after a half to maintain position, then
found some late response to gain a share from between rivals nearing the wire. DAS DA ONE, urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn,
angled to the rail entering the backstretch after securing a clear advantage, dueled for command on the far turn past midstretch, then was taken in hand
while giving way approaching the wire. HIGH ROLLING DUDE angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground
through the far turn and continued evenly between rivals just off the inside in the closing stages. JOSIE'S RIDDLE, switched out to race four wide as part of
the second flight in the opening half but never gained striking distance. INDIAN GULCH tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, came around foes
after a half, was caught five wide racing through the far turn and never seriously menaced. MULLED WINE tracked the leaders three wide between foes in
second flight to the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
PARISH POET (IRE) broke readily, pulled against restraint while her rider attended a rival's pace under firm rating along the rail racing to the backstretch,
was allowed to move to terms inside that foe after a half pressing the issue into the far turn, edged forward in upper stretch, then shifted out under left
handed pressure in the closing stages to fend off FLYING THE COLORS in a determined effort to prevail. The latter was guided to the inside racing to the
first turn to track just off the first flight, switched outside foes on the far turn, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge
for command approaching the furlong marker but was outkicked. LIPSTIKLIESNLOVERS ducked inwards a bit at the start, was righted to gain a position
outside a rival tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, shifted three deep after a half, was prompted to advance in that path through the far turn to
challenge for command between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. GESTURE, off a step slowly, was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at
the start, was settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch and never gained striking range. SHOW MAID, off a step slowly, was settled
last racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. THRILL OF GIANTS shied inwards into the path of GESTURE at the start, was quickly righted, then
urged to terms prompting a rival's pace on a narrow advantage racing into the backstretch, dueled between foes into the far turn and gave way nearing
upper stretch.
