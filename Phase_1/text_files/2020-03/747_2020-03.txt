CONEJOS vied for the lead from the inside to the turn, cleared foes then moved off the rail to enter the stretch three wide and inched away under a drive.
CANNES stalked from the inside to the turn, saved ground along the rail, rallied along the fence and finished a clear second. IRISH JACK vied three deep
for command, continued outside a rival and four wide chasing the leader into the lane and weakened. NOVA vied between rivals for the lead up the
backstretch, got caught in tight quarters and steadied briefly on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. FOUR GAELS off a bit slow and
steadied briefly at the start, trailed the field early, took an awkward step on the backstretch and was eased by the rider around the turn and entering the
stretch, then walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
SARAZONA TWO stumbled and knocked into rival leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, two wide into the stretch, surged late and inhaled the runner-up
in the final strides. JOE'S PASSION threw head and off slow to begin, recovered quickly to quickly assume command and clear the field, traveled clear
along the inside to the sixteenth pole but was caught in the closing moments. MY PROJECT GIRL broke in and bumped rival, raced off the rail then four
wide into the stretch and finished willingly. CARACORTADA bumped at the start, angled out early, went outside a rival into the turn, fanned six wide entering
the stretch and could not rally. CURRYFORTHREE BANG settled off the pace and off the rail, went between rivals on the turn and came five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. BLAZING MISS angled in and traveled a bit off the rail, tucked inside on the turn and saved ground into the
stretch, shifted out in the lane and failed to rally.

Footnotes
SEATTLE ENCOUNTER bumped by rival at the start, unhurried in the opening stages, traveled two wide then rallied from the inside and drew clear to win
going away. RUN FACTOR dueled inside a rival for the lead while off the rail, angled in entering the turn, raced a bit off the inside then moved off the rail
leaving the turn, held a short lead in the stretch, lost command just past the sixteenth pole but held on to the place. YES I'M WILD bumped leaving the gate,
stalked the top pair off the rail, traveled two to three wide around the turn, came out in the upper stretch and missed the place. LEEDSLIMIT dueled outside
of RUN FACTOR up the backstretch, took the turn two to three wide, came out into the stretch, fought back in the stretch but flattened in the final sixteenth.
SPEEDY RIDE bumped leaving the gate, lacked early speed, went four wide around the turn and showed a mild response to whittle the gap through the
stretch. SATORI off slow and bumped at the start, raced near the inside, checked entering the turn and never threatened.
