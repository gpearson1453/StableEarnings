Footnotes
AUTISM'S QUEST was unhurried to the second turn, rallied three wide when roused, collared STAND IN YOUR LOVE in mid stretch then edged clear
driving. STAND IN YOUR LOVE set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but was not in danger of losing the
place. SALSA VERDE pressed the pace to the half, bid two wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. PACIFIC SILENCE
stalked the pace from the rail for six furlongs, was also outrun to mid stretch then weakened. GO MUSKEE had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MOON ROCKET broke alertly and took the lead, set the pace from the rail, continued to lead saving ground on the second turn, met a bid from TOOLEY
TUNES, responded to edge clear to mid stretch and held off MY IDOL determinedly. MY IDOL had no speed and trailed to the second turn, was two then
three wide to the stretch then rallied but was too late. TOOLEY TUNES pressed the winner to the half, moved up two wide to try and engage that one on the
second turn but was outkicked in upper stretch and finished evenly. STORMY MIST was allowed to settle to the second turn then saved ground but could
not muster the needed late response. LUCILLE chased the pace three wide to the second turn then drifted five wide into the stretch and gave way.

was green to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch and showed a bit of interest late. GORDY'S RULES stalked the pace three wide to the stretch
then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. OLYMPIC SILVER tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and tired through the
drive. NO MORE FIREBALL was hustled early but outsprinted then was not a factor.

COOL HUNTER rated kindly on the lead from the rail to the stretch then responded and held on stubbornly. MY FRIEND GEORGE was settled to the half,
bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied in the final furlong then made a late surge to get the tie for the place. CANDY'S MARTINI chased the winner
three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. MONSAJEM PERVADE was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the
second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE pressed the winner two wide for six
furlongs then came up empty in the drive. KATZUMOTO trailed to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch and closed a gap without threatening.

MISS INDEFATIGABLE set a pressured pace for six furlongs inside, responded when set down for the drive and held determinedly. LORETTA pressed the
winner throughout two wide, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on gamely late. AMERICAN ROYALTY had no speed, closed the gap two then three wide
to the stretch but went evenly in the final furlong. PRIVATE KITTY was chasing the top two for six furlongs while saving ground then had little to offer in the
drive. VONHRA trailed to the second turn, continued in last while saving ground to the stretch and was never a threat. LIVE IT WELL was settled to the half,
raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
PACIFIC STRIKE was bumped by JAIMI JAMES at the start, had no speed, trailed to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then rallied between
rivals leaving mid stretch, battled the runnerup through the final furlong and got the best of that one. DREAMING ABOUT YOU had no speed, settled to the
second turn, saved ground to the stretch, rallied when asked, dueled the winner in the final sixteenth and just missed. BOLD ANTE chased the pace to the
second turn, rallied two wide to loom boldly in mid stretch then was outkicked. BECOMES A QUEEN pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up to
engage for the lead two wide to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then weakened. PLAYA CHICA had no speed and settled for a half mile, was asked for
speed three wide on the second turn but lacked the needed late response. JAIMI JAMES set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then was overtaken and
gave out in the drive.
