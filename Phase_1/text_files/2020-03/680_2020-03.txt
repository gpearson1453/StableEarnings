Footnotes
COSMIC HALLELUJAH broke on top, soon had the rail, responded to mild hand urging in the lane and prevailed. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP hustled from the
gate, pressed COSMIC HALLELUJAH from just outside, was all out in the lane, no match for the winner but proved easily second best. ANDREW THE
GIANT chased from inside, angled to the outside for the stretch run and passed tired ones. CHARLES T in contention early from outside, advanced three
wide on the bend, angled in midstretch and flattened out. MR. LUV MAKER was a contender between rivals to the lane then tired. HOME IT TIZ was a step
slow at the break and always outrun.

Footnotes
ELIZABETH'S FEVER vied for the lead inside rivals from the beginning, edged ahead in the lane and held off LADY WARRIOR under a steady drive. LADY
WARRIOR pressed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but pulled away for second. TOUR ON
prominent from the start, was boxed in through the turn, gained a clear path the last furlong but could only get up for third late. ECO STAR disputed the
pace two wide between rivals from the start but weakened for the drive. WADDLE moved up to contention from between horses on the turn then leveled off
in the lane. GOOD WISHES advanced from inside to have a striking position but hung the last furlong. SPONTANEITY chased from outside and was never
a factor. HOLYHOOT was forward placed outside but tired the last quarter mile. SUNSET GABLES soon trailed, became difficult to control, was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY rated on the front end from outside, was roused leaving the turn, took over midstretch and drew off under urging the final eighth.
IMPERIAL TEMPLE prominent inside, waited through the bend, got through two wide into the stretch and gained second from between rivals late. AGAVE
KID forwardly placed between rivals, was forced to swing five wide for the stretch run, lodged a mild bid and got up for third. MARCO'S DREAM stumbled at
the start, was hustled to a narrow lead then flattened out from inside the final furlong. EL PRINCIPE I B displayed early speed between horses but wore
down for the drive. HE'S RECKLESS saved ground taking the turn and lacked a significant stretch bid. ABSTRACT PAYNTER void of speed, had no late
bid. BOOGY SOKS chased, came six wide into the lane and was empty. MONFORD showed little.

LOST IN MANHATTAN was hustled to the lead from between horses, had the rail on the turn, urged clear upper stretch and held off RAHFEE TOWN under
a steady drive. RAHFEE TOWN pressed from inside, waited for room on the bend, got through four wide between rivals at the top of the lane, steadily
closed the gap, was too late but easily second best. BOLD ATTACK broke alertly, was soon pressing LOST IN MANHATTAN from just outside but flattened
out the last furlong. COUP DE VILLE void of speed, only passed between tired ones the last eighth. TUFF ATTACK prominent early, went for the lead three
wide on the turn but wore down for the drive. GREENSPAN pressed running widest for three furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
INTERNET SUCCESS contested the pace inside rivals, moved clear when asked in the lane and was kept to task to the wire. AFFIRMATIF SONG broke
alertly, was soon challenged from inside but lacked the extra needed in the stretch. SERIOUS TALK was steadied behind traffic midway down the
backstretch, altered to the inside, gradually angled out through the turn, lodged a mild bid four wide in the stretch and got up for third late. SEA OF
MAKEBELIEVE chased from outside, came three wide into the lane and showed a willingness to run late. ROSKI in the second flight from outside, was
three wide through the bend then weakened for the stretch run. BAD MOON only passed a few tired rivals in the lane. WILDCAT LITE gained the rail on the
turn and had no late bid. BATTLE N AWAY was hustled along to race in the second flight but began to tire before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
DURANGO KID was a step slow and shut off just after the break, altered inside, hustled up, waited for room on the turn, gained a clear path along the rail
leaving the quarter pole, was all out in the stretch and edged ahead inside the last sixteenth. CHRISTMAS COOKIE brushed with HALO HUNTER just after
the break, contested the pace outside that one, moved ahead upper stretch, was briefly clear inside the furlong marker but lacked the extra needed in the
waning yards. GOLDEN DRILLER forwardly placed between horses from the beginning, could only make up minor ground deep stretch but was clearly best
of the rest. HALO HUNTER brushed with CHRISTMAS COOKIE just after the start, disputed the pace inside that one, floated out some leaving the bend
and gradually wore down between rivals. SUNNY'S STORM in contention from outside from the beginning, lacked a stretch bid.

KIPPER DOODLE jostled briefly with KALISPELL after the break, was sent to set a pressured pace just off or along the rail, began to drift out upper stretch,
was corrected but her rider lost his whip nearing the furlong marker then was hand urged clear of the latter the final sixteenth. KALISPELL broke inward,
bumped KIPPEER DOODLE then was jostled briefly between rivals, pressed the latter from just outside, was forced out some by KIPPER DOODLE upper
stretch and began to wear down the last sixteenth. WELL MAID was shuffled back from crowding shortly after the start, advanced between horses on the
bend, swung to the outside into the stretch, moved inside with a furlong to go, finished evenly but was easily best of the others. WAY TOO SMARTE chased
from outside and had no late bid. HELEN MAE'S SONG in contention early, saved ground taking the turn and gave way the last eighth. KINGSBURY
DREAM was a contender between horses for two furlongs then began to tire.
