Footnotes
DAD'S YANKEES broke sharply, went quickly clear, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin into the bend and held sway to the end under firm
encouragement. PERP, brushed at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, angled in nearing upper stretch and continued
with a steady late bid to prove best of the others. GAME DAY DRAMA broke outwards brushing PERP, then ducked inwards into the path of TARTAN THE
BULL, shifted out while racing as part of the second flight to the turn, conceded some position shifting three, then four wide into the stretch but edged rivals
for a share in the closing stages. STEADY EARNER tracked the leaders three wide between foes just off the second flight racing to the turn, angled to the
rail nearing midstretch and continued with an even effort. BRANDT angled inside tracking off the second flight but had no closing bid. GIANT TRICK tracked
off the second flight racing four wide to the turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and steadily faded. TARTAN THE BULL, carried in at the break, was
righted, then urged to gain a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter but came up racing into the lane.

KALU was rated off the first flight in the opening quarter, steadily gained on the pacesetter three deep between foes to challenge for command in upper
stretch, then edged forward under firm left handed encouragement. MINNESOTA LUCKY broke readily to attend a rival's pace in the opening stages, took
over racing through the turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge but proved no match late. TEDDY'S HONOR broke outwards, was righted to track off the
first flight outside foes, made brief progress four wide on the turn but flattened out after a half. SOUL OF THE HERO settled last racing to the turn, angled
four wide into the stretch but had no rally. BEYOND STREETSMART, urged to dictate the pace along the inside, emptied out early.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RYDER was rated off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out splitting foes after a half, was prompted to advance on the
pacesetter three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage and drove clear. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY vied for command between
foes on a narrow advantage racing into the backstretch, edged clear into the far turn, held sway to upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner.
ITSGOTTABEMYWAY, brushed at the start, was reserved between foes off the second flight to the backstretch, angled in after a half racing to the far turn,
shifted out in upper stretch to split foes three deep and found her best stride late to prevail for a share. DILLY DOES IT, reserved outside foes in the last
flight to the backstretch, split foes racing into upper stretch, shifted four wide late and was just outkicked for a share. LIL'S TURN joined the pace three deep
racing to the first turn, lost ground to the pacesetter on the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing through the far turn and gave way. PLEASANT BUFFY,
pulling against firm restraint while prompting the pace inside foes to the far turn, gave way into the stretch. OUR PETUNIA, restless in the gate, broke
inwards brushing a rival, was pulling against restraint while being rated just off the first flight, shifted out racing into the backstretch and faded early.
VALERIE FIRST, off slowly, was reserved inside foes in the last flight, swung out five wide racing through the far turn but had no rally.

Footnotes
RISEN CHANGE, bumped by RETURN THE FAVOR while also exchanging contact with DIVA DANA at the start, tracked off the first flight between rivals
racing into the bend, shifted out four wide entering the stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest command and kick clear under firm handling.
RETURN THE FAVOR, restless in the paddock, broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, moved to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn,
edged forward to press the pace through the bend gaining the advantage nearing upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner while
prevailing for the place honors. TRUE ATKA tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing to the turn, came through along the rail to challenge when
presented an opening in upper stretch but had no final kick. DEMANDING was rated off the second flight inside foes on the backstretch, swung out five wide
racing into the lane and gained some position in an even effort. RITA OF CASCIA tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was fanned four wide
into the stretch and gave way. DIVA DANA, exchanged bumps at the start, was urged to dispute the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into
the turn and gave way nearing the stretch. SASSY MISS MARGIE settled last racing into the turn and never gained contention. JENNA DAWN settled
between foes in early stages and failed to menace.

SPEAKERIT tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside conceding some position nearing
the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out to split foes leaving midstretch, wrested command and drove clear. SIR SWAYSALOT, pulling
against firm restraint while held well off the second flight racing to the far turn, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late
response to prevail for the place honors. FRIO tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight to the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to
bid for command between foes but was outkicked. HAY HAY MY MY, forwardly placed between rivals tracking the pacesetter to the far turn, faded into the
stretch. AGRIPINO sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave out. SANDY BY THE BEACH settled last
in early stages and passed only tiring rivals. WICKED WEDNESDAY was settled along the inside and proved no threat. BIFF retreated early.

Footnotes
CASINO GRANDE broke readily to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace outside foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards to set the pace on a
narrow margin racing just off the rail and held sway to the end under firm handling. ACCESSIBLE exchanged solid contact with JUZCUZIFEELLIKEIT at the
start, was settled between foes in the last flight to the turn, gathered momentum splitting rivals racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the
gap on the winner. FEDERALE, forwardly placed along the inside, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to upper stretch and weakened late. OLLIEMYBOY,
forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to make a brief bid nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with the
winner and gave way late. MR. QUALITY tracked off the second flight between foes early, shifted out three wide racing into the turn but had no closing bid.
HOLY CROSS tracked off the second flight outside foes, raced four wide into the turn and had no closing bid. BUFFALO MAX settled near the inside early
and failed to menace. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT broke outwards exchanging solid, repeated contact with ACCESSIBLE at the start, was prompted to gain
some position while angling inside early but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
PURO BLANCO tracked the pacesetter three deep to the backstretch as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance in that path on the far turn while
being brushed by SAMMY'S TOWN racing into upper stretch but produced a steady late response to reel in ONE SLICK FACT in time under firm handling to
prevail. The latter was urged clear racing to the backstretch, set the pace to upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but came up second best.
BEACHTREASUREGIRL, bumped at the start, settled last outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing through the far turn,
angled four wide into the lane and steadily improved position. PUKALANI was rated between foes off the second flight into the backstretch, angled out
racing into the lane and improved position three deep between foes late. SAMMY'S TOWN, forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out nearing the far
turn while being urged to bid between foes, drifted into the path of the eventual winner brushing that foe leaving the far turn and came up empty in the drive.
MERMAID KISSES tracked off the second flight along the inside but lacked a late response. JUSTA JILL broke inwards bumping BEACHTREASUREGIRL,
angled to the inside early, switched out after a half while prompted to advance but had no rally. BROKEN ENGLISH tracked the pacesetter between foes in
second flight while racing a bit erratically, was steadied out of tight quarters nearing the far turn and quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
HIGH ROLLING DUDE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted out to bid between foes while exchanging light
contact with BROWNS GAP nearing upper stretch and wore down WILSHIRE STAR in a long drive under firm left handed encouragement. The latter was
urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the backstretch, edged forward on the far turn, dueled grudgingly through the stretch but just failed to contain the
winner. BROWNS GAP angled inwards racing to the first turn to press the pace outside a rival, continued to press the issue while being fanned three wide
while being brushed nearing upper stretch and gave way. DONE ACTING, caught four wide racing into the first turn dropping off the second flight, angled
inside foes entering the far turn and improved position along the inside. THE WAYNE FACTOR tracked the leaders three wide between foes tracking off the
second flight and continued evenly between foes into the lane. OLLIVANDER tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was caught four wide racing
into the far turn and gave way. SO NIFTY tracked off the second flight near the inside and retreated into the far turn. GLOBAL ENTRY tracked off the
second flight between foes in early stages, switched out five wide racing into the far turn and quickly came up empty. NOMINAL DOLLARS dropped out
early, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
PERT was rated inside foes in second flight, switched out on the backstretch while continuing under light reserve, was prompted to take charge racing into
upper stretch, went well clear under a left handed tap and was taken in hand nearing the wire. DAKOTA BEACH tracked the pace outside foes in second
flight, continued under patient handling to the far turn, shifted out three deep racing through the stretch and prevailed for the place honors. PACT, in touch
with a rival prompting the pace, took over to dictate terms into the far turn but gave way nearing midstretch. TREASURE CAT tracked off the second flight
outside rivals to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling four wide into the stretch but had no closing bid. MALICED shifted out three wide
early tracking just off the first flight, angled inside racing into the far turn and faded in the drive. SPLENDOR BEACH, a bit rank against restraint while racing
erratically to the backstretch, never gained contention. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight and proved no factor.
TEA PARTY flashed brief pace inside foes racing to the backstretch but was through after a half. BOURN WILD AGAIN was never a factor. CALL ME
MOONSHADOW dropped out early.
