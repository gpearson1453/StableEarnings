FLAMING JUSTICE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole to put Start From Scratch away through the backstretch,
drew away on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. EJE GAMA rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths then bid leaving the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and dug in to take second mid-stretch. TOP HAT SCRUTINY settled off the pace toward the inside,
started a bid leaving the three eighths pole but flattened stride the final sixteenth. OCONEE rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced outside
entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little more. CROSSWARD stumbled leaving the
gate and settled back toward the inside, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. START FROM SCRATCH rounded the opening turn in the
three and four paths while stalking the winner, challenged that one nearing the three eighths pole and raced close through the backstretch before fading on
the far turn.

HOUSE OF LOVE gave chase off the rail then raced at the rail through the turn, angled to the outside leaving the turn and dug in to take over the final
yards. SILKEN BELLE chased the pace outside and raced close in the five path of the turn, was bumped mid-stretch, dueled to a slim brief lead in later
yards but yielded the final yards. LIL LINDER chased the pace through the backstretch and raced close off the rail on the turn, was bumped outward and
into Silken Belle mid-stretch, recovered stride from that point and finished evenly. ODDSEVERINURFAVOR was hustled along to set the pace and raced at
the rail through the turn, but, ducked out to make contact with Lil Linder mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave chase
and raced in the four path of the turn. ROCKET BUSTER came away very awkwardly and raced well back. Following a stewards inquiry, no changes were
made.

RETURN TO DENIS saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards
and was edging further away nearing the wire. CHARITABLE ROSE stalked the pace from the two and three paths, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, dueled to even terms and took the nod past the quarter, was steadily encouraged from the head of the lane but gave up the lead later yards. CORY'S
CUTIE was shuffled back into the first turn and settled well off the pace, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and
was along for third widest. DRAMATIC PEGASUS saved ground off the early pace then raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little more. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW settled off the early pace and off the rail then rallied to
contention past the three quarter pole to race with the pace leaving the five eighths, dug in to the challenge of Charitable Rose through the backstretch,
succumbed to that one past the quarter, raced at the rail through the far turn then weakened. HI HI HOLLY rated the early pace inside but was met into the
second turn, gave chase leaving the turn then faded through the backstretch.

AMELIA BEDELIA took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail
rounding the far turn then dug in under determined handling through the stretch to ward off the game effort of AZZURRA, who raced in the four path the first
turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish, but needed a
bit more. OCEAN LILLY settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close
in the four path of the far turn and was gaining on the runner-up through later yards. SILK STOCKING settled off the pace in the three path, picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well after angling to the inside. SNIFF saved ground off the pace then
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded at the rail on the far turn.
