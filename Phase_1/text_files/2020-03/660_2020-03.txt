three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to take command a sixteenth out and was able to last on the wire from a closing rival.
SISTER ALEXA chased three then two wide, remained on hold in behind rivals through the turn until able to angle out six wide into upper stretch set down
for the drive, rallied offering up a mild kick to close in late latching on the aforementioned foe in the final strides. SPRING DRAMA prompted the leader from
the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in
under a drive and was collared a sixteenth out, dug in to safely preserve the show honors. OK HONEY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the

along the inside under some pressure from SPRING DRAMA to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and

Footnotes
ITS ALL RELEVANT away sharply, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch,
tucked to the inside nearing the half mile pole, remained patiently handled settled into a comfortable rhythm and came under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch shaking away, drew off under a drive to the finish. PATAGONIA broke in at the start bumping SMALL BEAR
in concert with KREWE CHIEF, raced forwardly placed along the inside through the first turn before chasing two to three wide down the backstretch, lost
position down the backstretch and into the far turn dropping back to the tail of the field tucked back to the inside, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths now last, angled out five wide into upper stretch under a drive, kicked on belatedly through the final furlong to secure the place honors
while never threatening the winner. FRANK'SGUNISLOADED three wide through the opening bend, chased four to five wide down the backstretch, tucked
three wide into the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ROAMING
UNION three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch advancing to be in closest pursuit of the leader, tucked to the two
path half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. KREWE
CHIEF broke out at the start bumping SMALL BEAR in tandem with PATAGONIA, raced just off the inside through the first turn before tipping four then
three wide down the backstretch, tucked back to the two path through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and weakened. SMALL BEAR bumped between foes at the start by rivals who each broke his way, chased two then three wide coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths when briefly along the rail, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

coaxing at the five-sixteenths angled in behind rivals to spin three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was directed to the inside a furlong out,
rallied up the rail to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was just up over a pair on the wire. ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from JACK BO to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three
wide into upper stretch, dug in inching away to the eighth pole before coming under threat from a pair and then a trio in the late stages and was nailed on
the wire while just preserving the place honors. CALL THE CAT loped along at the tail of the field three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path half a mile from home, came under a ride at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside surging late and just
missed at the end. ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick to miss at the finish. QUEST FOR FIRE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home, ran on through to the finish but was outkicked. JACK BO bobbled at the start, recovered to advance and prompt
the leader from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
AIR ON FIRE chased three then four wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. FLAT RATE
