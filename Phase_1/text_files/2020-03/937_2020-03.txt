Footnotes
PEPPER SINGS was quickly in front and eased in, set the pace two wide to the stretch then pushed away to mid stretch and held driving. LIL' CHIEFTAIN
pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then held the place. TUSCAN WARRIOR was away awkwardly, had no speed,
raced two wide on the turn, angled widest for the drive and did not threaten. INTIMIDATE stalked the pace early between rivals then was in tight off heels
and steadied from the half pole to the three eighths, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. UNION WINE was chasing to the turn, raced
two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. FAST SALE broke slow and trailed throughout.

JIVE TALKIN broke clean and dueled outside of SMILEFORME early, edged away from that one and eased down to the rail on the turn, rallied to push clear
to mid stretch and held driving. ZIMBA WARRIOR had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then closed willingly for the place. PISTON hesitated and
broke about three lengths last, hustled up to chase the pace, was three wide to the stretch but flattened in the final furlong. FOREIGN PROTOCOL also was
away a bit slow, had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch and did not threaten in the drive. SMILEFORME hustled to contest the pace inside
the winner early, shifted outside that one on the turn, got outkicked to the stretch then tired in the lane.

Footnotes
QUICK AND SILVER had good speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in determinedly when hooked by the runnerup and battled bravely to get
the nod. LA WAUN pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, pushed up to engage that one in mid stretch, was on terms through the final furlong and just
was nipped on the line. OWNING hustled to stalk the top two from the rail to the stretch then stayed on to the line. BULLET DRILL had no speed, was
fanned four wide to the stretch and made up ground belatedly. COLORMEMONEY was chasing to the turn, came two then three wide to the stretch but
weakened in the final sixteenth. UNCLE HAL had no speed and was not a factor.

INDIAN PEAK was outrun early then was rank behind horses on the backstretch, bid two wide between rivals into the second turn but was in traffic and had
to angle out leaving the five sixteenths, pushed ADMIRABLY off his path, shifted out in the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to prevail.
SACRED RIDER chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished wllingly for the place. AWESOME SUMMER pressed the
action to the second turn, raced two wide and rallied to get to terms in mid stretch then was outkicked by the winner and lost the place. FANTASY GAME
lagged to the second turn, raced two wide then swung out widest into the stretch and was closing ground belatedly. PRINCE DE PRINCE set the pace from
the rail for six furlongs, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. WINE AND WHISKY was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, remained four
wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. ADMIRABLY chased the pace for a half mile, was three wide on the far turn then was forced

Footnotes
TORO DE TORO never far back, saved ground into the second turn, had to wait for room leaving the quarter pole then rallied inside in the drive, took the
lead leaving mid stretch and held driving. ZEDEKIAH was allowed to settle to the second turn, swung out four deep into the stretch then closed willingly for
the place. SHIFTY DANCER tracked the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, pushed up to duel in mid stretch but got outkicked late.
PAPA DO RUN set the pace from the rail for six furlongs, stayed on to mid stretch but was weakening late. REY COLIMAN had no speed, settled to the
second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but went evenly in the drive. SOONER BETTER also had no speed, was unhurried to the second turn,
had to circle five wide to the stretch while making a run but tired once in the stretch. EARNEST had no speed and was not a factor. HARDY CHISEL
pressed the pace for six furlongs then tired.
