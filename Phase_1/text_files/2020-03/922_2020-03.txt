Footnotes
KAYSERI was forwardly placed around the first turn then stalked the leader down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for BUSINESSINDUBAI on the
far turn, vied for the lead upper stretch, took the lead near the furlong marker then held firm under steady urging. MADAME MOON settled nicely while rated
not too far off the early pace, launched a bid for command racing three wide on the far turn, continued to chase after the top pair in stretch run, inched up
closer but could not get to the winner. BUSINESSINDUBAI held a slim lead around the first turn then set the pace down the backstretch, held on top around
the far turn then challenged by the winner entering top stretch, fought back to the furlong marker then could not maintain equal terms but chased on with
response to secure show. DELIA'S PRIDE raced near the inside and edged a bit closer through early stages, prompted along the rail on the far turn and into
stretch run but needed more for serious impact. BETTIN ONNA KITTEN bumped the side of the gate then settled three to four wide off the early pace,
prompted to pick up the pace late backstretch, was ridden along around the turn then ran on five wide in the final furlong. MRS. MINIVER was unhurried and
saved ground to the far turn, moved into stretch three wide then shifted back inside and failed to threaten. LA GATA NEGRA drifted out around the first turn
then raced three to four wide near the rear, saved ground on the final turn and lacked a needed rally. HECHIZADA stalked the top two leaders to the far
turn, hustled up racing between foes at three eighths pole, raced two wide out of the far turn then gave way. DAMA DE NOCHE was reserved near the rear
along the outside, roused three to four wide into the lane but failed to move into contention. LET'S GO LUNA raced five wide off the pace and into upper
stretch without gaining a threatening position. FLUFFY TRUFFLE raced in contention while tracking along the inside then came up empty near three eighths
pole. BEE WINGS moved to the far outside and pulled up in the backstretch then walked off after the race.

Footnotes
VERY AMUSING pressed the early pace between horses, took over outside SIGHTED midway on the turn, drew off under a drive through upper stretch,
and was geared down the last 70 yards. FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS was pushed out by VISIONS OF YOU at the start, cut over in front of SAINT LARNED
and got clipped behind entering the turn, advanced in the three-path to the stretch, and ran on to get up for second late. SIGHTED held a short early lead
inside a horde of pursuers, was no match for VERY AMUSING after a half-mile, but kept on with good courage for a share. GRAN CAUSEWAY bumped
with NACHO PAPA at the start and was off slow, moved up between rivals through the early going, stayed close three wide into the lane, and finished
evenly. MEET CUTE raced in the second flight throughout, and could not menace with an even finish inside. NACHO PAPA bobbled at the start and
bumped with GRAN CAUSEWAY, raced three wide on the turn, and made no appreciable headway in the stretch on the far outside. AMERICAN ROCK
SALT was outrun inside. FRANK ALONE was forwardly placed early four wide, and tired. RAYO MY KING was strung out five wide into the turn, and
dropped back after a half-mile. VISIONS OF YOU broke out at the start, and was outrun four wide. SAINT LARNED clipped heels behind
FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS and checked past the half-mile pole, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
OHANZEE raced off the top two leaders around the turn, hustled up three to four wide into upper stretch, took over the lead from WITH A BIT OF LUCK,
came out wider and kept clear, vanned off after the race. ISLAND SONG hustled along in range then got carried wide and lost ground leaving the turn,
shifted in closer under right handed pressure, made contact with ANNUALIZED near mid-stretch and continued a solid bid. COOL HAND COOP raced three
to four wide around the turn then got carried out very wide when STORM THE BRIDGE drifted out turning for home, shifted in closer and stayed on with
response. ANNUALIZED raced two wide in range near the quarter pole then came out wider for the drive, bumped with ISLAND SONG near the furlong
marker then shifted back in and evened out. GUACO was away last and lagged in the back, saved ground into the stretch run, picked up the pace then
shifted three and improved position. OROSCOPO shifted in closer from the outside, hustled along three wide into stretch run and lacked the needed
response for serious impact. STORM THE BRIDGE advanced from the far outside to challenge WITH A BIT OF LUCK for the early lead, drifted out wide
leaving the turn the failed to regain. WITH A BIT OF LUCK sped to the lead then challenged by STORM THE BRIDGE, raced under some restraint while
wanting to get out around the turn the turn, stayed near the inside into stretch run then got collared by the winner and had nothing left in reserve. IMPERIAL
GUARD chased near the inside in range then gave way in the lane. THREE HOMBRES steadied at the start, raced near the back then five wide into the
lane and lacked a needed rally. BIG'S GRAY DAY roused near the inside around the turn then shifted out wider for the drive and had no late response.

Footnotes
BLAKEY pressed the pace inside STRATEGIC OUTLOOK, challenged in earnest after six furlongs, outdueled his foe through upper stretch and drove clear.
STRATEGIC OUTLOOK set a pressured pace in the two-path, fought back when hooked approaching the quarter-pole, but was no match through the late
stages while able to hold the place. COLIN A WINNER eyed the leaders heading into the turn, advanced into third approaching the stretch, then made no
further headway on the wrong lead. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) was outsprinted three wide to the stretch, and offered a mild response to land a share.
FALSE ACCUSATION saved ground under a drive on the turn, and had no response. SKY POINT was devoid of early speed, and passed only tired horses
outside. RATTLE'M bumped lightly with LAWYER DRILL at the start, pressed the pace outside to the turn, and began to fade before reaching the stretch.
ORGANIC JENNY was finished early inside. CAPE MARCO DRIVE bumped lightly with LAWYER DRILL at the start, and was always far back. LAWYER
DRILL was bumped lightly between horses at the start, and retired early four wide.

Footnotes
SISTER OTOOLE settled in good position and tracked the clear pacesetter two wide, moved up to take as slim lead mid-turn with RASPBERRY BALLET in
aim along the outside, shook clear from rival entering top stretch and kept clear under steady pressure. AIZU settled two wide through early stages then
headed in pursuit two to three wide around the far turn, gained closer contention and continued a steady effort to clear second best. JEANA'S GEM raced
under a snug hold to rate off the early pace, raced near the inside then angled out and moved up closer on the far turn, drifted out wider in stretch run and
churned on for a share. RASPBERRY BALLET tracked the leader down the backstretch then made a bid in tandem with the winner mid-turn and raced in
aim for the lead, stayed on with response in upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. TIZ ENOUGH raced in range and saved ground along the
inside, coaxed along the rail then drifted out leaving the turn and failed to move on. TINY TURBO was reserved in the back and saved ground, advanced
closer then steadied near the quarter pole and offered no late rally. CRESPUCULA raced along the outside off the pace, got carried out wider entering the
lane and failed to threaten. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW cleared on top nearing the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, got collared by the winner
midway around the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
TRIXIE'S TIME vied early between horses, edged away around the turn, and responded well to remain clear all out. CAT'S ASTRAY saved ground
advancing a bit on the turn, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch, and rallied with good energy outside the winner. PAULA ANDREA chased three
wide to the stretch, and was outfinished for second on the wrong lead. BALLIE'S DREAM vied inside the winner early before getting shaken off, saved
ground to the stretch and lacked the needed late bid. PLAY THAT TONE was no menace three wide. STATED raced widest throughout and was no factor.
ANJALI hit the left side of the gate and bumped with SHANGHAI MISTRESS at the start, and was outrun. SHANGHAI MISTRESS bumped with ANJALI at
the start, pressed the pace outside the winner for three furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
BLUE BUFF got bumped a bit at the start then raced three to four entering the backstretch, settled nicely while tracking the early pace, steadily advanced
closer then put a head in front at the three eighths pole, widened to a clear advantage racing in hand, shook the reins a couple times to keep attention in
stretch run, stayed sharp and well clear. IL FARAONE was reserved in the back and saved ground, angled off the rail and picked up the pace on the far
turn, roused two wide at three sixteenths pole then tipped out a path wider approaching the furlong marker, surged to the wire and captured place. YES I
SEE tossed head up strides out of the gate then remained unhurried down the backstretch, showed response late on the far turn, roused two wide into
stretch run, gained position then got edged out late for place. GRAY BEAU raced along the outside off the pace to the far turn, was under a drive at the
quarter pole then raced six wide into upper stretch and had a mild improve. AEQUOR raced near the lead entering the first turn then settled off the clear top
pair and tracked the duel to the far turn, prompted to head in pursuit on the far turn, stayed under steady pressure in the lane but lacked the needed kick for
serious impact. ANIMAL TRICK vied inside of WELL DEFINED around the first turn and held a clear advantage over the next pursuer, dueled down the
backstretch then got collared by the winner at three eighths pole, chased on around the turn then had nothing left in the lane. WELL DEFINED vied for the
lead racing a path outside of ANIMAL TRICK in the first turn, continued to battle for command while clear over the next pursuer in early stages, was no
match when the winner took over near three eighths pole then dropped back.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH WAR grabbed the lead after the start, rated along through an even tempo inside, and had just enough to stave off JOST SAYIN in the closing
strides. The latter saved ground early, had the two-path around the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and ran out of ground
outside the winner. ELITE APPEAL tucked in off the leaders for six furlongs, had aim in the two-path turning for home, but was outfinished. ROSA STAR
became unsettled as the gate opened, lunged outward and spotted the field several lengths, went up to prompt the pace three wide for six furlongs, and
weakened through the late stages. TELL ME MAUX raced three wide on the turns, and was no menace in an even effort. ROONEY raced in the two-path on
the turns, and was no factor. KARENINA settled in midpack early, advanced with a three-wide bid on the far turn, but faded through the drive. CASSIDY'S
SMILE brushed with GAROTA soon after the start, and saved ground to no avail. GAROTA brushed with CASSIDY'S SMILE through the stretch the first
time, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
SOLDADO hustled up out of the gate and chased along the inside under steady urging, angled off the rail and moved up closer then waited briefly behind
foes leaving the turn, set down two wide top stretch then shifted to the rail, advanced to race in aim for the late lead, dug in determinedly and got up in time.
FROSTED GRACE was forwardly placed in opening stages and stayed in steady pursuit into the turn, roused two wide at the quarter pole then advanced to
the lead near the furlong marker, switched in and raced two wide with a slim lead in final stages, continued to put in a game effort but could not hold off the
winner in final strides. MIHOS raced four to five wide in the back, was ridden along the outside around the turn, swung into action racing wide into the lane
and rallied for show. BELLE TAPISSERIE raced two to three wide in range through early going, kept on four wide late turn then chased on evenly through
the lane. RUNNING FOR RIZ sped to the lead and continued to hold by a slim margin around the turn, got collared by FROSTED GRACE upper stretch
then faded in the final furlong. WHERE PARADISE LAY hustled along and raced four wide leaving the backstretch, kept under a ride two wide at the furlong
marker and lacked a needed rally. BALANDEEN was widest and raced near the back early on, moved into stretch run six wide and failed to threaten.
HARRYHEE raced up close just off the early leader, continued to race in aim at five sixteenths pole then had nothing left and dropped back out of the turn.

Footnotes
BELGRANO tucked in behind the leaders to the far turn, maneuvered out three wide past the five-sixteenths, caught PEACOCK KITTEN and DEVOTED
KITTEN from outside entering the final furlong, and held for a hard-fought decision under good handling. DEVOTED KITTEN pressed the pace outside
PEACOCK KITTEN, reached even terms after six furlongs, dueled through the stretch and was game to the finish. ZIPPY had the two-path advancing mildly
after six furlongs, shifted to the four-path in deep stretch and gained too late outside the top two. THE MIGHTY JUDGE was crowded at the start and off
behind the field, gradually moved up toward the inside through the middle stages, moved to the far outside for the drive and finished willingly. PEACOCK
KITTEN set a pressured pace, dueled inside from late on the far turn to mid stretch, and weakened on the rail. GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE broke outward,
raced three wide in range for six furlongs, and lacked the needed bid. BAD TO THE CORE (FR) raced four wide much of the way, and did not factor.
BUGLE BARRY stayed in range three wide early, and faded approaching the stretch. DOCTOR D J was always outrun. FIVES WILD raced two to three
wide on the turns, and was no factor. QUALITY SPECIAL was three wide early, and never reached contention. FANTASIZING steadied between horses just
after the start, trailed to the stretch and was eased up late.
