pace looming off the leader through the turn, extending near mid track down the lane would cede to outside pressure while getting up for place. MISS BLISS
broke sharply setting the pace holding daylight to upper stretch digging in from the four path faltering late. DANCIN' ROSIE faded off the leaders on the turn
racing evenly down the lane. HIDE AND STREET played no factor. DREAM FEVER was always outrun.

Footnotes
DINESEN well placed stalked early rallying to wrest the lead outside the quarter pole widening in upper stretch holding rivals at bay from the eighth pole.
STACK EM HIGH slow early rallied from mid track in upper stretch going all out abreast rival to save place. TROPICAL CYCLONE prompted the pace being
overpowered to upper stretch dueling for place the final eighth holding reasonably well. CAUSEWAY CANDY hustled out was worked on pace through the
backside, overtaken on the far turn would check off a loose horse nearing the quarter pole fading into upper stretch. GIANT'S FORREST played no factor.
THORNY ISSUE was bothered by a loose horses on the opening turn, tracked down the backside beginning to waver on the far turn fading into upper
stretch. LEAP BABY LEAP dipped the head tossing the rider after the break, walked off after the race.

Footnotes
SALLY STRONG advanced on the turn continuing on to draw even from mid track in upper stretch putting away foe edging clear. RONNI'S DAY pressed
the pace wresting a short lead on the turn, digging in from the two path in upper stretch would cede to wide pressure. JUDGE REESE slow early saved
ground to gain contention in upper stretch finishing evenly on the inside. OPALESCENT hustled along chased through the turn then weakened in upper
stretch angling out six wide late. CAUSE OF LOVE hard ridden would vary little racing seven wide through the lane. JOIN THE PARTY pressured the pace
through the turn then folded in upper stretch. PERFECT DOLL played no factor. DISCREET ENERGY hustled along would tire to upper stretch. VERTICAL
TRAIL was always outrun. BIRD WALK offered little.

ENOUGH tracked the pace saving ground to upper stretch vying from the rail being held at bay late. CALBOYZEKE chased the pace pressing to even terms
near the quarter pole, ceded to rival near mid track in upper stretch weakening late. HONOR THE D rushed up on the outside on the turn losing some
momentum in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid track. SCHMULTZY raced mid pack proving no menace. FASTEST MAX gained ground on the turn
then leveled off in upper stretch. DANCING WILLARD was bumped as the riders leg came out of the left iron at the break. CELTIC LINE was always outrun.
