ALAN'S ARGUMENT settled just off the pace on the outside, raced in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the three-eighths, took the lead into
upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed whip outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip coming to the sixteenth-pole, swapped back
to his inside lead late and held. VENN was away well then taken in hand early and rated just off the pace, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, went
three wide on the turn, was asked at the three-eighths, came four wide into the stretch, was carried out approaching the three-sixteenths, raced outside
under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. TAPIT ON
RACE DAY bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, raced two path to the inside on the turn, was asked late on that bend then came three wide
into the stretch and also finished willingly but missed the place while clear for the show. SECRET VISTA was ridden along at the back on the outside, went
three to four wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch, reached the rail outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. TRUTH TELLER broke out
and brushed the gate then was hustled, showed speed on the outside then moved clear near the half-mile pole, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and gave way. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU was away very alertly, showed speed
on the inside of a foe then dropped back near the half-mile pole, saved ground while roused on the turn, moved out into upper stretch and came up empty.
BEFOREHAND broke towards the rear of the field, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. TENSAS GOLD bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up and spotted the front several lengths, raced near the back,

Footnotes
SEE SASSY RUN broke inwardly, moved forward from between foes early on the first turn racing in the three path to dictate terms, faced mild pressure from
an outside rival up the backstretch having moved nearer the rail, edged clear again racing on or just off the rail on the far turn, drew away through the
stretch under urging. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA tracked in behind the leaders on the first turn from the three path, moved in up the backstretch, advanced on
the leaders along the rail into the far turn but was taken a hold at the three-eighths in behind without room, continued to save ground on that bend but was
no match for the winner. G'S DEADLINE was urged at the break but still caught wide outside foes five then four deep through the first turn, applied
moderate pressure on the leader up the backstretch, was still in range two to three wide and between rivals on the far turn asked for run about midway on
that bend but could not rally. STREETTALKINHOTTIE was bumped at the break, raced mid-pack just removed from the rail early, moved out and edged
closer three then four wide on the far turn reaching striking distance but could not sustain the effort. FUHRCRY was bumped into a rival at the start and was
unhurried thereafter racing just off the rail, advanced past between rivals roughly four deep leaving the backstretch and early on the far turn, continued in the
four path through that bend before moving out in upper stretch and ran on. LUCKY HARBORAGE was bumped into the inside rival at the start, raced in the
there path in the back half of the field into the first turn, continued between rivals up the backstretch, entered the far turn in the three path moving out five
deep by the midpoint of that bend, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and made no late bid. BAD GAL RIRI tucked in mid-pack racing in the three path into the
first turn, continued just off the rail through the far turn still mid-division and made no bid. PIPER'S BUTTERCUP came in at the start bumping a rival into
others, raced a bit awkwardly into the first turn while five wide, continued far removed from the inside into the far turn going six wide on that bend and was
never a threat. BEAUTIFULANDWILD chased the leaders briefly heading into the firs turn but quickly dropped back six wide on that bend to be at the rear
for the run up the backstretch, continued well back in the three to four path and racing awkwardly on the far turn and was not a threat. COMMERCIAL
FLASH was forwardly-positioned five deep through the first turn, steadily dropped back three wide on the far turn and came up empty. MY PAL CHARLENE
saved ground inside on the turns to no avail. HAUTE CUISINE raced inside through the first turn among the leaders, moved out off the inside leaving that
bend, steadily dropped back four to five wide up the backstretch and on the far turn and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
BARBESS dropped in entering the first turn, moved from the two path to the rail on that bend, settled off the rail on the backstretch, saved ground on the far
turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, moved out under a drive near the three-sixteenths, shifted further out around the furlong marker then rallied
on the outside and closed fast to get up late. BREAKFAST POND came in early and bothered a rival, saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the
pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked a bit at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path then was put to a drive, made an outside bid
into the final furlong, reached even terms for the lead about seventy yards from the wire but missed while just able to get the place. GIRLS IN CHARGE
moved in while going to the front, set the pace in hand while on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole, responded well when put to the whip in upper
stretch, led determinedly into the final sixteenth but was caught and denied the place while clear for the show. BREEZY BEE dropped back early then
moved out, went four then three wide on the first turn, had the rider fall back in the saddle while tugging hard at the bit late on that bend, settled towards the
rear on the outside, moved further out while advancing closer midway down the backstretch, lugged out significantly around the seven-sixteenths, started
the far turn in the eighth path then dropped to the five path before the five-sixteenths, was guided all the way to the two path late on that bend and improved
position in an odd journey. GRACEFUL REQUEST went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace outside of the leader in hand, was asked
in the two tp three path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. BADGERI CANDY
was carried in early then shut-off and checked sharply, went around the first turn in the two path under a tight hold, settled more kindly on the backstretch,
was asked in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and came up empty. BIG RED ROSE stumbled at the start and was off slow,
spotted the front several lengths, went around the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BEE BIT was grabbed with the right rein at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, raced three to four wide on the far turn, dropped back while floating six wide into the stretch and capitulated. BAYLOR went three wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, floated five wide into the far turn then dropped to the three path under urging, was put to the whip inside the five-sixteenths
and failed to respond. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
BOLD REY quick moved to the fore and established a clear lead dictating terms racing inside through the first turn, continued on or just off the fence through
the far turn on a clear advantage, was asked in upper stretch and held safe under steady handling. FOUR PRINCESSES broke well and was
forwardly-positioned stalking the aforementioned three wide, edged a little closer late up the backstretch but could never really get near enough to
challenge, put to urging three wide leaving the far turn and continued to chase that rival home. YES I'M EVIL raced four wide and between rivals off the
leaders on the first turn, shifted in a bit up the backstretch and edged closer in the two path in behind the leader on the far turn, came out in upper stretch
and was put to a drive but could make no headway. SOARING NOW was caught in the four path heading into the first turn outside rivals then eased back
and shifted in near the rail early on that bend, advanced on the far turn racing two wide on that bend, moved out in upper stretch and ran on but needed
more. LADY BLUE shifted near the rail heading to the first turn then came off the fence going in the two to three path on that bend, took closer order three to
four wide on the far turn then weakened in the stretch. THAI CHILI SUE was bumped at the break, raced on or just off the inside through the first turn, went
two to three wide on the far turn and improved position late. NORTH OF EDEN chased from outside five wide on the first turn, lost ground on the leaders
dropping back four deep on the far turn. SUNDEREYA bumped the outside rival at the break, raced toward the back inside a rival on or just off the fence on
the first turn, continued well back two to three wide on the far turn and was never a threat. COLOR ME PRETTY was outside a foe two to three wide on the

Footnotes
OFFSPRING was asked some leaving the gate, moved in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when
asked at the three-sixteenths, drew off under a couple taps of a down-turned whip into the final furlong, widened under a strong hand ride into the final
seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. ROYAL ALEXANDRA was a bit slow into stride, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the
rear, went around the far turn in the two path without being asked, shifted three wide into the stretch, altered in from behind foes nearing the
three-sixteenths, was bumped outside the sixteenth-pole, came between horses into the final sixteenth and got up for the place. FOR REAL ALICE broke
out and hit the gate at the start, was rated on the inside, shifted into the two path under urging at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive while still on her
inside lead in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead approaching the furlong marker, came in and bumped ROYAL ALEXANDRA outside the
sixteenth-pole and lost the place while able to get the show. MI COPA REBOSA went three wide on the first turn, tracked the winner on the outside, was
asked in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. TOODALOO TO YOU went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried at
the rear, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CICADA'S SONG went
three wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. AIR GUITAR STAR went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to respond. KRIS T. went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside then let out in the three path
on the far turn, chased four wide into the stretch and came up empty. (Rail at 9 Feet) QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
WICKED SMART bumped the outside rival at the start, set the pace shadowed by an outside rival, went on or just off the rail through the turn, began to
edge away in upper stretch and was asked just past the quarter pole, responded well to edge away late. SAINTSATION pressed the winner from outside
going three wide on the turn, made no headway thereafter but saved the place from TORMENTA, who was bumped on both sides at the start, trailed early,
raced just off the rail through the turn, continued just off the inside into the stretch and was gaining late. REUNITE exchanged contact at the start, shifted in
heading up the backstretch, saved ground inside on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch coming about six wide past the three-sixteenths and ran on evenly.
LUMINAIRE tracked the leaders from inside on or just off the rail through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. BEAUTIFUL
BELLA raced well back early outside of rivals, went three then four wide on the turn swinging seven wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. SHELBY ROSE
was within range outside a foe three to four wide on the turn, asked for run early on that bend about three furlongs from home but came up empty in the
stretch. SIGNIFY hopped at the start, moved forward outside up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten.
