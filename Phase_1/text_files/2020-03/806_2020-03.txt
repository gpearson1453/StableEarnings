Footnotes
CAJUN BROTHER broke alertly to contest the early pace inside ONWARD and IMA PHAROAH, dueled with the latter late on the turn and into the stretch,
regained command a furlong out and gamely edged away. IMA PHAROAH pressed the pace three wide, shifted in poking a head in front after a half-mile,
continued to battle outside CAJUN BROTHER to the furlong grounds, and was bested in the late stages. VICTORY TOWN moved up inside entering the
turn, shifted out lodging a bid three wide late on the turn, and flattened out in the lane. FUGITIVE improved position four wide around the turn, and gained
mildly on the far outside to the finish. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF had good position tracking the top trio for a half-mile, but failed to respond turning for home.
GENERAL MATHIS lunged at the break and landed awkwardly spotting the field several lengths, took the turn four wide, swerved in greenly in upper stretch
and went evenly on the rail to the wire. ONWARD contested the pace between the top two finishers into the turn, and was finished before reaching the
stretch. HE'S A BABE was no factor two wide. U S S COLTON took a slight hop at the start, and was finished early outside. ALL INCLUSIVE retired early
two wide.

Footnotes
BOSS WIFE was not too far off the early pace while ridden along to maintain tempo, hustled along near three eighths pole and loomed closer late far turn,
raced five wide under a drive entering top of the lane, roused forward to briefly race on equal terms with CRYSTALINA near mid-stretch then drew clear.
CRYSTALINA sped to the lead out of the gate and continued on top down the backstretch, briefly vied with BUST OUT LADY midway around the turn then
quickly repelled the challenge, got collared by winner near mid-stretch and finished well clear over the rest. BUST OUT LADY stalked the pacesetter to the
far turn, advanced to challenge CRYSTALINA for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied briefly then could not move on with rival, weakened off the top pair
in stretch run but lasted for show. MRS. MINIVER tracked the pace along the rail, headed in pursuit around the far turn, kept under a drive racing two wide
in stretch run and lacked the needed response for impact. UNCUT was rank out of the gate and drifted in unruly like, wrangled back to last and remained
reserved along the outside then prompted around the far turn to no avail. DAMA DE NOCHE steadied and forced inward by rank running UNCUT in opening
stages and never reached contention.

Footnotes
GALLANT BID split horses advancing into the turn, closed in on REGGAE PIRATE nearing the quarter-pole, took over from outside after straightening away
for the drive, drew well clear through the furlong grounds, went wrong in the right hind and was being gathered up across the finish line, pulled up quickly
and was vanned off. VITA DOLCE lagged well back to the stretch in the two-path, and finished well to be clearly second best. REGGAE PIRATE sprinted
clear early inside, could not handle the winner turning for home, and salvaged third while weakening. GUESS FIRST bumped with RED NATION midway up
the backstretch, raced evenly inside and was no menace. SHANGHAI LEVI hopped at the start and landed awkwardly conceding the field several lengths,
moved inside going to the turn, swung back out four wide nearing the stretch and posed no threat. GOLDENLINEOF hit the left side of the gate and bumped
solidly with GRAY'S IMAGE at the start, improved position four then three wide around the turn, but could not sustain the rally and dropped back. GRAY'S
IMAGE bumped solidly with GOLDENLINEOF at the start, bumped with RED NATION up the backstretch, steadied unable to hold his spot between
GOLDENLINEOF and VITA DOLCE three-sixteenths out, and had nothing left. RED NATION got bounced around early between GUESS FIRST and
GRAY'S IMAGE, got out steadily through the turn to wind up extremely wide, was eased up through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA rated off the front runners while saving ground, moved up closer near the half mile marker then launched a three wide bid late turn, took
command nearing top stretch then stayed sharp and pulled away. AREYOUTALKINGTOME settled and saved ground in early stages, roused into closer
contention entering the far turn, waited for a clear path at the quarter pole then cut the corner, switched out three wide and stayed on with response.
MILLIONAIRE RUNNER was well reserved and lagged in the back, prompted near the inside late turn, came out a path briefly then switched back inside
near the furlong marker and cleared show. DR HARLAN rated five wide off the early pace, headed in pursuit along the outside around the turn, roused six
wide entering top stretch and lacked the needed response for late impact. BIG BOY BRUNO raced off the pace down the backstretch, was ridden along
entering the turn then put to a drive near the quarter pole, kept under steady pressure upper stretch but never got in gear. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT set the pace
down the backstretch, challenged for the lead near the quarter pole, lost the whip nearing top stretch and quickly tired in the drive. SENSATIONAL RIDE
raced in aim for the lead out of the chute, remained forwardly placed behind the pacesetter down the backstretch then failed to keep around the turn and
dropped back.

Footnotes
LETS PLAY HARDBALL tucked in behind the leaders early, was pocketed and kept in by MY BOY BLUE into the far turn, gained clearance when the latter
faltered after six furlongs, challenged outside SOUPER ENERGIZER into the stretch, and edged away after a long drive. SOUPER ENERGIZER set the
pace inside, fought back when confronted by the winner turning for home, and held well to trounce the remainder. OBIWAN was taken out three wide on the
first turn, shifted wider coming under a ride a quarter-mile out, and was along on the far outside to pick up third. MORE THAN USUAL stayed in range two
then three wide to the end of the far turn, and lacked a solid response. FIFTYFIVE STRONG raced sluggishly at the back despite early urging, and passed
only tired horses. MY BOY BLUE kept LETS PLAY HARDBALL hemmed in leaving the backstretch, briefly loomed a threat outside the pacesetter on the far
turn, but was empty approaching the stretch. HOOYAH raced three wide on the turns, and tired in the stretch. BARRANTES saved ground early, and
dropped back soon after completing a half-mile.

ZAINO BOYZ broke sharp on top, cleared and crossed over to the inside, held clear around the turn, turned for home two wide and put to a drive, had more
left in the tank and kept clear under steady pressure. PERUVIAN BOY raced four wide in the last flight through early going, hustled along in pursuit leaving
the backstretch then was driving four wide entering the lane, stayed on with response but could not get to the clear leader. GOLDEN CANDY was the
closest pursuer of the early leader and chased after rival around the turn, continued a steady inside bid through the lane and secured a share. CRAFTY
CONQUEST hustled along from the get-go, raced in range and stayed on in steady pursuit around the turn then gave way in the lane. SMALL REASON
raced in the back near the inside, moved into stretch run two wide under a drive, shifted wider and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STORMY NELLY was close up inside going to the turn, waited patiently for a way out, got a seam and responded readily being guided outside OVER
GATORS past the quarter-pole, and bested that rival in deep stretch. OVER GATORS grabbed the lead at the start, rated along in the two-path to the
stretch, battled back when challenged and yielded grudgingly late. PROSPECTIVE DIVA was outsprinted for three furlongs, cut the corner rallying into the
stretch, altered course outside and did not have enough while able to hang on for the show. WAR STAR broke a couple lengths behind the field, trailed to
the top of the lane swinging out widest, and gained belatedly. LENA HORNE raced three wide and lacked the needed bid. BAHAMIAN GIRL prompted the
pace outside OVER GATORS, and faded approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
EXTRAORDINARY was off to a good start and matched strides for the lead out of the chute, continued to vie for the lead racing outside of MY FIRST
GRAMMY down the backstretch, let out a notch and moved by rival near the mid-way point on the turn, prompted for more near the quarter pole, responded
willingly, quickly widened to a clear advantage then finished going away under steady pressure. MY FIRST GRAMMY matched strides for the lead in
opening stages, continued to duel inside of EXTRAORDINARY down the backstretch, could not move on with eventual winner at five sixteenths pole but
continued a steady bid through the lane and edged out foe for place. MUKULWITZ stalked the top pair along the inside, launched a bid for command
midway through the turn, was ridden along two wide entering top of the lane, continued a steady bid under pressure and got edged out late for place.
CORNBREAD KINGDOM settled while racing widest through early stages, prompted leaving the backstretch, showed brief response along the outside
around the turn then failed to sustain bid and gave way in the lane. NILES CHANNEL raced off the early pace, was ridden along trying to pick up the tempo
nearing the half mile marker, coaxed two wide around the turn then three wide into the lane and failed to move into close range. THE FALCON raced in the
back positioned near the inside, prompted on the rail around the far turn and into stretch run but lacked the needed response for impact. RAG TAG raced in
range positioned off the top flight to the far turn then failed to keep pace and faded.

KRACHENWAGEN brushed lightly with RULE YOURSELF soon after the start, took over from STRATEGIC OUTLOOK after a quarter-mile, rated along
inside building a lengthy advantage, and was kept driving to stay well in command. SNAP HOOK raced three wide to the stretch, could not menace the
winner but ran on willingly to go clear of the others. RULE YOURSELF brushed lightly with the eventual winner after the start, was put to a drive four wide
around the turn, and could not gain. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK led outside KRACHENWAGEN out of the chute, yielded midway up the backstretch opting to
prompt the pace, stayed on the chase to the end of the turn and faded. FANTASIZING bobbled after the start, and was never in the hunt. KING LEONARDO
saved ground and was finished on the turn. LOOKIN SAVVY was outrun throughout. STATE OF WAR became fractious briefly in the gate prior to the start,
stayed in range in the two-path for a half-mile and tired.

Footnotes
DALARNA secured inside position on the first turn then stalked while saving ground down the backstretch, tipped out and given cue leaving the far turn,
responded sharply, took command near the furlong marker and kept clear. TOTONO sped to the lead out of the gate and set the pace to the far turn, vied
for the lead racing inside of PADDY O'DINI at the quarter pole then shook clear turning for home, got collared when the winner swept by but stayed on with
response to hold place. HIGH NOON RIDER was allowed to settle out of the gate and angled inside to save ground entering the first turn, continued
unhurried two wide through early stages, launched a bid along the outside leaving the final turn, fanned five wide entering top stretch, advanced closer then
yielded late for place. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY raced near midpack down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, showed response
and raced four to three wide in range with a furlong left to run then evened out. AMERICAN NINJA raced in tight and forced to steady entering the first turn,
saved ground while not too off the early pace, produced a bid along the rail around the far turn but failed to sustain response and gave way in the lane.
PADDY O'DINI was forwardly placed racing behind the leader down the backstretch, engaged TOTONO for the lead around the far turn then tired in the
drive. KING ORB raced in the last flight through the backstretch and failed to respond when called upon in the final turn.

Footnotes
SALLY'S CURLIN hit the left side of the gate getting away behind the field, lagged far back inside early, began to get out of first gear shifting steadily wider
around the turn, fanned seven or eight paths out into the stretch, and finished with a flourish to overhaul the leaders and draw clear. WILDWOOD'S
BEAUTY was well back widest early, moved in to the three-path making little headway after a half-mile, rallied through upper stretch to loom outside
PAUSEFORTHECAUSE with a furlong to run, wore that rival down late but was overtaken from outside by the top one. PAUSEFORTHECAUSE pressed
the pace outside BLAMED through a blistering half, took over with the rider taking a confident peek back a quarter-mile out, remained clear while shortening
stride and drifting out under left-hand pressure past the furlong marker, and salvaged the show. NONNA MADELINE advanced mildly four wide midway on
the turn, but lacked a solid final response. LADY KATE was forwardly placed three wide to the turn, and weakened after five-eighths of a mile. W W FITZY
got outpaced losing ground to the leaders ridden along into the turn, moved to the far outside in the stretch and went by tired horses. HEIRESSALL chased
inside to the turn, and faded steadily through the late stages. UNHOLY ALLIANCE raced in the two-path giving way on the turn. BLAMED hustled up early,
set a fast pace in the two-path being hounded by PAUSEFORTHECAUSE, could not hold off that rival after five furlongs, and faltered.

Footnotes
YAKO raced in contention tracking the pace, moved up three wide near the lead at the quarter pole, came out wider under left handed pressure upper
stretch, held the advantage then drifted in under left handed pressure deep stretch and impeded the progress of several foes. DANCE TILL DAWN dueled
for the lead racing outside of PUT POSITION, began to move away from rival while taking on YAKO near the quarter pole, battled back along the rail, got
headed for the lead but stayed on gamely then bumped and raced in tight when YAKO drifted in late. BEACH DREAMING stalked along the inside, hustled
along two wide leaving the far turn, continued to edge closer then got in tight and jostled between foes when YAKO drifted inside late. PAINT THE
CORNERS settled along the inside near midpack, prompted three to four wide around the turn, continued to gain on the late lead then got shut off four wide
and steadied when YAKO drifted in deep stretch. TRILBY settled along the outside down the backstretch, showed response when prompted around the far
turn, was set driving five wide in range at the furlong marker and lacked the needed surge for serious impact. VITAEMI raced off the pace and saved
ground, launched a bid along the inside at head of the lane, took closer order then had to alter five wide deep stretch. RETRO STREET raced off the pace
while saving ground, lacked racing room near the quarter pole, shifted out leaving the far turn then shifted out wider upper stretch and got going to late for
impact. BAHAMA KITTEN was unhurried, swung wide into stretch run and showed interest in final stages. SPICY NELLY raced two to three wide off the
pace, prompted along the outside on the far turn, raced six to seven wide entering top of the lane and needed more for late impact. VINYARDNINA raced in
the back, saved ground on the far turn and failed to rally. TOTAL TREASURE raced near midpack then faded around the far turn. PUT POSITION held a
slim lead on the first turn, dueled with DANCE TIL DOWN down the backstretch and into the final turn then tired in the drive. AFTER A STEWARDS
INQUIRY AND RIDERS OBJECTION #9 PAINT THE CORNERS AGAINST #7 YAKO, STEWARDS ALLOWED THE CLAIM AND DISQUALIFIED #7 YAKO
