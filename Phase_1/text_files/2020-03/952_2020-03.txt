Footnotes
SEA LOVER broke readily, joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn, kicked clear nearing
midstretch and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. LANSE MITAN vied for the lead between foes in the opening stages, dueled
inside the eventual winner racing into the turn but proved no match in late stages. TITHED angled inwards tracking the leaders from out of striking distance
on the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the turn and gained some position in an even effort. UNCLE KEVIN shifted out to race four deep
between foes in the opening stages tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, then continued in that path to the lane while never gaining contention.
THE EQUINEST broke slowly brushing the gate, was prompted to split foes gaining some position midstretch but made no real impression. KING SHAWN
tracked the leaders three wide between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded. ALITE, a bit reluctant to load, was caught five wide in early stages, soon
dropped out. SANDY BY THE BEACH proved no factor. WEATHERFORD flashed brief pace inside foes prompting the issue but was spent early. WARM
was ordered by the Stewards to be scratched at the gate after refusing to load.

Footnotes
TIZ APPROVED broke readily to gain a clear advantage outside a rival in the opening stages, held sway off the rail racing into the turn, steadily widened the
advantage and was kept to firm right handed pressure. SIR SWAYSALOT, bumped by CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY at the start, was collected racing off the
second flight, was prompted to split foes just off the inside racing into the turn and steadily improved position to late stages to prevail for the place honors.
IMPERIAL GREATNESS tracked the leaders three wide between foes racing into the bend and continued evenly to late stages to gain a share. ERIN GO
BRAUGH, urged inside the eventual winner prompting the pace in the opening stages, switched outside that foe while continuing in pursuit of that foe to
upper stretch and faded late. IMPERIAL IVOR, caught five wide racing as part of the second flight in early stages, angled inwards racing into the lane and
steadily faded. STARSHIP FONZY settled off the second flight between foes early but lacked a late response. HAPPY GUY, caught six wide in early stages,
offered no rally. NOBLE KING, reserved last in the opening stages, passed between only tiring rivals. ARES WARRIOR dropped off the second flight
outside foes in early stages and never seriously menaced. VIX HERO, shuffled a bit at the start, was urged to contend inside foes but retreated early.
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY broke outwards bumping SIR SWAYALOT at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FOX ROX broke readily, sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, held sway through the far turn and
maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. NO CENTS LEFT was rated off the second flight while caught outside foes into the first turn,
switched out nearing the far turn commencing a steady, three, then four wide advance racing into the lane and edged rivals for the place honors nearing the
wire. PURE LUCK tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path to challenge the leader
nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. RUDIGER tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight, saved ground throughout and
weakened nearing the wire. BLUE PIGEON, caught four wide between foes racing to the backstretch, continued evenly to late stages. GOLD WING was
settled between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. WHISTLE ME HOME, caught five wide racing into the turn
to race on terms with the second flight, never seriously menaced. ROUGH NIGHT tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch and faded
after a half. BIG GILLETTE hopped at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter for a half and emptied out racing into the
far turn. DON'S MARSH raced between foes just off the inside in second flight, was pulled up midway through the backstretch, then was vanned off the
course.

Footnotes
MAD GRACE broke readily, pulled her way to a clear advantage racing through the first bend, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin under light rating
to the third bend, then was prompted to hold sway, then widen the advantage through the final quarter under steady handling. NATIVE LION gained a
forward placing while angling to the inside stalking the leader in the opening mile, was taken up while shifting out racing into the third bend to advance on
the leader three wide, briefly loomed outside that foe but proved only second best. STORMY D was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved
ground advancing in close quarters through the third bend but continued with interest to improved position inside foes. HANIEL settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the third turn, angled five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain some position. SUNDRENCHED, a bit rank under
restraint in the opening stages, tracked outside foes just off the second flight, was prompted into the third turn to make brief progress four wide nearing
upper stretch but flattened out late. STRICT VOW, reserved along the inside in the opening mile, was held up avoiding close quarters momentarily on the
third bend and offered no rally. CLASSY LYNN, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half mile, closed the gap in the
second half mile to briefly prompt the leader, then gave way between foes racing into the third bend. COLONELS DAUGHTER tracked the leaders three
deep in second flight to the third bend and came up empty racing into the stretch. ALL GOOD TIMES, pinched back at the break, settled in hand along the
inside and never seriously menaced. JUSTA JILL tracked the pace outside foes off the second flight and steadily faded after a mile.

stretch to gain some position but had no final kick. TALON, bumped at the start, switched outside foes while being prompted to sprint well clear in the
opening furlong, shifted to the rail setting the pace, dueled for command through the turn and emptied out into the stretch. K C TWOSTEP tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight, angled to the rail racing into the turn and steadily faded. RARE HUE broke inwards bumping TALON, was collected
off that foe and never gained contention. FORTUNICKLE proved no factor. BIG YES, caught in tight quarters at the start, dropped out early. RUN SIEGER

Footnotes
APOGEE was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled nearer to the inside nearing upper stretch, steadily gathered
momentum splitting rivals just off the inside in late stages and wrested a clear advantage in time under firm handling. FASHION MO was settled last outside
foes racing to the backstretch, angled six wide entering the lane and continued willingly in that path to prevail for the place honors. TOMORRA tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight, steadily gained position three deep between foes in upper stretch but was outkicked. PAU HANA settled between
foes just off the inside in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch to challenge but lacked the needed final kick. THAT'S MY CUE
was settled in the last flight while angling to the rail, shifted out racing into upper stretch, angled five wide leaving the furlong marker and continued with
interest in a belated effort. SUMMER LOVE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground through the far turn and faded into the stretch.
PURE RHYTHM, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three deep to challenge for command racing into the
lane, struck the front midstretch but quickly faltered. DIVINE MARTHA sped to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn and gave
out racing into the lane. LAVALIER, caught three deep between foes in second flight, retreated after a half. GOLD SOUK switched out early to track the
leaders three deep racing into the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. AKSARBEN SUMMER tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch but dropped out early. HEAVENLY JOY, caught four wide in second flight to the backstretch, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
TORNERO broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, angled in to set the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, held sway into upper stretch under some
right handed pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. WOWEE broke in bumping at the start, angled to the rail on the backstretch tracking the
pacesetter inside foes racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for the place honors. HER NAME
IS STAR tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out slightly nearing upper stretch, then angled back to the rail to gain
position inside foes late while prevailing for a share. FEBRUARYSEXCLUSIVE, bumped at the start, was settled in hand, gained position between foes just
off the second flight racing into the turn, shifted inside rivals entering upper stretch but had no final kick. GIFTED PATH angled inwards to track the
pacesetter between foes in second flight, shifted four wide into the stretch and faded late. MERMAID KISSES bobbled at the break, was quickly righted to
track the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the turn, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing upper stretch but proved empty in
the drive. JENNA DAWN was settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace. SUSIES WHO tracked off the second flight between foes and never
seriously menaced. BONSAI BENNY tracked off the second flight racing four wide, then three wide into the turn and steadily faded. TRACK MAGIC proved
no factor. JOPHIEL, steadied out of tight quarters at the start, was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
QUEENS EMBRACE was rated off the second flight inside foes in the opening half, readily gained position along the rail nearing the far turn, saved ground
advancing in close quarters through the second bend, shifted out in upper stretch exchanging contact with DUCHESS OF SUSSEX, shifted outside a drifting
rival to challenge in the four path leaving midstretch but wore down REAL DOOZIE in time to prevail under strong handling. The latter sped to the lead along
the rail, held sway on a narrow margin to the second bend, was prompted to maintain a safe advantage to upper stretch, drifted out under pressure
grudgingly resisting the winner's bid but just failed to contain that foe. HEY KITTEN, reserved outside foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch,
was prompted to advance between foes but was held up when lacking a path leaving the half mile marker, angled to the inside entering the far turn, split
foes nearing upper stretch, then angled five wide in the lane and continued willingly to close the gap. DUCHESS OF SUSSEX tracked just off the pacesetter
inside foes in the opening half, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards racing into the stretch while
exchanging contact with the eventual winner and weakened late. CHICK'S SHADOW tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide racing through the far turn, then shifted in to race between foes while lacking the needed late kick. JUDY'S WAY, bumped at
the start, tracked the pacesetter between foes just off the second flight, continued to upper stretch and faded late. PEARLS FOR JOSIE, reserved last while
angling inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch but made no impact. COUNTESS JESSICA,
forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, emptied out between foes into upper stretch. PEACE TAKER broke out bumping at the
start, tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the far turn and steadily faded into stretch. BRIDGE DANCER tracked the leaders three wide in
second flight to the backstretch and gave way after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF COUNTESS JESSICA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF DUCHESS OF SUSSEX WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.
