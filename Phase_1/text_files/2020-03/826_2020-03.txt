and was no match for the winner. WELL MANNERED stalked the pace along the inside and had no final bid. HIDDEN GUN stalked the pace, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and had no response. NAIVASHA MONTANA was slow early and never threatened. SOPHISTICATEDBLING dropped back
early, checked at the quarter pole, saved ground and never was a factor. BRONCO DAVE was hustled along and tird. LOOK AT IT failed to have a
