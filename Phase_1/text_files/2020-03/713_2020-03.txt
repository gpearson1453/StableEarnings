Footnotes
ROOKIE MISTAKE between horses early, stalked inside, came out into the stretch and again nearing midstretch, drifted in a bit then rallied under urging to
get up four wide on the line. PREACHING TRAINER had speed between foes then stalked outside a rival or just off the rail bid alongside the pacesetter into
the stretch to gain the lead, inched away in deep stretch and was caught in the final stride. JETOVATOR close up stalking the pace outside a rival or off the
rail, came three wide into the stretch and rallied between foes in deep stretch. SUMMER FIRE saved ground chasing the pace, came out in midstretch, split
foes twice in the final furlong and finished well inside. RINSE AND REPEAT chased outside a rival, came out some in the stretch and was outfinished.
ROSEY SKY had speed three deep then inched away, set the pace a bit off the rail then inside on the turn, fought back in the stretch and weakened some
late. JEN GO UNCHAINED saved ground stalking the pace, continued inside in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. LUCKY MS JONES squeezed a bit
at the start, angled in and chased inside, came out a bit leaving the turn and into the stretch, angled in again and could not offer the necessary response.

continued gamely under urging outside that one through the drive and got up between horses in the final stride. LAMBEAU sped to the early lead, set the
pace inside, dueled on the backstretch and second turn, fought back along the rail in the stretch and held on gamely but was edged on the line. DREAMS

three wide into the stretch and finished willingly alongside the top pair late. STREET CLASS chased three deep then outside a rival, came out leaving the
second turn and five wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. DARK HEDGES stalked three deep then a bit off the rail, bid
between horses on the backstretch, tracked again on the second turn, angled to the inside nearing the stretch and weakened. BOOGALUTE fractious in the
