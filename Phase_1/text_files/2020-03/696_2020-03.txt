Footnotes
SWISS THUNDER set a pressured pace off the rail, dueled clear mid turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. MOJO MATTERS pressured the
pace three wide, but dropped back midway on the turn and settled for second. STERLING FURIOSA hesitated and lunged at the break, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the five path of the turn then closed through the lane. RELAUNCHING chased the pace outside, left the turn
about the five path and finished evenly. SMARTY PLEASE gave chase through the backstretch and raced in the three path of the turn then finished evenly.
CIVIL STONES engaged in close early chase but steadied at the rail leaving the three eighths pole and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
TAP TOBOGGAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn, but dug in for the lead later yards and determinedly kept the nod. DELFINA raced with the early pace off the rail then took a slim lead nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail through the far turn, was steadily encouraged down the stretch, reluctantly gave up the nod in
later yards but dug in gamely to the finish. PRISS settled just off the pace in the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and was gaining on the top
two nearing the wire. GRACE'S WILD CAT broke a bit awkwardly and settled just off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced in
the three path the far turn and finished evenly. FIRE COMMAND loaded reluctantly and entered the first turn in the five path, started a bid nearing the five
sixteenths pole but showed little more leaving the far turn. WILD CAPPUCINO raced with the pace inside then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. MOMMA TRIES was never a factor.

the pace off the rail and finished evenly. APPROVING SONDE gave chase and raced at the rail through the turn, then finished evenly. HOLD MY BEER
pressured the pace, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride. FATHER DON gave chase toward the outside and had his heels clipped
nearing the quarter pole then showed little more. WINDSOR HILL gave chase through the backstretch and was carried wide on the turn. A LITTLE BANGED
UP gave chase under a hard left rein through the backstretch, bolted into the turn and clipped the heels of Father Don while carrying Windsor Hill wide, then

Footnotes
ANOTHER VICTORY settled off the pace in the two and three paths then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, circled rivals four wide on the turn, dug in for
the lead mid-stretch and drew away through later yards. BAYSIDER stalked the pace two deep and challenged from the three eighths pole, dueled at a
close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn, took a slim lead at the eighth pole, was caught mid-stretch, though, held on for second.
SAVAGERY stumbled leaving the gate then closed to contention along the rail, eased slightly out leaving the first turn and started a bid from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn then outfinished in a later duel for second. ZEP stumbled breaking inward and made contact with
Homer J then took control while angling to the inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn
but gave up the nod at the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. HOMER J was bumped leaving the gate and raced well off the pace in the three
and four paths, then bid only mildly from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail. AFFIX raced off the pace in the three and four paths and
showed little response through the backstretch. SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE mostly saved ground.

SILVER TAURUS rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled off the pace outside leaving the turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
improved four wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. CHARITABLE VISIT settled off the pace in the three and
four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved through the turn and slipped through at the rail leaving the eighth pole, but was caught later yards.
CAPTAIN MACHEN angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at the rail rounding
the far turn but was caught leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. WINNING SCHOLAR raced well off the pace in the three and four
paths then started an outside bid from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path but showed little more. FRATHOUSE MUSIC mostly saved
ground and could only improve his position. BLACK STEEL stalked the pace three wide then gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced close
still three wide on the turn then weakened. BLACK CANDY stalked the pace two deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole and continued close off the
rail through the far turn before weakening. MELDON settled off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded at the
rail through the far turn.

UNCANNY came away a step slow then picked up close chase outside, rounded the turn off the rail but couldn't improve down the lane.
TIZAAWESOMEDAY engaged in close early chase off the rail but dropped back toward the quarter pole and flattened stride down the lane. EASY'S FINAL
ROSE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little more. HOMEMADE MARGARITA gave early chase well off
the rail then angled in past the five sixteenths pole and flattened stride. INFLIGHT chased the pace inside then checked at the rail past the five sixteenths
pole. BURNISHED BRIGHT hesitated at the break, angled to the outside to give chase then raced in the six path of the turn. HERE'S I AM broke in to
exchange contact with Pure Romance, picked up the chase through the backstretch but weakened in the three path of the turn.
