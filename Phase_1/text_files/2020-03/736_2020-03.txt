Footnotes
TIZEZZY raced in mid pack early, advanced seven wide through the second turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, dueled with BUBBA NIGHTLINGER to the
wire and prevailed for the win. BUBBA NIGHTLINGER set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled to the
wire and just missed. DAWOOD was outrun early, made a middle move into the home turn along the inside and finished evenly late. PLEASE DO TELL was
unhurried early, circled eight wide through the second turn and flattened out late stretch. INCLUDE HOO was void of any early, went three wide into the
second turn, angled to the inside and offered no late rally. MOMS FAVORITE tracked the early pace, went six wide into the second turn and was empty.
COMMANCHERO SPRING stalked the early pace from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
FIREWATER BUZZ tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, angled out
further into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. MOVE IT MISTER was away in good order to set a pressured pace while
racing three-wide, responded when challenged by HIT BETWEEN THE ICE nearing the half mile pole, vied with that rival, drifted out approaching the stretch
and could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong. BIBLICAL CHARACTER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn, checked
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good energy when straightened away. IMPUTED was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved
ground through the turn, reached a striking position in mid-stretch but lacked the needed late response. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE broke sharply to press the
pace of MOVE IT MISTER from the inside, moved up to engage that foe nearing the half, vied and gave way through the final furlong. GO SILVER GO
chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. WAYLAY was forwardly placed from between foes, angled out into the
stretch and weakened. NACI STRADAMUS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
