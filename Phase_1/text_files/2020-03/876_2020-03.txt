rail, angled to the inside on the turn, continued along the rail in the stretch and did not rally. TICK TOCK a step slow to begin, stalked along the inside, came

RANEEM had good early speed and dueled outside a rival, took a short lead on the turn, inched away leaving the turn, drifted out some into the stretch and
won clear under urging and steady handling late. AWESOME ALESSANDRA stalked the pace off the rail, came out leaving the turn and a bit wide into the
stretch and was clearly second best. LUCKY DAUGHTER went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back on the turn, stalked leaving the bend, came a bit
off the rail into the stretch and held third. ENCHANTING MOON was a bit awkwardly into stride, dropped back off the rail then angled in on the backstretch
and saved ground to no avail. PALM D'ORO stalked the pace off the rail on the backstretch and turn, came three deep into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
EQUIPO A had speed inside a rival then inched clear, set the pace a bit off the rail, drifted out some in the stretch but held sway under urging. SIERRA
MELODY outside the winner early, stalked just off the rail, came out some in the stretch and was clearly second best. WAR MAKER pulled a bit off the rail
early, chased between horses then three deep into the turn, continued off the inside then three wide into the stretch and held third. VERY IRISH chased
three deep then off the rail, angled in some on the turn, came out in the stretch and was outfinished for the show. SATURDAY JOHNNY broke slowly,
settled outside a rival, angled in on the turn and lacked the needed rally, then was unsaddled on the clubhouse turn and vanned off. MY SUPER MARIO
wide early, settled off the rail, came three deep into the stretch and did not rally. PAPA LORENZO hopped and broke slowly and awkwardly then drifted in,
settled a bit off the rail then inside, came out into the stretch and was not a threat. GOV FROM ABOVE also broke slowly, went up inside to stalk the pace,
came out into the stretch and weakened.
