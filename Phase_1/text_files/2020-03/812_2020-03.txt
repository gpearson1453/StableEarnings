Footnotes
TEN BUDS broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, came off the rail a bit for the drive, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, dug in late to
prevail in game fashion. PRIVATE LAKE forwardly placed outside, four wide through the turn, late bid outside the winner, missed. THORNISH pressed the
issue outside the runner up, continued to contest the issue into and through upper stretch, not enough late between horses. RADICATOR broke well, raced
forwardly and inside, moved a bit closer turning into the stretch, flattened out. J'S LITTLE MAN in mid pack early off the inside, improved a bit off the inside,
had little left late. BLANCO BRONCO broke back, void of speed, improved position while not a serious threat. EGOMANIAC tired after a three wide trip.
SOUL TEMPTATION lacked speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. LIME TREE VALLEY in the main body early off the
inside, three wide out of the turn, tired in the drive. RANDOM AFFAIR remained always back. THERUNAWAYROCKET prompted the pace while three wide
early, began a steady fade before a half. UNBRIDLED SHOES fractious in the gate while loading, broke slowly, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
READY ORB NOT settled off the pace toward the inside early, moved out when advancing in the second turn, four wide into the lane, quickly kicked clear.
CRYSTAL LAKE lacked early foot, steered out to be five wide in the second turn when advancing, no match winner, clearly second best.
FLATOUTCOUNTRY settled off the pace, saved some ground into the second turn, moved out a bit to split a pair of tiring rivals late in the bend, finished up
best of the rest, no match for the top two. KISS MORE lacked speed, was four wide in the second turn, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. DULCE
RIDE pressured the pace three wide, tired in the drive. LEMON DROP KITTY last to leave, four wide into the first turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals.
BETWEEN THE HEDGES dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. MY LITTLE SPITFIRE was finished after a half. LETTERS TO BELLE
dueled up front in the two path, stopped.HEAVY FOG LIMITED VISIBILITY.

DESTINY WAY forwardly placed from the start out in the strip, four wide through the turn, got out a bit into the lane, regathered, outside bid past the furlong
marker, edged clear. JOAN'S DELIGHT pressed the pace off the inside, bid between horses late in the turn, showed the way past the furlong marker, could
not match strides with the winner late, held sway for the place. SOUIXPER CHARGER prompted the pace four wide into the turn, vied three wide into the
lane, weakened gradually down the stretch, saved the show. REEF'S DESTINY lacked speed, four wide out of the turn, mild late interest while out in the
strip. SIR BRAHMS in mid pack, saved ground through the turn, lacked a serious kick in the drive. WASABI MOON void of speed, along the inside into the
turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. YOUNG BULL broke back, made little impact off the inside. CAPTAIN DON closest to the leader,
took over in the two path early in the turn, weakened through the stretch. BANK MAN dwelt at the start, trailed well back early, three out to four wide late in
the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. EAST MOON LAKE bothered at the start, remained always back. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR was finished early
while racing three wide. PIECE OF WORK broke sharp sharply but outward, flashed brief speed, stopped.

I WILL STAND prompted the pace while racing three wide through the first turn,dueled in the two path out of the second bend, long drive, proved narrowly
best in a game effort. CODETOWIN last to leave, raced back off the pace in the three path, advanced and challenged into the lane, extended drive,
outfinished. MATROOH within striking distance, closer in some traffic into and through upper stretch, moved out, coming late. CANDY CARLOS away in
good order, narrowly set the pace inside, headed in the final turn, proved stubborn through the stretch. FAYETTE WARRIOR pressed the issue off the
inside, weakened.

Footnotes
BLACKBERRY WINE never far back while off the inside, took over into the far turn, quickly clear, drew off, ridden out. WHAT A COUNTRY settled off the
pace while saving ground, continued toward the inside into the far turn, moved out a but late in the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive,
clearly second best. OVERSHADOW lacked early foot, raced three wide, long drive for the show spot, best for that position while widest of that flight at the
wire. DREAMONMEBABY one paced out in the strip, dropped to the inside far turn, in the two path for the lane, missed show between horses. BOATING
PARTY settled off the pace toward the inside, within striking distance the middle half, two path into the lane, not enough for the show while closest to the
inside. SHAKA bothered at the start, raced back, improved slightly while not a serious threat. STOCK DEAL four wide into the first turn, remained back while
saving ground through the final turn. JASIRI forwardly placed outside, four wide when beginning to weaken late in the second turn,continued to back up in
the drive. SPECIAL PRYCE was always outrun. STURGILL broke in, bothered inner rival, was straightened to clear early, stopped when headed into the far
turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
TAISHAN got clear into the first turn through a quick opening quarter, slowed things down in the run up the backstretch, continued to set the pace through
the final turn, plenty left in the stretch to draw out without being asked for his best late. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC closest to the winner early, moved a bit
closer in the second turn, proved no match in the drive, comfortably held the place. BACKGROUND off slowly, tucked inside when well off the early pace,
continued unhurried in the run up the backstretch, steered out, loomed a threat five wide late in the final turn then hung in the drive. VILLAINOUS back off
the early pace, moved closer in the second flight in the second turn, also flattened out in the drive. LIFE ON THE ROAD void of early foot, saved some
ground through the final turn, passed some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. DAVIDIC LINE forwardly placed early just off the inside, had little left for
the drive. READY TO ROLL bobbled start, moved up along the inside, pulled while in a bit tight along the rail first turn, began to weaken after four furlongs.
SHACKLEFORD'S JOY settled in mid pack, four wide through the final turn, backed up.

Footnotes
K CHOICE stalked the three leaders in the off the inside, tipped out to the three path turning for home, challenged and put a head in front past the furlong
marker, edging clear under firm handling in a determined efforts. NIFTY last to leave, trailed for almost a half, angled out steadily to be four wide into the
stretch, widest when bothered by SILVER RIDE when that one came out with a furlong remaining, finished up willingly after recovering. IMPACT PLAYER
with the pace from the start, vied between rivals into the turn, continued to contest the issue while surrounded through the turn and into the stretch, gave
ground grudgingly to the top two. SILVER RIDE within striking distance outside, continued to maintain contact with the leaders through the turn, came out
when going evenly past the furlong marker and continued evenly to the wire in lacking a late punch. RULER OF THE NILE back off the pace along the
inside, saved ground to no avail in an even effort. FAST BREAKIN CASH broke back, lacked speed, improved position slightly without posing a serious
threat. KAUAI remained back. CURATE vied up front while along the inside, caved in the final furlong. BETTER CHARGE IT set or forced the pace three
wide, stopped.

Footnotes
NIGHT OPS in the second flight along the inside, asked along in the far turn, split foes three wide exiting that bend, set down, closed resolutely to be up in
time. SNAPPER SINCLAIR broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, dueled in the run up the backstretch closest to the inside, continued to hold the
advantage into the lane, headed a furlong out, could not contain the winner while proving game in coming back for the place. PIONEER SPIRIT closest to
the runner up into the first turn, joined that rival in dueling up the backstretch off the inside, continued on equal terms through the final turn, briefly put a head
in front with a furlong remaining but could not last. BRAVAZO forwardly placed, angled out to be four wide turning into the stretch, lacked a closing punch.
GUEST SUITE back off the pace, moved a bit closer along the inside into the far turn, lacked a further response to finish up evenly. LAUGHING FOX off a
bit slow, trailed into the first turn, moved out, four out to five wide in the second turn, came up empty for the drive. BANKIT lacked speed, steered out to be
four wide out of the final bend, also was found lacking for the stretch run.

Footnotes
SERENGETI EMPRESS broke alertly to garner a daylight advantage past the wire the first time, lightly rated onto the backstretch inside, shrugged off some
brief pressure from a loose horse into the far turn, not threatened through the stretch, wrapped up late to win ridden out. MYLADY CURLIN away in good
order, moved off the inside for the run through the first turn, continued back, saved ground into the far turn, rallied while continuing inside, no match for the
winner, held sway second. SARACOSA void of early foot, trailed for five furlongs, steered out three wide when advancing midway on the second turn,
outkicked for the place while also no match for the winner. STREET BAND closest to the winner while along the inside, came up empty for the stretch run.
LADY APPLE settled in the second flight off the inside, also had little left for the drive. RAHWAY three wide through the first turn when off the pace, was
finished before a half, trailed home. AWE EMMA reared at the start, unseated rider.

Footnotes
NADAL broke with the field, dueled into the first turn, was joined by a second foe to duel in the run up the backstretch through some lively fractions,
disposed of that rival turning for home to be clear, drifted in nearing the furlong grounds, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. EXCESSION fell
back quickly after the start, continued unhurried while saving ground, moved closer in the second turn, steadied slightly late in that bend, got through a large
opening into the stretch, steered out past the furlong marker, drifted out then was getting to the winner late. BASIN settled off the pace and the inside,
encountered some traffic late in the final turn, clear into the lane, proved no match for the top two late, gained the nod for the show. THREE TECHNIQUE in
the second group off the inside, continued to track the middle half, crept closer in the final turn in the four path, flattened out in the drive, missed the nod for
the show. COACH BAHE last away, raced well back outside the runner up, steered out four wide around traffic late in the final turn, drifted out midstretch
then finished up evenly. SILVER PROSPECTOR in the second group off the inside, in a bit tight from between horses in the first turn, saved some ground in
the second turn, traffic a quarter mile out, was one paced with bothered slightly as the runner up steered out with a furlong remaining, continued flat to the
wire. AMERICAN THEOREM forwardly placed after the start, moved up to join the winner from the outside onto the backstretch, quick fractions, gave way in
the drive. NO PAROLE broke sharp, dueled briefly outside the winner into the first turn, fell back then stopped after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CLASSY BEAST moved up inside to contest the issue early, showed the way through the turn, long drive while continuing inside, held on late to prevail in
game fashion. SILVERBELLA behind the pace toward the inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out slightly for the drive, finished well to be getting
to the winner late from the outside. TIPSY GAL pressed the pace outside, continued to force the issue while four wide through the turn, set down for the
drive, lacked a winning punch, caught late for the place. WEEKEND FUN forced the pace from between rivals and three wide, came up empty for the drive.
CYNICAL GIRL set or forced the pace from the two path for just over a half and began to weaken. GURL YOU FINE lacked early speed, in the two path
through the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. SACRED UNION failed to seriously menace. NEVER SAY CAN'T off step slow, remained
always back. LUCKY BETTY in the main group while between horses, tired in the drive. LEGGS GALORE was never involved.
