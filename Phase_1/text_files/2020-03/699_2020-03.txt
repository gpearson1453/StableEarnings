Footnotes
TWELVE MONARCHS taken in hand, confidently handled, rallied to split horses past the quarter pole and went clear under steady handling. MAGIC
FINNISH perfectly placed three wide throughout while no match for the winner but bested the rest. LIL HITCHHIKER chased leader to far turn, shuffled back
out of the turn to lose position and re-rallied back for show. ANGEL FACE unhurried throughout with a four wide move quarter pole and no bid. TIZ
MICHELLE'S WAY speed from the fence to the lead, stayed for three quarters and came up empty. BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE had an awkward start, close to
the half but dropped back. MISS HATTIE never a menace, widest into the stretch run, little interest. Quarter time missing due to damaged beam.

enough to make it close. MISS FRANK E raced evenly with no late kick when needed in the stretch run. BRILLIANT KITTEN chased winner to quarter, ran
out of gas and faltered in the lane. JEWELISA slow into stride at the break, race back to far turn, moved up. AT LEAST never a contender at any point.
UKNOWIAINTLYING failed to menace. AIR TURBULENCE through at the half and dropped back readily. BOARDING CARD never far back to the half,
gave way readily thereafter. LITTLE CHICK never asked at any pole with a wide trip throughout.

Footnotes
STANDFORTHEANTHEM perfect position to quarter pole, roused to go, responded well to go clear. RUSSIAN TO TAPIT no speed to far turn, rallied
outside past quarter pole for place. HOWARD ROARK staggered from gate, rushed to lead, set pace to the stretch but faltered. RUN THIS TOWN bothered
badly start, never far back to stretch, no late gain. FAMILIAR DREAM lugged in start, raced evenly, lacked late response when needed. ENHANCED
EDITION squeezed start, trailed to far turn, widest run to improve late. MR. SARINANA never a real menace. RUBATO bore out start, never reached a
contending position. GATTO ROSSO bumped at the start, rushed to leader for half, stopped.

the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. FLATTER ME PLEASE set the pace early from the inside of the trio, was off the rail into the
lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. BIRD IN THE HAT vied for the lead early from between horses, was in the three path into the lane and faded late
