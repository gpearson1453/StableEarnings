Footnotes
SEELEY showed good speed, pressed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back along the rail early on the turn, was taken in hand while off the heels of
the leader outside the five-sixteenths, shifted off the rail while asked outside the quarter-pole, rallied four wide into the stretch, began to drift out when put to
a left-handed whip in pursuit of the leader inside the three-sixteenths, continued to drift out while making a bid into the final furlong then switched to a
right-handed whip, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. PURE VALOR broke a step slow then angled in
towards the rear, moved up outside the half-mile pole, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead while roused
into upper stretch, led under a vigorous drive while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, lost the advantage while continuing on his inside lead outside
the sixteenth-pole and missed while well clear for the place. SWINGING GALAXY broke in and bumped soundly with a rival, was rated in fourth position,
came under urging while two then three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show.
NOCOMET was bumped soundly at the start then sent hard before settling on the inside, saved ground while asked on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the whip and failed to rally. KING'S PRAYER bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed and set the pace on the outside of a foe, moved
clear in the two path early on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong
and gave way. CLASSICAL DUBAI was very reluctant to load then broke a step slow, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground through the turn and
was no factor. GEAUX DUBAI broke in and bumped with a foe, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged along in the two
path on the turn and failed to respond. REMEMBER ME POP bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on
the turn, drifted in under a right-handed whip in upper stretch and also failed to respond.

HANDSOME HONEY went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, advanced four wide to make a bid midway
through the far turn, took the lead while five wide into upper stretch, shook clear inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in outside the furlong marker then was
put to a left-handed whip, drifted out while clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. SURGE PRICING was asked leaving the gate and
went to the front, set the pace while well rated inside to the two path, was headed just after being asked at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner under
a drive in upper stretch, switched out behind that foe into the final furlong, kept on well into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place.
JAILHOUSE KITTEN went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced under tight restraint while between foes late on the backstretch,
went five wide on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. ZING ZANG was well
placed on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and
lacked the needed response then just missed the show. SOUPER CATCH went two to three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, dropped back

Footnotes
THEBOYZGALAXY saved ground along the inside just off the leaders, continued along the inside through the far turn shifting out three deep coming out of
that bend, was thereupon put to a drive, struck the lead inside the final furlong and won going under under steady urging. STAR GAZE was just a bit
reluctant, gained forward position stalking the leader from off the inside going in about the three to four path through the first turn moving in a bit coming out
of that bend, continued to stalk up the backstretch beginning to edge closer into the far turn, took over two wide past the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper
stretch, overtaken past the furlong marker and was only second best. COMPROMISING was outside foes under a moderate hold in the three to four path off
the leaders through the early going, moved up outside rivals heading up the backstretch and into the far turn going three wide on that bend, came out four
wide coming to the top of the stretch and put to urging, could not make headway on the top two but captured show honors. TIZ ONE FEE exchanged a light
bump and very slightly steadied at the start, saved ground on or just off the turns racing toward the rear, came out a bit in upper- to mid-stretch and passed
rivals to improve. NANA'S JOY exchanged a bump at the start, tucked in to the three path into the first turn racing toward the back, continued four wide and
outside rivals on the far turn coming five wide into the stretch, passed foes but was never near enough to threaten. CHARZEE BABY cleared the field
heading to the first turn and shifted in to the two path early on that bend moving nearer the rail by the run up the backstretch, dictated terms on a clear lead
before being challenged on the far turn, was overtaken late on that bend then gave way. JUST CRUISING bumped with the outside rival at the start, raced
outside a foe two wide on the first turn, continued two to three deep while dropping back between foes on the second turn and failed to produce a bid.
BERNADETTES VISION bumped with the outside rival at the start and was thereupon urged forward, went four to five wide outside rivals on the first turn,
edged a hair closer outside a rival up the backstretch, dropped back while getting out and going four then five wide on the far turn, ended up receiving
corrections from the rider nearing the quarter pole having moved out seven to eight deep and faded thereafter.

IM A COWBOY TOO went to the front, set the pace under a snug hold in the two path, was challenged to his outside midway down the backstretch, vied
inside of a foe in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked near the three-sixteenths, switched back to his inside lead outside the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. THEORYINTOPRACTICE went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked in the two
path on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths then made an outside bid, vied outside of the winner in the final
furlong and missed while able to get the place. PAYDAY TOO was moving around at the start and unprepared for the break then off slow, spotted the front a
couple of lengths, was taken back nearing the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled in the back half of the field, was urged along while four wide on
the far turn, came between horses near the furlong marker and finished with good energy for the show. PAPA'S BOY was bumped at the start, jostled with
foes early, was hard held while two path to the inside through the first turn then rated just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked coming to
the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. LOUISIANA MOON jostled with a rival
early then checked, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, went three wide on the far turn, came five to six wide into upper
stretch then moved out a bit further and improved position. KRAFTY BOY went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with a
half-mile to run, chased four wide on the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch, came out while dropping back into the final furlong and weakened. RUN
ROCKET broke out and bumped with a rival, jostled with foes early, was hard held while inside on the first turn then reserved off the pace, raced inside to
the two path while roused on the far turn and failed to threaten. WHY JOEY WHY jostled with an opponent early then was taken up, went three to four wide
on the turns, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT broke a step slow, moved out under restraint early, went five to
six wide on the first turn, advanced outside on the backstretch to make a strong middle move then made a bid outside the half-mile pole, vied outside of the
winner in the three path on the far turn, dropped back with the rider tugging hard on the left rein in upper stretch and had nothing left. CABO'S RUMOR went
three to four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back into the far turn, went three wide on that bend and capitulated. (Rail

MISS IMPERIAL pursued the pacesetter from outside going three wide on the turn, took over a narrow lead approaching the quarter pole, was given
moderate hand urging past the three-sixteenths then went to a right-handed whip past the furlong marker while clear, was continued to be asked late and
just lasted from BEAUTIFUL TALE, who settled at the rear, shifted in heading into the turn racing just off the rail through that bend, came out four wide in
upper stretch and was put to urging, was gaining late but missed. MIZ SHELTON chased from outside going four wide on the turn, asked for run early on
that bend at the three-eighths pole but had no response and steadily weakened. PROPOSITION was coaxed at the break, set the pace hounded by the
winner going just off the rail through the turn, came up empty in the stretch.

BUY ME CANDY broke a bit awkwardly, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up three to four wide on the far turn,
made a bid nearing the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, battled outside of two foes under a left-handed whip while still on his inside lead into
the final furlong, switched to the proper lead when the rider shifted his weight outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady urging. PINTXOS

far turn, vied between horses starting near the five-sixteenths, came under the whip while still between horses in upper stretch, battled until inside the
furlong marker then was outfinished while just able to get the place. WHATA PERFECT DAY was unsettled in the gate, came away in relatively good order,
raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled nicely off the pace, was coaxed along passing the seven-sixteenths, came under stronger
encouragement in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch under the whip, chased the top two on the outside in the drive and was
out-kicked then just missed the place. REACH THE MOON raced inside on the first turn, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied inside on the far
turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. HOFFA was

Footnotes
HALF AGAIN stalked just off the leaders early, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch from ONE MORE JUMP
but had to duel with that one late and held under urging. ONE MORE JUMP moved forward inside a rival to contest the early lead, obtained a narrow lead
into the turn going inside on or just off the rail through that bend, was overtaken in upper stretch but fought on gamely to duel late and settling for second
best. COMMANDER SCOTT broke outwardly just a bit, shifted in gradually up the backstretch making it the two path in behind the leaders into the turn,
continued on or just off the rail behind those runners through that bend coming out turning for home, was three deep nearing the three-sixteenths and within
range but lacked the needed late kick. DADDY COOL CAT saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn while lacking early speed, advanced inside
rivals on the turn and came out a bit turning for home, moved out further in mid- to late-stretch but was never near enough to threaten while gaining position.
PRINCE CARLOS hopped slightly at the start, was urged along but devoid of speed racing off the inside, went in the five to six path on the turn outside of
rivals, came a bit wider into upper stretch and drifted in having reached late stretch. HOSTILE AFLEET was just a bit reluctant to load, contested the pace
from outside the runner-up then continued to chase three to four wide between rivals on the turn, came up empty in the stretch and faded. BY OUR LOVE
moved in heading up the backstretch then back out a path prior to entering the turn, checked very sharply early on that bend near the seven-sixteenths as
an outside rival began to come in, continued three wide on the turn, drifted in having reached upper stretch at which point the rider threw the reins with force
to change leads and ran on thereafter. FINEST SABER veered out sharply at the break, raced well outside mid-division up the backstretch, moved in from
the five to the four path early on the turn then back out later on that bend, was empty for the drive.
