Footnotes
LINDA AND MINDA away quickly from the outside, set the pace three deep off the fence, cleared foes and angled in slightly, carried a clear lead from the
two path into the stretch, urged right-handed throughout the stretch and held well. KATHIA attended the pace from the inside, chased the leader around the
turn while saving ground to the lane, kept along the fence through the final furlong and kept on willingly for the place honors. HOPE PARKWAY stalked the
pacesetter from off the rail, tucked inside on the turn and saved ground to the stretch, then came out a bit and showed a mild rally to edge rival for third.
BRITE TAN forwardly placed between rivals up the backstretch, chased outside a rival and two wide into the stretch, came out a bit in the stretch and was
edged for the show. MIRA LOMA MADAM lacked early speed and moved off the rail to travel four to five wide up the backstretch, angled in and took the
turn two wide and failed to threaten in the final furlong.
