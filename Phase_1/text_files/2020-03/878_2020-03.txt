Footnotes
PLEASANT BUFFY broke sharply, moved clear of her foes setting the pace a bit off the rail, held sway into the lane and maintained her advantage under
firm hand urging. MANCORA tracked just off the pacesetter between rivals in opening stages, continued with a steady bid pursuing the winner to upper
stretch but proved only second best. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW was rated off the second flight outside foes and gained some position while no threat to the
top pair. ONLY IN AUGUST, a bit restless in the gate, was urged to a forward placing three deep tracking the pacesetter into the turn and gave way after a
half. EXTRA SALSA tracked just off the second flight along the inside and steadily faded nearing the lane. AUNT BETTY was under pressure early but
lacked response.

Footnotes
DREAMING DIAMONDS broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace just off the inside on a narrow margin, turned back a challenge from THE GREAT
KATH nearing upper stretch, then kicked away late under firm left handed encouragement. NIKKI BELLA, urged to prompt the pacesetter three deep in the
opening stages, conceded some position racing into the turn, was prompted to advance racing into upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with the
winner. THE GREAT KATH angled to the inside prompting the pace inside the eventual winner, pressed the issue into the turn but gave way into upper
stretch. ACCOLADES GALORE broke in the air while off slowly, switched outside foes in early stages, raced four wide into the turn and steadily faded.
TAKIN IT EASY bobbled at the start, was quickly righted to track just off the second flight along the inside but retreated early. U KNOW I B LION dropped
out early.

Footnotes
ACTION WARRIOR angled in sharply in the opening stages to force the outside rivals racing through the backstretch into the turn, forged clear nearing
upper stretch and was kept to firm left handed encouragement to extend the advantage. TEN MILES HIGH broke slowly, quickly recovered to pursue the
leaders along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside foes racing into the turn to gain striking distance but couldn't gain terms with the winner
while prevailing for the place honors. TITHED tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance five wide in the opening stages, steadily gained
contention three wide on the turn, shifted in entering upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. SMOKEY SONG, unhurried outside foes in the opening
quarter, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and continued with an even effort. SAISON ducked out at the start, was righted, then urged along the
inside prompting the pace into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. ARBA shied from SAISON at the start, recovered quickly, then was urged
between foes prompting the pace, steadied out of tight quarters racing into the turn and soon gave way. VIX HERO proved no factor.

DYNAFORM, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just off the leaders inside foes racing to the backstretch, came through when presented an opening
midway through the backstretch to press the issue inside rivals, dueled on the far turn into upper stretch, shifted about under pressure through the final
furlong but held the challenge of CHAOS KID to the wire under firm encouragement. The latter tracked just off the leaders between foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted to the inside racing into the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, came through along the rail to challenge inside the
leader leaving midstretch, was steadied in tight quarters late and was just outkicked. SINATRA DEVIL, three deep between foes in second flight leaving the
chute, drifted out into the path of ROCK THE PARK racing into the first turn, was righted to track just off the leaders between foes into the backstretch,
shifted out four wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance and was just outkicked by the top pair. VIOLATOR joined the pace outside a rival
leaving the chute into the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the far turn, then to upper stretch but yielded late. MASPERO was settled last in
early stages, angled out five wide in upper stretch and gained some position while finishing evenly late. ROCK THE PARK, four deep between foes leaving
the chute, was carried out a bit racing into the first turn, was righted, then urged to press the pace three wide into the far turn and gave way into upper
stretch. AUTOGRAPH, caught five wide racing into the first turn, dropped out early. ACASEADAY, urged to the lead along the rail racing into the first turn,
emptied out entering the backstretch, was steadied out of close quarters nearing the half mile marker and soon gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
RIDER OF CHAOS KID LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WHICH WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT broke slowly losing some position to the field, raced unhurried gaining a position just off the second flight in the opening quarter, was
prompted to split foes just off the inside when presented an opening entering upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter leaving midstretch and edged
forward in time under brisk right handed encouragement. RUSSIAN ROULETTE sprinted clear in the opening stages, set the pace racing off the rail into the
turn, held sway to upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but couldn't contain that foe. SWEETLY MAID tracked just off the pacesetter
racing three deep between foes into the turn, advanced in that path to challenge entering upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. CLEARWATER
tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight along the rail racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and faded a bit in late stages. CAUGHT
UP IN YOU settled outside foes in the opening stages, came under some prompting racing into the turn, angled in nearing upper stretch and failed to
menace while racing in close quarters between rivals late. SWEET DADDIO switched outside foes in the opening stages, made brief progress four wide
through the turn to gain contention after a half but proved empty in the drive.

Footnotes
HUSBAND IN LAW, urged to gain a forward placing while conceding the lead racing to the first turn, prompted the pacesetter after a half, took over racing
through the far turn and drew well clear under firm right handed pressure. OLD FORT was settled in the last flight between foes avoiding some close
quarters into the first turn, switched outside rivals entering the backstretch, advanced on the leaders four wide through the far turn to upper stretch and
proved best of the others. AMERICAN DRIVEN tracked off the second flight between foes into the backstretch, gained some position into the lane, then
altered five wide in the closing stages while continuing well enough to prevail for a share. MORO DRAMA, carried out by JORDANS WAY at the start, was
pulling a bit inside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep to gain some position between foes racing into the far turn, angled inside racing into
the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. PRIVILEGIO tracked three wide off the second flight in the opening half, advanced in that path to briefly contend
into the lane but had no late kick. DISTINCTLY BREWED, forwardly placed outside rivals tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, steadily faded into
upper stretch. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. JORDANS WAY ducked out at the
start momentarily impeding a rival, was righted to just off the leaders inside foes to the backstretch but was through after a half. DRILL BIT broke slowly and
never gained contention. HALEL was hustled to the lead along the, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave out once headed by the winner.

Footnotes
GUERRERON tracked the leaders outside rivals from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, made steady progress three deep racing into the far
turn, moved to challenge in upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. UPPER CROWN was urged to
the lead from between foes racing into the first turn, set the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn to
upper stretch while resisting the winner's challenge but yielded to that rival late while just saving the place honors. LUNDQVIST was rated off the second
flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out after a half to gain position between foes, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted
out four wide into the lane and continued with interest while just missing for second. SUNSHINES OUT tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the
opening stages, advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn, dueled between foes to upper stretch and flattened out late. CIRCLE AWAY, reserved
while angling to the inside early, swung out five wide racing into the stretch and made some belated progress. OSVALDO, urged to gain a forward placing
along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, was urged to advance inside that foe when presented an opening in upper stretch but proved
empty in late stages. MARU'S RAVEN was settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention. ONEWAYTICKET bobbled slightly at the start while
his rider was momentarily dislodged from his irons, was collected racing into the first turn while shifting out four wide nearing the backstretch, continued in
that path to the far turn while making brief progress but soon faded.

Footnotes
MR WRENCH IT, reserved while angling to the rail early, saved ground through the far turn, came through inside the pacesetter to challenge for command
in upper stretch and went clear under a drive. BARREL OF STOUT, reserved in the last flight along the inside, saved ground into the far turn, shifted out
four wide nearing midstretch and prevailed for second. VINTNER was rated well off the second flight to the far turn, angled out five wide racing through the
stretch and prevailed for a share. HONEY DONT stalked just off the pacesetter between foes to the far turn, bid into upper stretch but lacked the needed
final kick. FADE AWAY settled outside foes in early stages, advanced four wide between foes into the stretch but had no late kick. PARADISE ISLAND
tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight and came up empty into the lane. WHAT A HOOT was settled between foes in early stages, was fanned
six wide and proved no threat. LOCANO sprinted clear of the field into the backstretch, held sway to the far turn, gave way midstretch and was vanned off
the course following the race. AMERICA'S SIMMARD failed to menace. FALSE INFO, forwardly placed three deep tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight, gave way nearing upper stretch.
