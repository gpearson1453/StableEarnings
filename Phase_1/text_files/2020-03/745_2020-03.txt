Footnotes
SKYE SNOW advanced gradually through the middle stages, began moving in earnest four wide after six furlongs, collared the leaders from outside past
the eighth-pole and edged away under a drive. LOOK ME OVER was in range early, challenged between horses three wide turning for home, and battled
gamely to the finish. BEAM OF LIGHT prompted the pace outside TUFF BIRD, bid between rivals two wide coming off the far turn, fought her way to a short
lead a furlong out, but was outkicked inside the top two. FORTY ZIP hit the left side of the gate getting away last, trailed for six furlongs, swung four wide
into the lane and rallied on the far outside. MAKISUPA (GB) was widest entering the backstretch near the back, found her best stride in mid stretch and
gained belatedly in the three-path. CAPABLE saved ground in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, swung three wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed bid. TUFF BIRD set the pace inside, came under attack from several challengers late on the far turn, and gave way a furlong out. ONE TIME
AROUND stayed in range to the stretch near the two-path, and tired. STORMY DERBY DAY steadied slightly inside TUFF BIRD approaching the first turn,
and made no impact. SEX SYMBOL saved ground early at the rear, and never reached contention. NO MORE STORIES was forwardly placed inside for six
furlongs, and tired. PAID UP took a bad step and became highly unsettled through the stretch the first time, was pulled up on the first turn, and walked off.

Footnotes
FOUR GRANDS was ridden along out of the gate and gained a forward position just off the top pair, advanced to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and
quickly widened to a clear advantage, turned for home two to three wide, continued to pull away while ridden out and finished clearly best. MAGGIE FITZ
applied pace pressure to the leader in opening stages and raced in aim for the lead between foes leaving the backstretch, was no match when the winner
took over three furlongs out but stayed on under steady pressure and cleared second best. MUSIC TEACHER sped to the lead and held a slim advantage
over MAGGIE FITZ, was no match when the winner took over upon entering the turn but chased on under a drive near inside in stretch run and held a
share. SEVEN CLUBS bumped a bit with foe at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground throughout and lacked the needed response to threaten. FAST
CATALINA bumped a bit with foe at the start, chased after the top trio in early going, continued in pursuit around the turn then tired in the drive. BOOKS
broke out then swerved in a step and got away slowly, switched out a few paths and lacked early speed, raced wide under right handed pressure entering
top stretch and offered no late run.

Footnotes
MANTRA was covered up inside for six furlongs, briefly awaited room late on the far turn before opting to move out three wide, gained clearance with a bid
through upper stretch, reached the front past the eighth-pole and gamely repelled late challengers from both flanks. MANICOMIO was four wide into the first
turn, moved inward for the run up the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, got through inside a tiring DERMOT a sixteenth out and just missed with a
last-ditch bid.. WILLING TO SPEED went along under a firm hold early between horses, swung four wide for the drive and came flying too late outside the
top two. BOLD PAYNTER raced three then four wide around the first turn, rallied in the three-path at the top of the lane, but did not have enough. DERMOT
established an easy pace inside, shortened stride into the final furlong and steadied while being overrun from both sides. TRICKY MAGICIAN prompted the
pace outside DERMOT to the top of the stretch, and came up empty when set down.

Footnotes
TOPO GRIGIO raced just off the leader out of the chute and continued to force the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead racing outside of
FLASHING RED around the turn and battled on gamely into the lane, took a slim edge over foe near the furlong grounds and refused to be denied.
FLASHING RED held a slim lead out of the chute and continued under pressure from TOPO GRIGIO down the backstretch, vied for the lead still holding a
slight edge over rival around the turn, fought back gamely in stretch run, got headed for the lead but never game up and battled back until the end. WITCH
HUNTER raced in close range while tracking two wide through early stages, hustled up around the turn then raced wide entering top stretch and churned on
for a share. PLEASE got shuffled back strides out of the gate and raced in the back, settled not too far back then responded when prompted entering the
turn, gained four to five wide near the quarter pole then failed to sustain bid in the lane. HARMONIC THUNDER raced in range through early going and
remained positioned as a sharp factor leaving the backstretch, given cue three wide entering the turn, failed to gain closer order on the top pair then steadily
faded. SO DEAR raced along the inside in range of the frontrunners down the backstretch then gave way on the far turn. GREY JAZMINE raced six paths
wide not too far off the pace through early stages then lacked response and faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS T TOO set the pace inside, shook off GUAZZA approaching the stretch and opened up, and was hand urged to win fairly comfortably. ENVOUTANTE
stumbled badly at the start, recovered to track the leaders in the clear outside, moved to the rail around the turn, had aim at the pacesetter but lugged in
greenly through the late stages while clearly second best. MYLASTFIRSTKISS rocked back as the gates opened and came out awkwardly, improved
position three then four wide around the turn, and was along for the show without threatening. SUNDAE SMILE was slow into stride, moved out in the
stretch and passed only tired horses. GUAZZA pressed the pace outside MISS T TOO for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch on the wrong lead.
JUSTLEAVEITALONE went along in midpack early, came under a ride toward the inside midway on the turn, and had no response. STARSHIP
MALLOMAR was finished early inside.

Footnotes
BROOKES ALL MINE matched strides for the lead out of the chute then set a pressured pace down the backstretch, widened to a clear advantage still
unleashed around the far turn, mildly prompted upper stretch, pulled away and finished ridden out. VALLEY DATE was forwardly placed through early
stages then launched a bid for the leader near three eighths pole, could not reach the eventual winner but continued a steady effort along the outside
through the lane and finished second best. AMALUNA raced in the back and saved ground to the far turn, angled out and hustled along four wide into the
lane then shifted inside near the furlong marker, gained position then chased on evenly in final sixteenth and finished on equal terms with KINDHEARTED
KOTA for show. KINDHEARTED KOTA raced off the top flight near the half mile marker then launched a three to four wide bid around the turn, shifted out
wider under left handed pressure in the final furlong and churned on to split a share. BABIE MONSTER switched off the rail in opening stages and moved
up to prompt the pace, remained forwardly placed down the backstretch then failed to sustain bid and gave way on the turn. MOTION'S FIRST matched
strides for the lead out of the chute then remained in close range through early stages then faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
BAJAN GIRL broke alertly but steadied back losing position first time under the wire, crept closer in the two-path behind a wall of horses coming off the far
turn, found a narrow seam between horses past the 70-yard marker and was up in a blanket finish. SETTING THE MOOD was never far back, raced three
wide around the far turn, moved out and finished gamely on the far outside. VALLETTA prompted the pace outside LET THEM EAT CAKE, reached a short
lead through mid stretch, but was outkicked inside the top two. OCEAN AIR went along in the second flight for six furlongs, angled out leaving the turn and
finished willingly between horses. LET THEM EAT CAKE set the pace inside, lost the advantage through the furlong grounds and stayed on stubbornly.
ACT LIKE ARTIE stayed close three wide to the stretch, loomed a furlong out surrounded by rivals, did not have quite enough to maintain position and was
squeezed and checked back between BAJAN GIRL and OCEAN AIR in deep stretch. OCALA saved ground on the turns, and posed no threat. MAGIC
FLUTE raced close up inside to the stretch, and tired. VEER was no factor two wide. BIG CHEEKS was slow into stride and showed little. CAUSEWAY
ROYCE was four wide heading into the first turn, and dropped back steadily after a half-mile.

Footnotes
VICKYTHEBEST tracked the clear pacesetter along the rail in opening quarter, advanced two wide to take command near three eighths pole, continued to
hold firm on top entering the lane, rivals began edging closer in final stages, stayed game and had enough in reserve to hold on. GRAN BRANDY settled off
the pace racing along the outside, prompted past the half mile marker and advanced into closer contention near the quarter pole, stayed on with steady
response after VICKYTHEBEST in stretch run, edged closer on rival nearing the wire but could not reach in time. LA TRES JOLIE was off slow at the start
and remained reserved while saving ground down the backstretch, responded when given cue to pick up the pace near the half mile marker, gained along
the inside around the turn then tipped out a path top stretch and remained in steady pursuit to clear share. PAOLA'S TEAM broke inward at the start,
tracked the clear pacesetter in opening quarter, advanced to race in aim for the lead entering the far turn but failed to move on with eventual winner,
continued a bid around the turn then faded in the lane. JOPLIN raced widest off the pace down the backstretch, had no response around the turn then
moved into stretch wide and failed to factor. LA FLAMENCA rated off the clear pacesetter through early stages, hustled along and raced in range along the
outside near the quarter pole but failed to sustain bid into the lane. ANGELIC KNUGGET sprinted clear through early stages then got headed near three
eighths pole and dropped back.

TRAPPEZOID hit the right side of the gate and was off at the back, began moving three then four wide on the far turn, moved further out rallying through the
drive, reached the leaders with a sixteenth remaining and edged away. CHASE RUNNER went up to join the leaders four wide heading to the turn, fought
his way to a short lead through mid stretch, and stayed on well. CANDY CRUSHEM was outrun early inside, moved to the two-path leaving the turn, rallied
between horses through the furlong grounds but did not have enough. SO LONG CHUCK alternated for the lead with KYLE for a half-mile while feeling
additional outside pressure, and weakened on the rail in the last furlong. BLACK PEPPER raced two wide around the turn, and could not gain. MR ATILA
went up to contest the pace three wide between horses approaching the turn, and gave way after a half-mile. KYLE dueled outside SO LONG CHUCK early,
got joined from the outside by MR ATILA and CHASE RUNNER after a quarter-mile as well, fought on between horses leaving the turn, and faltered outside
the eighth-pole.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN RON tracked the top two leaders along inside in early going, angled out and roused for more late turn, surged to command past the furlong
marker then held firm under a driving finish. CRYOGENIC raced outside of CAPTAIN RUN while tracking the top pair, launched a bid racing in tandem with
eventual winner late turn then set down five wide for the drive, put in a solid run but could not get by the game winner. FULLY LOADED held a slim lead
over R BOY EVENS in opening stages, dueled for the lead racing inside of rival around the turn, fought back and held the edge at the furlong marker then
got outkicked when top pair kicked by. R BOY EVENS applied pace pressure to FULLY LOADED in opening stages then dueled with rival around the turn,
remained in striking range then gave way in the final sixteenth. HONOLULU EXPRESS was reserved and raced in the back then angled out and headed in
pursuit, raced wide into the lane and had a mild improve in final stages. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE raced along the inside not too far off the early pace, coaxed
along the rail on the turn then angled out turning for home and gave way. DARK AGES raced three to four wide in opening stages, failed to advance under
pressure around turn and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
EMOJI GUY raced in striking range from the outset, got roused outside the quarter-pole three wide, kicked in to reel in BEE MAJOR through mid stretch and
drove clear. TRACEABILITY bumped with CLIFTON PARK at the start, saved ground to the far turn in the second flight, moved out for the drive and finished
with good courage between horses to get the place. STRONG HEADED lacked room after the start, then steadied again through the stretch the first time,
angled out leaving the far turn and gained late on the far outside. BEYOND THE CALL saved ground to the stretch, moved to the two-path with a mild run
through the furlong grounds, and was outfinished. BIG TREASURE saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail a sixteenth out and showed some late
interest. BEE MAJOR cleared to the lead around the first turn, rated along inside to the stretch, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. HERO UP
prompted the pace outside BEE MAJOR for six furlongs, and tired in the stretch. CLIFTON PARK got bumped between horses at the start, steadied along
the inside nearing the first turn, and lacked the needed late response. HELL BENT was never a factor. AVANT GARDE went into the first turn extremely
wide, moved in a bit up the backstretch and could not reach contention. NIMBLE BEAST bumped with CLIFTON PARK at the start, was four then three wide
on the first turn, and was finished early.
