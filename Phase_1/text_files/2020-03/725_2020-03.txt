Footnotes
SEXYAMA circled horses around the turn, was five deep in upper stretch, drew out under urging and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. ORTINOLA lacked
speed, was two wide in upper stretch, angled to the inner rail inside the three sixteenths pole and rallied nicely. MAE SAI PRINCESS chased the pace three
wide around the turn, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, weakened and drifted to the two path near the sixteenth pole. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER chased
the pace around the turn, was in the four path turning for home, steadied behind MAE SAI PRINCESS in upper stretch then failed to rally.
HEELSTOTHESKY lacked speed, raced in the two path through the stretch and failed to be a factor. ONE ODD STORY sprinted to the early lead, hugged
the inner rail throughout and weakened through the stretch. Objections by the rider of GOTTAFLATHAVEHER against SEXYAMA and MAE SAI PRINCESS
for alleged interference in upper stretch were not allowed.

Footnotes
AMANITE took over soon after the break, was nudged along, setting the pace towards the rail, moved away a bit around the turn then held firm while under
a steady hand ride. FREE , three deep prompting into the turn, dropped back slightly mid turn, came back into the lane, drifted in briefly, was corrected and
continued willingly to be second best. TALE OF PERFECT LA prompted the pace between runners early, dropped in towards the rail around the turn, edged
up a bit mid turn, chased but went even late. UNION ANNIE broke slowly, settled off the pace, made an inside run past the five sixteenths, angled out but
failed to seriously sustain. WHY NOT YOU failed to menance. I AM AINE , in the clear within range heading to the turn, chased and gave way.

ANNIKA GOLD stalked the duel, circled the turn four deep, gained the lead outside HASHTAG SELFIE in mid stretch and drew out under urging. HASHTAG
SELFIE disputed the pace outside FIRTH, battled inside the winner in the stretch and faded late. YESTERDAYSPLAN lacked speed, raced in the two path
on the turn and passed tired horses late. CALL ME JELLY ROLL off the duel down the backstretch, advanced in the three path between horses to reach
contention near the three eighths pole then gave way through the stretch. FIRTH rushed up early, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and gave way on
the turn.

Footnotes
CORT'N ASONG had speed then rated back off the leader nearing the five eighths, angled out and rebid between rivals near the half mile marker, prompted
the issue around the turn, moved to a slim lead into the lane, dueled outside LION LORD from there and dug in tenaciously under pressure to prevail
between foes. LION LORD sped to the front and secured the inside, was joined nearing the half mile pole, handled outside pressure around the turn, was
headed soon into the stretch, battled gamely inside the winner from there and saved the place. LORD SIMBA , off the pace and towards the inside, edged a
bit closer as the duel developed into the lane, eased out and finished gamely to gain. MY EMINENCE dropped off the pace, circled four to five wide into the
lane but failed to generate a solid finish. LA MAQUINA GRIS broke a step slow, was taken wide and pulled his way forward, bid three deep nearing the half
mile marker, failed to kick on with the leaders leaving the far turn, chased and came up empty.

Footnotes
PEP TALKING assumed the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn, remained in the two path in the stretch and dug in late to prevail.
RUMSON RALLY dropped back after an alert break, trailed to the stretch, angled to the six path in mid stretch and closed outside horses. LAST CHUKKER
stalked the pace, circled the turn four wide, had aim on the lead through the stretch and flattened out. MCLEAN HOUSE hugged the inner rail most of the
race and weakened late. DREAMIN N SCHEMIN , rated behind horses for five furlongs, swung to the five path turning for home then came up empty.
TAPITONTHESIDE was outrun. HIGH SOCIETY was outrun. PATRIOTIC QUEST chased the pace, was three wide on the turn and gave way entering the
stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE MISS RAELYN vied to the inside of MARY'S JEWEL while under good handling, came under pressure near the quarter pole, gained a short lead
with a furlong to go, kicked clear under left handed rousing soon after and held firm while kept to task. MARY'S JEWEL sped to a short early lead in the two
path, dueled outside the winner from the half mile marker to mid stretch, failed to match strides from there but continued on with good effort to be well clear
for the place. OLIVE KAT stalked the pace while saving ground, was under coaxing leaving the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked a rally.
SARAH'S TREASURE pulled her way forward between runners early on, steadied briefly near the five and a half furlong marker, dropped back some
leaving the far turn, angled out but failed to generate the needed run. BIRD TRAFFIC drafted back off the pace while saving ground, continued inside into
and through the lane and offered a belated response. YOU MADE IT , well placed three wide stalking the dueling leaders, failed go on under a ride heading
towards the lane and gave way. OUR STAR , three to four wide, failed to respond. LILO'S CALL broke slowly, was taken wide early and faltered leaving the
far turn.

Footnotes
BATTLE READY came in at the break, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, steadily increased his advantage through the stretch and
was under brisk urging in the late going. TOP HAT WARRIOR bore in at the break, circled foes three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch,
chased the winner, drifted out late and held the place. SIR DOUGLAS lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home and offered a slight rally.
ALGORIX , three wide on the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. FINBAR , bumped by TOP HAT WARRIOR leaving the
starting gate, chased the pace two wide around the turn and tired. PRIME TIME MAN saved ground on the turn and weakened. SHOTMASTER , forced in
by the winner leaving the starting gate, retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SOMETHING , a bit keen early while prompting the pace along the rail, drop back some mid turn, responded to right handed rousing and came
back along the rail nearing mid stretch to engage the leader, forged to command approaching the sixteenth pole and kicked clear while kept to task.
COMBAT QUEEN stalked the pace three wide, ranged up nearing mid stretch and continued on willingly to nab the place. MAGICAL LUNA had speed
outside the winner, pulled her way clear early turn, set the pace in the two path, was joined from both sides near the furlong grounds and gave way
grudgingly. VIRGINIA BEACH , bumped at the break, settled off the pace, made a mild run between runners nearing the quarter pole, eased out but lacked
a serious finish. PRETTY EDGY , bumped at the break, regrouped to save ground but lacked a stretch rally. JENN'S THE BOSS came out at the break and
bumped with a rival, edged up then steadied along behind rivals heading towards the half mile marker, shifted out, raced four wide into the lane and faded.
IT'S SO EASY bobbled at the break, was bumped and pinched back soon after then failed to recover.

Footnotes
ADABEL advanced two wide on the turn, secured command in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously late to hold sway. KHALOS
VISION began to advance in the two path between horses mid way on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. BROADWAY TROUPER
sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. FOUR LADY rallied through a close quarters along the rail near the
sixteenth pole. BODHICITTA saved ground on the turn, drifted to the two path turning for home and gave way. NOTION'S BEAUTY chased the pace three
wide on the turn and faltered.
