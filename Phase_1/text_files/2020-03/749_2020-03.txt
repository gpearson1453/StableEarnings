Footnotes
AGGRESSIVITY pushed out a bit at the start, in the second flight off the inside, advanced three to four wide late in the turn, bid between rivals entering the
stretch, drove clear. JOHNNY TIZNOW within striking distance, moved closer three wide and inside the winner late in the bend, could not match strides with
that rival the final furlong,. held sway for the place. KASILOF lacked early foot, two path through the turn, in some traffic late in the bend, improved position
through the stretch with some mild, belated interest. LITANY forwardly placed out in the strip, got out late in the turn, weakened the final furlong to lose a
couple of positions. WHITE WOLF last to leave, raced back off the pace, saved ground to no avail. FUDGE TOUGH set or forced the pace between rivals,
faltered in the drive. HARLEQUIN set the pace along the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
SCORING away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, continued to contest the issue into the stretch in the two path, shook off the other speed when
straightened for home after that rival steadied slightly along the rail, dug in late to hold the runner up safe late. HIS GIANT never far back, came three wide
out of the turn, advanced and challenged the winner from the outside with a furlong remaining, denied. DUBNATION bothered slightly after the start, lacked
speed, swung out four wide turning for home, improved position. FEELING IT came out slightly to bother an outer rival, was straightened and dueled up the
inside, continued on equal terms with the winner through the turn, steadied slightly along the rail turning for home, weakened. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN OUT OF THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. ADMIRAL BROWN broke back, raced outside, three
out to four wide turn, lacked the needed response in the drive. SEEK N JUSTICE broke sharp, fell back off the pace, had little left for the drive. SCOOTER'S
BOY last away, trailed much of the way while wide, not a threat. T C'S IMAGE forwardly placed in the early going, stopped in the turn.

STARVANA within striking distance off the inside, closer three wide turning for home, bid past the furlong marker, edging clear under steady handling. HER
GOLD MINE second flight, toward the inside early, lacked room in tight quarters into the turn, continued in traffic and lacked room again midway on the
bend, dropped to the inside for the drive and finished willingly to earn the place. DEDE'S TRICK back off the pace, moved out and was five wide turning for
home, finished willingly to finish up best of the rest. LITTLE SLEW pressed the issue early from the outside, joined the fray three wide turn, showed the way
into the lane and then faltered. LIL H back off the pace inside, steadied then was bothered by a stricken foe before a quarter, moved outside, came four
wide into the lane, improved position. LIL RESPECT in the second group, three out to four wide turn, weakened in the drive. FOXY BOX away in good order
from the outside, vied into the turn, between foes through the bend, also faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. YOU CAN INCLUDE
ME off slow, sluggish, well back. LUCKILY flashed early speed for a half along the inside, stopped late in the turn. ARKYARKYARKY raced behind the pace
inside, shortened stride before a quarter, pulled up, vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
CALL ME DERBY broke on top, with the early pace off the inside, vied through the turn while continuing between horses, shook clear in upper stretch,
enough left to hold off the runner up late. SMELLIN CANDY pinched back at the start to be off slowly, far back, came five wide out of the turn, finished
willingly to be getting to the winner late, clear for the place. DREXEL contested the pace while three wide into the turn, proved no match for the winner in the
drive, nor could contain the runner up, saved the show. JAPEDO settled off the pace and the inside, improved inside, steered out a bit, flattened out in the
late going. THE DARK JEWEL off the pace while racing outside, four to five wide in the turn, improved slightly with some mild late interest. MOON DOG
SPOT broke out to help rough up a pair of outer rivals, raced within striking distance, four wide late turn, had little left. P C SUSPECT made little impact in
the two path. SHOAL BAY in the main body early inside, fell back into the turn, continued to lose ground early n the bend, moved out widest for the drive
and picked off a couple of tiring rivals. IRISH OAK broke in to rough inner rivals, was finished after a half three wide. ORDAINED CAT washy, broke well,
vied up front closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. RUSTY CAGE roughed at the start, recovered to move up and race four wide through the turn,
stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CARLOS SIXES closest to the leader off the inside, inched closer then took over turning for home, long drive, proved best in determined fashion.
DANGERFIELD settled off the early pace and the inside, continued to track in the second flight while between rivals second turn, moved out a bit when
roused for the drive, late bid outside the winner, not enough in the waning strides. HERBIE away well, set the pace from along the inside, responded when
the winner came alongside in the second turn, gave ground grudgingly in the drive. CHICORY BLUE settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground in
the second flight, lacked a closing kick. WICKETS WAY in mid pack, four wide through the second turn, came up empty for the drive. GOSPEL ABE void of
speed, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. MILLWOOD lacked speed, also saved ground to no avail. ITALIAN CHARM prompted the pace while racing
three wide, backed up in the drive. KENTUCKY ALLSTAR remained always back.

Footnotes
LEXI ON THE MOVE forwardly placed out in the strip, four wide bid exiting the turn, kicked steadily clear the final furlong. MY ITALIAN RABBI vied front
while racing in the three path thus allowing a rival up inside into the turn, vied three wide through the bend, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner
upper stretch then could not keep up, clearly second best. JADE D'ORO broke alertly, set the pace along the inside early, continued to contest the issue
through the turn, began to gradually weaken into the lane, saved the show. PERFECT HAPPINESS slipped at the start, moved up under a firm hold to force
the issue, split foes to challenge into the turn, vied through the bend while remaining between horses then faltered in the drive. HENNY FLY fell back off the
pace after the start, failed to menace. MOORAC last away, was also never a threat.

Footnotes
ASTROLOGER dueled up front into the first turn, allowed the leader to go onto the backstretch, dueled upper stretch, long drive, proved best in a
determined effort. GREAT FACES dueled early in the two path, got clear after a quarter, pace, responded when challenged, extended duel stretch,
stubbornly. TONALTALITARIAN off slowly, raced far back, continued to trail by a wide margin in the run up the backstretch, began to move midway on the
final turn, came five wide into the lane, bothered, altered course a furlong out, finished full of run to be rapidly getting to the top two late. NO BAD DAYS
stalked the top two while three wide, had little for those two in the drive, caught for the show. MY NAME IS PHRED off a step slow, back off the pace,
steadied into the first turn, continued in mid pack, came out to bother a rival with a furlong remaining, finished up evenly. AHSAD went one paced
throughout. COLD SMOKE back off the pace and the inside, steadied into the first turn, remained outside, lacked a closing kick. INSTIGATED settled in the
two path, had little left for the drive. FRONT MAN within striking distance while saving ground through the first turn, continued to track the middle half, came
up empty for the drive. DESCENT four wide in the first turn when well off the pace, remained back. WITHERSPOON was finished early, trailed home.
