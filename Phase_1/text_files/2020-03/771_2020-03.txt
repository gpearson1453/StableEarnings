MACHISMO stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied determinedly three wide through deep stretch and was up in the final strides. GRECIAN PRINCE made
the lead soon after the start, set the pace in the two path until deep stretch and was caught in the final stages. GONE TOO SOON trailed into the stretch,
swung outside and was steadily gaining ground late four wide. OVERBEARING vied for the lead while saving ground and finished with good courage.
DRENA'S BULLET failed to menace. DELTA EXPRESS well placed, failed to respond. ROYAL'D pressed the pace three wide and was through after a half.
ROLLIN WAY OVER was through early.

SKYTOWN CAT made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace, shook clear in upper stretch and just lasted under left handed urging.
GOES TOO FAST never far back, rallied steadily in the four path and just missed. MISTER MOBIL trailed for a half, swung wide and had a mild late rally in
the seven path. DARK MAZE unhurried early, moved up two wide between horses on the turn then leveled off. READY TO ROCKET stalked the pace four
wide into the stretch then faded. LAST CRUSADER had speed from the start, inched closed along the rail on the turn then came up empty. TAKE OFF TO
MAUI pressured the winner three wide into the turn and was through after a half.

Footnotes
SONNYS CIGAR away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under right handed urging to win going away. MOBIL MAGIC bumped at the
start, moved up two wide into the stretch and finished clear for second. SMART DRUNK chased the winner into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing
the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. SLICK SIX vied for the lead along the rail into the stretch then weakened. PIRATE'S CODE settled mid pack
then lacked the needed response. MARCO'S ABYSS was no threat. MA MOO POWER bumped at the start, settled close up along the rail, checked on
heels entering the turn and dropped out of it. TROPICAL VAQAY bumped at the start and was no factor. HARRY'S SQUARED was outrun.

Footnotes
ALPHABETTING made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace unchallenged and won as much the best. PEGGY'S COVE never far back,
advanced along the inside on the far turn and into the stretch and finished second best. MANHATTAN LADY unhurried near the inside, shifted out to the
four path and closed some ground late. ROSES FOR MARTINA failed to menace. PEBBLE SLINGER unhurried early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals
in the middle of the racetrack. PURDY BIRDIE chased the winner from the three path to the quarter pole then flattened out. ITS MISTY IN PARIS was
outrun. GLORIOUS FREEDOM close up into the far turn, gave way. SWEET BAYTOWN pulled up on the first turn and was walked off.
