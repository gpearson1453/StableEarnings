Footnotes
SHOOTERS SHOOT grabbed lead into first turn, controlled pace from the inside, edged away in upper stretch and padded final margin in the lane under
few taps of whip and steady handling. FRIAR'S ROAD stalked from just off the rail into and through the backstretch, shifted to the rail on the second turn,
rallied inside to gain second and drew clear of other rivals late. LANE WAY forced the early issue then tracked pace from between rivals, continued off the
rail and three wide into the stretch and held for a minor award. YENG AGAIN three deep into first turn, tracked pacesetter from off the rail or outside a rival,
remained on four wide path and weakened in the drive. SEIZE THE DAY caught four wide into initial bend, stalked from the outside, remained on same path
into and on the final turn, came out further leaving second bend and also weakened. MONGOL ALTAI reserved early while angling over, saved ground
chasing the pace, came off the rail leaving last turn and never reached contention. STRUGAR settled outside foe, chased three wide to second turn, came
in slightly around last bend and lacked any response.

PERFECT ICE STORM content to track pace from off the rail then three wide, roused and quickly advanced on the second turn, gained lead nearing quarter
marker, shook free in upper stretch and extended that margin under few left hand taps. REDS SACRED APPEAL reserved from the inside, saved ground to
the second bend, shifted out on that bend, came three wide into the stretch and drew clear from inside rival in the lane to proved second best. RUBY
BRADLEY stalked from along the rail, continued inside winner, angled out late on the second turn and was out finished for the place. DISCRETE STEVIE B
prominently placed while outside pacesetter into and through the backstretch, moved up and gained brief lead later on last turn, could not match winner into
the stretch and weakened. WINSINFASHION was hustled to the front shortly after the break, set pace just off the rail, overtaken midway on the last turn,
gave way readily into the stretch, was eased in the lane and walked off.

BALTIMORE BEECHO chased outside a rival and three wide early, made progress around the turn, came out further in upper stretch, closed strongly from
the outside, collared leader in deep stretch and out finished inside rival to be along in time. PROMISE NOTHING bumped lightly with inside rival at the start,
settled inside, angled out entering the stretch, rallied then bid between rivals inside sixteenth marker but could not match winner in final strides.
BRICKYARD RIDE bumped lightly with runner-up leaving the gate, rushed up inside, gained command, set uncontested pace well into the lane, grew weary
in final sixteenth and could not hold top pair. NONNO'S POLARIS was void of early foot despite some asking and dropped well back, trailed on three wide
path to the stretch then found his best stride late. PROJECT LEADER close up early then stalked pacesetter from off the rail, continued three wide into the
stretch but weakened through the drive. COLEINATOR chased inside winner, continued between rivals then two wide, dropped back around the turn and

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GARDEN stalked from the outside, caught four wide into and on the turn, continued on same path into the stretch, closed from the outside,
reached the front at furlong marker and edged away late. DON'T STOP LOOKIN contested the pace outside rival into the bend, gained advantage
approaching top of the stretch,drifted out slightly in upper stretch, came back in inside eighth marker and went willingly to the wire. GOLDEN MELODIE
stalked from between rivals and three deep to the bend, continued on same path around the turn, angled in some in upper stretch, steadied slightly just
inside eighth marker, came back out and out finished rival for third. KUDA HURAA dueled inside runner-up early, continued battle inside same foe on the
turn, forced the issue into the stretch, remained along the rail and was outgamed for third. NEW YEAR NEW ME stalked from along the rail, angled out
leaving the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no late threat. PROBABLE tracked pace from between rivals, continued two wide, later gained the
rail and weakened. TIZ CURVY was off bit slow then squeezed back at the start, chased well off the rail or four wide and lacked needed response.
WRITING IN THE SKY broke in leaving the gate, chased from the inside, chased two or three wide to the lane and was no late threat. SWINGN IT was
fractious in the gate then slow into stride, chased from the inside and failed to menace. The jockey of GOLDEN MELODIE claimed foul against the
runner-up for interference at the eighth marker but the stewards disallowed the claim of foul, ruling that the incident did not cost GOLDEN MELODIE a better
placing.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR broke in and bumped rival, forced the early issue outside leader then stalked that foe while three wide into the lane, gained slim
advantage in upper stretch, inched away in the drive and lasted and desperate handling. JEN GO UNCHAINED stalked from between foes, continued three
then four wide into the lane, came in slightly through the drive, whittled gap on winner in late stages but was denied outside that rival. TEMPLE KNIGHTS
chased while bit off the fence, shifted out further approaching top of the stretch, came five wide into the lane, continued outside and was up in final strides
for third. SADDLE BAR tracked pace from the inside, came off the rail on the turn, bid from between rivals in upper stretch, fought gamely inside but gave
ground grudgingly nearing the wire and lost the show. ISEE IT IN HISEYES broke a step slow then was bumped from both sides leaving the gate, chased
two wide, secured the rail into the lane and weakened. WICKED ULTIMATUM broke out and bumped foe at the start, quickly recovered and sped to the
front, set clear pace while just off the rail, was overtaken shortly after departing the turn and weakened. SURE PROOF broke alertly then was taken off the
pace, chased three or four wide to the stretch and also weakened.

HANG A STAR settled off early pace then tucked in behind dueling leaders, awaited room along the rail entering the stretch, found clear path inside AVA'S
CHARM and surged past that rival to gain lead past eighth marker then powered away under urging. RATHER NOSY was taken off the rail early, came
three wide into the lane, loomed in upper stretch from the outside, could not match the winner late but gamely got up in final strides for second. AVA'S
CHARM dueled inside rival then gained slim advantage, came out slightly leaving the turn, was overtaken past furlong marker, continued inside and was
collared in final jumps for second. MONGOLIAN HUMOR settled off the rail and off the fence, angled in on the turn, came back out in the final sixteenth and
improved placing. BUSY PAYNTER contested the early pace outside a rival then pressured that foe on the turn, was between foes into the lane and
weakened through the drive. CHOCOLATE SPEIGHTS reserved early while well off the rail, came in some on the turn and lacked any late response.

Footnotes
ZILLINDA chased early while slightly off the rail, gained the rail entering the stretch, responded gamely from right handed urging in final sixteenth and nailed
leader in final jumps from along the fence. QUEEN CARMELITA was closest pursuer into and around the turn, continued bit off the, challenged entering the
stretch while outside pacesetter, gained lead past furlong marker, inched away, drifted out in deep stretch slightly, was caught in final yards and just lasted
for second. REAL GOOD DEAL chased four wide, came in some around the turn, rallied outside winner in upper stretch and through the drive and narrowly
missed from between rivals on the wire. SYBIL'S KITTY chased early from the outside, remained four or five wide into the stretch, continued outside through
the drive and got up for a minor award. PURDUE rushed up from the inside to grab early control, set pace on two wide path, resisted when challenged in
upper stretch, was overtaken past eighth marker and weakened in late stages. CHALKY (IRE) reserved early from the inside, swung out four wide, came
five wide into the stretch and failed to offer needed late response. LAKER JET chased from the inside, saved ground to the stretch but to no avail. DADDY'S
MELODY stalked while outside a rival, continued off the rail to the stretch and weakened in the drive. PROMNESIA unhurried from the inside, remained
along the rail and lacked needed response. DIOSA settled off the rail, chased three or four wide into and around the turn and also failed to reach contention.
