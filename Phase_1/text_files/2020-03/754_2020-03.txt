Footnotes
NERVE LINE broke readily, stalked just off the pacesetter three deep racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid to challenge racing into the stretch and
drove clear. KUPURI settled off the second flight while shifting off the inside early, split foes racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to
just prevail for the place honors on the wire. RICHIE'S SISTER bobbled at the start, was righted, then sped to the lead, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin racing between foes into the turn, couldn't match the winner leaving midstretch and weakened to lose second on the wire. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL
tracked just off the leaders racing four wide into the turn and faded into the stretch. GO GIRL GONE, urged to position forward placing along the inside
prompting the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into the lane. COTTON TOOYAH stumbled slightly at the start, was settled collecting her stride and never
gained contention.

Footnotes
FOURTH DESIGN angled inwards to join the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn, edged clear in
upper stretch and held the late challenge of HEY BIG GUY to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter broke slowly, settled last angling
inside in the opening quarter, shifted out splitting foes entering the turn while angling four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap
on the winner to the end. WILD WIGGLIN JACK tracked off the first flight outside foes from out of striking distance racing to the turn, advanced three deep
racing into the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SENT FROM HEAVEN vied briefly for command between foes, was eased off the first flight racing
into the turn to track those rivals between foes but had no closing bid. ROCKYSBUCKAROO brushed JUNCTION at the start, was urged along the inside
disputing the pace inside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. JUNCTION, reluctant to load, broke out hitting the gate
while being brushed by a rival, shifted out five wide racing through the backstretch and continued wide through the turn while offering no rally. K P CREED
tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter and faded from contention early. MOONWALKER bobbled at the start, shifted out early
dropping off the second flight and proved no threat.

Footnotes
I'M A G SIX was prompted to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, continued with a steady bid pressing the issue
in that path leaving the far turn then prevailed narrowly nearing the wire under firm handling and left handed pressure. TOWN CLASSIC tracked just off the
pacesetter along the rail racing to the backstretch, came through inside foes when presented an opening to challenge for command along the rail in upper
stretch and disputed the issue to the end while just outkicked. LAST PROMISE sped to the lead racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
between foes to the far turn, grudgingly resisted challenges racing into the lane but couldn't contain the top pair. SYCAMORE LANE tracked off the first
flight outside foes under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide midway through the far turn while being prompted to challenge but lacked
the needed late kick. NEW JERSEY JOHN was a brief factor between foes tracking the pacesetter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
READY TO MINGLE was settled near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out after a half, steadily gained contention three deep between foes racing
into the far turn, was shuffled a bit nearing the lane, angled out five wide entering the stretch and continued with a steady late bid to narrowly prevail in time
under pressure. HUBBA BUBBA tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, drew into contention racing into the second bend, was held
up in tight quarters while dropping to the rail leaving the far turn, was prompted to challenge inside foes to strike the front between calls late but was just
collared on the wire. DRILL BIT broke slowly, settled outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the far turn to gain
the advantage in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. ROYAL FAMILY, reserved outside foes just off the second flight, was prompted to
advance with a sharp move three deep racing into the far turn challenging for command between foes but flattened out in the drive. JORDANS WAY tracked
the leaders outside rivals in second flight, made a brief bid between foes after a half but soon emptied out. ODESSA GOLD tracked the pacesetter inside
foes as part of the second flight and gave way racing into the far turn. FULL MOON RISING, caught four wide leaving the chute, was prompted to gain a
position three deep in second flight entering the backstretch, came under pressure to gain a narrow advantage between foes in that path after a half and
emptied out nearing upper stretch. MORO DRAMA, caught four wide tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, made brief progress outside foes
racing into the far turn but quickly came up empty. GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY sped to the lead, bolted to the outside rail entering the backstretch and
dropped out early. RICKY RUN dwelt at the start and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CREDIT CYCLE, off a step slowly, switched outside foes racing through the backstretch gathering momentum, advanced on the leaders four wide racing
through the turn to wrest the advantage in upper stretch and went clear under firm handling. MALETTA broke outwards bumping WILL RUNAWAY, was
righted to gain the advantage while angling to the inside, dictated the pace just off the rail racing into the turn but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. WILL RUNAWAY, bumped at the start, was collected, then urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the
turn and weakened late. THE EXCEPTION angled in sharply in the opening stages while being urged in pursuit of the leaders while making contact with
GATOR FIFTY TWO, continued in pursuit along the inside into the turn then faded into the lane. AWESOME ROMEO tracked the leaders four wide in
second flight, shifted inwards racing through the turn to the lane while continuing with an even effort. BRANDY CHASER, urged along three deep between
foes tracking the leaders in second flight, emptied out early. COURTING MOONLIGHT was settled in hand avoiding close quarters along the rail in early
stages and failed to menace thereafter. FAFA FOOEY, held up between foes avoiding tight quarter at the start, never gained contention. GATOR FIFTY
TWO was carried inwards to the rail while being bumped by THE EXCEPTION in the opening stages, steadied off that foe midway through the backstretch
and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
FINEST JEWEL, prompted to a position, then pulling a bit between foes leaving the chute, angled in tracking off the first flight under light rating racing to the
backstretch, briefly awaited an opening between foes racing through the far turn, split foes just off the inside advancing in close quarters midstretch and just
edged EXACTA in time under firm encouragement. The latter moved to the lead racing through the chute while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to the far turn, then resisted several challengers to late stages while just failing to contain the winner. TIZ HER WAY, forwardly placed along
the inside, switched outside the pacesetter attending that rival's tempo to the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue nearing upper stretch but
weakened late while shifting out making some contact with BACI nearing the wire. BACI tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the first turn, angled
to the rail midway through the backstretch, raced in close quarters inside foes on the far turn, shifted out entering the lane to split foes three deep and was
bumped nearing the wire. CALYPSO KEY angled to the rail in the opening stages while dropping off the second flight under reserve to the backstretch,
saved ground into the second bend, shifted out six wide entering the lane and made some belated progress. WORLDS APART switched off the inside early,
was prompted to make brief progress three deep between foes into the backstretch, lodged a brief bid in that path on the far turn and soon flattened out.
FLORIDA RUST broke outwards bumping STONEY'S MONKEY, was settled between foes and never gained contention. KATIE FALOONA settled between
foes in the last flight early and offered no rally. BEACH LADY tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the far turn, was fanned five wide entering the
lane and came up empty. STONEY'S MONKEY, bumped at the start, was caught four wide into the first turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
IRISH ORB broke readily, angled inwards prompting a rival's pace, took over racing into the turn to dictate the pace on a narrow margin then responded to
go clear when roused left handed racing through the stretch. AUNT IRENE, urged through close quarters at the break to gain a position between foes in
second flight, continued under pressure shifting three deep advancing on the pacesetter racing into the bend, lodged a brief bid nearing upper stretch but
soon proved no match. STRAND DE ORO sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside disputing the pace, lost terms with the top pair while shifting out
into upper stretch, then exchanged contact with AJ'SLITTLEDANCER entering the stretch but continued well enough to prevail for a share. GRANDMARY
broke outwards bumping OLANA soundly at the start, was righted to track off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, was fanned five wide entering the
stretch while exchanging contact with AJ'SLITTLEDANCER and had no final response. AJ'SLITTLEDANCER tracked off the second flight while angling in
early, shifted out racing into the turn while being prompted to advance between foes, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, was bumped from both sides,
then knocked back entering the lane and had no further response. BLAZING RUBY settled between foes dropping well off the second flight and failed to
menace. LA GUATEMALTECA, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders to the turn, emptied out early. LADY DENISSE, bumped by OLANA at the start,
was settled in hand outside foes in the opening quarter and failed to menace. OLANA, bumped soundly at the start while forced into LADY DENISSE at the
start, was righted to track off the second flight, shied outwards from a rival nearing the turn and soon dropped out. K KITCHEN proved no factor.

POINT HIM OUT broke readily to gain the advantage just after the start, angled to the rail racing to the first turn conceding position to the leaders, stalked
just off the first flight to the far turn, swung out three wide racing into the lane, then wrested command and went clear under firm left handed pressure.
KENTUCKY GHOST tracked the pace between foes in second flight, angled to the inside racing into the far turn and made steady progress to gain the place
honors splitting foes in the closing stages. SAFE AND SOUND, bumped by DRAW THE LINE at the start, pulled his way between foes to gain the lead
along the inside on the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave out once headed by the winner.
DRAW THE LINE, bumped by TIZ ENVY while shifting into the path of SAFE AND SOUND at the start, angled inside to track the leaders as part of the
second flight to the far turn, shifted out racing into the lane and improved position between foes late. FUSED was rated just off the second flight between
foes while angling inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide in the closing stages but continued with a mild
bid. CARAMELITO, firmly reserved in hand along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out while continuing under a snug hold to the backstretch, was
fanned six wide leaving midstretch and displayed some belated interest. TIZ ENVY broke inwards bumping DRAW THE LINE, was righted to join the pace
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn, gave way nearing midstretch and drifted out late. CASK tracked the leaders
three deep as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. PUNCH HARD was settled along the rail and dropped out
early. IN HONOR OF ARTIE settled last and proved no factor.

Footnotes
THORCERESS, reserved last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes just off the inside racing into the far turn, angled to the rail
steadily gathering momentum on the far turn, swung outside the leaders racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. DUDE'S
SECRET tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the far turn, then advanced in that path between
foes to late stages gaining the place honors in the closing stages. RED KITTEN, caught four wide racing through the first turn tracking off the second flight,
was prompted to advance while caught five wide racing through the far turn to upper stretch but continued with interest to gain a share. CASCABELL
QUEEN, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the outside a rival racing through the far turn to upper stretch and gave
way once headed by the winner. A TOAST TO KAY was rated off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the far
turn and continued evenly between foes to late stages. SOLD ON SALSA, urged inside rivals prompting the pace to the backstretch, dueled for command
inside a rival on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. ELUSIVE AURA angled inwards to track just off the first flight between foes, was prompted to
lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn and quickly came up empty. ALL THIS JAZZ, held up in close quarters racing to the first turn while dropping well off
the second flight, never gained contention. GIFTED PATH, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the backstretch, emptied out after a

Footnotes
MY COWBOY went readily clear of the field to dictate terms on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, was prompted to repel a rival's challenge nearing
upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. ENDURING HONOR was rated tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance along the
inside to the backstretch, then made steady progress advancing along the inside to the lane to prove best of the others. BLUE PIGEON was rated well off
the leaders while angling inside racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance while angling out five wide through the lane but steadily improved position.
TOSS, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter under light rating in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid nearing the quarter mile
marker but soon flattened out. JIMMY D broke inwards bumping MISSION DRIVEN, was settled between foes, then angled six wide in the closing stages
while making belated progress. RUDIGER, caught four wide racing into the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn and continued with an even effort. TALK
TO THE MEDIA settled inside foes, saved ground throughout but proved no threat. HARV WON'T TAP switched outside foes early but offered no rally.
TACTICAL QUALITY proved no factor. MISSION DRIVEN, bumped at the start, trailed throughout.
