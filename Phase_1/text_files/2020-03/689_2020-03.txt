Footnotes
DAREDEVIL CARL settled outside, stayed out from the rail around the turn while chasing the early leader, took over from the outside entering the final
furlong then drove clear. BEYOND THE BEND was slow early, raced two wide between foes around the turn then split horses in midstretch with a late run.
DISTILLED SPIRIT was herded in shortly after the break, was hustled to the front from the inside just before going a furlong, stayed close to the rail around
the turn then tired in the drive. FIVE CARD DRAW was herded in and pinched back soon after the break, stayed inside around the turn, came out between
horses for the drive, was in a bit tight leaving the furlong grounds then the rider stood up well before the wire. CHRISATUDE bobbled, ducked out sharply
into WILD WOOD NORTH leaving the gate., raced well out from the rail around the turn and lacked a strong closing. MEGA MILLIONS was put in tight
between horses soon after the break, advanced between horses early, stayed inside around the turn and tired. WILD WOOD NORTH was bumped soundly
leaving the gate, raced three wide and failed to menace. SHARK CITY came in on FIVE CARD DRAW leaving the gate, wasn't far back along the rail into
the turn then stopped suddenly.

Footnotes
FOLES dueled inside of BYEBYE BYEBYE from the onset, dug in gamely as that rival inched a slight turning for home, and repelled him in the late stages.
BYEBYE BYEBYE dueled outside of FOLES from the onset, inched a slight lead passing the quarter pole, but was outgamed by his inner counterpart to the
wire. VISHNU stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, and offered a mild rally for show while gaining on the leaders late. LIVING
ON THE EDGE was driven to keep pace with the leading group at the half mile pole, angled inwards and saved ground while off of the pace through the
turn, then kept on to pass tired rivals along the inside without threatening. RICO CHARGES prompted the pace setting duelers from the three path, but
failed to keep pace with those rivals in upper stretch, then weakened in the final sixteenth. SAINT ADORABLE tracked three wide in midpack, but weakened
at the five sixteenths pole. JOZANI R V F trailed throughout and never got involved.

Footnotes
CASPER SLEW stalked along the inside, shifted off the rail after surpassing his outer foe to make a two wide bid between horses at the quarter pole, then
responded well to driving pressure in upper stretch and kicked away. SPIN LIGHTNING advanced position in the five path into the turn, made a four wide
bid turning for home, but failed to match strides with CASPER SLEW in upper stretch, then kept on for place. KNOCKTURN ALLEY set a pressured pace
along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, dug in for place while proving no match for the leader, but was bested late for that position. STREET
PRAYER took a bump from an inner rival early on, recovered to stalk four wide, made a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole. but flattened out in
upper stretch. JOHNNY WISHBONE was slow into stride and trailed the field through the turn, shifted three wide turning for home, and passed tired rivals
without threatening. I B CHARLY bumped an outer foe early on, then vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened between horses at the
five sixteenths pole. BEACH TREASURE prompted the pace three wide, but got outmoved by STREET PLAYER to his outside into the turn, then retreated
without being asked for run, faded while under strong restraint, and was eased.

STRONG BREEZE sped to a clear lead while staying in the two path early on, met a challenge from ROYALTY SALVATORE turning for home, but dug in
gamely, dueled inside of that rival, then repelled him approaching the sixteenth pole. ROYALTY SALVATORE lied close to the pace two wide in the three
path and between horses, made a bid outside of STRONG BREEZE turning for home and dueled with that rival in upper stretch, but was repelled
approaching the sixteenth pole. JOVIS pursued the leaders from the three path around the turn, shifted to the four path while gaining to striking range
turning for home, but failed to make any late headway on the leaders. CREATE A WINDSTORM trailed while shifting from the five to the three path around
the turn, then passed tired foes without threatening. MARTINKELLY stalked three wide while racing in the four path, but weakened passing the quarter pole
and hung on his left lead through the lane. WOLFINBARGER chased along the inside, but weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
AWESOME SIGHT raced far off of the pace outside of TYLER, rallied alongside that foe in the four to five path around the bend, drifted to the seven path in
upper stretch, but sustained his advance outside of horses in deep stretch to get up at the wire. TYLER was off a step slow and crowded between horses at
the start, shifted to the three to four path into the turn to commence a rally inside of AWESOME SIGHT, rallied in the five path through midstretch to reach
the lead inside the sixteenth pole, but was nipped by his outer rival at the wire. THAT'S HISTORY broke outwards, dueled inside of VICTORIOUS BEAR
early on, dug in inside of multiple rivals to reclaim a slight lead in upper stretch, but was surpassed in the late stages by outer oncharging foes, and just held
show at the wire. TYGER BRIGHT chased the leading duelers from the three path, inched forward to bid for the lead turning for home, but flattened out in
deep stretch, was surpassed by two outer foes, then kept on to just miss show. CACTUS JACK stalked along the inside, but came under a drive into the
turn, got outmoved by multiple outer foes turning for home, but kept on through the late stages. VICTORIOUS BEAR dueled outside of THAT'S HISTORY
through the turn, vied between horses turning for home, but stopped late.
