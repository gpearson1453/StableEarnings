Footnotes
MOUNTAIN VIEW away alertly from the outside, sped clear and crossed over, led from the inside entering the turn, drifted out around the bend, urged
right-handed in the lane and inched away in the final sixteenth. LOVE AND HOLD bumped twice by inside rival, traveled a bit off the rail then along the
inside through the turn, produced a mild bid entering the lane, could not threaten the winner but held the place. BOB AGAIN stalked outside a rival into and
around the turn, angled three wide and kept on willingly through the final furlong. BUMBLEBEE sandwiched and checked at the start, raced off the rail,
angled five wide and went around a rival into the stretch and bested the rest. IMPEACHMENT ACE settled early then angled in, came three wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. INFORMATO veered out and bumped rival, chased from the inside to the turn, lugged out around the bend, exited the turn four wide
and weakened. KENZLEE'S GOV angled in early, raced a bit off the rail, moved out and traveled four wide approaching the eighth pole and lacked a
response. FINE FETTLE broke out, pinballed between rivals and checked at the start, angled out on the backstretch, raced wide then angled back in and
saved ground around the turn but proved no menace.

YOUR ADORABLE reserved while off the rail, advanced into and around the turn in the two path, bid outside and collared the leader exiting the turn, gained
command in upper stretch and drew off under one right-handed reminder and strong hand urging to the wire. IN IT FOR LIFE bumped both sides at the
start, then bumped both sides again and checked early, settled off the rail, raced along the inside through the turn, rallied up the inside and edged rival for
the place honors. IZZY'S INPUT dueled from the inside into and around the turn, led a bit off the rail with pressure from the winner into the stretch, lost
command in the upper stretch and was edged for second. HOPE PARKWAY trailed the field up the backstretch, raced two wide then a bit off the rail into the
lane and passed tired foes. MOTHER SUPREME broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, bumped again and checked soon after, stalked the top pair
and angled to the outside, went three wide into the turn and came four wide into the stretch and weakened. WINDANSEA bumped at the start, showed
speed then came in and bumped again early, dueled outside of IZZY'S INPUT for the command, failed to match strides around the turn, entered the stretch
two to three wide and gave way.

PRINCESS RUN IT set the pace with pressure to the outside, entered the turn two wide and cleared foes mid-way around the bend, drifted out a bit entering
the stretch, challenged from the inside in the lane, met that bid and held off the runner-up to the wire. VIRGINIA HALL settled off the rail then angled over to
the inside, made progress along the fence around the turn, bid inside the leader and challenged through the lane but lacked the needed late punch.
REDHOTNREADYTOWED showed early speed between foes then dropped back to the chase the pace from off the rail, traveled three wide into the turn,
moved into the two path around the bend and showed a mild response to earn the show. HAPPIER TOGETHER pressed the pace from between foes, three
wide entering the turn, lost contact with the leader around the bend, came four wide into the stretch and was edged for the show. VIDALIA showed speed
and vied for command three deep between rivals, exited the turn five wide and weakened in the final furlong. POINT RECEIVED forwardly placed from the
outside, vied four deep lead, chased six wide into the stretch and weakened.
