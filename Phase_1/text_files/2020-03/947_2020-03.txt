Footnotes
HOLLY HILL contested the early pace, moved clear around the turn, and was kept to pressure to hold COOKIE COVE at a safe distance. COOKIE COVE
bumped with SOCIALLY ASTRAY at the start, gave chase outside the winner to the stretch, could not reach that one and had enough to save the place.
WILD ABOUT THIS bumped lightly with HER ZEALOUS at the start, raced in the two-path on the turn, finished evenly and was closing in outside the
runner-up. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB moved in from the two-path rallying mildly on the rail into the stretch, and finished evenly. DAT HOT MATCH had
difficulty negotiating the turn out in the five-path, and made no late headway. CULTIVATION hopped slightly at the break and was off slowest, lagged well
back inside to the stretch, and steadied on the rail behind DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB approaching the finish. LA GUATEMALTECA lacked speed far back
early, and drifted extremely wide coming off the turn winding up well past the middle of the course. SOCIALLY ASTRAY bumped with COOKIE COVE at the
start, and was through early three wide. KATNISS KAN dropped back four wide on the turn. ROSASPARKS steadied three wide midway on the turn, and
tired. HER ZEALOUS bumped lightly with WILD ABOUT THIS at the start, showed brief speed inside and tired into the turn.

Footnotes
ENLISTING raced near the lead out of the chute, vied three deep through early stages, battled on with BROKES ALL MINE then cleared on top mid-way
around the turn, widened advantage under steady pressure then finished ridden out in the final sixteenth. BROOKES ALL MINE vied for the lead in opening
stages and crossed over to the inside, matched strides with ENLISTING into the turn then failed move on with rival near the five sixteenths pole but never
gave up, chased on through the lane and held place. GRACE'S DRAMA raced in the second flight early on then got in a bit tight near the five-eighths pole
and shuffled back, moved to the outside and launched bid around the turn, continued a steady outside bid in stretch run and secured show. TIZ POSSIBLE
DEAR tracked the top flight along the outside down the backstretch, made a move and gained position around the turn then evened out in the lane. VALLEY
DATE was reserved in the back and saved ground, moved out to race widest in the lane and passed tiring foes. AMALUNA angled in closer from the
outside, raced off the pace and between foes entering the turn, hustled along three to four wide in the lane and could not muster a needed rally.
KINDHEARTED KOTA raced off the pace and three wide leaving the backstretch, moved into stretch run four to five wide under a drive, shifted in a couple
paths and failed to pose a threat. SWEET BLOSSOM stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and settled in good position tracking the embattled trio, urged
along the inside entering the turn, could not gain closer contention then gave way. QUICK POINT raced along the inside through early stages, shifted out
and failed to advance under pressure. VICKY APPLE was well placed tracking the embattled trio early on then came up empty and dropped back.
MOTION'S FIRST vied between foes for the early lead then retreated nearing the turn.

Footnotes
PARDON MY HEART hugged the rail unhurried for six furlongs, moved off the inside in front of I'LL TAKE THAT near the eighth-pole, and rallied
determinedly outside TIZAHRA and OCEAN FIRE to get up in time. OCEAN FIRE moved in from the four-path prompting the pace outside TIZAHRA, idled
making little impression on the latter despite urging at the top of the stretch, stayed on task closing in past the furlong marker, reached a short lead between
horses near the finish but was nailed coming to the line. TIZAHRA bumped with I'LL TAKE THAT while on the lead approaching the first turn, rated along
clear to mid stretch, and weakened on the rail the last sixteenth of a mile. REARRANGE was outrun for six furlongs, moved out to the four-path in upper
stretch and rallied mildly to pick up a share. ASTOUNDMENT bumped with I'LL TAKE THAT in the run to the first turn, raced three wide and lacked the
needed response. MARIPOSA BELLE lacked room behind TIZAHRA and I'LL TAKE THAT at the break, saved ground to the far turn, shifted out three wide
to the lane and was empty. SACRED PEACE (FR) was no factor two wide on the turns. I'LL TAKE THAT tugged under a stout hold getting bumped between
TIZAHRA and ASTOUNDMENT going to the first turn, stayed close for six furlongs near the inside, steadied in mid stretch as the eventual winner came out
in front of her and was unasked to the wire.

Footnotes
CENTER AISLE was forwardly placed out of the gate and tracked the leader two to three wide, evened out a bit past the half mile marker then got going
leaving the five sixteenths pole, advanced to take over the lead from SENORA ROMA leaving the turn then widened to a clear advantage and wrapped up
late. SAY MOI was hustled up from the get-go, raced along the outside then moved up closer and made a move with the winner around the turn, was no
match for CENTER AISLE but stayed on with response and cleared the rest. INDEPENDENT MISS raced along the inside near the back in the opening
quarter, tipped out wider and hustled along around the turn, stayed on five to six paths wide in the lane and secured a share. LASTING UNION raced three
to four wide through early stages, came out wider under right handed pressure on the turn, stayed on wide through the lane and needed more for late
impact. STARLIT DAYDREAM was stubborn to load then broke sharply from the outside post, chased under pressure around the turn then gave way in the
lane. SENORA ROMA brushed with rival then quickly advanced to the lead and crossed over to the inside, got collared by the winner leaving the turn then
tired in the lane. MARKET RUMOR raced wide through early stages, hustled along five to four wide in stretch run and failed to pose a threat. SOVEREIGN
APPEAL raced two wide off the pace then raced along the rail into stretch and could not move into close contention. DANCE D'ORO got pushed in a path at
the start, hustled along and raced two wide then shuffled a stride racing behind MIJET, raced wide into lane and had no late response. COUNTLESS FUN
race widest then shifted inside, saved ground the turn and failed to move into contention. NOUDHA broke in at the start, raced near the rear and failed to
reach contention. MIJET showed response in the opening quarter then retreated.

Footnotes
BIG TINA vied early between horses, assumed command entering the backstretch, rated along inside to the lane, and dug in to turn back BEAN COUNTER
through a stiff drive. BEAN COUNTER tracked from close range for six furlongs, came off the rail with aim at the leader turning for home, responded willingly
but was turned aside. I AM MAGICAL (GB) stayed close three wide to the stretch, and finished one-paced. SHE FLED THE SCENE was well back to the
stretch two wide, shifted out and rallied mildly. BUDDY'S MEMORY settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, and lacked the needed bid. INDICIA
trailed for six furlongs, swung four wide for the drive and made no impact. TRIESTE (BRZ) saved ground to no avail. WHISKARITA prompted the pace
outside BIG TINA, lodged a bid between horses midway on the far turn, but faded steadily into the lane. INCREDIBLE MISS was keyed up between horses
around the first turn, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
DR POST was away in good order then raced in range along the outside to the turn, was under a drive racing three deep behind the leader, loomed closer
at head of the lane, briefly race on equal terms with NOCTURNAL then gained control and finished clear. NOCTURNAL came in a step at the start then
quickly rushed up to the lead, cleared on top and angled over to the rail, held firm over challengers around the turn, continued on top near the furlong
grounds then gave way grudgingly. SIR KAHN was off to a good start and raced in close range behind the leader, was under a drive around the turn, moved
to the inside top of the lane, weakened off the top pair in the final furlong but stayed on for a share. RARE STRIPE got bumped between rivals at the start,
raced off the pace and saved ground early on the moved to the outside, raced wide in the lane and improved position without threatening. HARD LIGHTING
raced off the early speed and raced three to four wide leaving the backstretch, raced widest under a drive entering top stretch and lacked the needed
response for impact. SUPERFECTO got bumped then pinched back at the start and shifted out wide, briefly gained closer contention on the turn then gave
way in the lane. TIO WIL was off to a good start and raced in range to the turn, hustled along between foes at the quarter pole then tired in the drive. MUD
PIE broke out at the start, chased along the inside while not too far back then came up empty. PERCHER steadied sharply at the start and had no
response. DISTORTED MOON failed to move into contention. TIGER'S BACK got bumped at the start and got outrun. TRINNI DANCER saved ground on
the turn and had no response.

KAUFY BEAN bumped with BLAZING DESIRE after the start, vied outside the latter into the first turn, moved inside taking over into the backstretch, shook
clear after a half-mile, widened the advantage approaching the stretch and remained in command under pressure. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME bumped with
STORM RISK at the start, then was bumped again between that one and I'M MORE READY, advanced four wide after six furlongs, could not menace the
winner and saved the place. MYSTERY BANK bumped with I'M MORE READY at the start, chased three wide to the far turn, moved in approaching the
stretch, came back out late and ran on with good courage to the wire. BLAZING DESIRE bumped with KAUFY BEAN after the start and got outsprinted to
the lead inside that one, checked sharply fighting restraint on the first turn and was taken outside, pressed the pace but lost ground to the leader steadily
after a half-mile, and plugged along to take the last major share. I'M MORE READY was bumped between horses at the start, steadied behind the leaders
on the first turn, lost ground through the middle stages, bumped with STORM RISK attempting to come off the inside at the top of the stretch, and made no
headway. STORM RISK bumped with JUSTINTHENICKOTIME at the start, lagged far back for six furlongs, and bumped with I'M MORE READY while out
of contention at the top of the lane. REBELDE lacked room between BLAZING DESIRE and KAUFY BEAN after the start, and was through early inside.

Footnotes
MOROCCO raced three to four wide and stalked under a snug hold through early stages, remained forwardly placed around the far turn then given cue
entering the lane, roused forward to take control in the final furlong and finished clear. FOREVER MO was keen and steadied along in opening stages then
settled nicely and tracked in close contention while saving ground, briefly waited leaving the far turn, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane and
captured place. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) raced in tight and steadied entering the first turn, was never far back while being rated to the far turn, hustled up two
wide entering the lane then raced in some traffic, shifted out five wide, came under strong handling, edged closer and just missed place. GOLDEN
DECISION sat just off the second flight through early stages, given cue to head in pursuit around the far turn, raced six wide into the lane then shifted out
wider, ranged up closer but lacked the needed surge to move by. WESTERLAND (GB) was a step slow at the start then angled to the rail and steadied
sharply entering the first turn, settled in the back and saved ground, angled out and hustled along into the lane, gained some ground in late stages but
needed more to threaten. AMBASSADOR JIM raced off the early pace, prompted racing widest entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. DUBBY
DUBBIE led the way around the first turn, held a slim lead under pressure to the turn, vied inside of FARAWAY KITTEN then shook clear entering the lane,
continued on top then came up empty in the final sixteenth. FARAWAY KITTEN applied pace pressure to DUBBLY DUBBIE down the backstretch, vied for
the lead with rival around the turn then tired in the drive. TIZ LUNA tossed head up at the start, angled to the inside then ran out of room entering the first
turn, hit the rail and checked losing action, raced off the pace then dropped to last after the half and had no late response.

Footnotes
REMARKABLE SOUL bumped lightly with BARGAINAIRE at the start, was off the rail vying inside NAVASHA out of the chute, shook off that one before
completing a half-mile, widened the lead around the turn, and continued to run up the score kept to pressure through the stretch. BARGAINAIRE bumped
lightly with REMARKABLE SOUL at the start, took up the chase on that one approaching the turn, was under a drive by the five-sixteenths making no
impression, drifted out and in through the lane and held the place. BELIEVE INDEED raced three wide advancing to third around the turn, made no further
gains and ran on best of the others. ANGELIA improved position four wide after six furlongs, but made no late headway. NAVASHA pressed the pace
outside REMARKABLE SOUL early, and dropped back steadily around the turn. SLINGIN SAMMY B lost her footing breaking awkwardly, lost ground after a
half and dropped well out of it around the turn five wide. VIVA FOREVER was finished early inside. CAROLINE LOIS dropped back on the turn, drifted
extremely wide into the stretch and was eased up to the wire.

Footnotes
URBAN FAIRYTALE steadied entering the first turn, was well placed and rated just off the second flight to the far turn, launched a three wide bid, roused
forward under strong handling to take over the late lead then dug in gamely and held firm. RENATA raced off the early pace, prompted to pick up the tempo
around the far turn, gained three to four wide upper stretch, shifted to the inside late, raced in aim for the late lead but could not get by determined winner.
KEY BISCAYNE broke in and slightly steadied a stride at the start then steadied entering the first turn, rated three to four wide down the backstretch, swung
into action racing six wide into the lane, ranged up along the far outside in late stages, raced in striking distance and just missed place. POP A CHOC got
carried out wide around the first turn, stalked behind the leader to the far turn, moved up to race in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, took control and led
the way a furlong out then got collared by the winner and gave way. LONGPANTS REQUIRED wad unhurried and raced near the rear, raced wide into the
lane and had a mild improve. STARSHIP MALLOMAR settled along the inside early on, moved out and put to a drive, raced six wide near mid-stretch and
lacked the needed response for impact. L'INDISCRET raced between foes settled off the early pace, raced widest into the lane and could not muster a
needed rally. BRIGHT STREET was reserved racing near the inside down the backstretch, tipped out wider and given cue to head in pursuit, raced five wide
into the lane and failed to pose a threat. JUSTLEAVEITALONE bumped with SCONSET and steadied moving into the first turn, stalked along the inside,
prompted along the rail on the far turn then tired in the drive. SHARETHEGOODTIMES steadied entering the first turn then remained unhurried saving
ground, made a good move to advance into contention around the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. POWER OF MAGIC sprinted to the lead out
of the gate, continued on top to the far turn, challenged by POP A CHOC nearing the quarter pole, matched strides turning for home then tired in the drive.
SCONSET bumped with foe, steadied and forced out wide entering the first turn, raced in contention to the far turn then came up empty.
