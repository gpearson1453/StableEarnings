SQUIDWARD was allowed to settle early, went five wide into the second turn, made a bid in mid stretch, dueled with VICTORY LANE and prevailed for the
win. VICTORY LANE was void of any early speed, circled seven wide into the second turn, was gaining late, made a bid in mid stretch, dueled to the wire
and finished second best. TAMAIT (FR) stalked the early pace, raced along the inside and weakened in late stretch. SUPER ACCORD set a pressured
early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn and faded. DEVIL'S TEETH pressed the early pace, went five wide into the first turn and gave way. NETELA
was outrun early and offered no late rally. ZACH'S DASH was taken back early and was never a factor.

pressured early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, angled to the inside and finished second best. IT'S ABOUT ALEX was void of any early speed,
went six wide into the turn and was along for the show position. AMERICAN RAISA was allowed to settle early from the inside and faded. SUSAN SNUCK
IN was taken back early, circled nine wide through the turn and never fired. FOLLOW THE GOLD was outrun early, advanced eight wide through the turn
and offered no late rally. GOLDIES ANGEL raced in mid pack early, went between rivals into the turn and faded. TRIGGERED was up close and tired in the
drive.

Footnotes
BOBBIES FLIGHT raced unhurried early, advanced seven-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the lane and drew off with something left.
NORTHERN FERN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in tandem with the winner nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, was no match for that rival but clearly second best. SINGING MARY raced four-wide through the first turn, moved from off the
pacesetters while racing five-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. SWEETNORTHERN ROSE raced just
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but lacked the needed late response. BARBARA JO chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. HUNKA BULL lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and was
not a factor. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT was away in good order to duel for the lead with SCHUYLER WARRIOR while racing three-wide, opened a clear
margin after going a half and weakened after going six furlongs. HENNESSY STORM was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn
and was not a factor. SCHUYLER WARRIOR disputed the pace with IMGOINOUTTONIGHT while racing from the inside and weakened after a half.
