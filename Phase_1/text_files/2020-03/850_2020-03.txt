Footnotes
ROYAL JEWEL popped clear after the start and moved inside, shrugged off DINNER AT FIVE around the turn, and widened under a steady drive. DINNER
AT FIVE chased outside the winner, bid in earnest through the turn but got shaken off by the top of the stretch, and ran on well enough to save the place.
DREAM ADRIANNA bumped lightly with LEISHLANICK at the start, hugged the rail throughout and finished willingly. DOTDOTDASH raced in the middle of
the pack two then three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid rally. FELONY MELANIE bumped hard with LEISHLANICK at the start, raced far back three
wide to the stretch, and went by tired horses. LEISHLANICK bumped hard with FELONY MELANIE at the start, then lightly with DREAM ADRIANNA, moved
through inside behind the leaders approaching the turn, and faded through the lane. LIZA cut the corner into the stretch, and tired. ABOVE PAR broke out
hitting the right side of the gate, and was finished early.

Footnotes
JESUS' TEAM set a pressured pace with MAQUIAVELO forcing the issue along the outside, shook off rival while taking on the challenge from EMBRACE
MY UNCLE midway around the turn, shook clear entering top stretch then stayed sharp on top and finished going away. EMBRACE MY UNCLE rated along
the inside in early stages, tipped out leaving the backstretch and circled up three wide to challenge JESUS' TEAM for the lead, vied outside foe at the
quarter pole, could not match strides with winner entering top stretch but continued a steady effort and finished clearly second best. MAQUIAVELO applied
pace pressure to JESUS' TEAM down the backstretch, could not remain in touch with foe past the three eighths pole and steadily faded. UNO BABY BIRD
was edgy in the gate, veered outward at the start and was a bit rank with head up early on, settled more and raced in contention tracking the top pair,
angled to the inside leaving the backstretch then went to launch a bid but came up empty, quickly retreated in the turn then pulled up in stretch run and
walked off after the race.

Footnotes
DONJI bumped lightly with BASHA at the start, then went up to grab the lead, rated along inside to the top of the stretch, and responded well to turn back all
comers. BRUCARITA raced within range three wide around the far turn, moved out widest for the drive and finished well. BASHA brushed the left side of the
gate and lightly bumped with DONJI at the start, put in a three-wide bid after six furlongs, and ran on with good courage between horses to the wire.
MAJESTIC LUNA prompted the pace outside DONJI for six furlongs, bid between foes turning for home and was outfinished. PROJECTED (GB) saved
ground close up to the far turn, and was hopelessly boxed in along the rail through the last quarter-mile. KING OF SPADES settled at the rear of a
closely-knit sextet to the quarter-pole, and lacked room behind horses through the stretch.

Footnotes
LUCK OF THE CROOK raced in range then prompted five wide leaving the half mile marker, held a slim lead on the turn, hustled along three wide top of the
lane, drove by inside duo and finished clear. DARDANELLOS raced two wide off the pace down the backstretch, swung out and hustled along five wide at
the quarter pole, raced wide into stretch run and rallied to capture place. BELLAS FELLA tracked in close contention midway down the backstretch,
prompted three wide and advanced to vie for the lead with winner around the turn, kept on two wide between foes top stretch, could not match with LUCK
OF THE CROOK in late stages but continued a steady bid and got edged late for place. KEEP MARCHING bumped the gate and brushed with foe at the
start then rushed up the rail after the opening quarter to challenge for the lead, continued in aim along the inside into upper stretch, was no match for winner
in late stages but stayed on for a placing then lost whip in final sixteenth and flattened out. INGREIDO was forwardly placed and raced four wide near the
lead at the half mile marker, failed to gain closer contention around the turn then chased on evenly five wide in the lane. SWEET GIANT raced off the
pressured flight while six paths wide near the half mile marker, hustled along and angled in to race two wide around the turn, stayed near the inside in
stretch and lacked the needed response for impact. GAMBIT vied two wide between foes down the backstretch then failed to keep pace and gave way
around the turn. TITERE lagged in the back out of the chute, continued reserved then moved into upper stretch two to three wide and offered no late rally.
MANO raced outside off the pace, moved into stretch three to four wide under pressure and failed to gain. MORNING TICE got brushed repeatedly at the
start, raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
DONDER 'N BLITZEN pressed the pace outside LALALI, took over around the far turn and kicked well clear into the stretch, drifted out through the last
sixteenth and was all out to stave off an onrushing rival. LADY NOGUEZ stutter-stepped at the start, went along unhurried for six furlongs, came widest for
the drive and closed with a rush to just miss. BEASAICHI saved ground in the second flight to the far turn, moved three to four paths wide at the top of the
stretch, finished gamely just inside LADY NOGUEZ and steadied behind the winner coming to the wire. GEA moved up outside rivals through the
backstretch run, shifted in to the three-path with a bid outside DONDER 'N BLITZEN turning for home, but flattened out late. R SEA SMOKE stayed in range
for six furlongs near the two-path, was in some traffic going by the quarter-pole, and finished evenly when clear. LA TRES JOLIE broke slowly, advanced
three then four wide around the far turn, but could not sustain the rally. LALALI dictated terms inside through an ordinary half-mile, could not handle the
winner around the far turn and gave way. ALAFIA saved ground in range to the far turn, was briefly in traffic approaching the stretch, and was empty when
clear. WICKED SOLUTION raced three wide much of the way, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
KILLA DEE was well placed tracking the embattled duo while racing near the inside in early stages, switched out a couple paths and continued patiently
handled around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane then responded willingly when prompted right handed, swept by leaving the furlong marker
and finished going away. ARRIVEDERLA raced in the back although never too far back and two wide leaving the backstretch, hustled up along the outside
around the turn, roused six wide into the lane, gathered momentum along the far outside and rallied up to capture place. KAREN'S COVE tracked the
embattled duo in opening quarter, moved up three wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, held a slight edge at the furlong marker then got
collared by the winner strides after and weakened to show. ELUSIVE RO was not too far off the pace in early stages then prompted four wide around the
turn, produced a mild bid but lacked the needed response for serious impact. JERSEY JOE B vied for the lead in opening stages while racing inside of PINK
LEMONADE, set a swift pace and continued to contest the issue with the added challenge of KAREN'S COVE on the turn, fought back to the eighth pole
then had no kick left in late reserve. PINK LEMONADE vied for the lead at the outset racing a path outside of JERSEY JOE B, continued to battle on with
the additional challenge of KAREN'S COVE on the turn then gave way upper stretch.

Footnotes
JAKARTA took control moving inside soon after the start, rated along to the stretch, was roused left handed past the eighth-pole and remained well in
command. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL raced three wide around the turn, could not reach the winner but finished gamely outside MS MESHAK to take a late
duel for second. MS MESHAK chased in the two-path to the stretch, fought between rivals through the furlong grounds and was nipped inside KITTEN'S
COVERGIRL for the place. STARSHIP NALA saved ground to the stretch, stayed on the rail and lacked a solid final response. DANCING DOLL brushed
with GOODBYE BROCKLEY at the start, and was outrun inside. JUST AIN'T RIGHT raced two to three wide to the top of the lane, and failed to menace.
GOODBYE BROCKLEY brushed with DANCING DOLL at the start, steadied inside that one getting shuffled back early, went out four wide through the turn
and made no impact.

Footnotes
FLOWMOTION settled nicely while rated through early stages, was patiently handled two wide then hustled up late turn, advanced between foes and took
the lead upper stretch, stayed on gamely with ears pinned back and refused to be denied. MY POINT EXACTLY stalked the leader down the backstretch,
vied for the lead racing a path outside of JOYFUL HEART around the far turn, lost the lead to the winner but kept on with game response and nipped foe for
place. TROPICAT bumped with DEVOTED KITTEN entering the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, loomed closer racing five wide late
far turn then fanned wider entering top stretch, roused forward to race in strong contention in late stages but lacked the needed surge to get by. SUBLIME
APPEAL raced three to four wide and tracked the pace to the far turn, moved up closer past the quarter pole then roused forward to race in aim for the lead
near the furlong marker and lacked a closing kick. TIL THE END rated off the early pace and saved ground, hustled up along the rail at the quarter pole then
lacked racing room and forced to check upper stretch, altered course and had no late kick. FLYOFF tracked the pace down the backstretch, raced four wide
late far turn then fanned wider for the drive and lacked the needed response for late impact. DEVOTED KITTEN bumped with foe entering the first turn, was
reserved and saved ground, urged along the inside on the far turn, altered course upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. ROBINTAKINCHARGE settled
along the outside through early stages, prompted on the far turn then raced widest upper stretch and failed to move on. JOYFUL HEART led the way on the
first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead with MY POINT Exactly on the far turn then tired in the drive. MOZO BELLO raced two to
three wide in the back then five wide in the lane and failed to move into contention.
