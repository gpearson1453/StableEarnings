Footnotes
SUPER CHARLIE saved ground in behind the leaders to the far turn, angled out entering the lane to rally four wide and moved off under a steady hand ride.
L B GOLD stalked the leaders four wide to challenge through the far turn and show in front nearing the lane then could not go with the winner. JACK BE
GOOD contested the pace inside rivals to upper stretch and had little left for the drive. STORM DASH moved up three wide but could not threaten late.
MORNING SHADOW pressed the pace outside rivals to the far turn and weakened. A COWBOY'S FIGHT was not a factor racing three wide.
PICKELJUICE contested the early pace between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
OURS TO HOLD tracked the early pace inside OBVI to the far turn, angled out midway of the far turn to take aim turning for home and slowly wore that one
down to be up in the closing jump. OBVI moved to a clear lead racing just off the inside, resisted as the winner challenged through the lane and just missed
late. COIL AND STRIKE followed the pace racing three and four wide, moved up in the drive but could not reach the top pair. SUPER MISS B HAVEN
stalked the pace three wide and lacked a final closing run. ATSA WOESY saved ground and lacked a solid closing response. STELLAR BESS dropped
back off the pace early and moved up in the lane. OCTOBER WON saved ground and failed to mount a rally. PEYTONS SKY DANCER was not a threat
racing three wide. GONE INDIAN was within reach racing two to three wide and tired. WADABOUTDAREST was always back.

Footnotes
DRASTIC tracked the early leaders three or four wide to challenge through the far turn moved clear into the lane and drew off under steady handling.
YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK settled three or four wide off the leaders to move up through the far turn then just gained the place late. RUN FOR MATTY was
unhurried early to drop well off the pace while three or four wide, moved six wide in the far turn to rally in the lane and just missed the place late. JIMMY'S
MARCO contested the pace out from the rail while inside a rival and had little left on reaching the lane. WALKER'S BULLET was two and three wide to
move up in the far turn but lacked a solid closing bid. PRINCE OLAF failed to mount a rally racing three wide. TALK BIG MONEY was not a threat. WITTS
LUCKY SHOES contested the early lead three wide and tired. KIDO'S SLING SHOT was shuffled back between rivals at the start, drifted six wide in the fist
turn and was always back. R DEJA VOO saved ground and tired.

Footnotes
UNSHACKLED CROSS made the pace on a short lead about the three path, shook off THUNDER BOX into the lane and drew off under steady urging.
THUNDER BOX prompted the pace outside the winner to bid through the far turn then floated wide into the lane and could not go with that one.
NATTYTYME showed some early speed inside the top pair, settled back and moved out three wide heading up the backstretch and held position the
remainder. BLUE RIVER saved ground and lacked a rally. STEF'S GUY was three or four wide and failed to mount a bid. BOSQUE COUNTY was not a
threat three wide. MISS M KAYS DEPUTY was not a factor. TEKELA'S GLORY hesitated at the break, saved ground and was always back. PRAISE BE TO
GOD was outrun racing four wide. FLANAGAN followed the pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
GIANT GAMBLE made the pace on a short lead racing the two or three path, came in a bit through deep stretch but held clear. BOLD BULLDOG was along
the inside in striking distance, got nearest the winner into the lane then bid and steadied near the wire from tight quarters. The stewards posted an inquiry
and the rider of BOLD BULLDOG lodged a claim of foul against the winner which was disallowed. REVERSALOFFORTUNE stalked the leaders in good
position three wide but lacked a final closing bid. ALL FOR TRUTH prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened some in the drive. SILIS leaned
into the gate but quickly recovered to followed the pace two and three wide then lacked a final closing bid. PICADILLY ROADSTER saved ground and failed
to mount a bid. ONE KIND OF CRAZY was not a threat racing four wide. CLASSIC CZAR was always back.

Footnotes
SHIP STALKER stalked the leaders while saving ground, moved closer through the far turn to angle four wide into the lane then responded with a good late
run to collar the leader deep stretch and be moving clear. LEGENDARY LARRY made the pace on a short clear lead along the inside, carried the advantage
to midstretch and could not contain the winner's late run while just saving the place late. WILD DRIVE tracked the leader's pace from two or three wide in
good position then could not produce the needed late run in the drive. SPOON BOSS was shuffled back between rivals at the start, saved ground and
moved up going to the far turn then could not threaten late. GOLDEN BULLET moved up three wide while not a serious threat. SOUTHERNAIRE was not a
factor racing three or four wide. PRIMARILY GOLD was close to the early pace two and three wide and tired. CHILANGO was not a factor. CALL A COP
tired racing three wide.

Footnotes
SCOOTER'S BOY was at the back early, fanned six wide out of the first turn, remained outside to bid five wide through the far turn while joined by DOBY,
dueled that one through the lane and went gamely to narrowly gain the nod. DOBY followed the pace three or four wide, moved five wide to challenge inside
the winner nearing the lane, dueled through the lane and narrowly missed. LOVETHATCAUSE prompted the pace three wide outside a rival and weakened
in the drive. WHERE'S RUFUS was on a pressured lead inside, continued to late in the far turn and came up empty. POPCORN FOR EDDIE saved ground
in reach of the pace, angled out into the lane but lacked a solid closing run. OHTANI prompted the pace between rivals to the far turn and weakened.
HANDSOME DEPUTY was four and five wide in the first turn and was always back. KITTEN'S BULL tired racing three wide.

Footnotes
MEAN ERIKA settled back off the leaders while three or four wide, rallied to challenge four wide through the far turn into the lane to show in front and held a
safe lead under steady handling. SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE stalked the early leader inside to bid going up the backstretch inside FASHION FACT then
could not go with the winner in the lane. FASHION FACT tracked the leader three or four wide to bid outside SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE going up the
backstretch, continued to late in the far turn and weakened some late. SHES THE BEAST followed the pace four wide and had no rally. WACCA WACCA
WACCA failed to threaten racing three and four wide. LOVESAFLYIN showed early speed racing out from the rail and tired once headed in late backstretch.
BETTER AND BETTER trailed throughout and was eased through the lane. CLINE TIME reared at the break and unseated her rider then crashed through
the outside fence near the gap entering the first turn and ran into the barn area.

Footnotes
MACANDALES contested the pace inside RAIN RAY throughout, edged clear through the far turn then held safe under steady handling.
WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT stalked the leaders from along the inside in good position, appeared to hit the rail into the far turn while challenging inside the
winner, angled out into the lane and could not close the gap late. HYPER DRIVE tracked the winner's pace two wide, settled back through the second turn,
moved in reach going to the far turn but lacked the needed late rally. DAZZLE MAN settled off the pace racing three wide, steadied off heels leaving the
second turn, moved within reach going to the far turn but could not threaten late. AIR ASSAULT lacked a rally racing four wide. SHAWNEE KID saved
ground then steadied off heels in traffic leaving the second turn and failed to produce a further bid. RAIN RAY disputed the pace outside the winner to the
far turn and tired into the lane. DORCHEAT ZARB was always back. BRONK was not a factor. HEWHOFILLSMYHEART stalked the early pace three wide
and tired.
