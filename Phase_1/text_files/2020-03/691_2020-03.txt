Footnotes
ITSHERLUCKYDAY, off a step slowly, was prompted to advance on the leaders three deep racing through the backstretch, took over leaving the midway
point of the turn and held sway on a widening margin while being kept to pressure. ADONAI BLESS bobbled slightly at the break, tracked off the first flight
four wide racing into the turn, then continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. CHARGING RENEE, urged to a forward placing along the
inside, switched out three wide on the turn while prompted to pursue the leader but lacked the needed late bid. PREMIUM MOTION tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the turn but offered no closing bid. MS. AMETHYST proved no factor. DOMESTIC VIOLET was urged to gain the advantage outside
a rival in the opening stages, set the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
FLASHY PATCH tracked the pacesetter between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced to gain a position just off the leader
after a half, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain the advantage, then kicked clear and held sway under some right handed pressure through the lane.
MAMBO DANCER tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing just off the rail to the far turn and continued with a steady effort to
prevail for the place honors. PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight to the backstretch and continued evenly in that path
to late stages while just outkicked for second. DIABLO'S DARLING, urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command inside the eventual
winner racing into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. LAPULGA tracked off the second flight while shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch
but offered no rally. LADY AND ME broke slowly, angled to the rail in early stages while being prompted to contend but soon retreated. FLAMINGO CHICK,
restless in the gate before the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
VINTNER tracked just off the second flight three deep to the backstretch, steadily gained terms with the pacesetter between rivals in that path racing into the
far turn and produced a solid late response to just edge GENERAL on the wire under firm left handed encouragement. The latter, forwardly placed stalking
just off the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue to gain a narrow advantage between rivals racing through the far turn, grudgingly resisted the
winner's bid to late stages and just missed. SNOW LION tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing
into the far turn advancing on the leaders, moved to challenge for command in that path in upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. ED'S DOG,
urged to gain the lead in the opening furlong while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled inside foes past
midstretch and weakened nearing the wire. CORCORAN, shuffled out of close quarters at the break, was settled near the inside early, angled outside foes
on the far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued to improve position. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS angled inside early tracking off the second
flight, switched out to race between foes on the far turn but lacked a rally. PAUL CANE broke outwards into the path of CORCORAN at the start, settled last,
saved ground throughout but never seriously menaced. BROWN ESSENCE tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the far turn and steadily faded
nearing the lane. MR. MAURICE, caught four wide racing into the first turn, soon retreated.

Footnotes
OX TROT was rated just off the inside tracking the first flight in the opening stages, shifted three deep racing through the turn advancing between foes, was
prompted to challenge for command nearing midstretch and prevailed in time under steady right handed pressure. PERFETTO tracked just outside the first
flight in the opening quarter, made steady progress racing into the turn prompting the issue just outside the pacesetter, edged forward to gain a narrow
advantage nearing upper stretch, shifted a bit resisting the winner's challenge but couldn't contain that rival. LEM ME TEL YA broke readily, angled inwards
forcing the pace outside a rival, dueled for command inside foes racing through the turn to upper stretch and gave way. SAMMY'S MINESHAFT, bumped at
the start, was quickly righted, then urged along the inside prompting a rival's pace, gave way into the turn then shifted out entering the lane. VENEZUELAN
WARRIOR ducked outwards bumping SAMMY'S MINESHAFT at the start, was reserved near the inside early, angled out four wide racing into the stretch
but made no impact. DEFICIT HAWK tracked off the second flight outside foes early but never gained contention.

EMBATTLED was urged to gain the lead outside foes leaving the chute, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage racing through the first turn,
dictated the pace on a comfortable margin for a half, went well clear racing through the far turn and maintained a safe advantage to the end under some
right handed pressure. ALRAHAAL settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the far turn while being
prompted to advance, steadily gained position inside foes racing into upper stretch, then switched off the inside in the closing stages while steadily closing
the gap on the wire to prevail for the place honors. TRAVEL AGENT broke outwards bumping HOMER'S MAGIC, was collected to track off the second flight
between foes into the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into the stretch but continued willingly while just outkicked for
second. CATCH YA LATER BRO, pulling hard against restraint between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, continued to track the pacesetter
between rivals to the far turn but had no closing bid. FLEDERMAUS tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out to race four
wide between foes into the stretch but had no closing bid. SOUL KITTEN settled as part of the last flight along the rail racing to the backstretch and never
gained contention. CPL. DIONICIO tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to maintain that position racing into
the far turn, then was taken in hand while giving way when racing a bit erratically entering upper stretch. MORE THAN TEDDY, caught five wide racing
through the first turn, never gained contention. ROMANCING THE CAT tracked just off the second flight in early stages, switched out three wide tracking the
pacesetter in second flight through the backstretch but emptied out early. HOMERS MAGIC, bumped, then squeezed at the break, was caught four wide
between foes racing through the first turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BRAVELY BOLD tracked off the second flight between foes under light rating in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn gathering
momentum, then drove through inside the leaders to wrest command in upper stretch and held sway under firm handling. HAPPY GUY tracked the
pacesetter three deep between foes in second flight into the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to edge rivals for the
place honors on the wire. STARSHIP FONZY tracked off the second flight while angling inwards racing through the backstretch, split rivals advancing to
striking position three, then four wide racing into upper stretch while caught in close quarters and was just outkicked for second. SACCO AND VANZETTI,
reluctant loading, then restless in the gate, ducked out at the start bumping HALEL, was righted, then urged clear to set the pace just off the rail racing into
the turn and gave out between foes in upper stretch. SHIFT THE BLAME tracked off the second flight racing five wide to the turn, shifted inwards a bit
entering the bend to advance inside LITTLE GUY, shifted to the five path, then herded that rival making some light contact racing into the stretch but
continued to make some mild progress. LITTLE GUY tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn, was fanned six wide
nearing upper stretch and lost some momentum when being herded wider in the closing stages. MY COMPUTER settled near the inside in early stages and
passed only tiring rivals. TOMMY TUESDAY, urged to gain a forward position along the inside in the opening quarter, switched outside the pacesetter racing
into the turn to lodge a brief bid between foes but emptied out into upper stretch. RARE HUE, restless in the gate, angled to the inside early and steadily
faded. HALEL, bumped at the start, proved no factor. TRINNI ALEX broke slowly and never gained contention.

Footnotes
IGOTTAWHITEFACE was rated just out of striking distance along the inside tracking the pacesetter inside foes to the backstretch, steadily closed the gap
on the pacesetter along the rail on the far turn advancing in tandem with PURE PRAISE, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid in close quarters between
foes while exchanging contact with that rival, then edged forward out of close quarters to narrowly prevail in time under firm right handed encouragement.
MARMALADE was held up off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep entering the far turn while
advancing on the leaders, was fanned four wide into the stretch and continued with interest while just outkicked by the winner. PURE PRAISE, forwardly
placed three deep tracking the pacesetter into the backstretch,, shifted in entering the far turn to gain on the pacesetter between foes, was urged to
challenge for command entering upper stretch while caught in close quarters and exchanging some contact with the eventual winner, then was just
outkicked by the top pair. ANTALYA, reserved near the inside, came around a tiring foe to bid along the rail racing into upper stretch, was taken in hand
while altering course abruptly midstretch, but shifted out to gain position to the end. ASHLEY'S ROSE settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch,
gathered some momentum while shifting out four wide in the stretch and made some belated progress. ITSAGIMME'S GIRL sped to the lead along the rail,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave out late. LIL HOOH'S HOOH, held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, never
gained contention. SHES DYNOMITE, caught five wide racing into the first turn, retreated early. LADY LOVE, caught four wide between foes racing to the
first turn while prompted to a forward placing, dropped out early. TEARLESS, urged to gain a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to
the backstretch, was through after a half.

CHAOS KID was rated along the rail stalking the pacesetter inside a rival in the opening half, shifted out leaving the midway point of the far turn while being
prompted to advance between foes, came through close quarters racing into upper stretch to bid for command between foes, continued to skirmish to the
wire and narrowly prevailed between foes under brisk left handed encouragement. DEVILISH MOOD tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the
opening half, advanced on the leaders three, then four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, shifted inwards a bit disputing the issue outside the
eventual winner racing into upper stretch and pressed the issue to the wire to just miss. DANCERONTHEBEACH tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as
part of the second flight, advanced on the pacesetter to wrest command nearing upper stretch, resisted the top pair past midstretch but yielded late. LUNAG
RI angled inside to track off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out while being urged through close quarters to bid between foes nearing upper
stretch but flattened out entering the lane. BATTLE CREEK settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, raced four wide on the far turn into upper
stretch and made belated progress. LORD BYRON settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. SECRET MAGICIAN sped to the
lead along the rail, dictated the pace to the far turn and gave way abruptly once headed. BIJEMINI SLEW settled between foes in the last flight and proved
no threat. BEYOND THE STARS, reserved in the last flight along the inside, failed to menace. MR. BURNING MAN, pulling a bit while held up out of close
quarters in early stages, soon dropped out.
