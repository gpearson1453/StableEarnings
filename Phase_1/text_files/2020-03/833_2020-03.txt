DYNASTY CARTEL pressed, led throughout. JESS MY HOCKS brushed repeatedly early, drifted out late, tightened foe. WATAH FLASH brushed start,
came in late, tightened foe. JESS LET IT B brushed early, squeezed late. TOOFLASHYFORYOU chased, faded. CONA SUR multiple bumps, shuffled
early. APOLLITICAL DESIRE leaped at start, away far behind. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the late stages of the race and disqualified both
JESS MY HOCKS and WATAH FLASH, placing them third and fourth, respectively. The stewards ruled JESS MY HOCKS CAME out late and WATAH
FLASH came in, impeding JESS LET IT BE.
