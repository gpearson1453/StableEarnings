Footnotes
HERO UP shifted in from the two-path clearing off in front of FAYEZ midway on the first turn, rated along with a healthy lead through the middle stages,
responded to shake off pursuers after six furlongs, and remained well in command under pressure. FAYEZ steadied inside as HERO UP went by and
moved inward on the first turn, saved ground chasing the rest of the way, and lacked a solid bid while taking the battle for second. MAYITO moved up
outside rivals through the backstretch run, kept FAYEZ pinned inside getting closest to the pacesetter on the far turn, but could not sustain the rally and was
outfinished for second. FIRST IN LINE steadied between horses shortly after the start, raced three wide on the far turn and posted a mild gain.
RAPSTOREROCKS stayed in range to the stretch, and lugged in through the late stages unable to threaten. LOVEDISC failed to make his presence felt.
PROUD COUNTRY settled in the middle of the field to the stretch, and had no rally. LAST JET OUT was never involved. ANYWHERE ROAD steadied
inside entering the first turn keyed up under a hold, and tired before reaching the stretch. BERRY HILL was always outrun. SOY BORRACHO was taken out
five wide approaching the backstretch, and was always far back. CRUMB CAKE broke a couple lengths slow, and showed nothing at the back.
OBJECTIONS BY THE TRAINER AND RIDER OF FAYEZ AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN WERE NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
MISS OVER THERE raced five paths wide entering the first turn then angled in closer, tracked three to four wide off the second flight down the backstretch,
loomed a danger near the quarter pole then roused to the lead at entering top stretch and kept clear under steady pressure. HARMONIC THUNDER saved
ground while tracking off the second flight to the far turn, roused along the rail then switched out a path top stretch, chased on with response and dug in to
edge foe for place. GARNER STATE PARK was off a step slow at the start, remained unhurried and saved ground to the far turn, angled out and headed in
pursuit, advanced into closer contention with a furlong left to run and lost the head bob for place. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN vied for the lead racing inside of
LADY TEUFLESBERG down the backstretch and continued into the far turn, got collared by the winner entering top stretch but continued to try and chased
on to the final sixteenth then gave way. LOOKN FINE AS WINE stalked the top flight to the far turn, was ridden along three to four wide near the quarter
pole then flattened in the lane. TERRIBLE TARA tugged and steadied entering the first turn, settled two to three wide down the backstretch, was strong
ridden three to four wide around the final turn but failed to gain a threatening position. ZANDREA'S got forced wide when rival bore out around the first turn,
remained forwardly placed and stalked the top flight down the backstretch then failed to sustain bid late far turn and faded. LADY TEUFLESBERG bore out
and forced rival wide on the first turn, vied for the lead racing a path outside of SNOW AND LILLYLYNN down the backstretch and into the far turn then
emptied out in the lane. CALLMESENORITA raced four wide off the pace, stayed outside entering the lane and failed to move into contention. WICKET
HOPE steadied between foes entering the first turn, raced near the inside and offered no bid.

CORY GAL vied inside BAHAMIAN GIRL early, then sped away from that one before going a quarter-mile, widened the advantage around the turn, and
stayed well in command under pressure to the finish. CHAMPAGNE BLISS saved ground throughout, and rallied through the stretch to be clearly second
best. NO SE VENDE put in a mild three-wide run on the turn, but flattened out on the wrong lead. BAHAMIAN GIRL broke alertly and vied for the early lead
outside CORY GAL, could not stay with that one by the end of the backstretch, and was finished after a half-mile. BABYBEL was outrun in the two-path.
SHELLPHONE was finished early four wide.

Footnotes
PUTIN ONLINE raced two wide while forwardly placed on the first turn, raced under slight restraint and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch,
advanced to take a slim lead at the quarter pole, widened advantage in upper stretch and held firm under steady pressure. BEACH TRAFFIC raced in range
and edged a bit closer late backstretch, remained patiently handled around the far turn then given cue top stretch, responded, shifted to the inside and
chased after the winner, could not get to rival but produced a solid bid for second best. STILL SCHEMIN settled near midpack, picked up the pace and
raced three wide going by the quarter pole, remained in contention driving three wide near the furlong grounds and chased on for a share. CUY stalked
through early stages, moved up three wide and raced in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, could not move on with eventual winner, chased on four wide
entering the lane then flattened in the final furlong. CAB BEEF secured inside position on the first turn, settled nicely and saved ground while never too far
off the pace, given cue along the rail on the far turn then shifted out top stretch and lacked the needed response for serious impact. RINGLE BELLE led the
way on the first turn, set the pace to the far turn, got collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole then gave way in the lane. DON'T TASE ME BRO
settled out of the gate and raced two wide entering the first turn, remained unhurried three wide down the backstretch then angled to the rail and waited
briefly late on the far turn, angled out at head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. ATAKAN brushed with foe at the start, was unhurried and saved ground,
swung out and raced widest into the lane, was pushed along under strong pressure but failed to rally into contention. WE CONNECTED raced off the pace
then urged along the inside on the far turn but failed to gain. FUEGO leaned out and bumped at the start then steadied entering the first turn, saved ground
racing in or near the rear and had no response when called upon. SWIPE LEFT drifted out and away slowly at the start, remained off the pace three to four
wide and failed to move into range. MY HANDSOME MIKE drifted out around the first turn, raced five to six wide off the pace and had no response.

Footnotes
SIMPLE STORY saved ground in range early, shifted out four wide taking closer order approaching the stretch, dueled late outside TARA and took a
hard-fought decision. TARA hit the left side of the gate coming out, tracked the leaders three wide to the stretch, bid through the furlong grounds dueling
inside SIMPLE STORY, and just missed. STARSHIP NUGGET swung out four wide late on the turn, gained mildly through mid stretch, then surged with a
belated bid outside the top two. LIAM'S LOOKOUT raced three wide on the turn, and offered a mild response to get the last major share. R U ROYALTY
pressed the pace outside DAILY GRACE to the top of the stretch, and weakened. JOKER LADY got floated out by DAILY GRACE at the start, moved inside
outrun for a half-mile, and passed tired horses. DAILY GRACE broke out at the start, then sped off to the lead, maintained the advantage in the two-path
turning for home, and gave way through the final furlong. DONA CAMILE was at the back four wide nearing the stretch, and could not gain. BY HIS GRACE
bobbled slightly at the start, and faded steadily after a half. MIXTECA steadied inside past the half-mile pole, and dropped far back in the stretch.

LIZA STAR sped to the lead and angled to the inside, held a slim lead over DAY BY DAY in the opening quarter then began to move away from foe late
turn, widened to a clear advantage entering top of the lane and stayed sharp under steady pressure. DAY BY DAY raced up close in opening stages,
continued in striking range of LIZA STAR around the turn, was no match for winner in stretch run but never gave up and stayed on with response to clear
second best. FLAT AWESOME JENNY hopped in the air and came away slowly at the start, raced off the pace along the outside then showed interest late
turn, raced widest under firm handling into the lane and continued a steady effort for a share. JUST AIN'T RIGHT raced in contention and tracked the
leaders in the opening quarter then headed in pursuit three wide midway around the turn, came out wider for the drive, chased on for a placing near the
furlong marker then steadily weakened. BLAZEN BETSY raced in contention and chased along the rail on the turn, stayed on two wide to the furlong marker
then weakened. MISSCHIEF MAAS lagged in the back and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
KEEPSAKEKITTEN brushed with ALLGORILLA at the start, began moving around the far turn, came four wide at the top of the stretch keeping VERDICT IS
IN from getting out, reached the front entering the final furlong and edged clear late. SUN SQUALL advanced with a three-wide bid at the top of the stretch,
fought for command through the furlong grounds, could not kick on with the winner a sixteenth out but ran on to best the others. VERDICT IS IN loomed
behind the leaders waiting for an opening after six furlongs, was prevented from moving out by the eventual winner turning for home, found a clear path
outside the eighth-pole but did not have enough. BEINFUN prompted the pace three then two wide, challenged outside ALLGORILLA and poked a head in
front after six furlongs, fought on to mid stretch and faded through the last eighth of a mile. ALLGORILLA moved three wide to take over outside FREDDY
SOTO and BEINFUN leaving the first turn, shifted inside rating along through the middle stages, relinquished command to BEINFUN past the quarter-pole
and faded. FREDDY SOTO led around the first turn inside, steadied slightly yielding to ALLGORILLA as he went by entering the backstretch, and remained
prominent to the far turn before dropping back under pressure. ALL D' HYPE saved ground on the turns, and failed to menace. EARTHQUAKE was four
wide on the first turn, and retired after a half.

Footnotes
THE TABULATOR took over the lead shortly after the start and raced under pressure from WHYRUSWESOME, saved ground along the rail and shook off
aforementioned foe mid-way around the turn, widened advantage with willingly response out of the turn, continued to pull away under steady pressure then
shown the whip and ridden out in the final sixteenth. FAST PASS raced in range along the rail out of the gate then got shuffled back a bit and dropped to
last in the opening quarter, switched out and headed in pursuit racing five wide around the turn, gained position then stayed on with response into the lane,
angled in a few paths under right handed pressure, was no match for the sharp winner but finished clearly second best. WHYRUAWESOME broke on top
and conceded position to THE TABULATOR then positioned forwardly on rival and raced in striking distance into the turn, was under a ride but could not
gain equal terms with eventual winner near five sixteenth pole, had no kick left in reserve for the final furlong after early chase but stayed on for a share.
SWEETONTHELADIES raced near then in the rear and launched a bid along the rail entering the turn, clipped heels with DAK ATTACK coming upon the
quarter pole, chased on along the inside in stretch run but failed to pose a serious threat. QUIJOTE raced in tight between and brushed with foes when
things tightened up in opening stages, raced in striking range while in three wide pursuit leaving the backstretch, chased after the top pair into upper stretch
then faded. DAK ATTACK got in a bit tight briefly and brushed with foe when things tightened up not long after the start, raced near the rear although not too
far back then headed in pursuit entering the turn, made slight contact with rail running SWEETONTHELADIES nearing the quarter pole then failed to gain in
the lane. HIDE THE DEMON got brushed and steadied not long after the start, raced five wide in range going by the half mile marker then failed to advance
closer on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
RIJEKA (IRE) saved ground unhurried through all three turns, rallied decisively splitting VEGAS KITTEN and INDIAN COUNSELOR approaching the
eighth-pole, and kicked away under good handling. DUC DE CALAS (FR) stumbled a stride from the gate, settled in the two-path through the turns, and
finished with good energy while unable to reach the winner. SURF AND TURF hugged the rail for the first mile, moved out four wide approaching the
stretch, and rallied mildly well out in the course. INDIAN COUNSELOR chased to the third turn, lodged a bid outside VEGAS KITTEN approaching the
stretch, but gave way outside the furlong marker. VEGAS KITTEN tracked patiently inside, reached a short lead entering the final turn, fought on to mid
stretch and gave way. BLUESKY KITTEN trailed far back inside to the stretch, and passed tired rivals. SHAZIER moved outside the leaders four wide
approaching the third turn, but faltered before reaching the stretch. EXTRA EXTRA set an ambitious pace wandering well out in the course, got overhauled
into the final turn still three or four paths out from the rail, stayed on to the quarter-pole, and drifted out with nothing left in the stretch.

Footnotes
MANDATE settled nicely and rated while saving ground through early stages, prompted three wide on the far turn, moved up and held a slim lead entering
top stretch, shook off METCALF near the furlong grounds and finished going away. METCALF settled three to four wide off the early pace, loomed up to
challenge late on the far turn, vied for the lead with MANDATE near the eighth pole then failed to advance with the winner then the rider stopped riding in
final stages and just lasted for place. VENEZUELAN HUG was unhurried two wide to the far turn, moved into upper stretch six wide under a drive, rallied
and just missed gaining place. CHOCOLATE BAR raced off the pace and saved ground, moved out and roused five wide into the lane and produced a mild
bid. BEE MAJOR held a slim around the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, challenged by foes late on the far turn got headed turning for home
then gave way in the final furlong. RODEO RED tracked two to three wide down the backstretch, advanced two wide and raced in aim for the lead late on
the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. BLESSED JOURNEY raced near midpack along the inside, roused two wide at the quarter pole, moved out
wider for the drive and failed to move on. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM raced off the pace and saved ground then raced two wide under pressure and lacked a
needed rally. BACKANBLEU raced off the pace, moved into stretch three to four wide and failed to factor. HAPPY DANZA tugged and raced in aim for the
lead around the first turn then settled more and stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, given cue to advance but had nothing left in reserve and dropped
back. HEALY'S HOPE was off slow at the start, saved ground and trailed throughout.
