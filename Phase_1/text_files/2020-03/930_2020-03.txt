Footnotes
BUMBLEBEE dueled from the outside into and around the turn, kicked clear of LOST THE MINISTER approaching the eighth pole, urged right-handed in
the drive then shown the whip late and powered away widening to the wire. SOUND CHECKERS stalked the top pair from the outside, traveled five wide on
the backstretch then angled in entering the turn, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch and showed a mild rally near the inside to earn the place. ISLA'S
TOY asked early from the inside, could not match the early pacesetters and chased up the backstretch, lost ground nearing the turn, took the turn two wide,
came out in the stretch and edged LOST THE MINISTER for third. LOST THE MINISTER off slow to begin but recovered quickly and went straight for the
lead, dueled from the inside with BUMBLEBEE, lost contact exiting the turn, came out in the lane and weakened. KENZLEE'S GOV stumbled shortly after
the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn then angled to the inside and never threatened.

Footnotes
CURRYFORTHREE BANG dueled outside of SUGARATSUNDOWN for command, held a slim advantage around the turn and cleared three wide into the
lane and drew away in the final furlong. FAMILY TRIPS settled early near the inside, continued along the fence through the turn, rallied up the inside and got
up for the place. SUGARATSUNDOWN showed speed from the inside, dueled with CURRYFORTHREE BANG into and around the turn, lost contact with
the winner and came two wide into the stretch and was edged for the place. YOLANDA'S STONE unhurried in the beginning, crossed over to the inside,
traveled a bit off the rail through the turn and improved position. CHITTER CHATTER broke out, raced off the rail then angled in entering the turn, drifted out
around the bend and lacked a response when needed. MCFUN chased the front pair from the outside to the turn, traveled three wide then came four wide
into the lane and weakened. Due to a timer malfunction, the second race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.

RUN FACTOR controlled the pace in the early stages, padded the lead around the turn while a bit off the rail, urged left-handed a few times in the lane and
hand urging to the wire. HYDROSTATIC stalked the leader from off the rail, four wide nearing the turn, came three wide into the stretch and finished willingly
for a clear second. SATORI shuffled back at the start, angled to the inside, raced two wide then angled four wide around the turn and earned the show
honors. YODELERS WAY broke out, chased three wide then two wide into the stretch and weakened. DUTT BART traveled four wide up the backstretch,
three wide early on the turn then carried out five wide by SATORI and came up empty in the final furlong. SURE PROOF chased the speed from the inside
to the stretch and weakened in the late stages.
