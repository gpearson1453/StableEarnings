Footnotes
TALENT SCOUT was gradually worked onto the inside route on the backstretch, entered the turn well-positioned behind the ongoing four-way tussle for the
top, responded when let out a notch at the midway point, scooted by on the open rail corridor about a sixteenth later, settled into upper stretch and was
given his cue, held sway. BEACH FRONT participated in a multi-equined pace dispute from path five for most of the opening half, was the first one of that
group to come under a drive, this occurring a few jumps shy of the end of the bend, swung into the lane, failed to dent into the winner/s margin but won the
battle for place honors in the last stride. OUR STORMIN NORMAN sighted pulling a bit on the left, took up position in the two path shortly after the start,
was the innermost of a quartet fighting for the front end, saw its coupled stablemate snatch away the advantage late on the turn, came under rousing for the
drive home, ventured onward, got nipped at the finish line for second. LEGION STORM away the tardiest, was slow to settle into stride, departed the
backstretch from the two path, flashed some interest for the first time during the final stages of the run around the bend,went into the lane, mustered up a
mild response, sufficient enough to earn the final significant slice of the purse. PRETERNATURAL three wide and contending for the top from between rivals
to the quarter pole, gave way. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN stumbled on the lead at the start, went on to race four wide and contending for the top from between
rivals to the quarter pole, gave way.

Footnotes
ROYAL ALBERT HALL (GB) settled at the back of the pack after the field had been sent off and running, raced two to three wide on the turn, came under
some encouragement past the midway point, with all the others likewise coming under urging, mostly at some point between the three-eighths pole and the
quarter pole, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, forged by a threesome to take over with slightly under an eighth to
go and edged clear. SMALL BEAR underwent a two wide pursuit, going about the task from between opponents on the turn, was already being asked for
more before reaching the quarter pole, battled onward down the lane for the place. SHALAKO four wide entering the turn, was sent out towards the five path
exiting it, stayed on well to secure the show. ARMAMENT showed the way from the two path on a loosely-contested lead, got set down as three-quarters
was being completed, yielded and backed away. CREA'S BKLYN LAW had a ground-saving journey, was switched over to a brisk hand ride once onto the
turn, faltered. OUTPLAY took up chase from path three, being asked for run for a good portion of the journey on the bend, stepped into the stretch and gave
way. SWIPING DAN away alertly, prompted the pace from off the inside during the initial stages, sat wedged between rivals before becoming five wide on
the turn soon afterwards, continued to display some speed to the three-eighths pole, failed to respond to a drive over the course of the next furlong,
retreated down the stretch.

Footnotes
FAIR LASSIE established the front shortly after the start and cut the pace three then two wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down
spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task. OK HONEY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GENTLE ANNIE five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along half a mile from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, kept on through to the finish to secure the show
honors. BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE bumped at the start by FLOSS DANCER who broke outwards and in turn bumped TELETYPE, chased seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, got placed to coaxing tucked to the two path at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and passed
tired foes. SUNSHINE GAL chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cornered two to three
wide into upper stretch and weakened. TELETYPE bumped at the start by BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE due to pressure from FLOSS DANCER, chased four
then three wide in closest aim of the leader, got pushed along at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. FLOSS DANCER
broke out at the start bumping BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE into TELETYPE, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn coaxed along three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SKIPIN ON ORCHARD broke on top but was soon joined by REJECTED AGAIN, went at it head to head with that opponent for the opening half, got set
down as their tussle spilled over into the stretch, struck the front end narrowly by the end of the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds,
shook off the nemesis during the next sixteenth then dug in well under a strong drive to preserve the decision. POWER UP PAYNTER away from the
starting without visible excuse, moved into midpack on the backstretch, got guided over to the rail at the top of the turn, was on hold with a good view of the
contested pace a short distance up ahead, paused before having the pilot commit to the outside in the general area of the quarter pole, was in path three
when roused at the three-sixteenths marker, mustered up a mild kick to claim the place. REJECTED AGAIN drew up alongside the winner shortly after the
field had been released, moved over to the inside route, raced on near even terms with the top one practically the entire opening half, lightly hand urged,
was given his cue for the drive home, relinquished reluctantly prior to the furlong marker, put up a fight for another sixteenth then weakened into the show
slow. JUSTIN FRONT secured a prominent position after bumping lightly with COMBAT RIBBON in the shadow of the starting gate, chased the pace from
the three path on the turn, angled five wide during the initial portion of the stretch, made no headway. POLAR BEAR PETE shifted into the two path prior to
the conclusion of the backstretch, stalked the front runners from midpack, headed out towards path six after stepping into the lane, lacked the necessary
response. LUXURY SUITE saved ground to the end of the bend, was steered out four wide for the drive home, made no impact. COMBAT RIBBON made
slight contact with JUSTIN FRONT right after the start, travelled three to four wide on the turn, swung into the lane having been put to a protective hold and
was allowed to fade away.

closest pursuit three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, took over command at the three-sixteenths and
edged clear under a drive kept to task. WAILIN JOSIE chased four to five wide, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid
to procure the place honors. HAPPY SOPHIA hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, got roused under threat cornering just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in and was displaced three-sixteenths out, ran on to be along clear for the show honors. QUEENDOM broke out at the start
bumping AWESOME DEBATE, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on for the
last major share. PEGGY SUE chased three to four wide throughout, got let out spinning into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. DIRTY BIRD chased
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. ANYDAYISHERDAY broke in at the start bumping

Footnotes
PIEDI BIANCHI away in good order, kept watch on the front runners well rated during the initial stages, worked out a tuck closer to the rail at the top turn,
stalked the pace two to three wide, was cued up swinging to the outside for the drive home, got steered wider and wider until approximately five wide by the
conclusion of the maneuver, narrowed in, ventured onward relentlessly in the final furlong, getting the job done in the shadow of the finish line. SLIMEY took
up residence towards the back of the pack after the field had been sent off and running, departed the backstretch towards the two path, remained reserved,
got sent one path farther off the rail for the drive home, rallied with willingness to procure the place. KEPT TRUE attained a forward position, chased the
pace from path three, rated along for much of the opening half, stepped into the lane, was more in the two path issuing her best bid in the vicinity of the
three-sixteenths pole, emerged a sixteenth down the road as the new leader, came under heavy pressure by deep stretch, attempted to dig in, but got
nailed. BRIDLEWOOD CAT stumbled badly at the start, got going shortly afterwards, dove over to the inside as the first fraction was being finalized, fanned
out five wide from upper to midlane, closed in, ultimately earning the last major check. SEA SPARKLE was quickly set up along the rail, carved out the pace
feeling some pressure from the outside, got roused right around the five-sixteenths pole, was put to the test by KEPT TRUE a furlong later, weakened after
yielding. NISHA underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, was under encouragement spinning as wide into the lane, kept at the task at half to midlane
before flattening out. I'MNOTSHYI'LLBUY angled sharply in the two path early on the backstretch, sparred for command with SEA SPARKLE for nearly a
half and gave way.

Footnotes
HONEY MONEY led briefly before conceding the front to CHARLOTTE WEBLEY while five paths off the inside down the backstretch, prompted that foe
from the outside, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under brief coaxing at the five-sixteenths before settling back in hand advancing on the
leader spinning three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, got roused near the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive before
being geared down in the final jumps to the finish. CALIDAD four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced
well outside of rivals, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best.
DANCING KIKI chased three then two wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top pair while keeping on to secure the show honors. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY established the front shortly after the break
and showed the way in hand from the three path under some pressure from HONEY MONEY to the outside, tucked to the inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the final furlong.
REMOANE three wide in pursuit down the backstretch forwardly placed, tucked to the two path into the turn, had the rider apply a firm off sided grip as his
charge appeared to want to float outwards, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MOPOLKA broke
in at the start bumping IMINCOMUNICADO, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. DARLING'S CURE a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. STEAL MY HEART stumbled badly at the start recovering inwards and conceding five to six lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased five to six wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, offered up
a mild bid swinging four then three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. LEYTE chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside half
a mile from home, came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. IMINCOMUNICADO bumped at the start by
MOPOLKA, who broke inwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
SMOKIN HOT KISS chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
