was steadied when trying to split foes in the late stages. THEODOSIA saved ground disputing the pace, drifted off the rail and faded. IZZADORA BELLA
bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced between top flight then gave way leaving the final turn. MAMMA DEE, lapped on winner early, remained wide and

Footnotes
INCIDENTALLY saved ground just off the pace, drifted out slightly and bumped repeatedly with BILL'S MAFIA entering the stretch, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole and was all out to hang on. BILL'S MAFIA set the pace in the four path, came in slightly and contributed to the bumping with the winner,
resisted gamely and gave way grudgingly. TATTERED, racing three wide early then five wide into stretch, loomed with a furlong to run but failed to sustain
his bid. PAHALL REVEAR, very wide, rallied too late. MARCH SCREAMER, bumped leaving the gate, raced very wide and showed little. TU EXAGERES
was also bumped leaving the gate, raced in the three path, had no kick and returned bleeding from the mouth. HAIL TO THE KING came out and bumped
TU EXAGERES leaving the gate, dueled three wide before tiring. TOMMY'S TOP CAT was never a serious threat. FAIRLY BOLD bobbled leaving the gate
then came out and bumped MARCH SCREAMER, vied for command three wide before tiring. LAY IT ON THE LINE ducked out leaving the gate then raced
extremely wide.

midstretch, edged away from that rival and then held on. BELLARMINE HALL was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, close up between rivals,
chased on the far turn, angled out at the eighth pole, rallied outside and surged late. STARLING PRINCE set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn,

bid three wide on the far turn, dueled and weakened. MAXIMUS MIDANI was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. OCCHI D'ORO was bumped at the start, raced close up inside, chased on the far turn and faded. PROMISING PISTOL raced off the

Footnotes
YOU MUST CHILL set the pace in the three path under rating, edged away on the final turn and continued to be clear mid stretch, lost the lead in deep
stretch but came back to get the nod. REBEL TRAVELLER, racing two wide in second flight, responded to pressure in the stretch, stuck his head in front in
deep stretch but couldn't hang on. DOUBLE CHUBBLE, two wide and not far back, raced three wide into stretch then had no kick. PETER G. FOX, wide
while while unhurried, passed tiring foes. MR CLASSICAL saved ground in second flight, drifted out through stretch and tired. METHODICAL, inside, failed
to menace. JANE'S FACTOR was in motion in the gate and broke slowly, saved ground, challenged for the lead after a half mile then tired.
