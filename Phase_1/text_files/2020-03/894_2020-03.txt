Footnotes
CSILLA broke readily, was urged three deep between foes in the opening stages to dictate the pace on a narrow margin, angled inwards racing into the
stretch while edging clear and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. RAY'S SILVER STORM ducked out at the start, gained terms with the first
flight five wide in the opening stages prompting the pace, continued outside foes into the turn to gain second in the drive but proved no match for the winner
in late stages. EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE, raced in close quarters between foes while being rated just off the second flight in the opening quarter, was urged in
pursuit of the leaders inside a rival racing into the turn and finished evenly in late stages while narrowly prevailing for a share. JOST DREAMY vied with the
first flight four wide between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue between foes through the turn and gave way into upper stretch.
FOOT RUB LOVE, reserved avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, shifted out four wide racing into the turn while coming under pressure but had no
rally. BATI BATI flashed brief pace between foes pursuing the pacesetter but emptied out early. TREASURE CAT was a brief factor in second flight racing
along the rail but dropped out early.

Footnotes
SIR HIGGINS, urged to gain a forward placing along the inside, switched outside the leaders entering the turn, advanced on those rivals three deep into
upper stretch and wrested the advantage in late stages under brisk handling. FOG WARNING was urged to terms with a rival prompting the pace, came
under pressure racing into the turn dueling for command, edged forward while disputing the issue between foes to upper stretch but proved only second
best. WILL RUNAWAY tracked off the leaders between foes in the opening quarter, shifted out four wide entering the turn while being prompted to advance
in tandem with the eventual winner, couldn't maintain terms with that foe but finished with interest to edge a rival for a share late. DANZO broke sharply,
angled quickly to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin, was urged to duel for command inside foes through the turn and gave way nearing
midstretch. DRAFTABLE broke inwards bumping HE HAD A SECRET, then was urged four deep in pursuit of the leaders to the turn and quickly came up
empty. HE HAD A SECRET, bumped, then steadied slightly at the start, was prompted to gain some position while correcting his course nearing the turn,
angled to the inside on the bend but couldn't mount a serious challenge.

Footnotes
BLUE MISTRESS broke sharply, angled to the rail setting the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dispatched a rival entering the far turn, then
was roused to turn back the challenge of HONESTA racing into upper stretch to kick clear late under firm encouragement. The latter angled to the inside
tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, shifted out nearing the lane while briefly moving to terms with the pacesetter to challenge, couldn't
maintain terms with that foe but held a rival for the place honors. BELLA LINDA was rated along the rail leading the second flight into the backstretch, saved
ground through the far turn, was prompted to make a brief bid inside foes racing into upper stretch but flattened out. SPLENDOR BEACH broke in the air,
was reserved last along the inside to the backstretch, split foes leaving the far turn, then angled five wide in the closing stages while making some belated
progress. IVORYSGOLDTREASURE was rated off the second flight inside foes, came under prompting to advance on the far turn but offered no rally. LADY
DENISSE tracked off the second flight outside foes to the far turn and faded into the stretch. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE tracked off the second flight between foes
racing to the backstretch but dropped out early. ONE SHOT was urged to position just off the pacesetter prompting that foe into the backstretch but gave
way entering the far turn.

Footnotes
CARAMELITO came through close quarters to gain terms with the first flight nearest the rail leaving the chute to the first turn, was rated stalking just off the
leaders while shifting out a bit on the backstretch, came through tight quarters midway through the far turn to split foes, shifted out three wide in upper and
produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear while being gathered up in a ridden out effort. DANCERONTHEBEACH was rated
outside foes in the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, made steady progress three
deep to upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but proved no match when confronted by the winner. VALUABLE PILLOW was urged between rivals
prompting the pace into the backstretch, angled inside entering the far turn disputing the issue and gave way into the stretch. FLORIDA EXPRESS was
rated off the first flight inside, then between foes in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance but lacked
the needed late bid. SHANDIAN broke inwards brushing STRUM AND PLUCK, then was held up last while pulling a bit racing to the backstretch and never
seriously menaced. STRUM AND PLUCK, brushed at the break, came through tight quarters to gain terms with the first flight between foes, then along the
rail racing into the backstretch, lost some position after a half and gave way racing through the far turn. GIMMEABREAK, caught three deep between foes
prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave way on the far turn. SECRET MAGICIAN, caught four wide racing into the firs turn while being urged to terms
with the first flight, pressed the issue for a half and emptied out early.

shifted out three, then four wide into the stretch and steadily gained position between foes to prevail for a share. DOUBLE DEEP tracked off the second

Footnotes
CLASSY OF COURSE, forwardly placed along the rail leaving the chute, gained the advantage inside a rival dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the
backstretch, kicked clear nearing upper stretch while shifting off the inside and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. DON'T FIGHT was
rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, advanced on the leaders three wide racing
into the far turn but could never gain even terms with the winner. STRICT VOW was settled last along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside
foes racing into the second bend, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position while no match for the top pair.
WICKED WITCH, restless in the gate, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn and
gained some position in an even effort. PREMIUM MOTION, hesitated at the start losing position to the field, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch
and never gained contention. THRU STREET angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight, faded after a half, then shifted out four wide in late stages
to pass some tiring foes. TRACK MAGIC angled inwards to track between foes in second flight, made brief progress to gain contention nearing the far turn,
then gave way between foes into the stretch. SMARTY CAT, urged to terms prompting the winner's pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing
the lane. BROKEN ENGLISH, pulling a bit while held up between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
PRETTY CHITU broke sharply racing on terms with the first flight, conceded some position while being eased outside the leaders in the opening quarter,
readily advanced on those foes four wide entering the turn, took charge charge racing into upper stretch and kicked clear under firm left handed
encouragement. FLYING BANKROLL was steadied in close quarters early dropping off the first flight, shifted out five wide racing into the turn and continued
with interest in that path to prevail for the place honors late. ARCHIVERO, forwardly placed between foes in the opening furlong, was eased back to track off
the second flight racing into the turn, angled six wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. TEMPLE MOUNT angled
inwards to press the pace three deep between foes through the backstretch into the turn, shifted inwards disputing the issue to upper stretch and gave way.
THREENINETYTWO, slow into stride, gathered some momentum while being fanned seven wide in the stretch and made some belated progress. INDIAN
BUZZ, caught eight wide in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and passed some tiring rivals. TRANSFER PRICING, urged
between foes to gain terms with the first flight in the opening furlong, conceded position to track just off the leaders between rivals into the turn, then faded
into the stretch. YEI YEI, urged to gain a forward placing along the rail in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight along the inside into the turn and gave
way into the lane. SPINOS proved no factor. ETERNAL CROSS angled inwards to press the pace four wide through the backstretch, then three deep into
the turn and gave way after a half. MALETTA, caught in close quarters five deep between foes in the opening stages, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
ITSAGIMME'S GIRL moved readily to the fore while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, shook
clear racing into upper stretch and held the late challenge of SHES DYNOMITE under firm handling. The latter was rated in the opening stages to stalk the
pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with the pacesetter after a half, lost some ground to that foe
nearing upper stretch but produced a solid second effort to challenge that rival nearing the wire. BETTER YET was settled inside foes in the last flight racing
to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn, then shifted out to split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for the place
honors. ANTALYA was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out to split foes racing into upper stretch, then angled four
wide in the closing stages while being just outkicked for second. IGOTTAWHITEFACE tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight from the outset
to the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing the lane while being urged to advance but weakened between rivals late. ALEXBABE tracked the pacesetter
inside foes in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and steadily faded in the drive. ASHLEY'S ROSE was settled between foes in the last flight racing
to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn, was fanned six wide into the lane but proved no threat. BAR LIBRE (IRE) tracked off the second flight
outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. CROWN OF JOY settled outside foes in
the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace.
