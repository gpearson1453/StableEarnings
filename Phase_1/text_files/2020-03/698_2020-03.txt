Footnotes
STEPH'S PRINCESS moved to press outside the early leader, was carried out by that rival into the stretch, drew even on the front entering the final furlong
and edged ahead through the final yards. COURTING JENNY didn't break sharply, was hustled to the front before going a furlong, hampered the rider while
trying to bear out on the backstretch and around the turn then gave way grudgingly. FOUR SEASONS GIRL was bumped leaving the gate, advanced the
rail around the turn then weakened in the drive. VANESSA'S SECRET ducked out sharply leaving the gate, wasn't far back outside in the four path to the
stretch then stopped. PINK ducked into FOUR SEASONS GIRL leaving the gate, wasn't far back in the two path to the stretch then stopped.

Footnotes
OGEECHEE dueled inside of CARDIO COWBOY early on while staying a path off of the rail, put away that rival at the quarter pole while meeting an inside
challenge from ROCKIN COWBOY, but turned that foe away approaching the furlong pole, then kept RUNAWAY BULL's late surge at bay in the late
stages. RUNAWAY BULL settled off of the pace in the three path between horses, shifted four wide into the turn, was floated to the five path turning for
home, but sustained a rally to make a late bid, but was denied by a game inner rival. MINISTERSDONTPARTY saved ground while trailing around the turn,
tipped to the five path in midstretch to be outside of the leaders, then rallied willingly. ROCKIN COWBOY shied in a bit at the start after rivals came across
his path after clearing early on, chased the pace setters from the inside, tracked from the pocket before making a rail bid for the lead turning for home, but
was repelled by the leader, and weakened through the final furlong. SILENT ALARM tracked three wide from midpack in the four path, but weakened.
CARDIO COWBOY dueled outside of OGEECHEE while being kept in the three path by that rival, but drifted to the four path at the quarter pole and
weakened turning for home. Following a rider's claim of foul of #2 ROCKIN COWBOY against #1 OGEECHEE for interference at the start, the stewards
made no change to the final order of finish.

CALCULATED THINKIN stalked the leading duelers into the turn from their outside, glided along side at the five sixteenths pole and took over turning for
home, then fended off a stiff rally from HERE'S A JETPACK to his inside through the lane. HERE'S A JETPACK was off a step slow and was bumped by a
rival at the start, trailed the field before rallying in the two to three path through the turn, produced a bid for the lead in upper stretch inside of CALCULATED
THINKING, but did not have enough to reach even terms before being turned away in the late stages. RUN AWAY was slightly jostled between horses at
the start, saved ground while rating far off of the pace, then made a mild rally between horses in upper stretch for show. HAY SEEKER dueled outside of
SAINT MICHAEL into the turn, but was put to an all out drive due to CALCULATED THINKIN's bold bid at the five sixteenths pole, then proved no match in
upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. HUNTINGTON DRIVE took the turn in the four path, but failed to menace. SAINT MICHAEL dueled inside of
HAY SEEKER to the turn while under steady urging, but weakened approaching the quarter pole.

CHEESE ON was well placed outside, moved three wide to the early leaders on the turn, opened a short lead into the final furlong and held after a long
drive. ZOMBIE bumped with WARCRAFT leaving the gate, was sent to duel inside soon after, held a short lead into the final furlong and continued with
good courage. WARCRAFT bumped with ZOMBIE leaving the gate, swung wide into the stretch while not far back and gained outside to the end.
CUMBERLAND GAP fell back in the two path on the turn then made a late run between horses. TWEET KITTEN was hustled from the gate to duel, raced
two wide between horses around the turn then faded through late stretch.

WILD CARAMELO sped to a clear lead early on, and held sway through the lane under driving pressure. FORT FORTITUDE bumped with an inner rival at
the start, stalked five wide and outside of horses, forged place away from his inner foes at the five sixteenths pole and cut down to the three path at the
quarter pole, but proved no match for the leader in upper stretch and was second best. JUMPMASTER was forwardly placed four wide and between horses,
got outmoved at the five sixteenths pole, was hesitant to split foes passing the three sixteenths pole, split them at the furlong marker with a mild kick to
secure show while hanging on his left lead. WON AND DONE broke outwards and took a sound bump from FORT FORTITUDE, advanced position while six
wide and outside of rivals around the turn to make a place bid turning for home, but flattened out. PAPADOPALOUS was off a step slow and crowded
between horses at the start, trailed around the turn, shifted from the five to the seven path in upper stretch, then passed tired foes in the final furlong. KAIJU
broke outwards, chased the leader while two wide and between horses, but got outmoved at the five sixteenths pole, then got outfinished for minor rewards.
DUPREE was forwardly placed three wide between horses, but backed out at the quarter pole and had no rerally. SEISMIC JOLT brushed the outer part of
the gate at the start, advanced to race close to the pace along the inside of multiple rivals, but weakened turning for home. Following a rider's claim of foul,
#6 WON AND DONE against #7 FORT FORTITUDE for interference at the start; the stewards made no change to the final order of finish

the drive. BRONZE CHARM was bumped leaving the gate, stayed close in the two path to the stretch then tired. GOLIGHTLY pressed along the rail while
inside the early leader into the far turn then stopped. WEEKEND SERENADE failed to menace and stopped. ALL ABOUT BLEU ran out around the first

MORNINGAFTERBLUES was slow into stride, saved ground around both turns while far off of the pace, angled to the five path passing the three sixteenths
pole, and surged late to get up at the wire. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE stalked along the inside, surged through a rail opening as the leader drifted outwards
at the five sixteenths pole to make a bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged a slight advantage passing the furlong pole, dug in grudgingly through deep
stretch, but was nipped by an outer rival at the wire. QUEEN STINKER tracked from midpack in the three path, made a four wide bid for the lead turning for
home, vied between horses at the furlong poleas MORNINGAFTERBLUES ranged up along side, but got outfinished by that foe and an inner rival to the
wire. FAIRFIELD stalked two wide, bid for the lead three wide and between horses at the quarter pole, but weakened at the furlong pole. FLASHY SIREN
was caught four wide around the first turn, shifted to the two path into the backstretch, was floated to the six path turning for home, but failed to factor. KAY
SYRAH SYRAH established a clear lead early on, but shifted off of the rail around the far turn, met multiple challenges from rivals on both sides at the
quarter pole, then weakened at the furlong pole. BOX OF GOLD was caught five wide around the first turn, weakened to trail the field after a half mile, and
showed little thereafter.
