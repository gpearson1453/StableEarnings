Footnotes
BASHFUL BOB was reserved just off the leaders early, moved between foes to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, opened a clear lead into the
lane and drew off with complete authority. QUANTICO JOE dueled for the early advantage with AZTEC EMPEROR while racing three-wide, responded
when challenged by the winner nearing the seven-sixteenths pole but could not match strides with that rival in the drive. JACKS ZEN pressed the pace while
racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. NAVARONE SANTASONG settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and finished evenly late. RAMBLIN TOUCH lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and failed
to menace. SPECIAL EXCESS lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and was not a factor. J C
STREET lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, was pushed out further nearing the quarter and did not offer a bid. AZTEC EMPEROR
disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. JEDI FEVER showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and weakened. Due
to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.
