Footnotes
NAOMI FRALEY was away a bit slow but hustled into contention, rallied two wide to the stretch, took over from SHE'S IN LUCK in upper stretch and held
driving.'. SHE'S IN LUCK had the best speed, set the pace from the rail then could not stay with the winner but had enough of a cushion to hold second.
SMOKINHOTREDHEAD chased the top two while also two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. HOPE WINS was outrun to
the turn then tried to rally off the rail to the stretch but finished evenly. GEE STREET had no speed, trailed and was not a threat. MORNING DOVE pressed
the pace to the turn then was three wide while drifting out slightly to the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) was outrun to the turn, swung four wide at the quarter pole then swung four wide, got fanned out widest in upper stretch but
closed steadily to prevail. BOUNTY OF GOLD was hustled but outsprinted, pressed three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch then could not
stall the winner while saving the place. MISS LUCKY LAGER was sent for speed, also prompted the leader two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid
stretch and finished evenly. FUEGA was used to get the lead shortly after the start, set the pace from the rail to the stretch but was overtaken in mid stretch
and weakened. ACADIA FLEET chased the pace two then three wide, angled out into the stretch carrying the winner with her but lacked the needed late
response. LYDIA O LYDIA also was chasing to the turn then saved ground to no avail.

PERFECT SALE in mid stretch, could not shake loose but dug in stubbornly to hold. PERFECT SALE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded
when hooked by the winner in mid stretch and battled determinedly to the line. COMMISSIONESS had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn and
closed ground willingly late. MAMANUCA was chasing early, raced two wide to the stretch and offered a belated rally. PRINCESS RIO got outsprinted to the
turn then saved ground to no avail. TEASPOON OF PEPPER broke slow, trailed to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.

GEM STATE pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide and pushed to the front into the stretch, drew away to mid stretch and was under steady
urging to the line. MUSKET POWDER tracked the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch but dug in to hold the
place. MATSON had no speed, settled to the half, was three wide on the second turn, did not threaten the winner but was gaining for second. BLUES
RAPPER had no speed, raced three then four wide on the far turn, swung out widest for the drive and finished in a mild rally. COLLUSION DELUSION was
outsprinted to the half, bid three wide on the second turn but could not make an impact in the drive. TOTALLY TIGER chased the pace to the second turn,
was three then four wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. HULA KING broke slow, settled mid pack to the second turn, was two wide to the
stretch but was never a threat. RUN TO THE ATM hesitated and broke about six lengths last then was not a factor. GREGS CITY ZIP hustled to the front
then tried to duck in nearing the first turn, took up then straightened, set the pace to the second turn but tired after six furlongs, stopped in the stretch, was
eased but walked off.

Footnotes
MALIBU ALEX chased the pace to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms with STOCKED in mid stretch, battled that one
late and got the nod. STOCKED also was chasing to the turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch, rallied to battle the winner through the
final furlong and just missed. AOTEAROA was outsprinted to the turn, swung out from the two path to be four wide into the stretch, rallied when set down,
surged in the final sixteenth and was whiskered on the line. DRIZZY had no speed, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied to mid stretch then stayed on
gamely late. BOLD ROMAN pressed the pace two wide, pushed up to engage for the lead into the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
INDEPENDENT INDY broke in the air and lost about six lengths to begin, had no speed and saved ground to no avail. MELCHIOR hustled to the front, set
the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired.

JUSTA POPPIN hustled to press EIGHT O FIVE to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, took over and edged away to mid stretch then was all out to hold
TIZ THE STANDARD safe. TIZ THE STANDARD had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then eased out, rallied determinedly but was too late.
SIZZLING GRACE got outsprinted to the turn, had to circle five wide to the stretch and could not impact the top two. IMA SILVER LADY chased the pace to
the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. COACH'S VALENTINE was also chasing early, raced three wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SWEET RYAN had no speed, came two wide to the stretch but did not rally in the drive. TAHOE BLUE was
outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then was pinched a bit by IMA SILVER LADY in upper stretch, checked and finished evenly.
EIGHT O FIVE had good speed, dueled while off the rail to the stretch then was overtaken in upper stretch and tired. PROUD TO SHOYU had no speed
and was never a factor. SWIFT JUSTICE broke slow, was green and always outrun.
