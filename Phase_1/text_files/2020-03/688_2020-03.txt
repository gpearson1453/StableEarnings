Footnotes
SOUTH BEACH GIRL broke well and made the lead shortly after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win
as much the best under a hand ride. PROMISES FOREVER pressured the winner three wide into the stretch and finished clearly second best. DREAM ON
GORGEOUS trailed down the backstretch near the four path, dropped inside nearing the quarter pole, struck the rail and had a mild late rally. RISE TO
POWER saved ground through the turn, shifted out two wide and finished evenly. PRETTY CHARLEE moved up four wide on the turn then leveled off.
DEVILS DAUGHTER pressed the pace two wide to the quarter pole then weakened. HOPES AND PRAYERS inside, checked along the nearing the quarter
pole as DREAM ON GORGEOUS dropped to the rail then trailed. THE RIDER OF HOPES AND PRAYERS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF DREAM ON GORGEOUS FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE FURLONG POLE, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

HONOR AND RUN was well handled while bearing in at the start, rallied three wide on the turn and finished second best. VALID INTEREST battled with the
winner four then two wide for a half then was outfinished. COME ON CALLIE contested the early lead along the inside then faded. ALPHABETTING failed to
menace. STURN DONNA was no factor. ETHEL EILEEN stumbled badly at the start, rushed to contention then lacked racing room while behind rivals

Footnotes
DRAGSTER was bounced around repeatedly at the start, trailed into the stretch, circled his field eight wide through deep stretch and got up in the final
strides. CLYDE PARK never far back, loomed boldly six wide through the final sixteenth of a mile and just missed. TEPU WAR away alertly, set a pressured
pace out in the four path until deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. CHAIRMAN GAREY allowed to settle, bid along the rail through the
stretch and finished with good courage. OH OZ allowed to settle, closed willingly late five wide. FREEDONIA bumped at the start, prompted the pace out in
the five path down the backstretch, put a head in front entering the turn, dueled until deep stretch and was outfinished four wide. COAL MINERS SON
drifted inward soon after the start, stalked the pace from the five path into the stretch then faded late. ADVENTUROUS FOX stalked the pace along the
inside into the stretch, bid between horses two wide before the furlong marker then came up empty. ARATHORN bumped at the start and was no factor.

DANCIN' ROSIE broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best while in hand. FORTUNATE GINA
pressured the winner near the inside into the stretch then was no match while clearly second best. STORMY JUSTICE unhurried early, was steadily gaining
ground late in the five path. ANGEL'S STORMIN vied for the early lead three wide loomed boldly outside the winner on the turn then came up.
IBELIEVEINMIRACLES stalked the pace for a half then faded. CUT RATES failed to menace. JEZABEL'S CHARM was no threat. UCANTKEEPUP was
outrun. GYDA DDAWN unhurried early, inched close six wide into the turn then faltered in the stretch. RUBY TWO SHOES well placed, lacked the needed
response. PUNAHELE had speed into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
DUSTEM CAROLINA bumped at the start, was allowed to settle, closed rapidly along the rail through the stretch under right handed urging and got up in the
final strides. MISS SURPRISE away alertly, set all the pace, shoo k clear before the furlong marker, drifted to the four path late and just missed hanging on.
SHESMYHEARTANDSOUL saved ground and finished with good courage. DREAM PARK had a mild late rally in the six path. DIVINE SPARK failed to
menace. DEE WAY TO GO chased the winner pace from the four path until mid stretch and faded. LORETTAS SONG was no factor. SHARP HENNY
bumped at the start, was a sharp threat in the six path for a half then weakened. COCOLEECHO was outrun. DULCE DE LECHE was through early.
