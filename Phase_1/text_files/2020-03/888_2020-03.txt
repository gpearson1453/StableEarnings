Footnotes
RULING broke alertly from along the inside, showed the way into the turn, clear again when straightened for home, larger lead, held the runner up safe
under steady handling. RAHAAL lacked early speed, came four wide out of the turn, late burst to be getting to the runner up in the waning strides. ROAD
GAME broke in, bumped at the start, raced forwardly just off the inside, bit rank into the turn, dropped to the rail late in the turn, moved back out late, no
match for the top two. MY LEGACY forwardly placed off the inside, three wide through the turn, roused for the drive, came up empty the final furlong to
finish up evenly. NOT FADE AWAY bumped at the start, went one paced along the inside. BARTENDERS MISTAKE broke back, passed tiring rivals while
never a serious threat. WICKED CITI off a step slow, trailed, moved out for the drive, improved a bit late well out in the strip, also while also never posing a
serious threat. WENYEN chased the winner early off the inside, lodged a brief bid midway on the turn then gave way in the drive. STORMY CACTUSA in
mid pack while off the inside, had nothing for the drive. KUMSEE MYTRICK bumped lightly at the start, steadily faded.

Footnotes
ROAD TEST outrun in the early going, advanced four wide to challenge on the outside far turn, long drive, proved determined to prevail between foes while
drifting out in the late going. BIG BASE with the pace from the start inside, narrowly showed the way along the rail, raced on equal terms with the winner
past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end in saving the place. DEPUTY DORA back off the pace and the inside, four wide turning for home,
rallied, slowly gaining on the top pair late. SHE MIGHT TELL last to leave, trailed for six furlongs, three wide into the lane, closed some ground while finding
best stride late. ICY DAWN saved ground to no aval. PRETTI SAVI went evenly in lacking a closing response. CHECK SIX with the pace while between
horses, weakened ind the drive. ABSOLUTE LOVE pressured the pace while racing three wide, gave way in the second turn.

Footnotes
KURTS RAIDER behind the pace off the inside, raced three out to four wide through the turn, late bid from the outside, in time. BRAVURA CREEK forwardly
placed from the start, fell back into the turn, rebid three wide turning for home, shook clear, challenged late from the outside, outkicked. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY
in the main body early off the inside, closer in some traffic late in the turn, no match for the top pair late, clear of the others. BLACKS FERRY ROAD in the
second flight while along the inside, continued to save some ground into the lane, lacked a closing punch in the final furlong. SMARTY GRIMES lacked early
foot, four wide into the turn, dropped down one path late in the bend, was bothered then altered course to the outside soon after, displayed a modest
amount of late interest down the lane. LAST PAYCHECK off a step slow, moved closer along the inside late in the turn, steadied in traffic, went evenly
through the stretch after recovering. SUMMERTIMER fractious during the post parade, off a step slow, raced well back early, improved position without
posing a serious threat. IRONIC away in good order, vied up front along the inside, weakened in the drive. PRINCE LEO lacked early foot, four wide into the
turn, carried wide in some traffic entering the stretch, widest in the drive, no kick. HEROS R COWBOYS in mid pack along the inside, faded through the
stretch. AM TRAM off a step slow, remained always back. OFFICER DONELL vied up front early three wide, dueled through most of the turn, gave way then
got out to bother outer foes turning for home, continued to back up through the stretch.

Footnotes
NEW COLOSSUS last away, trailed early, advanced turn, swung five wide into the stretch, finished full of run to be clear. REPLETE in mid pack early, in
some traffic late in the turn, moved out widest when straightened for home, finished up willingly to be in time for the place. SENOR JOBIM broke in good
order, pressed the issue up front from between foes, put a head in front entering the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top two. MAKE NOISE back off
the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, lacked a closing punch during the final furlong. FIRERY TALE void of speed,
saved some ground through the turn, improved upper stretch, also appeared to flattened out in the final furlong. EL ASESINO broke alertly, narrowly set the
pace for a half along the inside and then faltered in the drive. KNIGHT COMMANDER within striking distance in the early going, had little left for the drive.
ONE FOR RICHIE pressed the pace while racing three wide, continued to contest the issue then caved in late. BOBBY AXELROD broke back, was never a
threat. PLATINUM NIGHTS tired while racing four out to five wide late in the turn.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT LEE fell back to trail after the start, never a factor in showing little. SUPER DUDE moved up to show the way past the wire the first time, set the
pace, faltered when headed by the winner with five sixteenths remaining. BOTSWANA prompted the pace toward the inside, had little left for the drive.
LOMBO broke on top, allowed the leader to go early, asked for some run into the far turn, took over midway on that bend, clear into the lane, kept to task.
SONNY SMACK lacked speed, moved closer three out to four wide turning for home, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best.
ZERO GRAVITY settled behind the pace while racing off the inside, moved closer in the three path second turn, lacked a further response but managed to
save the show. UNDERPRESSURE lacked speed, came four wide out of the final turn, failed to muster a closing kick.

Footnotes
CANADIAN GAME lacked early foot off the inside, closer four wide and in traffic 2nd turn, lost ground to the leader into the stretch, roused, kicked that rival
down late under firm handling and while being bothered slightly in the final strides. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT broke on top, showed the way in the two path,
remained clear while along the inside through the second turn, continued to lead by daylight until late, slight drift, nipped. ON PATROL off a step slow,
trailed, six wide advance midway on the second turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, narrowly gained the show. TASHKENT forwardly placed
early, fell back while four and five wide second turn, improved stretch. HERBIE prompted the pace from along the inside, continued to be within striking
distance while saving ground second turn, flattened out in the drive. AULT settled in mid pack, 2p 2nd turn, no response drive. CHICAGO BLUES forwardly
placed in the early going, had little left for the drive. TAPITOR back early, in traffic, checked up in tight quarters midway on the second turn, fell back.
TENTWELVEFOURTEEN fractious in the gate, rank into the first turn in some traffic, traffic again in the second bend, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
NOMIZAR outrun into the turn well out in the strip, four wide through the bend when beginning to advance, set down when straightened for home, engaged
the two leaders past the furlong marker under firm handling, edging clear late under a hand ride. INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ pressed the early pace outside, vied
three wide through the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, proved game to hold the place. PORTAL
CREEK closest to he lead pack early, moved closer four wide late in the turn, vied past the furlong marker while between the top two, outkicked for the place
late. LEMON DROP KITTY off a step slow, well back, showed some belated interest off the inside. LADY GUSTO trailed for a half well out in the strip, came
five wide into the lane, improved position down the middle of the strip. DANCIN IN PARADISE set or forced the pace closest to the inside, weakened
through the stretch. SANDY SANGRIA in the second flight, raced in some traffic into the turn, steadied when lacking room with a quarter mile remaining,
moved out for the drive and went evenly to the wire. MIZZ FABULOUS with the pace from between horses for a half, was beginning to tired when steadied
entering the stretch, continued to weaken. DRINKATTHECREEK back early, came in the two path into the stretch, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
LONG WEEKEND broke sharp, set the pace for almost four furlongs in hand, asked along late in the turn when being briefly confronted, rebroke in upper
stretch and drew out in a sharp effort. LITTLE MENACE within striking distance toward the inside, edged closer late in the turn, split foes to briefly lodge a
bid outside the winner entering the stretch, proved no match in the run to the wire, clearly second best. LYKAN outrun in the early going off the rail, fanned
four wide exiting the turn, could do little with the top two, clear of the others. BEAU OXY lacked speed outside, fanned five wide out of the turn, went evenly
through the stretch when lacking a closing kick. NUCKY off slowly, trailed most of the way, failed to menace. FLY TO THE BANK prompted the pace off rail,
stopped when three wide and between horses entering the stretch.

Footnotes
WILD POPIT outrun in the early going, moved out a bit in the turn, steered out further for room in upper stretch, came out a bit further nearing the furlong
grounds then was floated out by a drifting MAJESTIC JAZZ soon after in turning bothering DUST DEVIL, finished full of run to win going away. FOLLOWING
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. EDGEMONT ROAD broke alertly, light bump,
got clear soon after, bit of a breather in the turn, clear again in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, held the place. GOLDEN NOTION within
striking distance outside, three wide through the turn, lacked a winning response. STONEGATE bumped slightly at the start, went one paced throughout
along the inside. DUST DEVIL last away, back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, bothered a furlong out, finished up evenly. IDEOLOGY
void of speed, three wide through the turn, improved slightly, no real threat. MAJESTIC JAZZ mid pack, four wide out of the turn, tired, drifted out midstretch.
PRODIGIOUS BAY closest to the leader for a half, gave way. UGO void of speed, remained always back. BLESSED WITH LUCK raced in mid pack early,
faded.
