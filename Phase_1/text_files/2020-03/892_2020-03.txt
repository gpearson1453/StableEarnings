dueled between horses then stalked a bit off the rail leaving the turn and into the stretch and held second. CASSIE BELLE bobbled at the start, settled
between horses then a bit off the rail, angled in on the turn, came out into the stretch, split rivals in the drive then finished with interest inside. VA VA VOOM
came in after the start, dueled three deep then stalked outside a rival leaving the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened some in the final
furlong. DANCE COSTUME broke a bit slowly, saved ground off the pace, came out in midstretch and lacked the needed rally. RAIN DIVA stalked three
deep then outside a rival on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. KAYLA'S COWGIRL saved ground
chasing the pace throughout and did not rally. YELLOW SHIRT stalked between horses then off the rail into and on the turn, came out into the stretch and

Footnotes
ROUTE SIX SIX had speed a bit off the rail then angled in and dueled inside, took a slim advantage leaving the second turn, inched away under urging past
the eighth pole and won clear. DR. DORR sent between horses early, dueled outside the winner, fought back leaving the second turn and in the stretch,
could not match that one in the final furlong but was clearly second best. OLIVER three deep early, stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch
and bested the others. ARIZONA MOON chased inside then off the rail into and on the backstretch, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. MYSTERY MESSENGER saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, drifted inward in the final furlong and
weakened.

Footnotes
AVALON RIDE saved ground stalking the pace, awaited room leaving the second turn, came out in upper stretch, bid outside the leader under urging to
gain the lead in deep stretch and proved best. OH PRETTY WOMAN broke in a bit then drifted in some, chased just off the rail, came out leaving the
second turn and four wide into the stretch, drifted in some in the final furlong and edged a rival late for the place. SASSYSERB angled in and dueled inside
then stalked, re-bid along the rail leaving the backstretch, regained the advantage on the second turn, inched away into the stretch, kicked clear under
urging, had the rider lose the whip in late stretch and was edged for second. SCARLET HEAT stalked between horses then a bit off the rail on the first turn,
continued between foes on the backstretch and outside the winner leaving the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
FLYING TO THE LINE pulled her way along to stalk the pace three deep, came four wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response.
SWING THOUGHTS angled in and dueled outside a rival then inched away briefly early on the backstretch, battled outside a foe into and on the second
turn and weakened in the final furlong.

angled in past midstretch and bested the others. SWAMP SOUFFLE bobbled at the start, stalked inside then pulled and steadied briefly leaving the hill,
saved ground tracking the pace, came out between horses into the stretch and lacked a rally. FRENCH GETAWAY came out three deep leaving the hill and
again into the clubhouse turn, chased outside a rival or off the rail, swung four wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response.
ASHLEYLUVSSUGAR stalked inside then a bit off the rail, bid outside the pacesetter on the backstretch and final turn, put a head in front between horses
leaving that turn, found the rail into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. GO FOR A RIDE had speed outside a rival then inched away and angled
in, set the pace inside, dueled on the backstretch and final turn, dropped back into the stretch and also weakened. Rail on hill at zero.

Footnotes
MISS TOKYO came a bit off the rail to stalk the pace, bid alongside the pacesetter leaving the second turn, took the lead into the stretch, inched away past
the eighth pole, drifted in from a crack of the ship a sixteenth out and proved best under an energetic hand ride and a hold late. TAGLINE saved ground
chasing the pace, came out a bit in upper stretch then angled in past midstretch, got through inside in deep stretch to gain the place. DIPPING IN angled in
and saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, split rivals in deep stretch and edged a foe for third. MADISON PARC angled in outside a
rival then went three deep into the first turn, stalked just off the rail then outside a foe, came three wide into the stretch and was edged for the show. STILL
IN LOVE pulled her way to the early lead, angled in and set the pace inside, fought back leaving the second turn and under urging in midstretch, came out
from behind the winner in deep stretch, had the rider lose the whip between foes in deep stretch and was outfinished for a minor share.
LOOKINTOGETEVEN a bit slow to begin, angled in and settled inside, came out on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and was outfinished.
SAVING SOPHIE angled in and stalked outside a rival, tugged some early on the backstretch, continued outside a foe, came three wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. PRINCESS TALE settled outside a rival, dropped back leaving the second turn, gave way and was eased in the final furlong.
