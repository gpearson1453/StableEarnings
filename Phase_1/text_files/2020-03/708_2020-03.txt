Footnotes
ANA LISA raced four deep in the early going, cleared rivals and set the pace while angling over to the inside, led from a bit off the rail into the stretch, urged
through the drive and held safely. WICKED SUNSET chased between runners up the backstretch, went two wide around the turn and finished willingly to
close the gap on the winner. ROYAL ASTRONOMER between rivals early then three deep to the turn, came three wide into stretch and went evenly late.
AIMING STRAIGHT chased the speed from the inside, saved ground around the turn and into the lane and failed to respond when asked.

Footnotes
MAGICALCHIC stalked from the outside then outside a rival to the turn, bid four wide on the turn and alongside the rival in the lane, dueled through the final
sixteenth and got up near the wire. WARM IT UP dueled with CHARMING WEEKEND into and around the turn, cleared rival leaving the bend, met the
challenge from MAGICALCHIC in the stretch and fought gamely to the wire but was bested near the wire. BABA BE GONE chased in the two path to the
turn, angled out three wide bit off rail, lacked room and steadied off the heels of WARM IT UP, angled to the inside and held the show. CHARMING
WEEKEND away quickly at the beginning and dueled for the lead from the inside into and around the turn, lost contact with the leader into the stretch and
gave way. MERGIE TROID traveled off the rail in the early going, went three wide around the turn and never responded to urging. AVO unhurried in the
beginning, raced off the rail then angled in and saved ground to the lane but lacked a rally.
