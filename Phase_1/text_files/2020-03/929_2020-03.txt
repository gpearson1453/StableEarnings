Footnotes
RHYTHM SECTION bumped with MIGHTY TOUGH at the start, lagged far back early, began picking off rivals four wide around the far turn, came out a bit
further rallying into the stretch, caught the leaders from outside a furlong out, lugged in sharply to the rail after drawing clear and was saved by the wire.
ALONZO MOSELY steadied keyed up along the inside into the first turn, remained well back after six furlongs near the two-path, angled to the far outside
finding stride in upper stretch, closed steadily and came up just short outside the winner. MALIBU EDGE was outrun to the stretch, and finished with good
energy while no threat to the top two. TURN OF EVENTS raced four wide much of the way, and flattened out late. GIMME SOME MO advanced with a bid
three wide on the far turn, fought on to the furlong grounds and weakened. GHOSTLORE moved up outside rivals approaching the far turn, cut the corner
getting in range at the top of the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. LIGHT CRUISER was no factor three wide on the turns. COUNTERSTRIKE set a
pressured pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way in the stretch. MIGHTY TOUGH was bumped between horses at the start, and never reached
contention. ABSAM bumped with MIGHTY TOUGH at the start, pressed the pace outside, and had nothing left in the stretch. WALK UP MUSIC was
forwardly placed inside to the far turn, and tired. SEVEN AND SEVEN stayed in range two wide early, and tired.

Footnotes
MIZ CHAPLIN moved up the inside and took a slim lead over CROWN REAL nearing the half, cleared on top and widened advantage racing in hand around
the turn then remained unasked while well clear through the lane. CHIT CHAT GIRL hustled up from the get-go, was forwardly placed and chased near the
inside around the turn, roused three wide into the lane and sustained steady effort for second best. DON'T GET KHOZY raced wide and reserved through
early stages, prompted along the outside around the turn, raced wide into stretch and rallied for a share. BLESSED BEAST raced two wide through early
stages then coaxed four wide near the quarter pole, fanned out wider entering the lane and lacked closing response. ABARRIO FOREVER hustled along
three to four wide in range around the turn then shifted to the inside upper stretch and flattened out. MISS MAC raced off the early speed and four wide
leaving the backstretch, roused four to five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. LUCKY MILADY brushed with foes then steadied shortly after the
start and dropped to last, saved ground into upper stretch and failed to move into threatening range. MARCHING IN was forwardly placed while tracking the
top two leaders in the opening quarter, headed in pursuit around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. CROWN REAL briefly held the lead then
quickly retreated, eased up in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
TAPPING bumped lightly with TAPI FROST while breaking to the lead, shook off BOURBON STREET around the turn in the two-path, moved to the rail in
the stretch and held firm under pressure. BOURBON STREET chased outside the winner throughout, and held the place on the wrong lead. LIGHT FURY
was bumped between horses and steadied at the start, saved ground throughout and held the show with an even finish. APACHE bumped with LIGHT
FURY at the start, was under a drive three wide on the turn, and finished evenly on the wrong lead. TAPI FROST bumped lightly with TAPPING coming out,
then shifted in bumping with KUDURO, and failed to menace four wide. KUDURO was bumped between horses at the start, and never got close. GRAN
CHAMPAGNE retired early three wide. KHATTAF came four wide after being outrun for a half-mile, and dropped well back. YANKEE EMPIRE dropped
back three wide on the turn.

Footnotes
FIRST WAVE was forwardly placed in opening stages then loomed up three wide late turn, roused to the lead in upper stretch then held late under steady
pressure. FUDDLED (IRE) maneuvered to the inside in early stages then waited for clear racing room around the turn, shifted out entering top of the lane,
responded under a drive and inched closer to the wire. GLORIOUSLY vied for the lead with FIRST CATALINA out of the gate, battled on two wide around
the turn, was no match when FIRST WAVE took control at the head of the lane but stayed on for a share. MANE ATTRACTION bumped between at the
start, raced off the early speed then put to a drive four wide entering the lane and had a mile improve. SO ELUSIVE raced along the inside and waited for a
clear path around the turn, shifted out wider entering top of the lane and improved position. NOBLE ALMA raced two to three wide in range around the turn,
came out wider for the drive and flattened out. LETTER STORM got bumped just after the start and dropped to last, raced widest under a drive entering the
lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. GIGGLE FACTORY switched in closer after breaking from the outside nearing the turn, hustled along
two wide then inside and failed to kick on. FAST CATALINA held a slim lead out of the gate, dueled inside of GLORIOUSLY around the turn then tired in the
drive. BORROWED ANGEL broke mid-pack, lacked speed and dropped back, saved ground into stretch run and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
TONG SHU bumped with MIA'S BOBTAIL at the start, went up to take over outside STORMY BOSS midway up the backstretch, cleared off into the turn in
the two-path after a slow first quarter, and dug in through the late stages to preserve the decision. STORMY BOSS crossed over to the lead causing
crowding and bumping just after the start, led early inside but yielded to rivals midway up the backstretch, stayed inside with a rail bid through the lane but
came up short. SABINA PARK was in range three wide on the turn, had aim outside the winner into the stretch but did not have enough. COUNTRY
STRONG saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved out near the eighth-pole and gained mildly. QUEEN KANTHAROS was bumped and squeezed
between STORMY BOSS and MIA'S BOBTAIL at the start, gave chase to the stretch and faded. MIA'S BOBTAIL was sandwiched between horses at the
start, and raced far back three wide. LOOKING FOR MORE leaned out striking her head into STORMY BOSS and checked at the start, and was done early
three to four wide.

Footnotes
AZRAEL held a slim lead entering the first turn then raced along the rail and forced to the pace to the far turn, made slight contact with PROPENSITY at
three eighths pole then dueled for command entering top of the lane, shook clear under pressure then stayed sharp and finished going away.
ROCHAMBEAU rated off the second flight down the backstretch, launched a bid late on the far turn, raced six wide entering the lane, was set down under
strong handling, produced a solid bid but could not get to the winner. PROPENSITY raced four wide in the top flight entering the first turn, took over a slim
lead and set a pressured pace to the far turn, made contact with AZRAEL near the three eighths pole, dueled for the lead with winner entering top stretch,
could not move on with rival then just lasted for show. FREEDOM'S FLIGHT settled in range through early stages, prompted three wide around the far turn,
continued a steady bid into the stretch run, got in a bit tight behind ROCHAMBEAU and steadied near the sixteenth pole then never really got going again
and got nipped for show. GREYES CREEK was unhurried and raced two wide down the backstretch, went to make a move then steadied late on the far
turn, shifted out wider then showed late response. FLAME ZAPPER raced along the outside off the pace, raced wide under pressure entering the lane and
needed more for late impact. COLLIERY stalked along the inside down the backstretch, prompted along the rail on the far turn, held in while wanting to
move out wider upper stretch, continued in range then steadied late stretch and lost position. FELIX THE FOX rated between foes to the far turn, gained
position racing three wide on the far turn then failed to advance in the lane. THUNDER MOUNTAIN steadied a step out of the gate then raced under a snug
hold in the rear entering the first turn, was reserved and wide, prompted late backstretch but had no response. LIBERTY'S PURSUIT was unhurried and
saved ground to no avail. BOLD GEM bumped with foe at the start, stalked the top flight down the backstretch then quickly retreated mid-way around the
final turn.

Footnotes
KRACHENWAGEN hugged the rail advancing steadily around the turn, took over inside CHASE RUNNER approaching the eighth-pole and drove clear.
CHASE RUNNER pressed the pace outside KAHRAMANI, reached a short lead after six furlongs, could not fend off the winner in upper stretch but dug in to
hold the place. CANDY CRUSHEM tracked outside the leaders four wide to the stretch, and could not gain late. LAPOCHKA was outrun for six furlongs
three to four wide, and passed tired horses on the far outside. DISCREET HEAT moved off the inside to the three-path on the turn, and had no rally.
KAHRAMANI stumbled at the start, recovered to get the lead out of the chute, showed the way in the two-path to late on the turn, yielded after six furlongs
and was eased up late. TWO STEP SLEW was finished before reaching the stretch, and dropped far back inside.

Footnotes
MANIACAL bumped the gate then brushed with rival a couple strides, raced in the back but never far off the early lead, let out a notch and circled four wide
around the turn, given cue top of the lane, raced four deep in aim for the lead in the final furlong, dug in determinedly under firm handling and cleared late.
FRENCHMEN STREET held a slim in opening stages, moved away from CAMP RANDALL then dueled inside of CAPTAIN RON, battled on gamely into
stretch run, held a slim lead with a furlong left to run then had no closing kick left in reserve. COOP TRIES HARDER stumbled at the start then switched in
and raced two wide around the turn, shifted to the inside and raced in striking range in stretch run, yielded in late stages and edged foe for show. CAPTAIN
RON raced three wide up close in opening stages then advanced to duel with FRENCHMAN STREET on the turn, fought back three wide and remained in
aim with a furlong left to run then evened out in final stages and got edged for show. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT chased inside in range then checked
along the rail near the quarter pole, lost all momentum and quickly dropped back. CAMP RANDALL showed early speed racing just off the leader, came up
empty mid-turn, dropped back then allowed to gallop home.

MONEY MOVES applied pace pressure to OURNATIONSPARADE down the backstretch, dueled for the lead with the added challenge of EDGE OF FIRE
at the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and remained sharp to the end. EDGE OF FIRE stalked the top flight to the far turn, dueled three deep at the
quarter pole, could not match with the winner in upper stretch but ran on for second best. SPRAWL got bumped shortly after the start then settled off the
pace along the outside, hustled up and raced wide into the lane, showed response and gained show. SILVER RATIO got pushed out and bothered after the
start then steadied just after, raced under a snug hold to settle off the early pace, moved in to race near the inside entering the head of the lane then shifted
out four wide, gained position then raced evenly in the final sixteenth. SOROS raced well off the pace, saved ground down the backstretch and stayed
inside into the lane and passed tiring foes. OURNATIONONPARADE got bumped at the start then set a pressured pace down the backstretch, dueled for
the lead around the far turn, failed to match with the winner top of the lane then faded in the final furlong. MISTER CANDY RIDE was reserved, saved
ground and continued well off the pace into the turn, shifted out under pressure in upper stretch and lacked a strong rally. MILES AHEAD tracked the early
pace and raced in range entering the turn launched a bid and raced five wide around at the five-sixteenths pole then weakened in the lane. SARATOGIAN
stalked in close range down the backstretch, launched a four wide bid around the turn then failed to keep pace and faded in the lane. GENGHIS got bumped
and steadied after the start, raced five wide off the pace and failed to move into contention. AFICIONADO got bumped between foes shortly after the start,
raced near mid-range in the opening quarter then emptied out on the turn. AWESOME TIGER raced near the in the back and had no response.

Footnotes
SILVER KITTEN took command soon after the start, gradually increased the tempo inside for six furlongs, kicked away under vigorous hand urging through
upper stretch, and was under a late drive to hold on. BACCHANALIA settled in the second flight three wide to the far turn, shifted further out for the stretch
run and was closing in outside the winner too late. WILDLIFE was outrun early, raced three then four wide around the far turn, and rallied mildly.
RIDEFORTHECAUSE was roused into the far turn three wide, and could not seriously menace with an even finish. CASH OUT eased back slightly inside
SILVER KITTEN leaving the first turn, tracked along the rail until moving out past the quarter-pole, could not reach the leader and weakened through the last
eighth of a mile. SOLAR KITTEN raced toward the inside throughout, and lacked a solid response. BIENVILLE STREET trailed under a firm hold early
inside, moved out five wide late on the far turn, and gained some ground without becoming a factor. ZARINA saved ground to no avail. TAKE
CHARGECHRISTY prompted the pace outside SILVER KITTEN for six furlongs, and gave way approaching the stretch.

the pole then headed in pursuit for the lead, dueled with MYSTIC LANCELOT in the final furlong, edged by foe then got caught by winner. MYSTIC

command then shook free at the head of the lane, continued to put in effort but had no late kick left in reserve. BLESS THE KITTEN raced along inside and
advanced closer along the rail near the midway point, angled out and prompted late on the far turn, hustled along into upper stretch then flattened in the final
furlong. BEE CATCHER tracked the pace down the backstretch, prompted in two path around the far turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and lacked the
needed response for late impact. KID MERCURY rated four to five wide then launched a bid on the far turn, got carried out wider in the lane and failed to
move on. MONTANA MAN got bumped shortly after the start then took over the early lead, set the pace down the backstretch, dueled with MYSTIC
LANCELOT around the final turn then gave way in the lane. FAME TO FAMOUS was unhurried and raced five wide in early stages then switched in a
couple paths nearing the far turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. OFF THE MEDS rated along the outside to the far
turn, prompted to pick up the pace then raced wide into stretch run and had no late response. AMENDS was unhurried, hustled along the inside into the
lane and failed to move into contention. ASK FOR BODE got bumped at the start then bumped again just after, rated four wide in range down the
