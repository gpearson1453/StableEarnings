Footnotes
SHINY SURPRISE broke readily, angled inwards pressing the pace outside a rival on a narrow advantage, then edged clear through the stretch under right
handed pressure. THIRTY NINE SEVEN tracked off the first flight between foes while conceding some position nearing the turn, but continued with a steady
effort to prevail for second in late stages. PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR hopped at the start exchanging brusheS with TAKEANOTHERCHANCE while off a bit
slowly, recovered to track the leaders outside foes racing into the turn but lacked the needed late kick while continuing well enough to prevail for a share.
COCKTAIL SKIRT, urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace into the turn, gave way into the lane. TAKEANOTHERCHANCE broke outwards exchanging
brushes at the start, was righted to track the leaders inside foes but faded early. THE FIRST TIMING SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

MATTY'S EXPRESS, reserved between foes in the last flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance inside rivals on the backstretch, split foes,
then swung out four wide nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge for command outside RECKLESS SPIRIT while being carried out by that foe leaving
midstretch but continued with a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the first flight outside a
rival racing to the backstretch, bid for command three deep racing into the far turn, drifted out nearing midstretch momentarily impeding the eventual winner
but proved no match late. GATOR POSSE was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, then came around rivals racing into the lane to
prevail for a share in the closing stages. HIGH HEATER tracked just off the first flight along the inside, was held up while shifting out racing into the far turn,
gained some position between racing into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. BRONX RUMBLE, in touch with the first flight three deep
attending the pace, pressed the issue between foes, then along the inside to upper stretch and gave way. GLOBAL DINNER, in touch with the first flight
between foes prompting the pace racing to the first turn, was through after a half. BATS CHANCE moved to the lead under firm rating along the inside,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LIVIA ducked out sharply at the start bumping SWINDLE and forcing that rival into the path of LOLANITA, was quickly righted, then sprinted
clear along the inside racing into the turn, steadily extended her margin under some mild urging while shifting out nearing upper stretch and held sway to the
end in a ridden out effort. LOLANITA, bumped at the start, was collected to track just off the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the turn and continued with
interest to edge rivals for the place honors late. MS. GENUINE, bumped by KISSMEONEMORETIME at the start, quickly recovered to gain a forward
placing between foes tracking the pacesetter into the turn but faded into upper stretch. SWINDLE, bumped by the eventual winner and forced into a rival at
the start, tracked just off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane but lacked a closing response. KISSMEONEMORETIME shied
outwards at the start bumping MS. GENUINE, then bobbled slightly momentarily dislodging her rider from his right iron, was collected to track just outside
the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DANVILLE, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance leaving the midway point of the far turn while
shifting out three wide, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and went clear under firm left handed encouragement. LUNAG RI, urged to the lead
outside a rival in the opening stages, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage on the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch,
dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn to upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner but prevailed for the place honors in late stages. FIFTH OF
NOVEMBER, in touch with a rival on the pace nearest the inside leaving the chute, switched outside that foe racing to the backstretch while briefly
conceding some position, was prompted to press the issue racing into the far turn, dueled past midstretch and weakened late. WITH REWARD ducked in
while breaking a bit awkwardly at the start, tracked the leaders along the rail to the far turn, shifted out entering the stretch and continued with an even effort.
ESTILO PELIGROSO was settled between foes in the last flight, angled to the inside entering the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge. EL
SOLO UNO angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking off the first flight but was through after a half.

YABBA DABBA DUDE, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, came under pressure midway through the turn to make a
steady advance on that rival nearing the lane, took over approaching midstretch and kicked clear under firm encouragement. ELZABE'S ON BOARD was
urged to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch but proved no match
while best of the others. ROSAS WAY tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. GILDED DRAMA tracked off the first flight between foes, then outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out
three deep entering the lane and was just outkicked for a share. SHAKEM N BREAKEM settled last in hand racing to the turn, angled outside foes to race
four wide into the stretch but had no rally. FORTLITE came through close quarters leaving the chute to track off the first flight along the inside racing to the

Footnotes
HIGH THRESHOLD hesitated at the start losing position to the field, switched outside foes racing to the first turn, commenced a sharp advance three deep
through the backstretch to challenge for command racing into the far turn, held sway on a narrow margin while shifting to the inside racing into the lane and
gamely held rivals in a prolonged drive. O'HAIRE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn,
shifted out three wide entering the lane to challenge for command but was just outkicked. FINALLY, restless in the gate, then bumped and pinched back at
the start, settled outside rivals to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the lane and finished willingly to challenge outside the top pair nearing the
wire. IN HONOR OF ARTIE was rated out of striking distance along the inside to the far turn, switched out in upper stretch and improved position between
foes late. VERY REPLACEABLE tracked just off the pacesetter while angling inside racing to the first turn, was steadied momentarily when shuffled out of
close quarters entering the far turn, angled out three deep nearing the lane but had no late response. ROGUE RAGE, urged to the lead along the rail to the
backstretch, was prompted to briefly resist the winner's challenge into the far turn but gave way into the lane. HANDSOME GEM tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival in second flight, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner between foes racing through the backstretch and quickly came
up empty. ROCKY JOHN dropped out early. CITY CAT bore out racing into the into backstretch, was pulled up with the assistance of the outrider and
walked off the course under his own power.
