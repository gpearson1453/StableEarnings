to settle early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. FRIEND OF DUBAI set all the pace and was empty in the latter stages.
ANALYZING was slow early, raced four wide through the lane and had no final winning bid. BIG EGYPT showed little. COLOR ME BEHOLD dropped back
early, saved ground and never threatned. WILD CARD PLAYOFF failed to sustain a bid. DANCING FOR DE BUY raced far back and was eased up on in
the stretch.

stalked the pace, saved ground throughout and finished second best. DANCE DOCTOR was unhurried early, saved ground, raced in tight quarters at the
eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. HEISAYANKEE stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and weakened. ZOOT SUIT was off a step
slow, rushed to to the pace along the inside and tired in the drive. FOOLS RUSHIN was slow early, raced four deep in the stretch and never threatened.
HOTFOOT raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. PRIMARILY GOLD pressed the pace, tired readily and was eased up on in the
stretch. TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.
