Footnotes
MISTER KOWEN was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and drew off with
complete authority. MR MOO was away in good order to press the pace of STORMIN NAVARONE while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing
the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. DAJUDGE chased the leaders while racing four-wide
throughout and failed to gain in the drive. MEGA SOURCE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished
evenly late. SOME ASSEMBLY REQD was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and lacked the
needed closing response. SOARING CID showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the quarter and was not a factor. SHE
THINKS IM HOT was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and failed to menace. BEAU WIZER IMAGE settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. TETON lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. STORMIN NAVARONE set
a pressured pace from the inside for a half and weakened.
