IF YOU BELIEVE broke in front, set all the pace while nicely rated and maintained her advantage under left handed urging. SECRET TRICK never far back,
rallied steadily in the five path through the stretch and finished second best. J'S HANDSOME FANA allowed to settle, finished with good courage along the
inside. KENNEDIE SKY saved ground into the stretch, drifted out to the six path through the final furlong and finished evenly. SPRING CITY GAL failed to
menace. WICKED LOVE chased the winner from the four path until deep stretch then faded. KARA'S ANGEL stalked the early pace, offered a mild bid
three wide on the far turn then came up empty. PORT MARIA hit the gate, broke in a tangle, had speed into the stretch then gave way.

BURKIE trailed for a half, closed with a burst of speed in the five path three wide through deep stretch under an energetic hand ride and got up in the final
strides. CAUSEWAY CANDY away alertly, set all the pace along the inside and was caught in the yards. GIANT'S FORREST chased the winner into the far
turn, drew on even terms for the lead two wide, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished. OBTAINED stalked the pace three wide into the stretch and
faded. TROPICAL CYCLONE well placed, failed to respond. DARKNESS BEAUTY angled outside entering the clubhouse turn, was a forward factor for five
furlongs then weakened. AJWIBAH was outrun.

I RECALL unhurried early, closed rapidly when set down in the five path on the turn and into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker, shook
clear late and lasted under strong handling. SHE'S CRAFTY trailed into the stretch, swung wide, closed with a rush out near the middle of the racetrack but
was too late. PEARLS IN CHARGE stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch then was outfinished.
ENDURING LOVE passed tiring rivals. CHECK OUT LINE failed to menace. GINGERMYSISTER chased the pace from the inside into the stretch then
weakened. LIL'PRINCESSNELLIE was no threat. LOVELY J T away alertly, set the pace for just over a half, then gave way.

HEATHERFROMPHOENIX made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace unchallenged and widened through the stretch to win as much
the best under a strong hand ride. TORMENTA DE ORO unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the far turn and finished clear for second. VELVET
SAMI trailed into the second turn then had a mild late rally inside. CINNAMON DIVA chased the winner into the stretch and faded late. QUEENA ESTHER
failed to menace. ADORABLE EYES moved up four wide into the second turn then came up empty. FACTUM'S REWARD had speed for six furlongs then
wilted. GOLFIN' DE AN was through after a half.

RESURRECTION ROAD never far back, rallied three wide on the second turn and into stretch, made the lead nearing the furlong marker and proved best in
a stretch long drive under right handed urging. CHANNEL PRINCESS broke in front, set the pace along the inside until mid stretch then couldn't handle the
winner but gamely held on for second. AT FIRST BLUSH stalked the pace all the way and finished with good courage four wide. MRS. ROBINSON chased
the leader into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead two wide, matched strides until deep stretch then was outfinished. FRANKIE'S GIFT failed to
menace. GAGLIANO was no threat. QUEEN HIGH was no factor. BLUE COLLAR BABY had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
SWEET BELEN sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set a pressured pace for a half then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under
mild urging. CAPTAIN ANNE trailed while settling inside, advanced on the turn and into the stretch, drifted out to the six path under left handed urging
through mid stretch and finished clear for second. IMPAZIBLE MINK went evenly in the four path. SAINT GLORIA had brief speed. TIN CAN ALLIE
pressured the winner two wide to the top of the stretch then gave way.
