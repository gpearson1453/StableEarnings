Footnotes
NOTORIOUS R B G was isolated tracking behind the leaders around the turn, rallied steadily through the stretch and got up late outside. COIN THE
PHRASE set the pace inside pressed by GOTTA GO MO, dug in along the rail through the drive and was game to the finish. GOTTA GO MO pressed the
pace outside COIN THE PHRASE, loomed alongside into the lane and was outfinished between the top two. AMERICAN GODDESS stayed in range to the
stretch, and lacked the needed bid along the rail. SUMMER IN THE CITY saved ground and turned in an even effort without threatening. MAY I was no
factor three wide. HALFY was bumped by FAVORITE SIN at the start and slow into stride, and showed little. FAVORITE SIN got pushed in at the start by
MEADOW BEAUTY and bumped with HALFY, and lagged far back throughout. MEADOW BEAUTY banged into the left side of the gate with the rider losing
the irons and unseated after a few strides, and was eventually apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START
BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
INTER MIAMI vied for the lead out of the gate and continue to match strides racing inside a duo around the turn, held a slim advantage over ABSOLUTE
GRIT with a furlong left to run then began to move away from rival while taking on the challenge from rail running FLAMING HOT, dug in gamely two wide
under firm handling and held on in final stride. FLAMING HOT raced near the lead in opening strides but lacked the early speed to continued on, weakened
off the front runners, angled out while coaxed around the turn, switched back to the rail upper stretch, dug in determinedly up the inside while inching closer
on the leader, stayed on gamely and got nipped for the win. ABSOLUTE GRIT vied for the lead out of the gate and continued to battle between foes around
the turn, remained in striking distance at the eighth pole then flattened a bit off the winner but continued to put In effort and stayed on for a share. R U
LUCKY raced four wide in aim for the lead in early going and continued around the turn then raced five wide and chased on evenly through the lane. GRAN
CASIQUE vied for the lead at the start and continued to battle racing three deep into the turn, could not remain on equal terms with top pair at the quarter
pole then faded in the lane. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF FLAMING HOT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BLAME THE GODS eyed the early leaders two wide, challenged for command between horses on the far turn, and edged away into the final furlong under
pressure. KARENINA saved ground early, advanced three wide with a bid around the far turn, reached even terms after six furlongs, drifted out through the
stretch and saved the place while weakening. HENNY'S TREASURE was outrun early inside, came into the stretch in the three-path and was going well too
late. MAGIC RIVER was a step slow at the break and steadied between SAVVY CAIRO and ROONEY, began to make up some ground three wide after six
furlongs, shifted in a path for the drive and gained belatedly. ZODIAC PRINCESS took over from ZIP IT JESS midway up the backstretch, moved inside
coming under attack from the top two finishers around the far turn, and weakened. SAVVY CAIRO came under a ride along the inside approaching the far
turn, and had no response. ROONEY was three wide early and well back, and never reached contention. ZIP IT JESS vied early inside ZODIAC
PRINCESS, yielded before completing a half-mile, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
RUN DEVIL raced in close contention in opening stages then moved up along the outside to challenge for the lead near the half mile marker, vied three
deep around the turn then continued a five wide bid into the lane, appeared all out but continued to put in game effort and shook free nearing the final
sixteenth. SHAZZY B raced in striking range of the early leader then quickened up to challenge rival near the half mile marker, vied between foes on the
turn, continued to battle back with RUN DEVIL until mid-stretch then had no late kick left in reserve. SWEDEN tracked the top flight while saving ground on
the rail, angled out and hustled along on the turn, raced four wide into upper stretch then continued a steady effort and gained a share. GOODBYE GABY
led the way out of the chute and crossed over to the inside, challenged for the lead by a duo at the half mile marker, dueled along the inside around the turn,
cut the corner and stayed on near the lead top stretch then lost the whip approaching the eighth pole and gave way. GITANA raced three to four off the
pace and had no response when called upon. LUCY'S INTEREST raced in the back, moved into stretch four wide, had no response and was not
persevered with in late stages.

Footnotes
PROVEN STRATEGIES broke out bumping WEATHERFORD at the start, had the lead briefly out of the gate but allowed WEATHERFORD to go on with it,
tracked that one for a half-mile, took over when ready midway on the far turn, widened the margin after six furlongs, and felt a few right-handed reminders
past the eighth-pole before being hand urged home. SHAMROCKET bumped with SOUPER WATSON at the start and was away slowest, tugged along
fighting restraint behind and between horses on the first turn, settled down up the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and rallied into second late.
MAGIC STREET saved ground early in range, moved out to momentarily loom a threat outside the winner near the quarter-pole, but flattened out.
VENEZUELAN HUG saved ground most of the way, and gained mildly without seriously threatening. SOUPER WATSON bumped with SHAMROCKET at
the start, became unsettled rating outside that rival early on the first turn, and lacked a response when roused. MR NAPPY raced mostly three wide for six
furlongs, and faded in the stretch outside. WEATHERFORD received a bump from PROVEN STRATEGIES at the start, went up to take the lead shortly
after that, relinquished the advantage on the far turn and was eased up in the stretch.

VEGAS KITTEN took over the lead in opening stages and secured inside position on the first turn, set comfortable fractions on top and continued clear to
the far turn, repelled the bid from WISE TO LISTEN leaving the turn, had plenty left in reserve when asked for more in stretch run and finished clear. WISE
TO LISTEN was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the leader down the backstretch, prompted in two path and raced in aim at the quarter pole,
failed to reach even terms with the eventual winner but continued a steady effort through the lane and cleared second best. NEW YORK STYLE tracked the
pace and saved ground through early stages, roused along the rail on the far turn, angled out entering top stretch then chased on evenly for a share.
LUCKY MIKE settled three to our wide not too far off the early pace, roused in two path around the far turn then came out wider for the drive, stayed under
steady pressure but lacked the needed kick for impact. BYE BYE MAN was off a step slow at the start then angled inside to save ground approaching the
first turn, was a bit keen and raced under a snug hold in early stages then settled while rated off the early pace and failed to advance when called upon in
the far turn. JACK B WINKLE raced near between foes in the last flight down the backstretch, hustled along five wide upper stretch then shifted in a few
paths and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
SULTRY SAMURAI closed in on the leaders three wide after a half-mile, forged to the front from outside entering the final furlong and drew away under
pressure. FREE FLAYME sprinted clear early, dug in when confronted by SULTRY SAMURAI and LONDON WEREWOLF turning for home, and battled
back on the rail with good courage to hold second. LONDON WEREWOLF broke outward, stalked outside FREE FLAYME for a half-mile, bid through upper
stretch, and weakened on the wrong lead between the top two. CONGRATS THIS broke slowly and was well back to the stretch, and rallied mildly outside
for the last major share. MONEY COME stumbled at the start, and failed to threaten through an even effort. EL ZEUS steadied in the two-path near the
half-mile pole well back, and lacked the needed response. UNCLE GREGORY raced four wide around the turn, and faded in the stretch. MAJOR KELLY hit
the left side of the gate and brushed with COWBOY BOB at the start, and was outrun two then three wide. COWBOY BOB brushed with MAJOR KELLY at
the start, and failed to menace. ALL STAR SEILER was never prominent four wide. SHAHKAAR hit the right side of the gate at the start, drifted extremely
wide into the stretch and was eased up. DONEGAL ACES brushed the left side of the gate coming out, never got close and was eased up into the stretch.

Footnotes
ROMAN CITY tracked the embattled pair while racing along the inside through early stages then swung out wide leaving the turn, was set down for the drive
along the outside, dug in determinedly under firm pressure and kicked clear. SILVER TUNES dueled for the lead out of the gate with SWIRLING CANDY
and continued heads apart around the turn, battled on gamely for the lead in stretch run, was all out in late stages and got outkicked by the winner. LA
CARA BONITA raced off the embattled duo in early going then coaxed two to three wide around the turn, came out wider in the final furlong and chased on
to finish on equal terms for a share. SWIRLING CANDY dueled for the lead out of the gate with SILVER TUNES, continued to match strides around the turn,
fought back gamely at eighth pole then gave way and finished on equal terms for show. DROP A HINT raced three to four wide off the early pace, raced
wide entering top stretch, continued a steady outside bid and had a mild improve. SUE'S MONSTER BABY raced inside off the duelers around the turn,
switched out a path and put to a drive at head of the lane but failed to kick on. ALAFIA was widest and reserved through early stages then saved ground into
stretch and failed to rally. AFROLINA raced off the early speed, moved into stretch run three wide and had no response.

Footnotes
LIKE YOU broke alertly, vied for command inside SILVERLY ENOUGH and SMASH through the opening half-mile, began to edge away after six furlongs,
and widened steadily under a drive before being geared down 70 yards out. MAKABIM broke a beat slow, advanced around the turn shifting out four wide,
stayed on his left lead and overhauled SILVERLY ENOUGH near the sixteenth-pole to secure second. SILVERLY ENOUGH contested the pace between
horses up the backstretch and into the turn, could not kick on with LIKE YOU after six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. HARPER GO LUCKY lost his
footing at the start, dropped back inside heading to the turn, and failed to rally. SMASH pressed the early pace widest of a threesome, and dropped back
before reaching the stretch. BEINFUN was well placed off the leading trio into the turn, came up empty past the three-eighths and was eased up in the lane.

and kept clear. BEE WINGS clipped heels strides of the gate then remained reserved, raced wide into stretch run then finished with response and got up for
place. BETTER BEGIN tracked along the inside to the far turn, was put to a drive five to six wide in stretch run, advanced to gain place then got edged for
position in final stride. SILVER PALMS stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced three wide in aim for the lead around the far turn, was no match for the
winner out of the turn then flattened out late. SUBTLE JOY rated along the inside near midpack, coaxed along the rail on the far turn then shifted out in
stretch run and chased one evenly in final furlong. DAMA DE NOCHE steadied then raced four wide entering the first turn, raced near mid-flight down the
backstretch, launched an outside and raced in range late far turn then lacked the late needed response for impact. LA GATA NEGRA backend got bumped
at the start, was reserved down the backstretch then raced wide into stretch and passed tiring foes. POWERFUL WORDS got bumped at the start then
raced off the pace, saved ground and urged along the rail on the far turn then shifted out under left handed pressure in the lane and failed to threaten.
SPECIAL BEACH set the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead along the inside around the far turn then tired in the drive. IM THIRSTY TOO raced
near mid-pack down the backstretch, prompted two path on the far turn, could not advance then steadily weakened. LOVELY LEE steadied entering the first
turn then checked early backstretch, was reserved off the pace and failed to move into contention. EMILIA STRONG swerved inward to avoid trouble out of
