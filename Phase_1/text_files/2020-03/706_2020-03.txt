Footnotes
SECRET CASTLE gave early chase inside then angled out midway on the turn and entered the stretch about the six path, dug in from that point to take the
lead in the final yards and raced clear under the wire. PIPERS GOLD veered out at the break and gave early chase outside, angled in midway on the turn,
dug in at the rail through the stretch and had a brief lead in deep stretch but was overcome the final yards. THREE BOPS gave chase from the four and five
paths, was carried out leaving the turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch but gave way through later yards. IRISH KNOCKOUT tapered in to rate the pace,
came under pressure toward the quarter pole, drifted into the stretch, was caught mid-stretch then relented the final sixteenth. MAKIN US LOOK GOOD
chased the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and had little left. COPELANQUIKZIP saved ground.

SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR stalked the pace from the two and three paths and challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to even terms past the
five sixteenths pole, contested the far turn two deep, took the nod toward the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to hold off the game challenge of
KING MAURO through the final furlong, the latter of whom, raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
dueled close three wide from the mid point of the far turn and was at even terms leaving the turn and dug in gamely to the wire. CANDY ASSET saved
ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, took over third later yards and finished well. AWESOME FU rated
a slim lead inside, was pressured leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dug in when met at even terms at the five sixteenths pole, raced with the edge at the
rail to the mid point of the far turn, ceded the advantage to the winner at that point but remained close through the upper stretch before weakening.
ENVISION SUCCESS settled close about the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened.

flattened stride off the rail on the far turn. LANA rounded the opening turn in the five and six paths and raced outside leaving the turn, then showed little
response through the backstretch. CISCO BAY saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail
rounding the far turn. GEMAGILITY settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded approaching the far turn. WEEKEND FLYER saved ground.
