INDIAN ZIP had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was clear to mid stretch and held under steady urging. HARVEST A STORM
pressed the winner two wide to the stretch then finished willingly but settled for the place. TIVAN had no speed, was also two wide on the turn then closed
the gap to the line. CLEM LABINE also had no speed, was two wide into the turn, swung out four wide for room into the stretch and also was making up
ground belatedly. CATS BLAME tracked the winner from the rail to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. MIDNIGHT DESTINY got outsprinted to
the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but weakened in the late stages.

CREATIVE ROMANCE was awkward to begin and had no speed, was two wide on the second turn, shifted out for room, rallied when set down and surged
in the final fifty yards to get the nod.'. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) attended the pace to the half, saved ground to the stretch, pushed clear to mid stretch then dug in
but was nailed on the wire. OUR BOLD PRINCESS was settled to the half, saved ground on the second turn, rallied and split rivals late to just miss.
BRILLIANT BIRD was unhurried to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and closed willingly but too late.
ROSE PRINCESS had no speed, settled for a half mile, was three wide on the far turn then swung out widest for the drive and was gaining late.

speed, circled five wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. RUNNIN DIVA tracked the leaders to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, loomed a threat to
mid stretch then was outfinished in the final sixteenth. TAKES A VILLAGE stalked the pace three wide to the stretch, rallied to loom boldly in mid stretch
then slackened late. BOTTLE NECK was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. GO VAIDAGIRL had no
speed and saved ground to no avail. SUPER PARTY was always outrun. LIVING LEGEND hustled to press the pace two wide to the stretch then tired and
