Footnotes
QUEEN HELENE was outsprinted to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then caught SPANISH MAGIC in mid stretch and edged clear driving.
AILISH'S BUTTERCUP pressed the leader early, was two wide to the stretch, dueled in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. ROLINGA had no
speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. PAPAYA was rank behind rivals in the opening quarter mile, saved
ground to the stretch but did not rally in the drive. SPANISH MAGIC hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then
tired. FLASHY HERO broke a bit slow and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IRON ALEX was well placed to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, collared TURNAROUND in mid stretch and edged clear driving.
TURNAROUND set all the pace while two wide on both turns, responded to mid stretch but could not stall the winner while not threatened for second. MR.
PAPAS was unhurried to the half, got fanned four wide on the second turn, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. CATS OUT TONITE broke a
bit slow, had no speed, was two wide on the far turn and also lacked a late response. HAWK'S RISING trailed to the stretch and was never a threat.
LEGENDARY NIGHT pressed the pace for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn but tired through the stretch. MY MAN DRAYMOND chased the
pace for a half mile then tired on the second turn and stopped in the drive.

HAPPY ISSUE never far back to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and held driving. PROPEPPY had no speed, was
two wide on the turn then finished in a steady bid for the place. CEDARS OF LEBANON (IRE) set the pace while off the rail to the stretch, could not stall the
winner in mid stretch and was no match for the runnerup. NO SPIN ZONE got outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing
response. SITTIN AND THINKIN pressed the pace three wide to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. PRORIKA was chasing to the
turn, bid three wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. LACEY'S RAINBOW was a bit slow to settle, trailed to the turn, was four
wide then swung out widest but did not rally.
