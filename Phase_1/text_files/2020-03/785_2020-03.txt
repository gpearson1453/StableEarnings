Footnotes
BOSSY BRIDE away without apparent mishap, sat forwardly placed three wide on the backstretch, closed the gap during the run around the bend, was in
hand with the mount looking CAIRO QUEEN in the eye as the pair turned into the lane, settled in upper stretch and was given her cue, responded to draw
off smartly, then got geared down in the final seventy yards. CAIRO QUEEN grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been sent off and running, cut
over to the inside route, showed the way, pilot lightly hand urging the mount, saw the winner range up in a menacing manner as three-quarters was being
completed, tipped out towards path two early during the stretch drive when let out, proved no match, but stayed on sufficiently so to secure second. FIRST
DAWN was allowed to ease back on the chute, got guided over to the rail, continued along it, stepped into the lane, came up short of snagging away the
place award then was reported after the race to have bled. HEARTSTRINGS stalked the pacesetter from just off the rail, came under stronger
encouragement by the five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the lane, gave way. OUR TICKET had the rider grab hold after lunging a bit at the start,
made it over to the rail early on the backstretch, loped along, devoid of any speed, flashed some interest late on the bend, fanned out five wide from upper
to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, mustered up a mild response. SMILES FROM SADIE pursued the pace from the two path, failed to make it
presence felt. ORBILICIOUS three wide onto the turn, was one path farther off the rail at the top of lane, had no offering and backed away.

Footnotes
SHAMROCK KID five wide in pursuit down the backstretch and through most of the turn, advanced on the front taking command just outside the quarter
pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. PETER'S PROJECT chased five to six wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SINGAPORE TRADER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the
three path under some pressure from THREE TO THIRTEEN to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed nearing the quarter
pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. THREE TO THIRTEEN coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace from the four path
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took brief command before being headed spinning just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch.
VINCENTO seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing half a mile from home, spun
three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
WHISPERING ROSE took up the chase from the two path, came under a drive midpoint on the turn, angled out five entering the lane for the best of
clearance, ground her way to the front end just inside the eighth pole and kicked away. MOLLY'S NIGHTHAWK sat forwardly placed from the two path, got
asked for her best at the head of the stretch, led briefly and by a slim margin in the general area of the eighth pole, saw the winner take over, held to save
second. MIZZEN THE MARK tracked the front runners from the inside during the initial stages, came under rousing tipping to the outside and into the two
path midway on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied for the show. MASONS FRIEND loosely drafted behind WOMEN NOT EASY from along the
inside for a good portion of the opening three-quarters, got cued up for the drive home, shifted into two path with approximately a furlong to go, flattened out.
WOMEN NOT EASY cut over to the inside after establishing the top, showed the way, feeling light pressure, got roused a short distance from the quarter
pole, was collared at the furlong grounds, then steadily backed away. MONEYBACKGUARANTEE travelled from path two for nearly three-quarters, was
moved out one wider for the drive home, made no impact. WICKED KHEISHA sighted three wide on the turn, was never involved. EMERALD ICE failed to
menace. SASSY SECRET three wide at the top of the turn, lacked a response. HOLIDAY BELLE four wide onto the turn, failed to contend. DERBY DOLL
saved ground on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
BEG TO DIFFER attained a forward position after the field had been released, was three to four wide in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, hitched up to
them by the midway point, got cued up challenging in earnest a sixteenth down the road, wrested away control at the furlong grounds then kicked away,
kept to the task at hand. UNRELENTING FORCE established the top in short order, got guided over to the inside route soon afterwards, carved out the
pace, attended by SIGNIFIED from the outside, that one being two wide, saw the winner add himself to the pace picture by the three-eighths pole, had the
pilot go to work soon afterwards, relinquished for good in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, stayed on well to easily salvage second. LIQUOR
underwent a ground-saving journey, stepped into the stretch and went on to secure third. SIGNIFIED pressed the issue towards the two path, going about
the task from between opponents during the latter stages of the run around the bend, got roused with a few strides to spare before the quarter pole, fell back
steadily during the stretch run. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU kept watch two wide from midpack, swung into the stretch by going five wide into it, came up empty.
A VOW OF BEAUTY travelled from the two path on the turn, had no rally. ROMANOATSEE two wide springing from the half mile pole, lacked the needed
response. CONSTANT QUEST inside on the turn, failed to menace. FROZEN ACCOUNT three wide on the turn, gave way. TRUE PALACE took a stroll in
the middle of the strip on the backstretch, departed it from the three path, was never in it.

Footnotes
PAYNE bobbled slightly losing its footing springing from the starting gate, assumed a forward position nevertheless, was rated along prompting the pace
from the two path, took over and edged away from the competition travelling around the bend, saw the pilot sitting chilly atop from the five-sixteenths pole
until its end, even with the others getting roused themselves in varying degrees, settled in at the head of the stretch and was fed his cue, scampered away,
then got geared down in the final seventy yards. MUSICAL AMERICA chased the pace from the two path, in between rivals for a good portion of the initial
six furlongs, came under a ride, as did all but the top one by the five-sixteenths pole, tipped three wide for entrance into the stretch, fought his way to the
place. FELIX IN FABULA tracked the pace from along the inside route until the quarter pole, angled two wide into the stretch, having already been roused a
sixteenth earlier, got outfinished. ROAMING UNION grabbed the top shortly after the start, slowly trekked over to the rail, was lightly hand urged cutting the
pace, got overtaken by the winner on the turn, stayed in contention until the top of the lane and backed away. HAN SENSE three wide onto the turn, was
four wide exiting it, tired after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
HONEY I'M GOOD five wide in closest pursuit of the leader, advanced on that rival through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took
over command and swung six wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged clear to the eighth pole and held clear to the finish to prevail. HONOR
WAY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to
three wide for home and offered up a mild kick. BLUEGRASS JAMBOREE chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight
wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. QUEEN KAHEN chased seven to eight wide throughout under a ride from the three-eighths and
offered no response. HAY FIELD coaxed from the start, chased five to six wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, continued five to six wide into upper
stretch and offered no rally. FORGOTTEN HERO coaxed from the gate, spurted away early on four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got collared near the quarter pole and went five wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
ONESHOTATFOREVER assumed the role of primary pursuer after the start, went about it from the three path, responded when let out a notch issuing a
challenge in the general area of the three-eighths pole, snatched away the verdict in short order and kicked clear, was put to a drive coming up to the
quarter pole, emerged at the eighth pole with its largest lead, squandered some of it late even though kept to the task at hand. OLIVER WITHA TWIST got
steadied being pinched at the start, took up position in midpack after settling into stride, entered the turn from the three path, improved while in hand, swung
into the lane slightly wider under a ride, rallied in a steadfast manner en route for place honors. POLITICAL pursued the pace two to three wide on the turn,
got driven into the lane, had to settle for third after being outfinished. DA BERG chased the pace towards the two path on the turn, was being roused moving
out four wide into the stretch, went on to finish a very non-threatening fourth. TRY'N SMART'N UP strung out four wide on the turn, lacked a solid closing
punch. LIAMS MAJESTY showed the way from the two path until the midway point on the turn, backed away steadily once into the stretch. HONORABLE
AVENUE travelled from the two path on the turn, had no rally. OUR PAPA G parked four to five wide on the turn, never made its presence felt. BLESSED
HONOUR cut over to the inside route after stumbling at the start, failed to get involved off the ground-saving journey that followed. GEILS ROCKS took up
the chase approximately four wide, came into the stretch and tired. LEGEND OF BAM stepped off the backstretch stationed in the three path, folded. GETA
LODE OF LUCKY loosely pocketed, was through after going six furlongs, fell back readily getting eased in the stretch, then walked off the track without
need of outside assistance.
