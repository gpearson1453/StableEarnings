Footnotes
PLATTE GIRL moved clear through the opening quarter racing about the two path, came out a bit into the stretch while opening the lead then held safe late
by a shrinking margin while never being put to the whip. P R GOLD MONEY was along the inside, rallied in the lane and was closing in on the winner late.
BAKER TOWNSHIP saved ground and closed some ground late as the leaders bunched nearing the line. SWEET COWGIRL tracked the winner three wide
and slowly closed late. MISS BLUE ROOSTER failed to mount a rally while three or four wide. WILDFIRE SIS saved ground and lacked a closing bid.
STREAKNSILVERSTONE was not a factor. SWEETSOURPUSS was always back.

Footnotes
TAYLOR'S BEAUTY dueled between rivals while two wide through the turn, continued well in the drive and dug in late to hold a narrow margin. AUNT
GAYLE dueled inside rivals, kept on well in the drive and narrowly missed late. FEELS RIGHT tracked the leaders outside, came five wide into the lane and
mildly closed late. ROAD SHOW was five and six wide through the turn into the lane and made a mild late gain. IMA DANGER was two or three wide
towards the back and moved up late. MY LADY J dueled three and four wide between rivals to the lane and weakened. CLASSY AFFAIR lacked a rally
racing three wide. MUZZ'EM dueled outside the lead group to be four and five wide and weakened. MABEL BELLE was not a factor. AIRIETTE saved
ground and was not a threat.

Footnotes
GOVENESS SHEILA contested the lead inside rivals from about the two or three path, continued inside ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY through the far turn, shook
that one off midstretch and held clear. ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY contested the early pace outside rivals, continued with the winner through the far turn to bid
into the lane but could not go with that one late while well clear of the others. D L'S GIRL settled back off the pace three or four wide, moved up through the
far turn into the lane but could not threaten. TICKER contested the pace through the first turn between rivals and weakened. EYES ON BEHOLD hesitated
then lunged into the air at the break and dropped well back early, moved up outside in the lane while no threat. LA DANTA saved ground and was not a
factor. TIZASPELL showed early speed between rivals and tired. SWEET AS CARO saved ground and was always back. GOODNESS CAT bobbled at the
break, recovered but went to bucking shortly after and unseated the rider, walked off.

Footnotes
WITT'S GOLD tucked inside the lead trio going to the turn while in good position, rallied through the lane and moved clear under steady handling. DIALED
made the pace about the three path while pressed through the turn then could not handle the winner's late run. MY PERFECT GRAYDAR prompted the
pace outside rivals and lacked a final closing run. CHILLY WILLIS brushed with a rival at the start, angled out nearing the lane and moved up four wide late.
BETA LOVER saved ground and lacked a rally. PERFECT LINE prompted the pace four wide outside rivals and weakened. DEFENDER OF HEARTS
brushed with a rival at the start and trailed three or four wide.

while no threat. XAVIER DAVEY stalked the leaders two or three wide and failed to mount a bid. FRANKALEE FUN tracked the leaders four wide to the far

A KISS GOODNIGHT saved ground back off the pace to the far turn, angled out through that bend to rally four wide into the lane and closed determinedly to
run down the leader in the closing jumps. MONGOL CALL dueled inside rivals while out from the rail, edged clear into the lane but was caught in the closing
yards. SILVER'S SWAN SONG dropped back off the pace three or four wide, rallied through the far turn and continued in the lane to gain third late. ZYXYZ
dueled from between rivals on the lead to the far turn and weakened in the drive. ODACHI stalked the pace from two or three wide and lacked a final closing
bid. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL improved position four to five wide while not a threat. STALKER contested the pace outside rivals to the far turn and weakened.
FOXY TWIST weakened racing three to four wide.

Footnotes
BIGSHOT LACEWELL followed the leaders saving ground, moved to challenge going up the backstretch to bid clear then held a safe lead the remainder.
OUT OF PATIENCE settled off the pace three or four wide, rallied in the far turn but could not get to the winner. DANCE FOR RANSOM contested the pace
out from the rail then weakened once headed by the winner. POINT HOPE moved up four wide while not a threat. STREET RULER tired racing two to three
wide. BANJO BILL prompted the pace three or four wide and tired. BE STORMY stumbled at the break and was always back. VALID PROSPECTOR was
outrun.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S LULLABY stalked the pace four wide to move closer through the far turn, rallied into the lane and moved clear under steady handling.
BANDWIDTH was five wide through the first turn while midpack, remained outside to rally with the winner into the lane and moved clear for the place.
HEISAYANKEE stalked the leader from two or three wide and could not go with the top pair in the lane. CLIPBOARD MONEY moved off to a clear lead
through the first turn, carried the advantage to late in the far turn and had little left. MINEFIELD followed the pace two or three wide and weakened. DUKATI
was not a threat racing three wide. COUNT N GOLD was caught in tight and checked into the first turn between rivals then never threatened while two or
three wide. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN was always back. RESILIENCE OF LOVE saved ground and tired.
