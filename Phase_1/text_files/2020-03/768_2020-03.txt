Footnotes
ALASKAN pressed the pace outside GANGSTER OF LOVE, took over with five-sixteenths remaining, and dug in to repel a challenge from STORM THE
BRIDGE through the stretch. STORM THE BRIDGE was well placed off the dueling leaders into the turn, ranged up three wide to issue a bid past the
five-sixteenths, and could not reach the winner through a long drive. JACK BEANSTALK raced four wide around the turn, and gained mildly outside through
the lane. MOZANO moved in around the turn improving position mildly, and lacked a bid on the rail. GANGSTER OF LOVE hustled to the lead inside, could
not stave off the top two late on the turn, moved out at the top of the stretch and faded. LAST JET OUT was no factor three wide. ELITE MISSION was no
threat four then five wide around the turn. SUPER INTENSE bumped with CAJUN ENCOUNTER at the start, raced two wide and tired after three-eighths of
a mile. CAJUN ENCOUNTER bumped with SUPER INTENSE at the start, saved ground and dropped far back after a half.

BUCKY'S DRAMA took the lead and angled inside after the start then was quickly challenged by TREVESS, vied inside of rival around the turn then shook
free entering top of the lane and kept clear under steady encouragement. TREVESS bumped with foe shortly after the start then advanced to challenge
BUCKY'S DRAMA for the early lead and vied two wide around the turn, could not match strides entering top stretch but kept after the winner with good
response to finish clearly second best. KAYLA'S TUNE hustled along the inside while racing in range of the top two leaders, saved ground around the turn
then continued a steady bid near the inside and secured a share. NO NO NINA bumped with foes shortly after the start then got shuffled while in tight near
the half mile marker and dropped to back, raced wide under pressure through the lane and passed a couple tiring foes. SAUCY TUNE raced two wide in
contention in early going and stayed on around the turn then came up empty in the lane. ARCH FLYER got bumped between foes just after the start,
hustled along three to four wide in range of the front runners, chased on around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DANZING DUNHILL bumped with DECKOLOGY at the start, vied inside several opponents up the backstretch, edged away from DYNADRIVE after six
furlongs, and drew off steadily under pressure. DYNADRIVE contested the early pace between rivals, could not stay with the winner turning for home, but
dug in through the late stages to hold second. I'M MORE READY raced four then three wide advancing around the turn, but could not sustain the rally and
was outfinished for the runner-up spot. MONTANA MAN broke out at the start, raced widest around the turn, and faded in the stretch. BAD BEAT BRIAN
argued the pace widest of a foursome up the backstretch, and faded around the turn. DECKOLOGY vied up front early, got steadied and shuffled back
between horses near the three-eighths, was eased up into the lane, and walked off.

Footnotes
PROPRIOCEPTION set a pressured pace with a pair of rivals racing outside in striking range, repelled the bid from PRINCESS AVRIL midway around the
turn then turned back the challenge from AWESOMENEWYEAR leaving the turn, continued to find more in reserve under steady pressure through the lane
and held clear. KOZY DREAMS raced off the top trio in opening quarter then ranged up closer along the outside late turn, stayed on with response racing
wide in stretch run and steadily edged up closer to the end. AWESOMENEWYEAR broke on top and remained forwardly placed then launched a three wide
bid for PROPRIOCEPTION on the turn, raced in striking distance but could not reach equal terms with eventual winner then flattened and churned on for
show. IRISH THUNDER lacked early foot and raced three to four wide off the pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, shifted out wider a furlong out
and failed to gain a threatening position. MIRANDA SOFIA showed response in the opening quarter then came up empty and dropped back. NATIONALIST
raced along the inside out of the gate, drifted inward and bumped the rail nearing the half mile marker, steadied and quickly retreated. PRINCESS AVRIL
showed speed from the outset and raced in aim of the early leader then began to falter past mid-way point in the turn.

Footnotes
THENORTHREMEMBERS bumped with BEBEAU at the start, pressed the pace outside BOSS LIFE for six furlongs, dueled with that rival past the
three-eighths and into the stretch, and edged clear after a long drive. BOSS LIFE became edgy in the gate prior to the start, came away alertly and grabbed
the lead, rated along slowing things down up the backstretch, dug in when hooked from the outside by THENORTHREMEMBERS midway on the far turn,
yielded after a long duel and saved the place. RAGS FOR BRITCHES broke inward unruly and having to be pulled off BEBEAU, saved ground at the back
early, got a bit closer two wide around the far turn, finished willingly and just missed second outside the top two. BEBEAU bumped with
THENORTHREMEMBERS at the start, stayed close in the two-path for six furlongs, swung widest for the drive and finished one-paced. PUNCHLINE
tugged along under a firm hold behind the leaders inside, and was empty turning for home.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN TODDY cleared in opening stages and led the way out of the chute, set the pace near the inside with SAMOA looming in close contention
along the outside, repelled the bid from aforementioned foe moving around the turn, appeared to be tiring with a furlong left to run but stayed on gamely and
kept clear. KAUFY FUTURES bumped the side of the gate at the start then quickly shifted to the inside, continued unhurried along the rail down the
backstretch, shifted out and headed in pursuit around the turn, stayed on with response and emerged from between foes in late stages to prevail for the
runner up spot. LOOKING FOR MORE tracked the top two leaders through early stages, launched a bid along the rail on the far turn, continued a steady
inside bid through the lane and ran on for a share. SAMOA was forwardly placed and raced in close range of the pacesetter, was put to a drive on the turn
but could not reach equal terms with the leader, chased on three wide upper stretch then flattened in late stages. MIA ANGELINA raced five wide off the
pace through early stages, was under a drive along the outside in the lane and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
SOLAR tracked outside the leaders up the backstretch, bid three wide after six furlongs, pulled clear outside RODDICK through the furlong grounds and just
held off IM THE CAPTAIN NOW in the final yards. IM THE CAPTAIN NOW broke in at the start, was unhurried early moving inside, shifted out three wide
approaching the stretch, kicked in on the far outside through the last sixteenth of a mile and just missed. MARYLAND PRIDE checked at the start between
MYBROTHERSLEDGE and IM THE CAPTAIN NOW, trailed early inside, advanced through the middle stages two then three wide, continued with a mild
response through the lane but did not have enough. THIRD ARMY raced four wide for most of the initial six furlongs, and made no appreciable headway
late. GAMBLER'S FALLACY saved ground early in the second flight, lost position dropping back to last on the far turn, and improved past tired horses in the
three-path late. CAUSE FOR PARDON prompted the pace outside RODDICK to the far turn, bid between that one and SOLAR approaching the
quarter-pole, and faded through the drive. RODDICK set the pace inside, came under attack from challengers after six furlongs, and faltered through the last
furlong. MY BROTHERSLEDGE was forwardly placed inside early, came under a ride midway on the far turn, and lacked a response.

Footnotes
CUCINA slammed the side of the gate and came away slowly at the start, raced in the last flight and saved ground around the turn, tipped out and kicked in
gear top of the lane, finished with strong willingly response and surged by SONG RIVER in final strides. SONG RIVER quickly cleared out of the gate and
widened advantage to race well clear over the next pursuer, continued in hand at the quarter pole then prompted late turn, remained well clear at the furlong
marker then ran out of gas in late stages and got caught nearing the wire. FLASH PASS raced in or near the back then raced a path outside of eventual
winner moving around the turn, raced three wide entering top stretch then shifted inside and advanced along the rail to gain show. DEO FORTE raced along
the inside off the clear leader in early stages, hustled up and angled out late turn then chased on five wide near the furlong grounds and lacked the late
needed kick for serious impact. FREEZER BURN was the closest pursuer of the clear leader through early stages, chased on two to three wide past the
furlong marker then gave way. DANCING DESTROYER hustled along racing in two path around the turn then raced widest in the lane and had no late kick.

Footnotes
GEMO stayed close early inside, was briefly bottled up behind RICKI TICKI TAFFI late on the turn, maneuvered outside that rival issuing a bid at the top of
the stretch, lugged in on the wrong lead wresting command through the furlong grounds, switched leads a sixteenth out and pulled clear while still
attempting to lug in. RICKI TICKI TAFFI sprinted clear after a quarter-mile, showed the way around the turn slightly off the rail, could not handle GEMO past
the furlong marker but held well to best the others. MASERATI MAN gave chase three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed late bid. BEYOND GONE
saved ground throughout, and could not menace in an even effort. ASSERTIKO was no factor two wide. BABY BROTHER pressed the pace outside,
dropped back under a drive outside the quarter-pole, and drifted wide dropping back in the stretch. IBERICO was finished three wide before completing a
half, was eased up at the top of the stretch, jogged under the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
AERODYNAMIC was a bit keen racing in three path nearing the first turn then settled nicely and tracked the pace down the backstretch, advanced top
command racing two wide past the quarter pole, widened to a clear advantage upper stretch and stayed sharp. RASPBERRY BALLET was off a step slow
at the start then remained reserved in the back, prompted late backstretch then began to show response around the far turn, fanned out wide entering top
stretch, stayed on with response racing wide and produced a solid bid for second best. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED was off a step slow at the start then sat
off the early pace, advanced two then inside around the far turn, sustained bid into stretch run, drifted out wider under right handed pressure and got edged
out late for place. PRINCESA CRYSTAL (GB) settled and saved ground through early stages, prompted and gained two to three wide around the far turn,
drifted out wider and flattened near mid-stretch. FUNNY FEATHER rated along the inside never too far back, waited patiently near three eighths pole then
roused late turn, moved into upper stretch two wide then moved to the inside and failed to kick on. BIT COIN QUEEN raced near midpack and continued
three to four wide in range around the far turn, fanned out entering top stretch and gave way. WILD ABOUT THIS led the way around the first turn, set the
pace down the backstretch, got collared for the lead by winner late far turn then faded. LITTLE EVY stalked the leader down the backstretch, raced along
the rail and failed to advance under pressure on the far turn and steadily faded. ALWAYS LUCKY raced five wide through early stages and had no response
when called on in the far turn.
