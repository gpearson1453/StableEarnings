MAYHAWK set the pace from the outside and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. SERGIOS LIMONCELLO stalked the pace, raced along the
inside and finished second best. MACANDALES stalked the pace, raced three wide while racing between and finished willingly to the wire. SENATOR
ROBERT stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final bid. ELUSIVE BLUEBOY was allowed to settle early, saved ground and had
no rally. CRIMSON JET dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. LIL' APOLLO failed to respond. IN CONTROL
was hustled from the inside and tired. MAGIC COWBOY was bumped at the start and never was a factor. SOPHISTICATEDBLING bumped at the start and
trailed.
