Footnotes
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS galloped inside to the lead, pressured throughout, dug in gamely for a determined winner. LUCKY ASSET off a bit slow start and
just missed trouble, secured good position to turn with an inside run, headed the winner with a furlong to go but was outfinished to the wire and gamely held
the place spot. SCALE broke a bit tardy, trailed early on, made a nice midtrack move through the stretch run for the show spot and just missing the place.
HARD TARGET broke well outside, vied to the turn three wide, could not go on and faltered late. QUEEN'S PALACE broke sharp outside, stayed in the mix
four wide to the turn but emptied out. KITTEN'S MAN was bothered at the start when foe came over and never factored throughout. MEISTER'S BREW
never a menace. KING SNAKE broke in sharply at the start, rushed to duel to the half but stopped readily. NO MAS was through early and dropped back.

pressured to the half, cleared a bit past the quarter pole and stayed on grudgingly for the place spot. CENTERFOLD ANGEL pressured leader to the half,
garnered lead at the furlong marker and stayed game to just missed staying for place. SCREENWRITER unhurried to the half outside, made a five wide
move into the stretch,but evened out in the final furlong. CARINA with the top flight throughout while off rail with no late kick when needed. ESTILL no speed
to the far turn outside, angled inside once into the stretch and moved up slightly while never a threat. TEMPESTUOUS AMY lagged along in the back
throughout outside and no threat. SISTER KITTEN good position while never far back to far turn from inside, roused for run with no response. BOURBON
GIRL no real factor. BYE BYE BULLY'S good position to the half and gave way readily. SILENT SURPRISE bore out badly start, never a threat thereafter.

AMONGST no speed to the quarter pole, rallied widest in the late stretch. WILLISTON WAY dueled to the half, gave way in the drive. NEWSTOME through
after half, dropped back. HOWARD OF LUCK never a real factor. TORRES DEL PAINE through early, stopped. Due to a timer malfunction the final time

ROGUE TOO set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane then drew off late in the stretch under a steady drive. SPEEDY SOLUTION checked entering
the first turn and trailed the field early on, was off the rail into the lane, moved up in the stretch but was no match for the winner while second best.

raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and improved position. RUMANDICE was bothered into the first turn, raced along the five path into
the lane and improved position. MAID IN THE MIST was never a factor. FLASH N' DANCE hopped and came out at the start, chased the pace early, was in
the three path into the lane and tired in the stretch run. MISS MOSAIC broke out at the start and was through after a half. GORGEOUS IN RAGS was
bumped at the start and done early. NEW ROO was steadied early on and bothered into the first turn. CALL ME KAYLA was through after a half.

Footnotes
HAVE A PLAN broke out at the start, chased the pace early, kicked on along the far turn, strolled past the leader into the lane from the three path and drew
away late in the stretch under a steady drive. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch and prevailed for place in the final stages. AUTOPILOT tracked the pace early on, was shuffled nearing the quarter pole, raced along the
four path into the lane, came again in the stretch run and missed place in the final stages. RUNTECH chased the pace early, made a bid near the quarter
pole, was on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. JILT stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in
the stretch drive. PEERLESS BROWN steadied nearing the quarter pole, squeezed through the inside into the lane and was empty in the stretch. BLACK
SHEEP set the pace for a half then folded up. JUDGE JOHNNY came out at the start and was no factor. HONEY SAVER was bumped at the start and
checked hard into the first turn. INDIAN SPRINGS was done early. CORENTIN was pulled up and vanned off.
