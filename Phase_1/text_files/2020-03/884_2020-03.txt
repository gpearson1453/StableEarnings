NEW BEGINNING settled off the pace and off the rail, started to improve past the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn, rallied to the lead
mid-stretch then widened through later yards. RICHIE'S B L rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at
the rail, was steadily encouraged through the upper stretch but gave way to the winner leaving the sixteenth pole. DONTMESAWITHSISTER rounded the
opening turn about the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn but showed little
in the lane. BALLYHOO PRINCE stalked the earlier pace inside then picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far
turn. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE stalked the pace from the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened through
the far turn. ECLIPTICALS DEWEY was through after a half mile and galloped the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
OWL RUN rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn then dug in under determined
stretch handling to hold off the effort of MIGHTY BOP, who saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole but raced hemmed in off the rail
nearing the top of the lane, recovered stride to come between horses mid-stretch and finished well at the inside flank of the winner. FIRE TIGAR settled off
the pace through the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn but was outfinished in the stretch duel
for second, while able to hold onto third. BURNIN RING O FIRE settled off the pace and off the rail, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four
wide then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. SYNERGY UNBRIDLED angled in to stalk the early pace from the two and three paths, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and had little left. EMBLEM'S ESTATE raced off the pace in the two and three paths the
opening turn and settled outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but flattened stride while saving ground on the far turn.
CHARITABLE MARK dropped well off the pace early on. The fractional times and final time were hand timed due to an equipment malfunction.

Footnotes
CUTTER LANDING stalked the pace two deep and challenged leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths, drew clear midway on
the far turn and was steadily handled to widen. QUINCYS WAY angled in early and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, was caught past the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride in second. KIM'S DIAMOND was forced in early and had
her heels clipped by Marylee then settled off the pace saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little
more. SING FROSTY rounded the first turn in the five path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, bid past the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the
far turn but flattened stride through the lane. SHE'S RIGHT raced off the early pace in the three and four paths then left the turn outside, bid past the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little more. WEST VIRGINIA PAM saved ground the opening turn then bid leaving the three
eighths pole, angled to the six path on the far turn and had little left. QUEEN OF ANYTHING raced in the four path the opening turn and settled off the pace
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded on the far turn. MARYLEE was shut off and clipped the heels of Kim's Diamond
and stumbled losing her rider shortly after the start. After a stewards inquiry, Quincys Way was disqualified to last place for causing the chain reaction which
ultimately affected Marylee, as well as Kim's Diamond.

TWO BIT KID stalked the pace off the rail then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dueled to
the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was clear under the wire. RESCUE FIVE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole then ceded; reluctantly. BOASTER saved ground off the pace the opening
turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path, angled five wide into the stretch,
dueled for third inside the sixteenth pole and finished well. HERO'S MAN rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. POOL BOY CHARLIE stalked the pace inside, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. COZZE CAT lunged leaving the gate, raced outside into the backstretch
and was not a factor.

SHANNA'S GRAY settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, angled
out to come between horses past the eighth pole, dug in for the lead later yards and held on well. CANARSIE PRINCESS raced off the pace toward the
inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, angled out leaving the turn then continued in an outward drift under
solid left handed pressure through the lane and got up for second the final strides. YODEL LADY saved ground through the opening turn and raced well off
the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path, eased out entering the stretch, was carried
outward through the length of the stretch and was just up for third. HATTITUDE was hustled along through the front stretch then stalked into the opening
turn, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms approaching the five sixteenths, took the nod nearing the quarter and contested
the edge through the far turn, but, gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. CALCUTTA settled back early on then bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, angled to the outside leaving the turn and was carried wider through the length of the
stretch. VINTAGE GIN was hustled along at the rail then rated the pace into the first turn, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole and ceded
the nod nearing the quarter, raced close at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. DELFINA showed little response through the
backstretch. DAM LOCKS rounded the opening turn in the six path and was not a factor. A LITTLE FLATTERED raced in the five path the first turn and
settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. After reviewing a claim of foul against the
rider of Canarsie Princess, lodged by the rider of Yodel Lady, the stewards disqualified the former to third place for carrying the latter outward through the
lane.
