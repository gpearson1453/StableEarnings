I SEE LONDON saved ground for six furlongs, shifted off the rail, rallied between horses two wide into the stretch, bumped repeatedly, made the lead past
the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. CAROLYN chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, dropped back, shifted outside,
came on again six wide late and got up for second. TEARS AND ROSES vied for the lead from the four path, inched closer on the far turn and into the
stretch, bumped with the winner before the eight pole then was outfinished. NORTH LATITUDE never far back, offered a bid two wide through upper stretch
then leveled off. FAB AUTUMN GIRL trailed into the stretch, improved along the rail to the eighth pole then failed to sustain that bid. COWGIRL CAL made
the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace off the rail in the two path into the stretch, bumped with the winner near the furlong marker then faded
through the final sixteenth. PUSHY GIRL had speed for six furlongs then faded.

Footnotes
RIDING IN THE WIND had good early speed along the inside, dropped back and shifted out to the four path before the turn, responded under left handed
urging to make the lead four wide past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. LIME AND TEQUILA shifted out to the four path soon
after the start, loomed boldly three wide at the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. CANDY CLASSIC broke in front, set a pressured pace
near the inside until deep stretch then was outfinished. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED had speed from the start, loomed boldly two wide on the turn, battled until
deep stretch then weakened. OFTEN ENOUGH failed to menace. WEST LEONARD was no threat. SEEKING A MILE inside, was through early.

Footnotes
STRATEGIC EKATI never far back, closed with a rush in the seven path under left handed whipping through deep stretch and was along in time. SMALL
TOWN HERO vied for lead the lead along the inside, rallied two and put a head in front inside the sixteenth pole then couldn't handle the late charge of the
winner. ROSKILDE broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. GREG RULES DA close up from the start, offered a mild bid in the
four path on the turn then leveled off. SHAKURR failed to menace. TREETOP FLYER chased the winner three wide into the stretch then faded. UNION
GRACE was no factor. OPRAH'S RANGER trailed.

ROCKY PARADE allowed to settle, closed fast in the six path under left handed urging through the stretch and was along in time. GIFT FROM MOM
prompted the early pace from the inside, steadied a bit and angled outside the leader entering the turn, shook clear quickly, set the pace until deep stretch
then couldn't handle the winner. MY PEGGY LOU stalked the pace and finished with good courage in the four path. LIL COUNTRY GRAD failed to menace.
CIRCLE WILL RUN passed tiring rivals. NOT A FLIRT was no threat. HIGHLY VISIBLE was no factor. ANSWER QUIETLY failed to menace. LINDA N
MICHELLE made the lead two wide soon after the start, set the pace into the turn then stopped.
