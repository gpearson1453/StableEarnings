thru and cleared off through the drive as much the best. TRICKIZAR unhurried to turn, rallied widest while outside for the place spot. MY DARK SECRET
dueled past the quarter pole outside but was outfinished for for the place spot late while well best of the rest. LOOKTHEOTHERWAY no speed to the stretch

quarter pole with no kick thereafter. CHRISTIAN MISS good speed two off rail, dueled into the stretch but faltered late. MAGNETIC SPOT sharp speed three

the turn, between horses into stretch, good effort. ZIDIKAI troubled start, lagged far back, shifted widest, moved up late. GRACE D' ART never a menace
with a rail trip. AMERICAN VALUES good position to the turn, lost his action on the backstretch and came up empty in the stretch. MIS ELAIN E US never
reached contention. RIVER GYPSY through after half, dropped back.
