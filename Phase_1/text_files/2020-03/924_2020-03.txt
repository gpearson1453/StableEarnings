Footnotes
DESTINY'S LOVE away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, cleared and worked way to rail early in the turn, maintained
daylight to the wire while never feeling the whip to win ridden out. SASSY SETA forwardly placed off the inside, continued to pursue the winner into the
stretch, slowly closing the gap on that one late while prevailing for the place. ITALIAN JUSTICE broke out, lacked speed while racing outside, four wide
through the turn, finished up willingly to be getting to the top two late. ISABELLE'S JOY back off the early pace toward the inside, improved position slightly
in the drive. ALL FACT forwardly placed, came three wide into the stretch, came up empty for the drive. MIA PROMESSA last to leave, made little impact
while racing three wide. MISS XIMENA broke with the field, raced forwardly early along the inside, faded.

TELL ME IM PRETTY within striking distance off the inside, three wide into the lane, late bid, gained the nod late while fully extended. RIGMAROLE
prompted the pace off the inside, took over nearing the furlong grounds, responded when the winner challenged from the outside late, missed the nod.
PRAIRIE DRESS broke alertly, showed the way toward the inside, saved ground through the turn while continuing to show the way, offered little resistance
to the top two the final furlong, best of the rest. RED LINGERIE chased the early leader toward the inside fell back in the turn, went evenly in the drive. HER
GOLD MINE went evenly while racing three wide. DARK SARCASM in mid pack while racing outside, steered out for the drive, improved bit. LITTLE SLEW
void of early foot, four wide late turn, moved out wider for the drive, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. GEORGIANO made little impact
while racing off the inside. ELSIE'S FIRST off a bit slow, void of speed, failed to menace. ANIMATOR off a step slow, remained always back. BATTLEBOT a
bit rank into the turn, tired while racing in the two path. LIL RESPECT mid pack early off rail, dropped inside turn, steadily faded.

Footnotes
BETTYANN stalked the early leader, challenged into the stretch, fell back, drifted out slightly nearing the furlong marker, rebid late, fully extended. WILLOW
MOON broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, responded when the winner came alongside exiting the turn, gained a slightly
larger advantage past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT in mid pack early off the inside, three wide through the turn,
finished up best of the rest while closing the gap slightly on the top two. LANEYS LOVE void of early foot, four wide when improving through the turn,
flattened out in the drive to finish up evenly. MICHELLE'S GRACE went one paced throughout, lacked a closing response. BENDI BLU off a step slow, four
to five wide out of the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CINNAFRIJOLE also failed to muster a response when called on in the
drive. BLUE MERMAID remained always back. SUSPECT THE WORST forwardly placed in the early going, steadily retreated in the two path.

Footnotes
BARRY LEE away best of all, dueled early off the inside shook clear in the turn, maintained daylight through the lane under steady handling. FIVE STAR
KIP lacked early foot, four wide into the turn, two path into the stretch, steered out, set down for the drive, willingly late to be up for the place. LOOKIE LOO
broke back, lacked early foot, steered out to be three wide into the lane, widest drive, outkicked for the place. ACADEMY BAY in the second flight three
wide, two path into the stretch, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, had nothing for that one to the wire, caught late for the second spot. WEAST
HILL dueled up front along the inside, weakened. SUSPECT A STORM was finished early. COWBOY CACTUS JACK off a step slow, moved up to the main
body before a quarter, tired in the drive while off the rail. BUD RO in mid pack off the inside, came four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing response. GET
THE BLING was never involved.

Footnotes
PEPPERED never far back toward the inside, advanced to challenge in the two path second turn, took over, clear when straightened for home, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire while being firmly kept to task. ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE broke alertly, bothered into the first turn, settled in mid pack in
the run up the backstretch, improved while saving ground through the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the palce.
NAPOLEON'S EMPIRE in mid pack when carried out a bit into the first turn, three wide trip, outkicked for the place spot late. GEORGIA DEPUTY lacked
early foot, improved while saving ground in the second turn,moved out for room when straightened for home, continued to display some interest in the drive
to close the gap on second flight at the wire. JUSTIN ZEE off a step slow, moved well out into the strip, continued to be wide through the second turn, six
path into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position while not posing a serious threat. WINGS UP lacked speed outside, five
wide through most of the final turn, went flat in the run to the wire. SHOAL BAY got clear early, continued to show the way up the backstretch and into the
far turn, dueled briefly with the winner inside late one late in the final bend, faltered when headed. TELETAP jostled at the start, tucked inside into the first
turn, made little impact thereafter. HARD TO IMPRESS settled in mid pack while outside, had little for the drive. HESLUCK broke out to bump an outer rival,
was straightened to race closest to the leader, chased that one up the backstretch and began to weaken. PLEASE THE COURT forwardly placed early
while along the inside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
ESPOSITO broke alertly, allowed the pace to go late in the first turn, moved closer into the far turn, engaged that same rival from the outside turning for
home, wore down foe under steady handling. ADULATOR forwardly placed off the inside into the first turn, cleared before a quarter, larger lead the middle
half, responded when the winner came alongside in the second turn, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, held the place late. HOLD ON ANGEL settled off
the pace, four wide in the first turn, continued outside and raced four wide through the second bend, finished willingly to be gaining for the place. CARMELO
settled in the second flight while off the inside, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. KRISTO slipped to bobble at be last away at the break,
lacked speed, continued back, improved slightly inside while not a serious threat. VOKAZAK void of speed, continued to lag into the far turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK remained back in lacking a rally. YOU SPLIT TENS within striking distance,
tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DICHOTOMY in mid pack, advanced three wide turn, traffic into the lane, outside bid a furlong out, edged clear. ANITA MARIE took command after the
start, remained clear through the turn and into the lane, proved no match for the winner the final sixteenth, saved the place. J P'S GLADYS last away, raced
back, came four wide out of the turn, finished willingly well out in the strip while too late for the place. GEMINI JOURNEY back off the early pace, dropped
inside far turn, continued to save ground into the stretch, moved out a bit, improved position through some traffic. SHE'S A LUCKY ONE broke back, lacked
early foot, steered out exiting the turn, displayed some late interest while in some traffic. DAVE'S BABY GIRL broke alertly, fell back and turned in an even
effort off the inside. SHOWIT forwardly placed outside, prompted the issue while three wide through most of the turn, weakened in the drive. IVY'S
COLLEGE FUND closest to the leader, had little left for the drive. SYRAH within striking distance inside, faltered in the drive. WISE EYES four wide through
the turn, tired in the drive. NORTHERN CONNECT trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SURE FIRE FRIEND with the pace, continued to contest the issue while between horses in the turn, gradually weakened through the stretch. AUGIE
contested the pace while three wide, also faded through the lane. SILVER RIDE attempted to get out a bit early, n the second flight along the inside, came
up empty in the drive. KING OF THE COURT bothered slightly early, raced ih the second group while between rivals, backed up in the drive. GLORY
STARS broke with the field, bobbled before a furlong, pulled up in apparent distress soon after, vanned off. SEVEN NATION ARMY never far back outside,
crept closer to vie four wide through the turn, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, remained clear, driving. BATTLE STATION with the
pace along the inside, could not match strides with the winner in the drive, saved the place. STROLLING void of speed, three out to four wide exiting the
turn, rallied for the show. TWELFTH LABOUR in the second flight outside, four wide turning for home, lacked a late kick.

Footnotes
SPECIAL DAY angled in through the first turn, stalked in the run up the backstretch, allowed a rival to challenge and clear from the outside when moving to
engage the leader far turn, bothered by that one a furlong out, finished willingly. BEAVER HAT four wide into the first turn when off the pace, made a sudden
move toward the front into the far turn, cleared, lugged out stretch, caught late. MEGA MAX forwardly placed off the inside, fell back off the issue into the far
turn, two path around that bend, three wide into the stretch, came back for the show while not a threat to the top two. MONEY COMETH within striking
distance off the inside, lacked a punch in the drive. CONNECTION got out into the first turn, showed the way onto the backstretch when clear, began to
weaken when headed in the far turn. BRUSH DOG void of speed along the inside, improved into the stretch, not a serious threat in the drive. ACE
GILFORD floated out seven wide into the first turn, angled in while continuing outside, lacked a response in the drive. RIP IT RYAN off slowly, raced back,
passed tiring rivals while not a factor. MISSUMAXWELL settled in mid pack off the inside, two path second turn when finished. MAYBE A SPIDER five wide
into the first turn, gave way after five furlongs. BAYERN TO BE WILD six wide into the first turn, finished early, jogged in.
