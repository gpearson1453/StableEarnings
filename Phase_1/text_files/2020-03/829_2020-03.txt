Footnotes
DA WINNER IS saved ground while in range of the dueling leaders, angled out approaching the stretch, straightened to be about four wide, closed steadily
under pressure, wandered outward in deep stretch and just got up. LOOKS GOOD got engaged in a pace battle while along the rail, steadied after
exchanging a bump with BUCKED TOOTH mid turn, re bid along the inside entering the lane, dueled, gained a short lead with about seventy yards
remaining, kept on gamely but nipped at the wire. BUCKED TOOTH broke a step slow, rushed up outside rivals soon after, dropped in and sparred outside
of LOOKS GOOD nearing the half mile pole, continued that scrum to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. JONATHAN MCD , off slowly, raced well back
past the three eighths, picked up some steam while off the rail into the lane, angled out and closed steadily. SUPER BUDDY chased outside a rival, shifted
out five wide entering the lane but lacked a serious response. FRENCH'S QUEST dropped well off the early pace, had a belated gain but failed to pose a
threat.

BARON OF BLUEGRASS chased the pace three deep around the turn, secured command in upper stretch and drew out under urging. LUCKY JUNIOR
lacked speed, was three wide on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. AIR ON FIRE , two wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
passed a tired rival late. SHADOW BOXER hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened late. PATRIOTIC QUEST hugged the inner rail most of
the trip and was not a factor. I GOT THE BRAHMS was outrun. GRAND RIVER , wide around the turn, was outrun. LACROSTIX disputed the pace two wide
between horses, faltered in mid stretch and was eased late.

SIERRA LEONA , with the early pace while saving ground, dropped back into the turn, angled out and was put to a drive mid turn, circled into the lane,
leveled off under left handed pressure near mid stretch, closed relentlessly and forged ahead in the final yards. CASH REGISTER , a bit rank at the break,
was brushed and carried out by TOWSON soon after, vied three deep before clearing three quarters out, dropped in and set a rated pace, turned away a
challenge in upper stretch, drifted out when going clear, corrected with the right stick, kept on willingly but could not contain the winner. MISS ALIPHANT
prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, bid soon into the lane, drifted in pursuing past mid stretch then was out finished. TOWSON came out at
the break and brushed with CASH REGISTER, vied between foes early, rated back near the six furlong pole, came under pressure mid turn, raced four wide
into the stretch but failed to drum up a closing response. CHAPEL OF CHIMES stalked outside a rival nearing the far turn and faltered.
EMMA'SDIAMONDDIVA dwelt the break, was pulled up early and walked off.

Footnotes
TOP ME OFF was allowed to go through along the rail and bid nearing the five eighths pole, moved clear heading to the half mile marker, set the pace
towards the rail and under light hold, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, dueled, had his rider get his whip knocked away soon past the eighth
pole, kept on tenaciously and proved best. SUCCESSFUL ZIP , fractious in the gate, was backed out then re entered, cleared early but remained off the
inside allowing the winner a seam near the five furlong marker, prompted that one around the turn, rebid past the three sixteenths, fought on from there but
wasn't quite good enough. COOL MAN CLETUS , in range and off the inside, gave hard chase of the top pair into the lane, shifted four wide, kept trying and
had a mild late gain. GRAND OASIS saved ground while off the pace, was put to a drive leaving the far turn, remained inside and had a belated response.
BIG BOOTS settled off the pace, edged up between foes nearing the turn, angled five wide under pressure into the lane but lacked a bid. BAYSIDER broke
a bit slowly and failed to menace. JERICHO MARSH , away well, chased wide into the turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
ALWAYS FORGIVEN prompted the pace outside of ANTRIM AUBREY, moved to engage that one nearing the turn, took a slim lead mid turn, spurted clear
approaching the stretch, opened up under strong handling in mid stretch and held firm while kept to task. GLENGAR bobbled at the break, recovered and
edged up four wide outside rivals leaving the three quarter pole, was under pressure pursuing the leaders past the three eighths, came four wide for the
drive and finished willingly to be second best. STUCCO , three wide between runners early on, was in the clear chasing mid turn, angled five wide and
continued with interest to gain the show. WALL was squeezed back from between runners soon after the start, lagged into the turn, circled six wide but
failed to generate the needed bid. INDIAN GHOST , between foes early, raced two wide into the lane but failed to threaten. ANTRIM AUBREY sped clear
early, dropped in and set the pace, was pressured nearing the turn, fought on to about the five sixteenths then gave way past the quarter pole. VOODOO
VALLEY angled out leaving the far turn and failed to menace. COFFEE PLEASE saved ground, gave way through the drive and was eased late.
