SILVANUS went eleven wide entering the stretch, closed to wear down his rivals and got up in the final strides. SAXON LORD dueled to deep stretch,
inched clear and was caught in a good effort. PARTY FOR ONE dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. KICKENIT raced close to the pace and
lacked the needed late response. CASUALITY was never far back, failed to rally and did not threaten. WILD WILD KINGDOM went ten wide leaving the turn
and offered a mild bid only. BULLITTONE improved position in an even effort. YEREVAN SONG raced mid pack, bid inside to loom a threat and stopped.
MIGIWEWIN raced mid pack in an even effort and was outrun. DARRENATOR pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. ALL ABOUT THAT BEN was not
a factor. HOUDINI HILL trailed the field.

Footnotes
TOO AWESOME sprinted clear to set the pace and held well under left handed urging. GOOCH EXPRESS was unhurried early and raced in the back, bid
six wide and closed well to finish second best. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD raced mid pack, bid along the rail on the turn, lacked room in the upper stretch and closed
steadily to get up for show. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was never far back, lacked the needed late response and failed to menace. DAKATI rallied into the
second turn to get within range, leveled off and faded through the stretch. ALL IN STEW OUI settled off the pace, rallied into the turn to loom a threat, had
little left for the drive and faded. TRE was outrun in an even effort. PAUL'S DIVA trailed the field.
