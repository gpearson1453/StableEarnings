THESWEETESTTABOO settled close toward the inside the opening turn, bid three wide nearing the five sixteenths pole and took a slim lead two deep
toward the head of the lane, then dueled clear later yards. SURFER GIRL CENTS took over at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under
pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, dug in to the challenge of the winner leaving the far turn but succumbed to that one later yards. GROUP TEXT
settled close in the three path the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, eased to the six path to come around the drifting Miss Casuarina on the
far turn then leveled off in third. SECRET O'LIFE came away awkwardly and was shuffled back leaving the gate, raced in the three path and well off the
pace on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. MISS CASUARINA stalked the pace two
deep then challenged past the seven sixteenths pole, engaged in close chase through the backstretch but drifted on the turn and weakened from the head
of the lane. KIM'S PET raced in the four path the opening turn then faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
THEKIDSBACK was shut at the start then rated off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled four wide leaving the far turn,
closed to the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. UNBELIEVABLE STORY rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and angled three
wide toward the head of the lane, dueled to a brief slim lead nearing the sixteenth pole, was quickly overcome, however continued on to duel for second.
CAST A STONE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths, contested at a close
disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn then outfinished in the later duel for second. BATTLE ROYALE broke outward then stalked the pace two
deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the lead past the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep on the far turn but was caught
entering the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. SWAY'S GODSEND RVF veered out leaving the gate and settled close in the three path the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn.

EISELE stalked the pace then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled to the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear into the lane then
drew off under steady encouragement. J J WEDGIT MAN stalked the pace about the three path then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in through the lane to take second later yards. LASHER settled off the pace well off the rail, was shut off and
checked sharply at the heels of the errant All About Tap leaving the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path, eased to the outside at the top of the lane and finished well. THORN OF ROSE HILL settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid approaching the
seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path then flattened stride. BULL MEECHUM angled to the inside to rate the pace, came
under pressure toward the three eighths pole and contested the advantage to the mid point of the far turn, gave up the lead at that point and weakened
leaving the turn. ALL ABOUT TAP settled off the early pace toward the inside but bolted from under his rider nearing the half mile pole. A stewards inquiry
was conducted, though, no change was necessary.

the three eighths pole, gave up the advantage past the quarter but dug in gamely to late stretch before ceding; reluctantly. FACEY'S SISTER raced off the
pace in the three path the opening turn and entered the backstretch outside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the
four path and showed little more. COURTLY KITTY was squeezed leaving the gate and checked immediately afterward, raced well off the pace in the four
path the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and had little left. SAINTE THERESE settled off the
pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then weakened. EARNED THE

but was caught leaving the first turn and faded through the backstretch.

sixteenths, widened on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. RIGHTEOUS MAN rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths then
settled outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and challenged three wide, but dropped back into the far turn and dug in to retain
second. HARD BEING ME saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in
the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. TURNER ASHBY settled off the pace inside then angled out past the three eighths pole, bid nearing the
five sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the five path but showed little more. CHAMPAGNE JAM raced well off the pace and offered little response through
the backstretch. RIP THORN stalked the early pace then passed the winner two deep leaving the nine sixteenths pole, was pressured nearing the three

Footnotes
GIANT DREAMS rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in
under determined handling to ward off the game stretch effort of LETCHER, who steadied soon after the start then settled off the pace in the three path the
first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms two deep past the quarter pole and dug in
gamely through the stretch, though, grudgingly ceded. RAMBAM ROCKER rated close about the three path the first turn then picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened stride down the lane. LIL BITTY ROAD settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more in the lane. THE SON WIND saved ground off the pace, started a bid into
the far turn, drifted to the six path nearing the head of the lane and passed some. CAT MOR BRIDGE settled close inside the first turn then picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then angled out at the head of the lane and finished evenly. PISTOLINMYPOCKET
raced in the five path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened on the far turn. CHARITABLE
rounded the opening turn about the seven path and raced outside into the backstretch, was never a factor and was carried out nearing the head of the lane.
ORE PASS raced off the rail through the opening turn and never factored. FORBIDDEN TOPIC raced well off the pace and was not a factor. PER RULING
FROM WEST VIRIGINA RACING COMMISSION, GIANT DREAMS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
