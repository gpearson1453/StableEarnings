Footnotes
SACRED OATH outrun early, steered out four wide when advancing late in the turn, set down for the drive, late bid, going away. VAYA CON DIOS forwardly
placed while between rivals, bid, took over turning into the stretch, clear a furlong out, proved no match for the winner late. DENVER CITY pressed the pace
in the three path, continued to force the issue through the turn, could not match the top two in the drive, saved tghe show. GREATER CAIRO broke in good
order, narrowly set the pace inside, began to weaken when headed turning for home. WYOMING CONQUEST broke awkwardly, raced well back and three
wide, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. BIG BAD BUD restless in the gate, lacked speed, failed to menace. RICHMOND off a step slow,
mid pack while in the three path, had nothing for the drive. DATA CAT in the second flight in the two path, steadily faded.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD STAR void of early foot, saved ground while racing back into and through the turn, roused for the drive, rallied up the rail to be in time. GRAB
THE MUNNY in the second flight while racing in the two path, behind the leaders into the lane, split foes when challenging past the furlong marker, briefly
led, outkicked. COME ON DOVER lacked speed, four wide through most of the turn, came five wide into the lane, late bid outside, not enough. MUSKOKA
WONDER away in good order, prompted the pace off the inside, took over midway on the turn, continued to vie past midstretch, weakened a bit late while
between horses. R H SMOAKEM well back in the early going, moved closer toward the inside late in the turn, traffic a furlong out, finished up evenly when
clear. BUCK DUANE in the second group while outside the runner up, angled out four wide when moving on the leaders exiting the turn, challenged,
narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, faltered soon after. CHARLIE'S SCHILLER broke sharp, set the early pace inside, weakened.
QUICKSILVER off a step slow, moved up outside into a forward position into the turn, gave way in the drive. WAR VETERAN tired while racing off the
inside. DAHIK was finished early.

Footnotes
WEEKEND MADNESS outrun early on the outside, angled in a bit into the far turn, worked way out to five wide turning for home, took over, ridden out.
GYPSY WIND JEANNE angled in sharply to save some ground in the first turn, continued inside into and through the second turn, proved no match for the
winner in the drive, clearly second best. A REAL GEM lacked early foot, angled out to be widest for the drive, finished up best of the rest. PLUS SIZE
VALUE void of speed, four wide through the final turn, improved position while not a serious threat. UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY four wide in the first turn, three
wide in the second bend, improved a bit into the lane then flattened out. PROUDLY FOUGHT forwardly placed while racing off the inside, three wide
through the final turn, tired in the drive. WITHYOURPERMISSION sprinted clear in the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, faltered when headed
turning for home. FOOLISH PRINCESS broke sharp, dueled early inside, fell back to chase the leader the middle half mile, gave way in the drive. OUR
LIZZY LOU failed to menace. SUITS ME was finished after a half. EMILY BUG also began to back up after a half. HERMANA RED last away, was never
close.

Footnotes
SUNDAY SERMON with the pace from the start, vied three wide, shook clear, widened, enough left to last. IMPLICATOR outrun for five furlongs, began to
move far turn, improved inside of rivals in the second turn, moved out a bit for the drive, finished willingly to be up for the place while cutting into the margin
of the winner late. JIMMIE T behind the first flight, raced in the three path second turn, advanced into the stretch to be closest to the winner by daylight past
the furlong marker, caught late for the place while also getting to the winner in the waning strides. PEARLTHIRTYEIGHT void of speed for five furlongs while
saving ground, angled out to be three wide late in the final turn, improved position. TRAFFIC SCOUT bothered at the start, fell far back, improved position
through some traffic, not a serious threat. INTO ORBIT lacked speed, continued back, improved in the two path, also never dangerous. FIRE TO settled in
midpack, had nothing left. PAPA STAR with the early pace while between horses, backed up in the drive. MOONSHINE MOMENT broke out, bothered rival,
raced in mid pack, failed to muster a rally. BACK ROAD OUTLAW remained back, five wide through the second turn, remained back. I STAN FOR LOVE
broke in, straightened to contest the pace along the inside, stopped. EXOTIC PEGASUS stopped after a half.

Footnotes
PRINCIPE GUILHERME off a step slow, back early as a result, moved closer in the two path turn, encountered some traffic entering the stretch, roused,
split foes, collared the leader late and was clearly best. PETE'S PLAY CALL with the pace while racing four wide, continued to contest the issue in the four
path through the turn, disposed of the other speed to get briefly clear with a furlong to run, proved no match for the winner late. FLAT LUCKY in the second
flight, raced three out to four wide by late in the turn between rivals, mild rally to finish up best of the rest. JERRYS PRIDENJOY vied up front along the
inside, weakened in the drive. POWERFUL ALLY back off the pace, angled four wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick while well out in the strip.
RECOUNT vied up front between horses, gave way. D' RAPPER with the leaders while three wide, tired through the stretch. SHORTLIST in the second
flight outside, four out to five wide exiting the bend, faded through the lane while widest.

Footnotes
CANDY CORNELL stalked the pace from the three patch, roused when entering the stretch, engaged the leader from the outside with a furlong to run,
quickly kicked clear under pressure. TOWN CHAMP moved up the inside to duel through a quick opening quarter, continued to alternate up front through
the turn, shook off the other speed in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. SOARING BIRD moved out while off
the early pace, carried out after a furlong, three out to four wide turning for home, displayed a mild amount of late interest to be getting to the runner up.
MARKET KING came out early to carry out SOARING BIRD, raced in the two path into the stretch, improved slightly while not a threat to the top three. .
COURTING A KISS chased early off the inside, dropped to the inside midway on the turn, had little left for the drive. TIZ MCNAMARA made little impact
while saving ground. LIGHT OF THE WORLD off a bit slow, angled in sharply to the inside before a furlong, also was never a threat. SPECIAL RESERVE
broke alertly, alternated up front outside the runner up for a half then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
M G WARRIOR off a step slow, raced well back while moving outside, advanced strongly into contention four wide into and through the far turn, showed the
way into the stretch and drove clear. CHRIS AND DAVE lacked speed, steered out to be four wide when moving forward late in the final turn, finished up
willingly to be in time for the place. TIMELINE back early off the pace, followed the winner in the four path toward the front in the second turn, flattened out in
failing to keep up with that rival, lost the place late. GORDY FLORIDA dueled up front while racing closest to the inside, helped set some lively fractions,
weakened in the drive. PETROV settled in the second flight just off the inside, came up empty for the drive. EXTIRPATOR closest to the dueling leaders off
the inside, had little left for the drive. MISTER BANJOMAN vied up front off the inside, steadied when appearing to begin tiring far turn, fell back and then
continued to fade. SHIVERMETIMBERS was finished early, stopped far turn, jogged in, walked off.

Footnotes
STRONG FLAG prompted the leader through some soft splits, engaged that one from the outside entering the stretch, wore that rival down and kicked clear
under steady handling. CHEROKEE MAIDEN broke alertly, set a soft pace toward the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner past the furlong marker
then could not keep up, clearly second best. GLAMOUR GIRL in some traffic into and through the first turn, continued inside, raced in the two path through
the second turn, had little for the top two in the drive, finished up best of the rest. MALIBU MARLEE went one paced while racing three wide. HASHTAG
WINNER lacked early foot outside, angled in a bit onto the backstretch, steered back out to be five wide turning into the stretch, staged a mild rally to
improve position. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT off a step slow, raced back, moved moved closer while four wide into the far turn, flattened. CLOUDBUSTER
failed to menace while racing just off the inside. AREEMAA remained always back while four wide throughout. BEACH TIME broke out, raced forwardly
early, gave way in the drive.
