Footnotes
DOUBLEDOWN DREAMER was allowed to settle early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in the closing
yards. BINGHAM'S FLASH broke awkwardly, steadied soon after, raced just off the leaders, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths, reached the fore inside the
sixteenth pole but could not resist the winner late. DUALITAS was bumped at the break, set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin
nearing the quarter, remained in control through mid-stretch, lugged out and gave way through the final furlong. LIL LATIGO was bumped at the start then
forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished evenly. BENITO CHICO was bumped at the break,
pressed the pace of DUALITAS from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and weakened in the drive. PAPER ROSES lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

PRINCESS JADA dueled for the lead from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. MORE SMORES broke
sharply to press the pace from between foes, dropped back nearing the three-eighths marker, responded when set down for the drive and was up for the
place. PEACEOUTYOURHONOR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU
lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. REALREALGOOD was away in good order to press the pace from between foes,
moved four-wide through the turn and weakened after going a half. BLUEGRASS BANJO pressed the pace from between foes for a half and weakened.
TRES TAURUS disputed the pace from between foes for a half and weakened.

MY BOY ZAYN was allowed to settle early, went six wide into the turn, was gaining late, made a bid on BEHOLDS HOTTIE, dueled with that rival and
prevailed for the win. BEHOLD'S HOTTIE set a pressured early, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out through the turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled
to the wire and finished second best. GOLD NOTE stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and weakened. ZUNI raced in mid pack early,
went seven wide through the turn and flattened out in the drive. STRONG COUNSEL was void of any early speed, raced between rivals into the turn and
offered no late rally. MAGIC CARPET RUN pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn and faded. ONE FINE ROMANCE was taken back early and
was no factor.

GHOSTED pressed the pace of SHAULA while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied into deep stretch and
drew off through the final yards. SHAULA was away alertly to set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, vied with that foe but could not match strides through the closing yards. BUOYANCE lacked early foot, raced between foes through the
back-stretch, move three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. JACK'S PARTY GIRL was forwardly placed from
the inside throughout and gave way in the drive. ROBTHEQUEEN was off a step slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out further
approaching the stretch and did not offer a bid. MAMA'S KID was off slow, moved up to race just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and

SPECIALYKINDACRAZY raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing
yards. HOMEMADE LOVIN was away in good order to press the pace of THREE CHIPS while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and just failed to last. HENNO MOMO was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail,
angled out approaching the stretch, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. CURL was forwardly placed from between foes, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and finished evenly in the drive. LADY DOVE was off slow, lugged out approaching the stretch and did not
reach contention. NAVARONES SPARKLE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. THREE CHIPS set a
pressured pace from off the rail and weakened after going a half. SASSY QUEENIE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. SPLITS N STRIKES lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace.

early, drifted out six wide into the second turn, was no match late and finished second best. CLASSIC GENT was void of any early speed, advanced five
wide into the second turn, angled out in early stretch and finished with a mild late rally. VICTORY LANE was taken back early, raced along the inside into
the turn and finished evenly late. SNEAKY MEEK was not far back early, circled seven wide through the second turn and was empty late. MOOSEWOOD
raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals into the home turn and faded. GETTY followed the early pace, went four wide into the second turn and
weakened. HUNTERWOOD was reserved off the pace from between rivals and gave way. DYNAMIC RESPONSE had a poor start and never recovered.
