Footnotes
BAOZUN broke very fast from the inside post, was allowed to drop to the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then
moved out under a drive, rallied on the outside, was put to a right-handed whip while making a bid into the final furlong, gained the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole, was put to strong hand urging after taking the advantage while battling outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth, came back under a
right-handed whip while under threat from that game rival and narrowly prevailed. NICE OF ME dropped back between horses early, settled on the outside,
moved further out just inside the half-mile pole, advanced four to five wide on the turn, rallied to the lead just after turning into the stretch then moved clear
at the three-sixteenths, was challenged by the winner coming to the furlong marker, lost the lead to that rival outside the sixteenth-pole, fought back gamely
to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. HE'S THE SOUPERWON settled on the outside, ranged up while three to four wide on the turn, took a
very brief lead at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the runner-up, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened while clear for the
show. WELLWEST was rated just off the pace then let out in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and came up
empty. LAUGHING BOBBY was hustled to the lead, set the pace with some company to his outside, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole
and gave way.

Footnotes
BRENDA'S AN I FULL settled on the outside, was roused while three then two wide on the turn, rallied while still on her inside lead under a strong hand ride
in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead while gaining fast coming to the eighth-pole then was put to a left-handed whip while taking the advantage into
the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. SMOKIN HOT MOMMA was fractious in the gate then backed out and reloaded, settled in second
position after being hustled from the start, rounded the turn in the three path, was asked for her best in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and
secured the place while no match for the winner. D J SOUL SISTA broke a step slow, was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the four path on
the turn, gained five wide into the stretch then came under the whip, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and flattened out while able to get the show.
DAAHERACHEL came out in front then crossed over while moving clear, remained clear while inside on the turn, was asked for more in upper stretch then
collared into the final furlong and gave way. ALTERED DREAM was reserved off the pace, went three wide while asked on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. SUCRE broke in at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the
turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to respond. CHASES DIXIE BELLE angled in early, settled on the inside, saved ground under urging
on the turn and also failed to respond. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
AW ITE was quick to the lead, dictated terms up the backstretch, extended the margin racing along the inside through the turn, was put to a drive in the
stretch and held sway under steady handling. REACH THE CIRCLE switched off the inside heading up the backstretch, went outside a rival three then four
wide on the turn and under urging leaving that bend, gained on the leader into upper stretch but could make little ground thereafter despite the effort.
STANDING MAN was outside rivals up the backstretch entering the turn four deep, moved in a path racing behind then inside and just off REACH THE
CIRCLE past the three-eighths, came out a bit into upper stretch, appeared to be lugging in near the furlong ground and was strongly corrected by the rider
running nearly on the heels of that aforementioned rival and made no impact thereafter. BROADWAY JONES was urged forward from the break chasing
near the inside, went two to three wide on the turn then weakened inside the final furlong. TONI'S STAR broke a bit awkwardly then angled in trailing the
field, saved ground inside through the turn, came out past the quarter pole but had no rally. GENTLEMAN CHARLIE chased the winner from outside going
three then two wide on the turn, dropped back and faded, was not persevered with through the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
CHIKARA settled on the outside, dropped from four to three wide while gaining early on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead into
upper stretch then quickly kicked clear and drew away under a solid hand ride to win ridden out. EVERY SINGLE DAY was urged along off the pace,
inherited the advantage in the two path when the leading pair both got out bad on the turn, was headed by the winner into upper stretch and proved no
match while just able to hold the place. MISS JAMIE showed good speed and set the pace, lugged out six wide early on the turn, lost the advantage shortly
thereafter, dropped to the five path outside the quarter-pole and just missed the place while clear for the show. NODOUBTABOUTHER was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, raced on the outside under restraint, dropped from four to three wide early on the turn then moved to the two path near the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. TWINS PLUS A DOT was hustled from the start then settled off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then brushed with a foe and failed to respond. QUEEN OF CARNIVAL settled off the pace,
was roused while two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then brushed with a foe and was no factor. ALWAYS GRACE settled
under some urging, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SURPRISE ARRIVAL tracked the pace on the outside,
bolted to the outside fence on the turn and faltered then was not urged in the stretch but walked off. (Rail at 27 Feet) FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS

Footnotes
RAIN DROP KID exchanged a light bump at the start, raced in behind rivals two to three wide into the turn, angled sharply six deep leaving that bend, put to
urging in upper stretch and took over just past the three-sixteenths, drove clear by the furlong grounds and held safe. DRUNKEN FRIDAYS broke just a hair
slowly and was unhurried in the early going, saved ground advancing on the turn, waited about a sixteenth of a mile in upper stretch then found move at the
eighth pole and was asked for run, responded by gaining on the leader but was too late to reach that one. DAY was reluctant to load, broke open the gate,
was urged at the break, raced in behind the leaders on the inside then moving out a path on the turn, came out three wide past the quarter pole and ran on
while just getting show honors. TWIST OFF was lacking early speed, raced outside foes six wide into the turn, eased back and shifted in five then four deep
the remainder of that bend before coming out in upper stretch and ran on late. GREELEY CAN WIN bumped with the outside rival at the start but recovered
quickly to move forward at the set the pace, raced inside on the turn drift out a bit coming into the stretch then corrected to race just off the rail in upper
stretch, was collared at that juncture and weakened thereafter. LAURIANO chased from between rivals into the turn going four wide on that bend, came out
five wide past the quarter pole, was within striking distance but faltered past the furlong marker and faded. TIME ON TARGET chased from outside five wide
on the turn, came out seven wide into upper stretch and was empty then faded. TIME TO STROLL chased the pacesetter from outside three wide on the
turn coming four wide past the quarter pole and came up empty.

back, moved closer while five wide for most of the far turn, shifted six wide late on that bend then was asked, rallied eight wide into the stretch, closed
strongly under a left-handed whip, took the lead into the final furlong then edged clear under steady urging. FOXGLOVE went to the front, set the clear pace
in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and was
outfinished while clear for the place. CARIBBEAN KITTEN went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, raced four wide on the
far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, drifted in after turning into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. ILLUSIONISTA
saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the front, was asked while inside on the far turn and came up empty. POLARCENTS went four wide on the
first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was roused while four then five wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
THREEWICKEDWISHES went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths, came further out in the final furlong and failed to threaten. SENSE OF SELF broke out at the start, settled on
the inside, was urged along on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, came further out in the final furlong and was no factor. SKIPTEASE went three to
four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and retreated. MALARTACH
broke a bit slow then bumped with a foe and was taken up some, darted to the rail early, raced in the two path on the first turn, lagged well behind, went
three wide on the far turn and was well back throughout. TAP YOUR FRONT broke in and a bit awkwardly, saved ground on the turns and showed little.

Footnotes
OVERZEALOUS raced three wide and between runners into the first turn continuing three to four deep on that bend but just outside a foe racing off the
leading trio, moved in a bit up the backstretch going two to three deep on the far turn and edging a bit closer late on that bend, moved in by the top of the
stretch but lacked room in behind rivals so altered out nearing the three-sixteenths, took aim and the lead at the sixteenth pole then edged away. BLUE
STEEL was floated outside two rivals four then five wide on the first turn being carried out a further path late on that bend before the trio moved back in early
in the run up the backstretch, stalked before moving up to force the issue past the five-eighths, continued to press three deep on the far turn taking a narrow
lead just past the quarter pole, put away the inside rival but was overtaken on the outside by the aforementioned and was second best. GOTTA GO
exchanged a brush at the break, set the pace into the first turn racing well off the fence first in the two then three path on that bend floating out a further path
leaving before moving back in nearer the rail, faced pressure about midway up the backstretch and was hounded by an outside foe racing just off the rail
through the far turn, overtaken by that rival and fought on till the furlong marker then weakened some. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO was caught outside foes four
to five wide on the first turn, dropped back to trail racing off the rail, continued in the four path on the far turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch and needed
more late. SENOR FRIDAY exchanged a brush at the start, raced inside on then just off the rail in the early going through the first turn, continued toward the
rear just off the fence through the far turn, moved out two paths in upper stretch and ran on. CEE R BEE raced three to four wide and between runners on
the first turn, eased back heading up the backstretch and switched out nearing the half-mile marker to stalk from outside in about the four path into the far
turn, came up empty in the stretch.

MY FIRST GUITAR bumped lightly with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled near the back on the outside, was roused while four then
five wide on the far turn, swung nine wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed whip and closed strongly to get up late. LUCKY ANDY went
three then four wide on the first turn, moved up under restraint with five furlongs to run, ranged up in the four path on the far turn, made a bid passing the
five-sixteenths, was carried six wide at the quarter-pole, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, led until the final three to four strides but was denied
while able to get the place. KING CAKE bumped lightly with a foe at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, advanced five wide
while asked on the far turn, made an outside bid in the seven path into upper stretch, battled outside of three foes into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished while just able to get the show. JUS DREAM BIG went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three
path nearing the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage while under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and was also outfinished then just
missed the show. ROYAL ROCKET was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, moved
closer midway down the backstretch, was asked while four wide on the far turn, came eight wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. FIRE LAKE
went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace off the rail on the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead coming to the
five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and weakened. LOVE CONQUERS stumbled at the start and spotted the front a couple of
lengths, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while dropping from the two path to the rail on the far
turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SAND PIT ROAD saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along while moving
from three to five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, dropped in near the three-sixteenths and was no factor. MUCH CLASS saved ground
on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and
failed to respond. B RASEN went four then three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, dropped back

TWO DATE prompted the pace on the inside, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths, moved clear along the rail with three furlongs to run, hugged the
fence into upper stretch, widened while skimming the rail into the final sixteenth, was kept to task into the final seventy yards then wrapped up significantly
nearing the wire while much the best. EL HOMBRE was hard held while three wide on the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, continued under a
tight hold on the outside, moved closer while four then five wide still under restraint on the far turn, was finally let out inside the five-sixteenths, passed foes
six wide into upper stretch, drifted in nearing the furlong marker and safely secured the place. I DON'T FLY COACH went three wide on the first turn, settled
off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip and weakened while clearly best of the rest. HISTORY
EARNED went around the first turn in the seven path, settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased five wide on the far turn and
capitulated. IZZY B WINN was hustled from the start, raced in the five path on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the
backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered. SHAQ JACK rounded the first turn in the six path, tracked
the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the far turn and retreated. SHOESFROMTHEGITGO was hustled from the start, traveled around the first
turn in the two path, checked early on the backstretch, settled near the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and also faltered. HALOSTAR
smashed through the front of the gate prior to the start, was brought back around and reloaded, went to the front, stayed out in the five path on the first turn,
set the pace, lost the lead near the seven-sixteenths and stopped.
