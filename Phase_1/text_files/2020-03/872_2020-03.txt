Footnotes
AUCTION FEVER settled behind the pace while saving ground, moved a bit closer while continuing along the inside late second turn, moved out, brushed
slightly entering the stretch, set down, engaged the leader with less than a furlong remaining and wore that foe down under firm handling. HENNY FLY
broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the second turn, briefly clear again
into the lane, responded when challenged midstretch and proved stubborn until late. FIRST EMPRESS five wide when off the pace through much of the first
turn, moved into contention with a four wide advance in the second bend, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. SIRENIC back off the pace and the
inside, angled out to be five wide turning for home, lacked a serious closing kick. COMPETITIVE FIRE last to leave, raced well back early, moved closer
while five wide into the far turn, improved through the bend and also was found lacking in the drive. AGAVE QUEEN within striking distance while four wide
through much of the opening half mile, had little left for the drive. MANDY prompted the pace off the inside, gave way in the second turn. MISS
FIRECRACKER was finished before a half.

Footnotes
GOLD BACKED balked at loading, last to leave, raced four wide into the first turn, continued well back, rallied three wide out of the final turn, finished with
good energy to be up in time. DARREN'S FORTUNE settled off the pace in the three path, continued off the inside when advancing on the leader far turn,
took over, was well clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. OCTOBER SKY lacked speed, advanced while saving ground into the lane,
no match for the top two, finished up best of the rest. CONSUMERCONFIDENCE closest to the leader off the inside, bid second turn, had little left for the
drive. SUSPICIOUS EYES devoid of early foot, worked way out to four wide when moving closer in the second turn, continued to improve position stretch.
POWER SONG reluctant to load, broke well, clear early, set a glib pace while well in front the middle half, weakened when confronted for the drive.
COLOMBARD raced in the main body toward the inside, had nothing for the drive. MYSTIC TIGER was finished after four furlongs. RICKHOUSE settled in
mid pack just off the inside early, saved ground into the second bend, stopped.

DENA'S BOLD MOVE lacked speed inside, continued to save ground turn, advanced up the inside to challenge inside the furlong marker, kicked clear.
LAURA BELLE dueled up front while racing off the inside, continued to alternate up front through the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear past the
furlong marker, could not contain the winner. SAILAWAY AND HIDE in the second flight early off the inside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, some
late gain. SING A SONG TOO broke sharp, soon cleared to the inside, dueled into and through the turn and began to falter. WILL B LATE in the main body
off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, went evenly through the lane. ELUSIVE SECRET off a step slow, raced well back and outside, angled four
wide late in the turn, improved position with some mild interest. BONITA'S GOLD made little impact while racing inside. HALF SCOUT tired while racing
three wide. BANKER NITA failed to menace while racing off the inside. PRINCESS SIMONE lacked speed, four out to five wide late in the turn, lacked a
closing response. SHADYNGRAY broke back, was never close. FIVE RIVERS chased the early leaders, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
PARADE FIELD off a step slow, pulled early while well back, saved some ground into the far turn, split foes midway on that bend, steered widest entering
the stretch, finished with good resolve to be up in time. HITCH void of speed, raced outside, five wide move to challenge turning for home, shook clear,
nipped in the final yards. LIGHTHAWK broke alertly, showed the way early inside, relinquished the advantage before a half, pressed into the far turn, rebid
between rivals exiting the final turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, narrowly saved the show. DEFENDER lacked early foot, came four wide
out of the final turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to be gaining for the show. LIONITE forwardly placed behind the two early leaders inside, fell
back the middle half, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response after steered out to the three path. MISSISSIPPI four wide when off the pace into
the first turn, continued outside, moved closer while once again in the four path into the far turn, flattened out for the drive. COSMOLOGIST back off the
pace while off the inside, failed to muster a response in the stretch. CARTE BLANCHE in mid pack along the inside, saved ground to no avail. DON'T
FORGET pressed the issue early, took over before a half, stopped when headed turning for home.

rivals nearing midstretch, kicked clear late under steady handling. HINTON forwardly placed toward the inside, rail bid into the far turn, clear midway on the
far turn, proved no match for the winner when confronted by that one nearing the furlong grounds, clearly second best. D'URBAN PARK broke alertly, set
the pace toward the inside, allowed the runner up the inside into the far turn, headed, offered some resistance through the final bend, proved no match for
the top pair in the drive, saved the show. CANDY MY BOY settled off the pace and the inside, three wide most of the way, finished up evenly to miss the
show. ROAR OF THE LION last away, trailed for five furlongs, improved position without posing a serious threat. DREAMER'S POINT five wide into the first
turn, failed to menace while racing outside. OPPORTUNISTIC chased the leader off the inside, a bit rank into the far turn, gave way for the stretch.
TIZPURE was finished after four furlongs.

Footnotes
ARRIVAL unhurried early inside, angled out to be four wide when advancing into contention late in the final turn, took over, drove clear. MALIBU PRO never
far back, raced three wide in stalking the leaders up the backstretch, bid, led, no match for the winner late. HAWAAKOM off step slow, asked along in the
two path far turn, could do little with the top two through the lane, fully extended to earn the show. OPERATION STEVIE fractious in the gate, raced well
back, moved out for the drive, finished willingly while too late for the show. GIGGING went one paced toward the inside. MINEYEROWNMALONE closest to
the early leader, headed that one into the far turn, gave way in turn when challenged soon after. NICKY NUMBERS broke alertly, got clear early, showed
the way up the backstretch, stopped when headed into the far turn.

Footnotes
MIA MISCHIEF raced off the early pace, in the two path into the turn, in some traffic late in the bend, brush, split foes, dueled, drove clear. SHANGHAI
TARIFF broke sharp, dueled off the inside, disposed of that rival late in the bend to garner a briefly larger advantage, was joined from the outside by the
winner into the stretch, dueled with that one until a furlong remained, no match late, clearly second best. ESTILO FEMENINO broke with the field, fell back
soon after, asked along while five wide into the lane, raced widest in the drive, displayed some late interest to be rapidly getting to the runner up late. ISTAN
COUNCIL last away, trailed, improved position while racing toward the inside. HOTSHOT ANNA within striking distance outside, raced four wide through the
turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. RAINTREE STARLET forwardly placed out in the strip, moved closer three wide in the turn,
brief bid, gave way in the drive. MAYBE WICKED with the early pace along the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S MAP away in good order, set the pace inside, turned back a bid turning for home, clear past the furlong marker and maintained daylight to the
wire under steady handling. ON D'ORO four wide in the first turn when off the pace, advanced three wide, lodged a brief bid outside the winner turning for
home, could not match strides with the winner late, held sway for the place. AZTEC EMPIRE prompted the pace off the inside, roused for the drive, slowly
getting to the runner up late. COPPER KING within striking distance inside, moved slightly closer in some traffic second turn, went evenly in the drive.
LOOKIN HIGH in the second flight off the inside, asked along in the far turn, moved slightly closer midway on that bend, lacked a further response.
SECULAR STAGNATION off the rail and the pace, three wide onto the backstretch, continued out in the strip, also lacked a closing kick. BAKER'S MAN off
a bit slow, void of speed, trailed, improved slightly while never dangerous. BARINGER SPRING washy, pressured the pace off the rail, gave way.
UNIMAGINABLE U off a step slow, remained always back. SOUTHERN PHANTOM broke out, lacked speed despite being asked for some run early,
showed little the rest of the way while continuing inside.
