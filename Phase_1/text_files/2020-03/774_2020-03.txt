R SWEET EXCHANGE tracked the first flight from out of striking distance while angling inwards in the opening stages, shifted three wide racing into upper
stretch and responded to firm left handed encouragement to prevail in time. ALLURING APPROVAL was urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the
outset into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch to gain a narrow advantage late but was collared nearing the wire. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE broke
inwards bumping J P'S GIA, was righted, then urged inside a rival disputing the pace, dueled into the stretch in a prolonged skirmish then yielded late. FUN
AND GAMES tracked the leaders between foes in the opening stages, shifted four wide racing into the lane and continued with an even effort. J P'S GIA,
bumped at the start, settled last along the inside and never gained contention. KONZA KHROME tracked the leaders outside foes racing to the turn and
faded early.

Footnotes
SUDDEN LIGHT, unhurried outside foes tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance to the backstretch, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch
and produced a steady late response to wear down MISS WROTE to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm handling. The latter sprinted clear of her
rivals while getting a out bit racing to the first turn, held sway on a commanding margin and lost momentum in late stages while switching leads several
times in late stages while holding for second. TWO STEP BEAT settled between foes off the second flight, angled out four wide entering the lane and
continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance leading
the second flight on a narrow margin, continued along the inside to bid inside the pacesetter in late stages but was outkicked for a share. ALEXACRAT was
rated off the second flight along the inside and continued evenly into the stretch. GET BACK HOME, pulling between foes against light rating tracking the
pacesetter as part of the second flight to the far turn, faded into the stretch. UNITEDTORUN, reserved near the inside, never gained contention. ENGLISH
TOFFE ROSE proved no factor.

rivals in late stages. BOLTER was a brief factor between foes in second flight and faded into the stretch. ARMY COLONEL, urged between foes disputing
the pace, gave way after a half. WANNA WOW YOU broke slowly and never menaced. NO LOOK BACK dropped out early.

ANOTHER TIME tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch to wrest the advantage under
firm encouragement and was taken in hand approaching the wire. CLASSY WOMAN tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second flight,
switched out racing into the far turn to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but was outkicked. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER sped to the lead, dictated the
pace on a comfortable advantage to the far turn, briefly resisted the top pair but weakened late. BARREL OF DESTINY, reserved along the inside to the
backstretch, continued evenly into the stretch. KEEPER REAL tracked off the second flight in the opening stages, shifted out racing into the far turn but
lacked the needed late response. CHILLED MILK settled last early and never gained contention. CRY UNCLE, urged to a forward placing tracking the
pacesetter, emptied out racing into the far turn.

FASHION FRAME, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, switched outside that foe racing into the far turn while continuing with a
steady bid, wrested command racing into upper stretch and drew well clear under pressure. CHICA DIFISEL tracked the leaders three deep in second flight
and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. RENEESINHEAVEN broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace into the backstretch,
briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave out leaving midstretch. BORN TO GROOVE tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the first turn,
angled in to race as part of the second flight to the far turn but had no closing bid. SWEET LEAF settled between foes dropping off the second flight and
never seriously menaced while gaining some position late. SHARON'S LAW, caught four wide between foes racing through the first turn, tracked off the
second flight to the far turn in that path and faded into the lane. POSEIDONS HEIR was a brief factor between rivals racing as part of the second flight but
gave way racing through the far turn. GLOBALPRINCESSCOCO, caught five wide racing through the first turn, dropped out early. LA PROMESA soon
retreated.

LONG BLADE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn, then came under firm encouragement
to go clear in the final furlong. CUESTION DE TIEMPO angled to the rail in early stages tracking off the first flight, saved ground through the turn, shifted out
three wide midstretch and prevailed for the place honors. FOX ROX broke in the air losing position to the field, angled to the inside tracking off the second
flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued to make steady late progress inside foes to gain position to the end. KITCHEN FIRE, urged along the rail
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening quarter, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way. SAUCY DON tracked the leaders
outside rivals in second flight, shifted four wide racing into the lane and continued with an even effort. PEMAQUID PETE vied for the lead briefly between
foes but gave way early.

Footnotes
MR LIGHTNING BOY broke a bit awkwardly, angled in while being prompted to a position just off the first flight racing through the backstretch, split foes
entering the turn while being prompted to advance, continued in a protracted skirmish between foes to upper stretch but edged forward in time under firm
handling. TOTAL DISTRACTION tracked just off the first flight in the opening quarter, steadily advanced four wide on the turn to challenge for command in
that path nearing upper stretch and continued in a prolonged drive to prevail for second nearing the wire. MIGHTY GHOST was urged inside foes disputing
the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, then grudgingly resisted the top pair to late stages. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE ducked in at the start, then
was switched outside foes while being righted, was prompted to position tracking just off the first flight racing four wide into the turn, shifted five wide
entering the lane and continued with an effort to gain some position. SMOKY BLUES attended a rival's pace in the opening quarter, pressed the issue three
deep between foes racing through the turn and gave way. NORTHERN, climbing a bit in the opening stages, angled to the rail but never gained contention.
MOOJI MOO JR. tracked off the first flight three wide racing into the turn and gave way. ANDREW THE BULL settled last and proved no threat.

Footnotes
LEGACY PARK broke readily to gain the advantage along the inside just after the start, switched outside a rival racing to the backstretch attending the pace
under light rating, pressed the issue racing into the far turn to gain a clear advantage and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement.
MY MASTERPIECE angled inwards to track just off the first flight between foes racing into the first turn, shifted three deep on the backstretch, was
prompted to advance on the pacesetter racing into the far turn and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors late. NO SNIVELING, urged
to the lead while angling to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, disputed the issue inside a rival into the backstretch, was eased off the pace entering the
far turn, then was prompted to make a second effort inside foes late to narrowly prevail for a share. AGUAS COLORADAS, reserved off the second flight
outside foes in the opening half, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the stretch and was just outkicked for a share. UNABRIDGED (IRE) tracked
the pace inside rivals in second flight, shifted out entering the stretch and continued evenly between foes to late stages. SWEET MOOCHIE was rated off
the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out three deep in the lane but had no rally. WEST HORIZEN settled between foes racing to
the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. LADY BREANNA, fractious in the gate, hopped at the start and dropped out early.
FREAKIN' ME OUT tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch and faded after a half.
