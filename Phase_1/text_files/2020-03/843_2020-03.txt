Footnotes
CAN'T SAY NO broke alertly, set a pressured pace from inside, gradually drifted out leaving the bend and entering the stretch, was all out between horses
in the lane and held on. FOUR LEFT FEET steadily progressed from inside, began to drift out deep stretch and was too late. GREAT SCAT hesitated at the
break, moved up quickly between rivals to press CAN'T SAY NO from just outside, was gradually carried out by the latter leaving the turn and into the
stretch and slowly yielded the last furlong. HIDE THE GREEN raced forwardly not far off the rail and lacked the extra needed for the drive. LEFT COAST
DREAMS angled in on the turn and had no late bid. CLASS WON faded from outside after two furlongs.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SECRET bumped at the break, quickly recovered to gain a clear lead while staying just off the inside, was challenged leaving the turn, floated
out entering the lane, all out through the stretch and held on. IMPERIAL TEMPLE broke inward, bumping WILDWOOD SECRET, chased from between
rivals, advanced along the rail on the turn, gradually closed the gap under a steady drive in the stretch, did not have enough late but proved easily second
best. HE'S RECKLESS forwardly placed inside, did not keep up between horses on the bend but passed inside tired ones to gain third late. LINE OF
DENHAMS pressed WILDWOOD SECRET from just outside but flattened out for the stretch run. BOB'S BRASS DANCER in contention early between
horses, began to tire three wide on the bend. EL PRINCIPE I B hesitated at the break, was a factor from outside on the backstretch but gave way four wide
after two furlongs.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE vied for the lead from inside, drifted out at the top of the lane, moved clear inside the last furlong and was drifted out in the waning yards.
DEAUVILLE MIST advanced from outside to vie for the lead four wide on the bend, fanned out some further entering the stretch and lacked the extra
needed in the late going. GOOD WISHES hustled along from the start, saved ground taking the turn, loomed a serious threat midstretch but leveled off
instead. CAROL'S A CASE forwardly placed from outside, was four wide on the bend, bumped several times with PRECIOUS KOWGIRL leaving the quarter
pole, fanned out into the lane and found best stride too late. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES displayed early speed between horses but weakened for the drive.
LION'S WAGER progressed between rivals on the turn, angled out some leaving the quarter pole, jostled briefly with PRECIOUS KOWGIRL and flattened
out through the lane. PRECIOUS KOWGIRL in contention between horses early, failed to keep up on the turn, was caught in tight quarters leaving the
quarter pole, jostled between rivals and also faded. MARNATE also displayed early speed between rivals but gave way the last quarter mile.

Footnotes
MY WIFE IS BOSS shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead three wide on the bend, was challenged again upper stretch, but shook free with a
sixteenth left. PAT'S PRADO pressed from inside, went for the lead upper stretch but did not have enough left inside the last eighth. MACBU progressed
from along the rail, angled outside MY WIFE IS BOSS midstretch then drifted out in the waning yards. LOGI in contention early, was just off the inside on
the bend then ran evenly through the lane. PRANCIPANTS without early speed, came four wide into the stretch, gained a striking position but leveled off
late. SHESAMINESHAFTBABE chased from between horses, made her bid upper stretch to reach contention but could not sustain her bid. ROMANTIC
ATTACK was soon well back, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the lane and improved position some under a hand ride. FILLY FROM ILLY
displayed early speed between rivals but began to tire before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S STORM advanced from inside on the turn, split rivals with a furlong to go and was driven clear. ENGLISH broke inward, crowding those inside
her, chased from between rivals, moved to the rail leaving the bend, altered out for a clear path midstretch, rallied belatedly but caught LIPLINER for
second. LIPLINER soon had the lead, showed the way from inside, drifted out leaving the bend and wore down inside the last furlong. MARYS LAST SONG
pressed LIPLINER from just outside, was carried out by the latter entering the stretch and gradually yielded. TAP'S LULLABY squeezed back at the start,
trailed from inside, swung to the outside for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. COMMANDING MIDAS forwardly placed outside MARYS
LAST SONG, also weakened for the drive. SIMPLY FAST chased from outside, came five wide into the lane and was closing the gap deep stretch. LORI'S
LEGACY well placed from inside, loomed a serious threat along the rail midstretch but could not sustain her bid. VERY FRIENDLY was a factor between
horses to the turn then began to fade. PRETTY GITA bumped at the start, was never a factor.

Footnotes
TIO CHUY showed the way just off the inside while in hand, was put to a drive in the lane and held on under steady handling. TOCCETIVE JAC without
early speed, picked up his pace along the rail on the bend, closed well but was too late. MUSIAL also without early speed, advanced between rivals on the
turn, came five wide into the lane, made a strong move but also came up short. PATCH'S LUGH in contention early, had the rail on the turn, angled out
upper stretch, drifted out inside the last furlong, bumped GUARD YOUR GRILL, closed on the weakening leader in the late going but also was too late.
GUARD YOUR GRILL prominent from outside, floated out to path four entering the stretch, was bumped inside the final eighth and began to wear down in
the waning yards. RUDY'S BOY chased in midpack, was just off the inside on the bend and failed to have a significant stretch bid. HOME IT TIZ void of
speed, though hustled along, was between rivals on the turn, fanned to the outside for the stretch run and failed to rally. HE'S THUNDER chased from
outside, was widest through the turn and empty for the drive. READY'S MISSION pressed from inside, did not keep up leaving the turn, angled out for the
stretch run and gave way.

Footnotes
DARLIN ROSIE forwardly placed inside, was steadied some when her path was taken into the bend, came off the rail, moved out three wide at the top of the
lane, was all out under a steady drive and got the nod at the wire for the win. GHOST TRAIN was soon clear of the rest, took the rail into the turn, was
challenged from outside soon after, fought gamely in the stretch but had to settle for second best. MY FOUROONE KPLAN pressed from outside, dueled
two wide through the stretch and grudgingly yielded through the waning yards. JUKEBOX MONEY progressed from inside on the turn, gained a striking
position in the lane but leveled off the last furlong. KALISPELL forwardly placed between horses, was crowded briefly with a half mile to go, was three then
four wide taking the bend and ran evenly through the stretch. LONG LEGGED LINDA was away slowly, came widest into the stretch and improved position
without threatening. W W PUT AND TAKE was steadied behind traffic shortly after the start, advanced four wide on the turn and failed to have a significant
stretch bid. LADY FURBEIN was urged along but showed little. ECO STAR in contention early, gave way two wide on the turn. The rider of KALISPELL
lodged an objection alleging interference from MY FOUROONE KPLAN nearing the half mile marker. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that
objection.

Footnotes
STORMY PACIFIC rated from inside, angled out some as he commenced his bid on the turn, rallied three wide in the stretch and took over with a sixteenth
to go. MIAS MOONBEAM without early speed, though urged along, came into contention three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive, gradually
closed in, was too late but caught SUMMERDUCK for second. SUMMERDUCK contested the pace in tight quarters between horses, moved to the rail into
the stretch, drew clear but did not have enough left in the late going. DIAMOND MAXIMUS chased from outside, moved to the rail into the turn, came off the
rail soon after, swung out five wide for the drive and showed a willingness to run. COUSIN DARIO vied for the early lead outside SUMMERDUCK then
gradually wore down through the lane. KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF displayed early speed inside horses, did not keep up leaving the quarter pole, was
steadied briefly when his path was taken shortly thereafter then continued to yield. COOL AMBITION chased from outside and was never a factor. STUMP
chased from between horses, angled in on the bend, moved off the rail upper stretch and had no significant bid. K STREET failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SPONTANEITY rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was put to a drive in the lane, opened up on the field and proved
much the best. ELIZABETH'S FEVER pressed from inside, was outrun into the turn, came off the rail some with two furlongs left, lacked a serious bid under
urging in the lane but edged ahead for second through the waning yards. LADY WARRIOR in contention early, bid at the leader while three on the turn,
fanned out further entering the stretch, proved no match for SPONTANEITY and began to wear down in the late going. ARCTIC MUSIC contested the pace
between horses, did not stay with SPONTANEITY on the turn, took the rail at that point and lacked the extra needed for the stretch run. PINK FOR ME
progressed two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and showed late interest from between rivals. RULER RUNAWAY raced in contention
early from outside, did not keep up while losing ground through the turn but closed the gap on the second flight deep stretch. TOUR ON was a factor from
outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the bend then ran evenly through the late. ALLEY 'O MALLEY was never a factor in a ground-saving trip.
WADDLE showed little. DA MRS. steadily faded from outside.
