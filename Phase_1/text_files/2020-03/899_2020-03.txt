Footnotes
LONDON WEREWOLF brushed with TAYLORSINITIATION while in a bit tight between in opening stages and dropped back then moved to the outside and
raced off the early speed, swung into action entering top stretch, kicked by the field near the furlong grounds and finished going away. AWESOME ACTION
dueled for the lead at the outset while racing a path outside of BELLEVILLE SPRING, battled on around the turn, shook free top of the lane then failed to be
a match when the winner swept by. STARSHIP TAXI raced along the outside in the second flight at the half mile marker, roused forward four wide to race in
striking range near the quarter pole then churned on four to five wide through the lane. GUESS FIRST was void of early speed and lagged in the rear, saved
ground through early stages and around the turn then showed interest on the rail in stretch run and improved position. UNCLE GREGORY lacked speed
and raced two wide leaving the backstretch, moved into upper stretch three to four wide and improved position. WHY TRUST chased the pace positioned in
range while between foes going by the half mile marker, chased on around the turn then hit a wall of rivals top stretch, shifted out widest and rebid but
lacked the needed response for impact. TAYLORSINITIATION made contact with eventual winner in opening stages, chased on with response and hustled
along the inside around the turn then failed to sustain bid and gave way in the lane. DECIDER was forwardly positioned and remained in strong contention
while coaxed three wide near the quarter pole quarter pole then failed to sustain bid out of the turn and weakened. BELLEVILLE SPRING was away last
then rushed up along the inside to quickly contend for the lead, dueled inside of AWESOME ACTION through early stages and around the turn then tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
JUST FOR ONE DAY tracked outside the battling leaders for three furlongs, challenged outside SHARED LEGACY turning for home, dueled through the
last eighth of a mile and narrowly prevailed. SHARED LEGACY vied from the start outside BOSS ONTHE HORIZON, got the best of that dispute by upper
stretch, shifted to the rail and dug in continuing to fight on against the top one, and just missed. GROUNDBREAKING settled behind the leaders to the
stretch and offered a mild response when clear, going by a tired rival to pick up third. MAINE was no factor two to three wide. BOSS ONTHE HORIZON vied
inside SHARED LEGACY to upper stretch, and gave way. SEVEN CHANNELS broke slowly and trailed every step.

Footnotes
NOBLE HOPE was allowed to settle out of the gate, saved ground around the first turn then rated three to four wide off the pace, prompted on the far turn
and advanced to race off the top pair, roused two to three wide entering top stretch then took command from wide running duo, kept on gamely under
steady pressure and held firm. LOOKIN AT ROSES was unhurried and saved ground through early stages, prompted to pick up the pace around the far
turn, gained ground then shifted in to race two wide with a furlong left to run, produced a solid bid but could not get by the game winner. POSITIVE PHIL
tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, moved up to race in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, got carried out wide by SMELL OF ROSES entering
top stretch, remained a strong contender in the final furlong but lacked the needed surge to get by. SMELL OF ROSES emerged on top out of the gate and
angled to the inside, opened up to a clear advantage while under a slight restraint on the first turn, held a clear advantage down the backstretch then
challenged by POSITIVE PHIL around the far turn, drifted out turning for home then chased on evenly through the final furlong. DIRECT APPROACH was
allowed to settle through early stages then prompted three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out wider upper stretch then set down for the drive but failed
to kick on. OLE MOLE stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, hustled up along the inside into upper stretch then failed to sustain bid and gave way. ROAD
TO PEACE rated while saving ground through the backstretch, showed brief response when prompted near the three eighths pole then steadily weakened.

Footnotes
PLEASANT ORB stalked outside the leaders to the turn, challenged three wide past the five-sixteenths, dueled outside SNEER through the lane and took a
hard-fought decision. SNEER dueled inside ERV'S WENCH early, won that dispute after six furlongs, battled back inside PLEASANT ORB and was
stubborn to the end. SO DARN HOT raced four wide around the turn, and was up for the show while never a threat for anything more. NO BULL JACK hit
the left side of the gate and was off slow, advanced on the turn coming off the rail and going around a tiring EMMA ROSE, moved back inside and continued
on with a mild response for a share. ERV'S WENCH argued the pace outside SNEER for six furlongs, and weakened between that one and PLEASANT
ORB at the top of the stretch. GUARDED SECRET stayed close for the first half-mile, and dropped back around the turn under pressure. KISS THEORY
stayed close through the run up the backstretch, and gave way. EMMA ROSE was finished after six furlongs, and eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
DOMINATE THEMOMENT was well positioned racing three wide off the top two leaders through early stages, moved up to challenge for the lead near the
quarter pole, shook free from FLASH PASS near the furlong marker then stayed sharp and finished going away. FLASH PASS raced two wide in aim for the
lead on the first turn, remained forwardly placed and stalked the leader to the far turn, advanced to duel between rivals at the quarter pole, battled on with
DOMINATE THEMOMENT top of the lane then could not match with winner past the furlong marker. KING OF RANCH leaned out and bumped with foe at
the start then angled inside to save ground, rated not too far off the early pace then launched a bid near the quarter pole, roused five wide into the lane,
continued a steady effort but lacked the needed surge for serious impact. HANDSOME LIL DEVIL bumped with foe at the start then settled through early
stages, hustled up around the far turn, was ridden along six wide entering the lane then chased on evenly. AT THE BEACH held a slim lead around the first
turn then took a length lead on top and set the pace down the backstretch, fought back when challenged and vied inside a duo at the quarter pole then tired
in the drive. HOLY MUCHACHO was unhurried racing two to three wide through early stages, prompted to pick up the pace on the far turn then hustled
along three to four wide in stretch run and lacked a needed rally. HARPER GO LUCKY raced in the back, saved ground throughout and failed to respond
when called upon.

Footnotes
MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT was unhurried toward the inside for six furlongs, angled out for room pushing ADDISON out in front of TOURNESOL at the top of
the stretch, rallied past QUEEN FIELD from outside into the final furlong and held off SPECIAL LIASON to the wire. SPECIAL LIAISON steadied behind
TOURNESOL at the start, trailed to the top of the stretch near the two-path, shifted outside rallying through the furlong grounds and finished with good
energy. ADDISON went along in range from the outset, got pushed out in front of TOURNESOL by MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT at the top of the stretch and got
clipped behind, regrouped and finished willingly on the far outside. QUEEN FIELD led in the two-path through the first turn, moved inside rating along
through the middle stages, remained clear to mid stretch but folded up late. RISING BELLA saved ground reserved in easy striking range for six furlongs,
was boxed in along the rail turning for home and through most of the stretch, and was never set down in earnest. OMNIA prompted the pace outside
QUEEN FIELD to the stretch, and came up empty. TOURNESOL broke out in front of SPECIAL LIASON at the start, went along three to four wide to the
end of the far turn, clipped heels behind ADDISON at the top of the stretch and lost all chance winding up on the outside rail eased up. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED LAST FOR CAUSING
INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
CHARLIE THE GREEK raced three to four wide while ridden along to maintain a steady tempo through early stages, prompted four wide around the turn
then roused along the outside into the lane, advanced to race in aim nearing the furlong marker, forged ahead under pressure and finished clear. KYLE was
forwardly placed while three to four wide through early stages, roused two wide past the quarter pole then hustled along into stretch run, raced in aim for the
lead in upper stretch then failed to be a match when the winner kicked by but stayed on for place. JOE DI BAGGIO raced five wide off the early speed,
continued near the rear then roused five wide around the turn, raced wide and lost ground entering top stretch then continued a wide bid and captured
show. HE IZ GONE raced in range then chased three wide around the turn, continued a bid in close range top of the lane, lacked a clear path near the
furlong marker, shift wider, stayed on and got edged late for show. UNPUBLISHED came out a couple paths out of the gate and quickly took command,
continued to hold clear around the turn, fought back near the eighth pole then was all out and gave way. HE'S SMOKIN HOT raced in the back and saved
ground down the backstretch, angled out and roused into the lane but failed to move on. MORE THAN STRIKING lost footing then steadied when
UNPUBLISHED came over strides out of the gate, got away last then quickly advanced up the rail to race in contention, chased to the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
DYNA PASSER saved ground in striking range to the third turn, moved outside FRITZI being given her cue approaching the quarter-pole, reached even
terms into the stretch, and prevailed after a long drive. FRITZI crossed over intent on the lead after the break, rated along inside slowing things down
through an easy six furlongs, responded when hooked by DYNA PASSER turning for home, battled to deep stretch and saved the place. SHREWDNESS
(GB) had the two-path near the back for the first mile or so, came four wide off the far turn, and was edging closer outside the top two at the finish. ON THE
TOWN went along in the middle of the field for a mile, had a clear shot in the three-path at the top of the lane, but did not have enough.
WHATDOESASHARKSAY hugged the rail throughout, and was not a threat with an even finish. WITH HERSELF (IRE) was slow into stride and far back for
a half-mile, took closer order to the third turn, and gained only mildly. BO'S IMAGE was reluctant to load, steadied slightly as FRITZI came over after the
start, prompted the pace outside the latter for nearly 10 furlongs, and was overrun from both sides. INDICIA was slow early, and failed to respond.

Footnotes
THE QUEENS JULES stalked the leader down the backstretch, advanced two wide and took a slim lead at the quarter pole, widened to clear advantage
then kept to task under steady encouragement. MR CHAPLIN was unhurried along the outside then shifted inside late backstretch, roused along the inside
around the far turn, moved up closer then stayed on response along the inside then two wide and produced a solid finish. DEXTER ROAD tracked the pace
along the inside, hustled up two wide around the far turn then churned on three wide through the lane for a share. TELL ME A STORY settled off the pace,
saved ground then shifted out, raced wide into the lane and had a mild improve. TIP SHEET rated not too far off the early pace while positioned along the
outside, headed in pursuit around the far turn, raced in strong contention for a placing the gave way in the final furlong. JAMAICAN quickly cleared on top
and set the pace to the far turn, got collared for the lead by the winner at the quarter pole then tired in the drive. SUMMER SPICE was reserved in the back,
raced three to four wide and failed to move on when called upon. MANHATTAN PROJECT raced off the pace and widest, shifted inside and saved ground
