Footnotes
SHAKEM N BREAKEM broke a bit slowly, was settled last in the opening quarter, shifted out racing into the turn, steadily advanced on the leaders four wide
nearing upper stretch, and continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under firm right handed pressure. SIR HIGGINS tracked off the
first flight outside foes racing to the turn, steadily drew on terms with the leaders three deep nearing upper stretch, disputed the issue in a prolonged drive
while striking the front between calls but just missed. KALU, urged between foes, then inside rivals disputing the pace just off the inside racing to the turn,
dispatched a rival racing into upper stretch, then continued inside the top pair in a prolonged drive disputing the issue to the wire while just outnodded.
RELISHMENT, in touch with the first flight along the inside in the opening furlong, was eased off the pace to track those rivals along the inside, was
prompted to lodge a brief bid along the rail entering upper stretch but soon flattened out. ROCK THE PARK joined the pace outside foes soon after the start,
pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way entering upper stretch. INDIAN BUZZ tracked off the first flight inside foes but retreated
early.

Footnotes
DREAMING DIAMONDS, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out
three deep nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, took over nearing midstretch and went well clear under some right handed pressure.
MZ. FOO DO tracked the leaders outside foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with
interest to edge a rival for the place honors in time. SONOMA STORM tracked the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing into the turn,
angled inside the leaders entering the stretch but had no closing bid. RATTLESNAKEROSE joined the pace outside foes soon after the break, pressed the
pace on the turn to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner and gave way late. ADONAI LOVE settled last while angling
inside and failed to menace. DRINKS ON MAGGIE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch
and was gathered up in the closing stages.

Footnotes
CLEVER TALE tracked the first flight from just out of striking distance under light rating near the inside in the opening quarter, shifted three deep on the turn
advancing on the leaders on her own courage, was prompted to take charge racing into upper stretch and drew away from her rivals while never being
asked for her best. STACK SHACK bobbled at the start, angled to the inside, was prompted to make steady progress between foes racing into the stretch
and narrowly prevailed for the place honors between rivals on the wire. LAVALIER ducked out a bit at the start, settled last racing to the turn, angled out four
wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain position while just missing for second. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, urged to terms prompting a rival's
pace in the opening quarter, pressed the issue into the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, proved no match when confronted by the winner and
gave way nearing midstretch. FLAMING INDY, urged along the inside disputing the pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. LOVE MY SUNSHINE was settled out of striking distance, angled to the inside nearing the turn and soon dropped out.

EPIC DRAMA broke readily to gain terms with the first flight, attended the pace three deep under light rating in the opening quarter, moved to wrest the
advantage nearing upper stretch, angled to the inside entering the lane and held sway on a clear margin under firm left handed encouragement. MR.
KISSES, bumped soundly while being forced inwards at the break, shifted to the inside while being prompted to regain position racing through the
backstretch, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance on the leader but couldn't gain even terms with that foe. I'M IN A
HURRY was urged inside foes from the outset disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, couldn't match the winner after a half and gave way into the
stretch. GREELEY'S FAREWELL tracked off the first flight five wide in the opening stages, continued four wide on the turn to upper stretch but had no
closing response. AMERICANO tracked the leaders three wide between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. BACK PAGE, restless in
the gate, broke through the stall doors before the start, ducked inwards at the break bumping I'M A COOL MAN, was righted to briefly prompt the pace
between foes but emptied out early. I'M A COOL MAN at the start while forced into MR. KISSES, was righted to make brief pursuit between foes but
dropped out early.

Footnotes
ON BASE tracked just off the first flight along the inside under light rating racing to the first turn, shifted out nearing the backstretch to track the leaders
between foes, was held up momentarily in close quarters racing past the five furlong marker, was prompted to advance from between foes racing three
deep into the far turn, continued with a steady bid in that path racing into the stretch then took over firm hand urging and some right hand pressure.
SUNSATION, in touch with the leaders prompting the pace racing three deep early, attended the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue between
foes into the far turn to upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late but held well for the place honors. IT'S MANDATORY tracked off the second flight
outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to edge several rivals for a share nearing the wire.
CURLIN'S THRILL, off a step slowly, was settled along the rail, saved ground to upper stretch gradually gaining some position and was just outfinished for
third while racing in close quarters nearing the wire. TIZ ENVY, forwardly paced along the rail racing to the first turn, conceded the lead to track just off the
first flight inside foes racing to the far turn, altered course near midstretch when being prompted to advance but had no late kick. SULTANNES CROWN,
urged between foes prompting the pace to the first turn, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the backstretch, dueled inside
foes racing into the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. TWO RED, off slowly, angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, continued near the
inside to the far turn but had no closing bid. EASY WEEKEND settled near the inside early and never gained contention. LOVEDISC tracked just off the
leaders outside a rival, switched out racing to the backstretch to track the leaders three deep but was through after a half.

HANIEL, bumped, then shuffled out of tight quarters at the break, settled last to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn, was prompted to advance
while caught five wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but rallied smartly to the front to wrest the advantage
and kick clear in time under firm encouragement. LEGACY PARK, gained terms with the leader attending the pace under light rating in the opening five
furlongs, was prompted to bid for command racing into upper stretch, drifted out while being roused to resist the winner's bid but proved no match while
proving best of the others. PAINTED IMAGE ducked in at the start crossing the path of the eventual winner, was righted to track just off the leaders outside
a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep midway through the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide into the lane
and lacked the needed final kick. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY tracked off the second flight three deep in the opening half, was prompted to advance four wide
leaving the far turn, was fanned five wide between foes entering the lane and finished evenly late. ALYDARIUS, held up out of close quarters along the
inside in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, came around a tiring foe to bid inside the leaders in upper stretch
but soon flattened out. MY MASTERPIECE moved to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light reserve to the second bend,
was roused racing into the lane but quickly emptied out midstretch. GO YEOWOMEN tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn but
had no closing response. SWEET MOOCHIE settled along the rail racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. WHITEHEELGIRL tracked just off
the leaders along the inside under light rating racing to the far turn but came up empty nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
DANZO broke readily, angled in sharply gaining terms with a rival attending the pace under light rating racing through the backstretch, responded when
challenged by WHITE DRILL racing into upper stretch, shifted out under pressure but turned back that foe to go clear under firm right handed
encouragement. WHITE DRILL, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to stalk just off the first flight between foes, split rivals when presented an opening
to bid for command inside the eventual winner, dueled for command past midstretch but proved no match late. LARGE, held up just after the start, switched
outside foes while being prompted to gain terms with the second flight racing five wide on the backstretch, continued with a steady advance to challenge
four wide nearing upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the top pair entering the lane, swerved to the rail midstretch and faded in the closing stages. SIR
SWAYSALOT tracked the leaders three deep between in second flight, was prompted to advance nearing the lane but had no closing bid. BUC'S
INVESTMINT settled off the second flight along the inside, angled out four wide racing into the lane and improved position. CITY CAT tracked off the second
flight outside foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. INITFORTHELOVE proved no factor. SHACKLEFORD DANCER broke outwards bumping WHITE
DRILL, was righted track off the leaders inside foes to the turn but faded into the stretch. COMMANDER'S INTENT, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival
from the outset into the turn, emptied out after a half. ESOR bobbled at the break while losing position to the field and never gained contention.

Footnotes
WHERE'S OLIVER was settled between rivals dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued unhurried to the second bend, angled out
five wide in upper stretch gathering momentum and produced a steady late response to collar IMPLICATION in time under firm left handed encouragement.
The latter, reserved along the inside as part of the last flight racing to the first turn, switched out to race between foes on the backstretch, shifted out nearing
the far turn, responded with a sharp move when prompted to circle the field four wide racing through the far turn, went clear in upper stretch while shifting to
the inside, resisted the winner's bid but just failed to contain that foe. EMPIRICALLY tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, was
prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing into upper stretch, continued willingly between foes in that path to late stages but was outkicked by
the top pair. WINTER'S WONDER angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight, steadily gained position inside foes after a half, shifted out
racing into upper stretch to split foes three deep in late stages and continued with interest. CUZZN DOUG was rated off the second flight inside foes racing
to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and made some mild progress to late stages. O DANNY BOY, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter
outside a rival in the opening half, advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn but emptied out racing into the stretch. RIONERO angled inwards to
track inside, then between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, then emptied out nearing the lane. OPUS NORTH was settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. AMERICAN DRIVEN dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the far turn and gave way
once headed nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FINE SPIRIT was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced readily when given his cue to advance three deep on the leaders on the far turn,
was fanned four wide into upper stretch but took charge when roused right handed to go clear and was taken in hand once the issue was decided. PURRS
AGAIN tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening half, was prompted to advance three deep entering the far turn to challenge for command
nearing upper stretch, drifted out resisting the winner's bid racing into the lane but proved no match. OLD FORT settled outside foes in the last flight racing
to the backstretch, steadily gained position three deep racing into the far turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
PRIVILEGIO, off a bit slowly, was settled along the inside to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned five
nearing the lane but continued to improve position to the end. MIKE MIKE, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into
upper stretch. DISTINCTLY BREWED, held up in close quarters along the inside racing into the first turn, shifted out entering the second bend, briefly
awaited an opening midway through the turn, angled four wide in the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. DRAFTABLE, in
touch with the first flight prompting the issue leaving the chute, was taken up racing into the first turn to track those rivals along the inside and soon dropped
out. DONNERSBERG, three deep between foes in the first flight in the opening stages, was eased off the pace to track those foes in second flight but was
through after a half. TORRID ZONE, urged to terms with the first flight four wide leaving the chute, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to prompt the
pacesetter but emptied out early. GALLEON LIGHT switched off the inside racing to the backstretch and soon dropped out.
