Footnotes
MISSIONELLE stalked the pace four wide to the backstretch, eased in while settling, saved ground on the second turn then shifted off the rail for room in
mid stretch, rallied when set down and wore down STRATUS BIRD late. STRATUS BIRD set the pace off the rail for six furlongs, responded to mid stretch
then could not stall the winner while not threatened for second. TOP TIZZY pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was
weakening late. CHIEF BARBARA had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response.
SKEETER DAVIS was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the half, made a run while widest into the second turn to briefly loom a threat but was outrun
to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MAJOR KONG was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, was gaining then drifted in under right handed
urging but was straightened and prevailed. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE hustled to the front then dueled for the lead from the rail to the stretch, responded to
mid stretch but was bested by the winner. UNUSUALLY HANDSOME pressed the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch, responded to mid
stretch, had to check briefly at the sixteenth pole when MAJOR KONG drifted inward in front of him then was outfinished. MY LUCKY BID attended the pace
two wide to the second turn, responded to mid stretch then was outfinished in the late stages. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run
involving MAJOR KONG and UNUSUALLY HANDSOME and ruled that although MAJOR KONG did bother UNUSUALLY HANDSOME, that incident did not
cost UNUSUALLY HANDSOME a better placing and no change was warranted.

SADIE BLUEGRASS broke alertly and went right to the front, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then edged away to mid stretch and held under
steady urging. EMMA'S A BEAST was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, was no threat to the winner but finished steadily for second.
BABY HANG ON had no speed, was off the rail to mid turn then swung out four wide into the stretch but could not make an impact and missed second.
FLASHPROOF pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. EDDIE'S PRINCESS had no speed and saved
ground to no avail. POPULAR APPEAL tracked the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD HEAT had good speed, dueled inside of TRASH TALKIN CAT to the stretch, put that one away to mid stretch then held under steady urging.
BIG CHEDDAR stumbled at the start then bobbled two strides later, recovered but was outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, swung out for room
in upper stretch and closed ground willingly but too late. SEEKING REFUGE was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper
stretch and was making up ground belatedly. DYNAMIC DUO had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then made a bid to mid stretch but could not
sustain the late response. TRASH TALKIN CAT attended the pace outside the winner to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
INQUISITION trailed to the turn, was three wide then shifted out widest for the drive but lacked a closing response. CONTINENTAL UNION tracked the
leaders from the rail to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
LEA'S REWARD was used enough to establish the lead, set the pace in hand to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, turned back MOSCATO GIRL
in mid stretch and held on determinedly. NIGHT OF IDIOTS was outsprinted to the half, bid two then three wide to the stretch, angled out in upper stretch
and closed steadily. MOONLIGHT MYSTIQUE had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then was widest in the drive
and just missed the place. MOSCATO GIRL pressed the winner for six furlongs while two wide, tried to engage for the lead in mid stretch but was outkicked
and finished evenly. TIKI BAR LOGIC never far back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. RUN FOR A
MILLION tracked the pace to the backstretch, dropped back leaving the half and was never a serious threat. FANTASTIC SECRET had no speed, settled to
the half, was asked three then four wide on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.

TAP IT CHAMP was outsprinted to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, responded when set down, rallied between rivals and inched to the front in the
final strides. ELEGANT TANNER chased the pace to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, swung out widest for the drive and finished willingly to
the line. CROSS CREEK attended the pace three wide to the stretch, responded to inch away to mid stretch then could not stall the top two. JULIUS
pressed the pace in the opening quarter, was outkicked and shifted off the rail mid turn, rallied to mid stretch to loom a threat, kept on to the line but was
outfinished. DETANGLER had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then closed inside to loom a factor in mid stretch but finished evenly in the final
sixteenth. OWNING had no speed, was three wide to the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive. SMOKIN BLACKJACK hustled to contest the
pace two wide to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR never far back to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, took over nearing mid stretch and edged away driving. SEIZETHEDAY
REXY was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER stalked the pace from the rail to
the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. TEMPLE OF SOL had no speed, was fanned out to the four path on the turn and could not offer
the needed response. BIGFOOT CITY lagged to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch, swung out for the drive but did not threaten. AUBURN
STREAK was quickest of these, set the pace from the rail to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. NEXT REVOLT was outsprinted to the turn then lugged
out to five or six path to the stretch and gave way. BALIUS hustled to press the pace two wide to the turn, was outrun to the stretch and gave out.
