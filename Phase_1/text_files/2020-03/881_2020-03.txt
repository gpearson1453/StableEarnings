Footnotes
SYDSTER was fractious in the gate then asked from the start, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two to three path, was well rated while setting
an unchallenged pace, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, was put to a left-handed whip
outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. JAX MAN bumped with a rival at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was asked while four wide on the far turn, chased the winner while outside in the drive and finished willingly to get the place. LUCKENBACHER
went three to four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip,
brushed with a rival and was forced out a path just inside the quarter-pole and was out-kicked while able to get the show. CITY PARK went three to four
wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along outside the half-mile pole, went five wide while ridden along on the turn, came under the whip
late on that bend and lacked the needed kick. LANGS DAY pulled hard on the bit while keen under restraint in the two path through the first turn, was rated
under a tight hold, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe while shifting out just after turning
into the stretch and came up empty. ATTA BOUY leaned out at the start and broke a half-step slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, went
two to three wide on the far turn, was roused inside the three-eighths and failed to rally. KAI BABY KAI was taken back early, went two to three wide on the
first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, came under coaxing while inside on the far turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths and also failed to
respond. FREEDOMFI went five wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along while six wide on the far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
VACHERIE GIRL went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn then driven three wide into the stretch,
made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled inside of the runner-up into the final furlong, began to drift out while moving clear nearing the sixteenth-pole and
proved much the best while continuing to drift out under steady urging. QUIKFAST N AHURRY bumped with foes on both sides at the start, went around the
first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was asked while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, made an
outside bid at the three-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner near the sixteenth-pole then switched back to her inside lead late and safely secured the place.
SABER CUT broke in and bumped soundly with a rival, dropped to the rail early on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while inside to the two path
on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. OH TOODLES broke in then bumped
with foes on both sides, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, vied in the two
path on the far turn, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. JET SWEEP was off slow
then snatched with the left rein, spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the back, was urged along while four to five wide
on the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to respond. GEORGIA DAWN was bumped at the start while hustled, went to the front, traveled
around the first turn in the two path, set the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper
stretch and faded. STEPH'SFULLASUGAR broke out at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up while three to four wide
on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered.

then reserved off the pace, moved closer while three to four wide under urging on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, drifted in while gaining at the
three-sixteenths, took the lead just inside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. FORTUITY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off
the pace, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to get the place. IMPERIAL
MOMENT set the clear pace on the inside, had challengers move closer near the five-eighths, was asked while inside on the far turn, came under a drive in
upper stretch, lost the lead just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished then lost the place while able to get the show. GOVERNALE broke out and hit
the gate at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front, saved ground on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and finished with good courage but missed the show. KOKO STAR bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the
pace, went three wide on the far turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. REIGNING SPIRIT was off slow and spotted the front a
few lengths, went three then two wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, swung five wide
into upper stretch and improved position without threatening. BARLEEWON went three then two wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace,
moved closer with five furlongs to run, went around the far turn in the two path, chased the leader into upper stretch and tired. LEADING THE CHARGE

out drive and came up empty. SUGGESTED bobbled at the start, dropped from five to three wide on the first turn, settled inside of a rival, was roused while
four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. MIGHTY HEART lugged out early, bore out badly on the first turn, lagged at the rear, raced towards the
inside on the far turn and showed little. KINZEA STONE was reluctant to load then wrestled back nearing the first turn, went three to four wide on the bends
and was no factor. BREW CREW broke out at the start, dropped from six to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back late on the
backstretch, went five wide on the far turn and faltered. ELVIS'S JOY was taken back nearing the first turn, went five to six wide on that bend, settled

SCARLETTSBLACKJACK was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up into the
final furlong, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. CHARGE THE LINE showed speed then stalked the pace on
the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, took the lead while four wide into the stretch then moved clear under his own power, was asked inside the
three-sixteenths then dropped in while put to a drive, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the
place. STATE TREASURER broke a half-step slow, settled between horses, dropped back while three then four wide early on the turn, moved to five wide
later on that bend, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. RECKLESS RANSOM settled on the
outside, was urged along while five wide on the turn and failed to rally. SOUTHERN SWAGG moved to the lead and set the pace, vied inside of the
runner-up while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and gave way. SALTEE STARK settled off the pace, was
hard ridden in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty then
drifted out near the sixteenth-pole. CAJUN CHAOS broke a half-step slow while brushing with a rival, settled off the pace, was urged along while two then
three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. FORERUN tossed his head at the start and was off a half-step slow, was
taken in hand early then moved out, settled on the far outside, went six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. RELEASE
THE BEAST broke a step slow, angled in outside the half-mile pole, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was driven into the stretch
while moving closer to the three path and failed to threaten. GREELEY WENT WEST broke a step slow, raced at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path,
came four to five wide into upper stretch and never reached contention. TEMPRANO brushed with a foe at the start, was well placed on the inside, dropped
back while guided around the turn under extra left-rein pressure and faltered.

on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch then kept the runner-up in behind horses, closed well to make an outside bid into the final furlong, battled
outside of several foes into the final sixteenth then fought with the runner-up to the wire and gamely prevailed. ALTEA (FR) settled on the inside, was asked
in the two path at the quarter-pole then moved out while put to some urging, was kept in by SHE?SONTHEWARPATH then dropped in for room outside the
furlong marker and bumped DESERT RIDE soundly, made a bid between horses into the final furlong, fought gamely with the winner in the final sixteenth
and was denied while clear for the place. NOTAPRADAPRICE was hustled from the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace,
came under urging while three wide on the far turn, tipped a bit further out into upper stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled between
horses into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. WINNING ENVELOPE moved in early while taken in hand, traveled
around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, went around the far turn in the two path, was roused while swinging five wide into the
stretch just off heels then moved further out, gained into a good striking position while outside into the final furlong but flattened out. DREAM PASSAGE
switched off the rail early, went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside under a tight hold, was let out in the two path on the
far turn, made a bid in upper stretch, battled between horses into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. DESERT RIDE raced in the two path on the first
turn, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, moved off the rail while put to a drive in upper stretch, was bumped solidly outside the
furlong marker then weakened. STRIKE MY FANCY was off slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, saved ground on the turns and was no factor.
FULLNESS OF LIFE (IRE) broke in at the start, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the clear pace, vied inside on the far turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and tired. JOY
NIDERA (ARG) went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. FLOWER PARTY (IRE) was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging

BY MY STANDARDS went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue while three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths and proved much the best under strong urging. CAPTIVATING MOON
went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced three wide while still unasked on the far turn, was roused while five wide into the
stretch and finished willingly to get the place. CHESS CHIEF went four wide on the first turn, settled under some urging, chased four wide on the far turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, came in some near the sixteenth-pole and bothered foes then lost the place while able to get the show. TENFOLD
went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, brushed with
FEARLESS near the furlong marker, bumped with that foe while put in tight by CHESS CHIEF at the sixteenth-pole then missed the show while just able to
get the last spot in the superfecta. SILVER DUST was restless in the gate then lunged at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved
up take the lead, went four wide for most of the first turn then dropped to the two path, set the clear pace, raced in the two path on the far turn, was
challenged by the winner at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to that foe into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.
FEARLESS bumped with a foe at the start then moved in and put two foes in tight, was taken up early while keen under stout restraint, saved ground on the
first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was asked into the far turn, saved ground on that bend, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch,
brushed with TENFOLD while unable to go through a tight spot near the furlong marker, bumped with that foe near the sixteenth-pole then checked and lost
any chance at the minor awards. GUN IT moved in while tossing his head early, fought the rider while keen under restraint, went three wide early on the first
turn then swerved five wide still under tight restraint, was reserved outside on the backstretch, came under urging while four wide on the far turn and lacked
the needed response. LONE SAILOR was bumped at the start then bumped hard with a rival early and checked, raced inside to the two path on the first
turn, settled towards the rear, was roused while inside midway through the far turn and failed to threaten. SONNETEER bumped with foes at the start then
bumped hard with LONE SAILOR early then checked, went three to four wide on the turns, was asked inside the three-eighths and failed to respond.

sixteenth-pole.

FACTOR THIS went to the front, set the pace inside to the two path, shook off the challenge of MARZO when asked at the quarter-pole, extended the
advantage under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip approaching the furlong marker, swapped back to his inside lead inside
that marker and proved best under strong urging. DONTBLAMEROCKET was well placed on the inside, came under urging in the two path into the stretch,
chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) was taken under a tight hold early,
rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, picked up the tempo while two then three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into upper
stretch, drifted in while passing foes near the furlong marker and finished with good courage to garner the show. AQUAPHOBIA saved ground on the first
turn, settled off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, chased the winner on the outside under a
drive into the final furlong, had the rider lose his whip late and lacked the needed kick while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. SYNCHRONY went
two to three wide on the first turn, settled well back on the outside, was roused while three wide on the far turn, dropped in outside the sixteenth-pole and
improved position but reached his best stride too late. INSTILLED REGARD went two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused in
the two path on the far turn then driven three wide into the stretch, moved out under the whip shortly thereafter and lacked the needed response. MARZO
went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, was turned back by the winner into
upper stretch, dropped back under a drive the final furlong and weakened. CHANNEL MAKER went two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, dropped in a bit to be in the three path early on the far turn then moved quickly back to the four path, was driven five wide into the stretch then
drifted out, raced inside of ROCKEMPEROR past the three-sixteenths, was carried in by that foe near the furlong marker then moved back out and failed to
rally. HENLEY'S JOY was keen under restraint early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far
turn, turned into upper stretch in the two path under a drive and failed to threaten. BUNDIBUNAN broke a step slow, moved in towards the back, saved
ground on the turns and was no factor. DOT MATRIX had his head turned at the start then reared badly and was off very slow, spotted the front many
lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turns, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and never reached contention. SECRETARY AT WAR had his
head turned at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went three to four wide on the turns, drifted inward in upper stretch and came up
empty.

Footnotes
BONNY SOUTH went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, moved closer while shifting from two to four wide on the far turn,
was roused in the process, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear
under strong urging. TEMPERS RISING bobbled at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled last but one, advanced while moving from three to five
wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole then was asked for her best into upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken while
able to get the place. ANTOINETTE raced under a tight hold in the two path on the first turn then was rated just off the pace under stout restraint, drafted in
the two path while still in hand in the two path on the far turn, waited from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole while several other foes made their move,
shifted three wide into the stretch then was asked outside the three-sixteenths, moved out late and finished willingly for the show. FINITE went three to four
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up while three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole then was asked, drifted
in while on even terms for the lead in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened then lost the show. STOP SHOPPIN TAMMY went three
wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the two to three path on the far turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. FRENCH ROSE was asked leaving the gate, set the pace on the inside, was asked under
heavy pressure outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.
