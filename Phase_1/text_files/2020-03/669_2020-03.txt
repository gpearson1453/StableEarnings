Footnotes
SANTA ANA WINDS outrun in the early going, raced outside, advanced into contention through the second turn while three wide, collared the leader
nearing the furlong grounds and drove clear. CLAY'S MOON STONE settled off the pace while saving ground, continued inside into the far turn, came in the
two path for the drive, finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. SHACKADELIC broke on top, dueled early off the inside,
shook clear in the two path second turn, offered brief resistance to the winner the final furlong, proved no match for the runner up, comfortably saved the
show. KIMBERLY FRANCES last away, raced back, improved a bit while never a serious threat. WEEKEND MADNESS fell back to trail while three wide in
the first turn, continued back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. RED LINGERIE within striking distance while three wide, had nothing left
for the drive. REVEALING QUALITY dueled up front along the inside, stopped. PER RULING DATED 8/31/2020 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS
RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2020-OP-33) WEEKEND MADNESS WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
CHIEF OF STAFF broke sharp, narrowly showed the way early inside, shook clear entering the stretch, drew off through the lane to win ridden out.
DINGDINGDINGDING stalked the pace while racing three wide, moved a bit closer turning for home, could do little more with the winner in the run to the
wire, clearly second best. SOUTHSIDER within striking distance while racing outside, set down for the drive, gained the nod for the show while slowly
getting to the runner up late. GIDDYMEISTER pressured the winner from the outside for a half, weakened gradually in the drive and was nipped late for the
show. AIR POWER in the second flight toward the inside, lacked a closing punch. AVAIL EKATI off a step slow, trailed early, improved position while racing
four wide. BUBBAS DIXIE broke back, lacked speed while saving ground, lacked room along the rail from late in the turn through upper stretch, finished up
evenly after moving out late. PLUMBAGO remained back in failing to threaten. GET THE BLING tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
VICE VERSA with the pace after coming out a bit just after the break, vied three wide into and through the turn, disposed of the other speed when
straightened for home, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. EXULTATION last to leave then was bothered slightly when the winner came over
soon after, moved up to race in the second flight three wide and between rivals, set down for the drive, could do little with the winner, fully extended to hold
the place. MAKE NOISE in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, not enough for the place late while prevailing for the show.
HIDDEN RULER in the second group while in the two path, lacked a serious closing response. BENNY CHANG with the pace while between rivals, faltered.
DEFLATER vied up front along the inside for a half and gave way.

Footnotes
DADDY'S ANGEL within striking distance while three wide, continued off the inside, advanced and challenged in upper stretch, dueled to the wire, proved
narrowly best in a determined effort. LUCKY ROAD closest to the leader off the inside, collared that one turning for home, dueled with the winner inside that
one to the wire, missed while proving stubborn, clearly second best. RICH PRINCESS broke on top, washy, got clear to set the pace inside, continued to
show the way the middle half, off little resistance to the top two in the drive, saved the show spot. BANKER NITA settled off the pace just off the inside, three
wide into the far turn in some traffic, dropped steadily to the inside through that bend, went evenly in the drive, in lacking a closing response. ARKANSAS
INVASION lacked early foot off the inside, four wide into the far turn, improved position off the inside into the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong.
CYBER AFFAIR settled off the pace toward the inside, went evenly in lacking a closing response. DRAMATIC ENTRANCE volid of early foot, made little
impact. DADDY'S STORM four wide into the first turn, remained always back. ELUSIVE SECRET last to leave, was never close. BONITA'S GOLD in mid
pack off the inside, five wide outside of traffic into the far turn, faded in the drive. DANZIG STAR four wide trip, always outrun. LAURA BELLE rank in the
early going when forwardly placed, stopped.

Footnotes
MATROOH prompted the leader from the two path, continued to stalk up the backstretch, moved to the fore at will far turn, well clear stretch, ridden out.
CURLIN RULES broke in good order, showed the way into and through the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, proved no match when
confronted by the winner second turn, held sway for the place. EISENSTAEDT settled in mid pack, pulled in the run up the backstretch, three wide out of the
final turn, went evenly in the drive. MIGHTY MANFRED last to leave, raced back, displayed some mild interest while not a serious threat. CATDADDY within
striking distance in the early going, had nothing left for the drive. TAPSOLUTE lacked early speed, five wide into the far turn, lacked a closing response.
ATTENTIVE fell back after the start, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MATAPAN allowed the leader to go early while off the inside, tracked that one through the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, drew clear and
maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. FLORIDA BIRD off a step slow, raced back, remained well back through the turn,
two path into the stretch, rallied through traffic, up in time for the place. SAVEDBYANANGEL forwardly placed while racing three wide turning for home,
chased the winner past the furlong marker, flattened out, outkicked for the place. TIDDLY within striking distance early, behind some traffic late in the turn,
went evenly in the drive. THE MARY ROSE off a bit slowly, raced back and off the inside, steered out four wide turning for home, improved slightly with
some modest late interest while widest in the drive. OOCHIE went evenly three wide. LUCKY EVERY DAY in the main group outside, was four wide through
the turn, lacked a kick. BETTYANN moved up inside after the start to set the pace, dueled through the turn inside the winner, gave way in the drive. OWE
HER ONE broke back, lacked speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANYWHERE broke well, dueled early closest to the inside, shook clear in the turn, increased advantage through the lane under a steady hand
ride to win ridden out. MOJOVATION back off the pace outside, raced four wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second
best. TOUCHING RAINBOWS behind the pace while saving ground, continued inside through the turn, got through entering the stretch, finished up best of
the rest. NASHVILLE KNIGHT forwardly placed while racing three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. D' RAPPER lacked speed, was three
wide through the turn, never dangerous. SOVEREIGN IMPACT failed to menace while racing in the two path. BASIC CHANCE dueled up front outside the
winner early, chased that rival through the turn and gave way. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SUPER DUDE with the early pace inside, allowed the leader to go early in the first turn, moved out, chased that in the run up the backstretch and into the far
turn, brushed upper stretch, bid between foes, dug in gamely late to narrowly prevail. ROCKING THE BOAT back off the pace, closer three wide into the far
turn, challenged on the outside exiting the final bend, brushed with the winner, continued to battle past the furlong marker widest of the first flight, brushed
with the winner, outkicked in the late going. LENSTAR broke well from the outside, asked to clear into the first turn, dropped inside, set the pace while
saving ground, continued to show the way into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair late. EXCLAMATION POINT last to leave, jostled soon after,
raced off the pace inside, moved out three wide for the drive, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch. COLONELSDARKTEMPER lacked speed, four wide
into the lane, lacked a closing response. POWERFUL ALLY forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded. THETRASHMANSCOMING jostled after the
start, raced back toward the inside early, got out to be wide into the lane while being eased up a bit, jogged in.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY BETT stalked the leaders three wide, continued to race forwardly through the turn, engaged the leader late from the outside, lightly bumped
with that foe in the final strides, proved narrowly best in a determined effort. KINETIC SWAGGER broke sharp, vied from the start off the inside, showed the
way into the stretch, drifted out, lightly bumped with the winner, outkicked in the final strides. CAMPAIGN SPY back off the pace in some traffic in the two
path turn, rallied for the show, no match for the top two in the drive. NOT FADE AWAY within striking distance well outside, five wide into the turn, four wide
exiting, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. MR. UNUSUAL lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive and finished
willingly while too late through some traffic. PEWTER mid pack and outside, was four wide out of the turn, lacked a serious closing response.
IMEANTTOPAY off a step slow, raced well back and inside, improved position without posing a serious threat. THE DUSTMAN narrowly set the early pace
along the inside, dueled into the turn, gave way in the drive. WENT forwardly placed toward the inside, steadied slightly in traffic early turn and faded.
COPPER MOUNTAIN four wide into the turn, backed up in the drive. WILD WORLD off slowly, remained always back. RAHAAL steadied and lost action
early, also was always outrun.
