Footnotes
SOUTHERNPERFECTION broke in front, set all the pace under confident handling and widened through the stretch to win as much the best while taken in
hand through the final stages. MEET ME HALF WAY allowed to settle, drifted out bumping ART THIEF past the three wide sixteenths pole, rallied three
wide and got up for second. ART THIEF trailed into the far turn, began to close ground outside, was bumped in upper stretch while four wide and finished
determinedly. GENTLE KISS never far back, inched closer along the inside through the far turn and into the stretch then came up empty.
COLORINCOLONEL broke slowly and was no factor. WAR EAGLE'S LOVE broke slowly, was well placed then failed to respond. ZOE MY LOVE pressured
the winner into the far turn then stopped in the final furlong.

DA DUDE tracked the pace near the inside into the stretch, rallied to make the lead in the three path past the furlong marker and won under strong handling.
ENEMY RUNNER well placed, rallied four wide on the turn, dug in determinedly in the six path late and gained second. IT'S OFFICIAL chased the pace two
wide into the turn, checked at the three furlong marker, shifted outside, then came on again in the seven path through the stretch. BEARPATH sprinted to a
clear lead soon after the start, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. NOTARIZED failed to
menace. IT'SGOODTOBESEEN offered a bid along the inside on the turn then came up empty. KANDY CHARGE was no factor.

BEAUTIFUL GAME was bumped at the start, stalked the pace into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, dropped back a bit, dug in
determinedly three wide through deep stretch under right handed urging and was along in time. MAKES GOOD SENSE broke in front, battled for the lead
three then two wide into the stretch, shook clear, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. PRAIRIE CHIEF unhurried early, swung
wide and closed a gap late int he seven path. ARAZI LIKE MOVE settled inside, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch and closed some ground
late. JOE BAILEY found his best stride late. FISH TRAPPE ROAD bore out at the start bumping the winner, was allowed to settle, closed rapidly two wide
on the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened. JUMPN' JAMES moved up four wide on the turn
then came up empty. AMERICAN LUXURY battled for the lead two wide then along the inside into the stretch and gave way late. LOVE THAT LUTE had

Footnotes
EDGE OF HONOR with the second flight three wide, rallied steadily in the three path under left handed urging and was along in time. CANUSTAYTONIGHT
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace off the stretch and just missed hanging on. QUEEN CITY KITTY chased the pace
and turned in an even effort in the five path. MAGNA MONEY with the second flight four wide, lacked the needed response. ALL THE BEST close up along
the inside down the backstretch, was in tight causing her rider to steady entering the turn, dropped back then passed tiring rivals through the stretch.
SMARTINA was no factor. KAYLEE'S HOPE stalked the early pace, swung wide and lost ground. SHAKE ME DIVA also swung wide while always outrun.
LIL'PRINCESSNELLIE chased the pace near the inside into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
EARLY RETIREMENT chased the pace two wide, made the lead before a half, set a pressured pace into the stretch, was headed near the furlong marker
then fought back gamely under right handed urging to get back up in time. TAPNGO unhurried early, split horses two wide at the top of the stretch, put a
head in front at the eighth pole then was outfinished by the winner. RAPID FIRE with the second flight, loomed boldly three wide past the half mile marker,
kept pressure until mid stretch then faded four wide. LION LION well placed, inched closer on the far turn then leveled off. GARDEN QUALITY failed to
menace. LEOPOLDO broke in front, set the pace for nearly a half, prompted the pace from the inside into the stretch and weakened through the final
furlong. CHIEF RED BULL was no factor. IMADANDYBANDY was outrun. THUNDER KID with the second flight two wide, was through after six furlongs.
PABLO'S VISION was no threat. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB showed little. A B G GUERRERO was through after a half.

Footnotes
CHIEF BIG HEAD settled mid pack, closed with a burst of speed five wide through the stretch under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. KING
CORN dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, led late and just missed hanging on. MODERN JUSTICE stalked the pace four wide down the
backstretch, loomed boldly three wide before a half, matched strides the balance of the trip and was outfinished in the final stages. KOLE MAN CAN stalked
the pace five then four wide, also bid nearing the quarter pole and was outfinished. CAPTAIN RILEY failed to menace. FREEKSON was a sharp threat three
wide into the stretch then faded. HEIDI'S SINATRA was no factor. HANSANITY had good early speed then retreated. GRAND KITTEN was no factor. MY
MAN ARCHIE was outrun. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch then stopped. CONNORRSKIE showed little.
