Footnotes
TONI ANN'S MIRACLE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up in early stretch and edged clear for the win. CASA BONITA
stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out in early stretch, was no match late and finished second best. WEDDING DANCE was
up close early, went five wide into the turn and was empty late. LADY LEX stumbled at the start, was rushed to contend, advanced between rivals and
faded. TEXT DONT CALL was outrun early, angled to the inside and offered no late rally.
