Footnotes
CHIEF OF STAFF closest to the inside in the two path, continued to pursue that one through the turn, engaged from the outside inside the furlong marker,
wore that same foe down late under firm handling. LEWYS VAPORIZER broke on top, sprinted well clear through a quick opening quarter, responded when
challenged just inside the furlong ground, proved stubborn to the end. BAJAN CASH last away, raced back, angled out a bit to be in the two path turning for
home, finished clear of the rest while not a serious threat to the top two. LOUDEN'S GRAY went evenly while racing three wide. R FAST LIFE two out to
three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. YOU'RE KILLIN ME void of speed, four wide out of the turn, also lacked a closing kick. WILLOW RIDGE
settled off the early pace, faded.

Footnotes
HONORING MAJOR unhurried early, continued back in the run up the backstretch, swept to the fore four wide in the second turn, showed the way into the
turn, drew clear under pressure. MUTINEER settled off the early pace inside, closer before a half, in hand into the far turn, continued to save ground through
the second bend, had little for the winner late, clearly second best. BOOKIE'S BLUES closest to the leader in the two path, advanced and challenged
between horses late in the final turn, soon lost contact with the winner, no match for the runner up, determined to save the show while between rivals at the
wire. GEORGIA DEPUTY lacked speed in the two path, angled out to be four wide exiting the final turn, wide in the drive, outfinished for the show.
COLONEL TALBOT showed the way into the first turn, continued to show the way the middle half, brief responded when headed turning for home,
weakened. DEALIN' STELEN in tight at the start to break back, lacked speed, failed to menace. BAQUERO FLIES within striking distance while three wide,
continued in good position in the final turn, had little for the drive. PLEASE THE COURT four wide into the first turn, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RIDE outrun in the early going inside, began to move late on the backstretch, steered out when continuing a steady advance in the final turn,
finished up willingly to be up in time. DAWDLE broke alertly, worked way clear and to the inside early in the first turn, dueled in the run up the backstretch,
shook off that rival turning for home to be clear in upper stretch, could not contain the winner. AUSTIN'S GAL pressed the runner up early from the outside,
dueled outside that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, could not keep up in the drive, no match runner up, comfortably finished up best of the
others. ADDI four wide into the first turn, settled up the backstretch, dropped to the inside to save ground through the second turn, finished up evenly.
BROADWAY BURN prompted the pace from the three path, had little left for the drive. MAGICALLY HONORED one paced early along the inside, fell back
into the far turn while continuing along the rail. UNBURNT four wide into the first turn, far back in the three path turning for home, jogged in late.

Footnotes
ROARING RULE with the pace from the start inside, continued to vie through the turn along the rail, gradually edged clear the final furlong under steady
handling. ST. LOUIE GUY away in good order, also raced with the pace, between foes through the turn, could not match the winner from midstretch in, all
out to preserve the place. MONDAY CONFESSION settled behind the first flight, two path through the turn. PARK RIDGE BENNY within striking distance
outside, pressed four wide through the turn, went evenly though the lane in lacking a closing response. BIG SPORT prompted the pace while three wide,
had little left for the stretch run. PLUMBAGO fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag turn while just off the inside, improved position with some mild,
belated interest. BAR STOOL BUDGET fractious in the gate prior to the start, settled off the pace and the inside, continued just off the inside through the
turn, lacked a rally in the drive. VIRGA off a step slow, failed to menace. MISCHIEVOUS DANCER finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MORNING SNOW broke well, narrowly showed the way inside, continued to set the pace through the turn, headed nearing the furlong marker, battled back
in game fashion to prevail while fully extended. JACK VAN BERG pressed the issue early in the three path, vied three wide into the lane, put a head in front
past the furlong marker, outfinished in the late going. HAYDENS HAVOC broke on top, contested the back while between rivals, remained between the top
two through the turn and into the stretch, weakened the final furlong, narrowly lasted for the show. WICKED INDEED off the pace inside, saved ground
through the turn, moved out for the drive, getting to the show horse late. BOX OF CHOCOLATES within striking distance outside, inched a bit closer late in
the turn, lacked the needed response when called on for the drive while remaining well out in the strip. SPEAKER VAN last away, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
LIL TATER broke with the main body, moved up inside to contest the issue inside, put a head in front into the turn, steadily pulled away through the lane
without being asked for her best to win ridden out. LORI'S EYES within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, no match for the winner, edging
away for the place. DAT GIRL a bit washy, raced with the pace in the two path, continued to vie early turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, could
not match strides with the runner up late. MANY SWEET TREATS forwardly placed while racing three wide, went evenly through the lane in lacking a
closing bid. DIXIE CAT lacked speed three wide, moved a bit closer through the turn in the three path, lacked a further response. ARKANSAS INVASION
void of speed, raced back and in hand turn, in some traffic midway on the turn, moved outside late in the bend, displayed a mild amount of late interest to
improve position after the issue had been decided. ESTHER lacked speed, failed to seriously menace. GUEST IN MY HEART veered in at the start, moved
up to the main body, lacked a response in the drive. FIVE QUEENS prompted the issue early just off the inside, dropped to the inside midway on the turn,
fell back. PULPIT'S PRINCESS lacked speed, checked up in tight quarters entering the turn, fell back, moved out five wide, continued to fade through the
stretch.

Footnotes
FIRE CORAL away well, got clear through the first turn under firm restraint, continued under a snug hold in the run up the backstretch through some soft
fractions, roused when dueling into the lane, edged away. CHARMING LADY prompted the winner off the inside, tried that one from the outside turning for
home, briefly dueled then could not keep up, all out to hold the place. JILTED BRIDE unhurried early, saved ground second turn when moving slightly
closer, steered out past the furlong marker, finished willingly to be rapidly getting to the runner up. PIECE OF MY HEART pulled early when just behind the
pace, continued inside, came up empty when asked for the drive. SEAHAWK LISA settled in the two path under some restraint, remained in hand the
middle half mile, also lacked a closing kick in the stretch. BACK IN CHARGE lacked speed, asked along in the second turn, lacked a significant closing
response. SHE'S ALL WOLFE prompted the pace three wide, had little left for the drive. TURNSTONE bobbled at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FROZEN HANNAH closest to the early leader, challenged the leader while being asked a bit in the second turn, took over into the lane, drew off through the
lane, drew well clear under token encouragement to win ridden out. ARROWSPHERE broke on top, set the pace along the inside under light restraint,
offered little resistance to the winner when that one came alongside exiting the final turn, remained clear for the place. WENEEDTOTALK chased the top
two toward the inside, finished up best of the rest. TICKLE BUNNY off a step slow, raced back much of the way just off the inside, staged a mild rally into
the lane, flattened out a bit late. HONOR WITH PRIDE turned in an even effort along the inside. ANGEL OF DREAMS void of speed in trailing for five
furlongs, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. EXPRESSLY within striking distance while racing outside, tired. ABBY IN PINK lacked speed, four wide in
the second turn, faded through the lane. SWISS DOT off a step slow, moved up in the opening quarter under stout restraint, stopped, jogged in.
