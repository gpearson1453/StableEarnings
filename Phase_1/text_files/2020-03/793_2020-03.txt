Footnotes
SHESHED close from the start off the inside, ranged up to challenge the leader from the outside midway on the turn, shook clear when straightened for
home, maintained a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late. PUNISH in the second flight toward the inside, in some traffic
turning into the stretch, moved out slightly, roused, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. OH MY OH broke out to bother an outer rival, was
forwardly placed, raced three wide through the turn, also managed some gain late. MIZ NIGHTCAP broke alertly, shook clear early, dueled late in the turn
inside the winner, could not keep up in the drive. VEGAN GOES BEST broke in and toward the back, lacked speed early, two to three wide in the turn,
improved slightly into the lane then finished up evenly. TRACI'S GREELEY bothered to be off a bit slowly, moved up to race within striking distance early
while outside, four wide through the turn, had little left for the drive. HALEYS HEIST was never a threat while saving ground.

Footnotes
IN THE DEEP floated out start, behind the leader along the inside for a half, angled out to the two path turning for home, set down for the drive, finished
willingly to be up in time. WRITTEN PERMISSION sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way into the turn, continued to have daylight on the field
past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. PAROLEE back early off the pace, moved closer in the four path in the turn, flattened out a bit in the
drive to finish up best of the rest. RIVERS OF LITE void of early foot, four wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position, no real threat. MAYAN
GHOST lacked early foot, made little impact. TOUGH COMPANY main body early, slightly closer three wide in the bend, flattened out in the drive. NIALL
steadied in the early going, fell back, failed to rally. GRAND ATLANTIC shuffled back just after the start, remained back. DELTA SURPRISE chased the
runner up for three furlongs, gave way midway on the turn.

Footnotes
POPULAR KID dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, well clear upper stretch, kept to task. DUKES UP off a step
slow, raced well back for five furlongs, rallied three wide into the stretch, finished up with good energy to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner.
HARDLY A SECRET chased the dueling leader toward the inside, advanced to be closest to the winner entering the stretch, had little for that one the final
furlong, caught late for the place. FIRST MASAMUNE went one paced toward the inside, no real threat. PINSON broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the
inside, could not match the winner into the stretch, faded in the run to the wire. GOOD GOOD settled off the pace toward the inside, failed to respond.
COUNTY COURT off slowly, sluggish, trailed home.

Footnotes
HISSY MISSY lacked early foot, began to advance far turn, steered four wide into the lane, lodged an outside bid late, edging away late under firm
handlling. TOO PRETTY in the first flight while three wide, continued to vie on the outside the outside the middle half, shook clear into the lane, caught late.
LOVELY LOU settled on the pace just off the inside, closer in the two path second turn, finished up best of the rest. MS SASSY ATITUDE shuffled back at
the start, lodged a middle move four wide into contention in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. ZANSHOES went one paced while off
the inside. ELLA'S MY GIRL off a step slow, remained well back for five furlongs, displayed some late interest to improve position after the issue had been
decided. LINE OF FAITH off the pace inside, failed to muster a rally. MOCHA KISS void of early foot, failed to menace. HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY vied up front
while between rivals in the early going, began a steady retreat after a half. LIL' FANCY remained always back while five wide in the far turn. DIXIE WAYNE
with the pace along the inside for a half, stopped. JULIE ARKANSAS in the second flight while three wide, also stopped.

foot, five wide through the turn, improved position while remaining well out in the strip. BACKSEAT PROMISES devoid of early foot, came five wide out of
the turn, improved position with some belated interest. AS FAST AS YOU CAN off a step slow, moved up through some early traffic, three wide through the

Footnotes
SOUTHERN CENTS closest to the leader, took over into the far turn off the inside, well clear, kept to task while drifting out slightly. MI BELLA lacked speed,
continued back into the far turn, lacked room and steadied three furlongs out, finished up willingly to be in time for the place. GOLDEN LILY back early off
the pace, three wide trip through both turns, closer into the lane, caught late for the place. GYPSY WIND last to leave, trailed early, four wide in the second
turn, improved position with a mild rally, no threat to the top three. MEBS WEB broke back in bobbling slightly, void of early foot, three out to four wide in the
second turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit late. DARK SARCASM back off the pace three wide, made an early move to challenge just
before a half, dueled with the winner into the far turn then could not keep up, weakened through the stretch. SWEET KALA failed to menace while off the
inside. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN broke sharp, a bit rank early, remained forwardly placed for six furlongs, backed up through the stretch. CONGRATS GIRL
sprinted clear soon after the start, stopped, eased into the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
ECHO TOWN prompted the leaders through some quick early fractions, joined the fray three wide late in the turn, vied past the furlong marker then drove
well clear. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY outrun in the early going, two path through the turn, switched out past the furlong marker for room and finished willingly
to be well clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. ZYRAMID broke alertly, dueled along the inside through some quick fractions for a half, no match
for the top two in the final furlong, narrowly saved the show. CYRIL'S BOY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive,
some late interest to narrowly miss the show. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON in the second flight well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, not enough for
the show late while remaining outside. SYCAMORE RUN away in good order, helped set some lively fractions off the inside, faltered the final furlong.
SECRET BISCUIT back off the pace while racing outside, five wide through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. BELEWS GOLD off slowly, lacked
speed in trailing, in some traffic with a furlong remaining, lacked a late punch when clear.

Footnotes
CROATIAN closest to the two leaders for ten furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. CHANGI with the early leaders inside, allowed two rivals to go
entering the stretch for the first time, moved out, began a steady retreat before a half, gave way in the final bend and finished far back. TONE BROKE set or
forced the pace toward the inside, backed up through the stretch. UCANTHANKMELATER off a step slow, raced back throughout in lacking a rally.
ROILAND settled off the pace, went one paced throughout. SKY PROMISE unhurried for over a mile, rallied three wide out of the third turn, moved inside
then back out a bit, challenged between horses with less than a furlong remained, gained command then had enough left late to hold off the runner up.
CAMPAIGN devoid of speed while well out in the strip, continued out in the strip, continued well wide, came six wide out of the third turn, finished with good
energy to be getting to the winner while too late. REMEMBERING RITA forwardly placed from the start, dueled the middle part, shook clear turning for
home, drifted out when confronted by the winner brushing with that one slightly inside the furlong marker, faltered, remained clear of the others. RATED R
SUPERSTAR settled off the pace while along the inside, continued to save ground into the final turn, angled out to be four wide for the drive then went
evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
THE BIG BLUFF broke back, split foes when beginning to advance midway on the turn, swung out five entering the stretch, finished full of run down the
middle of the strip to win going away at the end. NORTH SIDE within striking distance off the inside, came three wide when moving on the leaders into the
stretch, took over, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. SON OF GA GA settled off the pace and the inside, improved into the lane,
could not match the top two the final furlong, well clear of the others. MEGA MAX lacked speed while along the inside, continued to save ground turn,
steered out entering the stretch, little late gain. CASCADE KING off slowly, trailed well back early, angled out steadily to be four wide into the stretch,
improved position while not a threat. STEELDRIVER in the second flight while racing outside, came up empty for the drive. RECKLESSNESS made little
impact while racing outside. GUMWRAPPER broke in good order, vied inside through a quick set of early fractions inside, gave way in the drive. BIG BIZ in
mid pack early, tired in the drive. FAIR CATCH alternated up front for four furlongs off the inside, backed up through the stretch. SIETE LEGUAS within
striking distance in the early, steadily faded.
