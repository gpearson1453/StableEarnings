Footnotes
NORTH CROSS broke alertly and was on the pace from the outset, raced two wide to the stretch then battled KENJI'S JOURNEY through a long drive and
put that one away in the final sixteenth. DAVE'S GIFT was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task
and tagged KENJI'S JOURNEY late for the place. KENJI'S JOURNEY dueled inside the winner to the stretch, dug in determinedly to the sixteenth marker
then weakened and lost the place late. CUPID'S VICTORY tracked the pace to the turn, got outkicked three wide to the stretch and lacked a closing bid.
DESERT MOVIE broke a bit slow, had no speed, was two wide to the stretch but also did not rally. SHINER'S CODE chased the leaders to the turn then got
fanned out to the four path to the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

BLUSHING BAY never far back to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to win going away.
ODESSA attended the pace from the rail for six furlongs, responded to mid stretch then was collared, outfinished but second best. MISS INDEFATIGABLE
dueled outside of ODESSA for six furlongs, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. LORETTA tracked the pace to the second turn, was outside the
winner to the stretch but gave out in the drive. ROUGE BOUQUET gave a dull effort.

finished in a rally. CLARENCE HEADS stalked the winner to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but also was
finishing well. WHEN JESUS WALKED broke slow, tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch and closed willingly late. HAWK'S RISING chased the pace

MOLLIE O ' MCEVOY had good speed, set the pace to the second turn, turned back REIWA into the stretch then failed to switch leads in the drive but held
determinedly. REIWA was three wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, rallied three wide to loom a threat at the quarter pole but was outkicked
to mid stretch, also failed to switch leads in the drive and was second best. FASHION ROYALTY (GB) had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then
closed the gap in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT SUNRISE lugged out on the first turn while hard to place, shifted outside the winner on the backstretch,
pressed that one to the second turn while three wide then did not rally when asked in the drive.

Footnotes
DIAMONDSNCHAMPAGNE sped clear early, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded to stay clear to mid stretch, was tiring late but had
enough of a cushion to hold. SIERRA SUNRISE had no speed and was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly for second.
HAPPY ISSUE was chasing to the turn, also saved ground to the stretch and closed steadily but too late. TAPITHA BONITA was outsprinted early, got
fanned four deep on the turn and lacked a closing response. A FILLY CAN DREAM was stalking to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch but
weakened in mid stretch. JUDICIAL also stalked the winner early, raced three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
SINGLE BARREL was outside rivals to the backstretch, remained widest on the second turn while five deep, rallied when set down for the drive, dueled to
mid stretch then inched away driving. AERO STREET chased the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, rallied to be on terms in mid stretch
then was outkicked for the win but saved second. QICK QUACK QUO settled to the half, raced two wide on the second turn then also responded to be on
terms in mid stretch but got outkicked late. NORTH FORK settled mid pack to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then shifted out and finished
willingly. RUNAWAY INDY pressed the pace to the half, offered a bid two wide on the second turn, engaged for the lead nearing mid stretch but weakened
in the late stages. FORT JACKSON had no speed, was three or four wide throughout and lacked the needed late response. CODE GRAY set the pace
while three then two wide to the backstretch, shifted in and saved ground on the lead on the second turn then was tiring in upper stretch, drifted inward and
caused MATSON to clip heels at the eighth pole and gave way. MATSON was unhurried to the half, saved ground on the second turn then was trying to
rally inside CODE GRAY but was crowded by that one, clipped heels, stumbled and lost any chance. APATHETIC had no speed and was never a threat.
The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run and disqualified CODE GRAY from seventh to eighth place for interference to MATSON.

Footnotes
GALAXY MASTER had the best speed, dueled INCLUDE EDDY from the rail to the stretch, put that one away and edged clear to mid stretch then was tiring
but held on. GOLD N GRAND had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, shifted in then drifted out leaving mid stretch, brushed
with GLENROY late and nipped that one for second. GLENROY also had no speed, was two then three wide to the stretch, was rallying in mid stretch then
was brushed and forced out late and just missed second. CLIFTON HOLLOW was outrun to the half, bid three then four wide to the stretch and finished in a
rally. ST JAMES PLACE was chasing to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but got outfinished in the final furlong. INCLUDE EDDY
attended the pace outside the winner and two wide for six furlongs then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. HOLD ME CLOSE was four wide to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, tried to rally three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. PEGASUS SPRINT was caught widest while
five deep into the first turn, eased down to the three path to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, was four deep to the stretch but lacked a closing
response. SECRET MANIA had no speed and was always outrun. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving GOLD N GRAND and
GLENROY but failed to alter the results in a majority decision.
