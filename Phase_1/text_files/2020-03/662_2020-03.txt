Footnotes
SWIMHARD DREAMBIG was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a right-handed whip, rallied
on the outside, switched to a left-handed whip while gaining at the furlong marker, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth then switched back to a
right-handed whip and prevailed under strong urging. MADEFORLIFE was bumped by WHODATWHODAT near the five-eighths pole, tracked outside under
coaxing, went four wide on the turn, was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, bumped with LOVE BOUND while keeping that foe in behind horses outside
the three-sixteenths, took the lead under hand urging outside the furlong marker then moved clear inside that marker, drifted out when put to a left-handed
whip outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the wire and was caught while able to get the place. LOVE BOUND bumped soundly with a rival at
the start while also bumping with another foe, showed speed between horses then inside of a rival, dropped off the pace midway down the backstretch,
drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked some inside the three-eighths, bumped with MADEFORLIFE while blocked behind the leaders into
upper stretch, steadied repeatedly while blocked until inside the furlong marker, finally found some room at that juncture and finished willingly for the show
but lost all chance at the victory. KOHENSRISING was a bit fractious in the post parade, broke out then bumped lightly with an opponent, settled towards
the back, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under a drive, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to
threaten. SECRET PRINCESS was bumped in the hindquarters at the start while coming out in front, set the pace while off the inside, dropped to the rail
while losing the advantage early on the turn, was asked on even terms for the lead into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened.
MAYREESE bumped soundly with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe then was taken up, raced at the rear of the field, rounded the turn
in the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, remained at the rear under the whip into the final furlong, angled out sharply late and was no factor.
WHODATWHODAT was hustled from the inside post, steadied while beaten to the front early then dropped back, switched out shortly thereafter and
bumped with a foe, moved up then was taken in hand around the half-mile pole, took a narrow advantage in the three path on the turn, was asked at the
five-sixteenths, led under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
SPECIAL CONNECTION raced outside a rival up the backstretch, continued in the three to four path through the turn, moved out six wide in upper stretch
and was put to urging outside foes, struck the lead a sixteenth out and edged safely clear. CASUAL PLEASURE settled early, advanced outside a foe on
the turn going four wide through that bend, made a mild bid in mid-stretch, could not kick on with the winner but kept on late to be second best. G'S MINE
broke just a bit slowly and awkwardly, saved ground inside on the turn mid-division, came out three wide near the three-sixteenths, ran on late but needed
more. HARBOR SUNSET broke a half-step slowly, tracked in behind racing off the inside, went in the three path through the turn, bid four wide taking the
lead by the three-sixteenths, was clear passing the furlong marker but overtaken outside the sixteenth pole and weakened. STAR PRADO prompted the
pace from outside going three wide early on the turn moving in a bit on that bend, was empty in the stretch. POPS SHANGHAI was just a bit fractious in the
gate, set a pressured pace inside, gave way and faded. AUBEE GRAND broke a step slowly, moved in and saved ground on or just off the rail through the
turn, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
MARYWOOD went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, raced inside on the far turn, extended the
advantage while asked into upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed whip
outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped leads back and forth in the final sixteenth and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. B'S TEN broke out
and brushed with a rival, was eased back while inside of three foes early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the front, saved ground
on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased inside in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. CRIMSON FELINE went three to four wide on
the first turn under restraint, was hard held early on the backstretch then rated off the pace, brushed with a rival leaving the backstretch, stalked four wide on
the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased outside in the stretch and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. ROYAL ALEXANDRA was
last to commence, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, went three to four wide while roused on the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch, passed foes under the whip on the outside, drifted out just inside the furlong marker and gained to just miss the show. SCOOTIN BAYOU tucked
into the three path on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, went three wide on the far turn, was roused then driven four wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. MY PEPPER ANN was taken up while in tight between horses just after the start then taken up again briefly in the early going, went four to
five wide on the turns, drifted out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SAVVY SHIPMAN brushed with a foe at the start, went
three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch
and came up empty. FORGOTTEN moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, raced inside to the two path on the far
turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. BRAHMS BABY went four wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, brushed with an opponent leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and
capitulated. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
GUITAR SLIM raced off the fence in the two to three path through the first turn, moved out entering the far turn while beginning to advance, was six wide
past the three-eighths pole, moved to the fore approaching the furlong marker and drove past. DRILLING REPORT broke outwardly just a bit, moved in
while clear into the first turn dictating terms from the two path on that bend, moved in a bit up the backstretch still in the clear, continued to lead on or just off
the rail through the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch but fought on to regain the place. REINSURE exchanged a bump in the early going, raced off the
leaders in the three path through the first turn, edged closer on the far turn going three to four wide on that bend, took a narrow lead by the three-sixteenths
before being overtaken nearing the furlong marker and was subsequently outfinished for the place. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN exchanged a bump soon after
the start, was taken hold of briefly prior to entering the first turn, saved ground racing inside through both turns but was not a late threat. THUNK raced in the
four path through the first turn inside a rival, continued in behind foes and inside one up the backstretch, was given mild coaxing by the half mile marker,
went in the three path through the far turn and failed to rally. TUCKER THE GROUCH broke outwardly just a bit, raced outside foes five wide through the
first turn not too far off the leaders, continued five wide on the far turn and was empty by the stretch. BARROW ROAD ducked in at the break, switched off
the inside heading down the home straight the first time, went mostly in the three path through the first turn bringing up the rear but floating out to the four
path on occasion, continued outside a rival up the backstretch into the far turn going six then seven deep early on that turn before shifting in a bit late, was
never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
CHANNEL WON settled on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly under a brisk hand ride to get
the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead while switched to a
right-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. HORSE DOCTOR bobbled at the start then brushed with foes on both sides,
settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the far outside into the final furlong and finished fast to
just get the place. PRINCE PIERCE brushed with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the
stretch under the whip, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and finished with good courage to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show.
SNOOSE GOOSE was rated towards the front of the field, came under urging while two to three wide on the turn, moved out behind the winner inside the
three-sixteenths and was out-kicked then just missed the trifecta. HELLO BUBBLES bumped with a rival early, settled towards the rear, saved ground on
the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and improved position. ON THE MUSCLE bumped with foes on both sides early, settled off the pace,
went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained ground but was no factor. BATTLEBUS was hustled from the start then
well placed under some urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved off the rail outside the furlong marker and came up
empty. LATENT REVENGE crossed over while going to the front, set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two path, lost the lead inside the
three-sixteenths and gave way. LIKE MIKE brushed with a foe at the start, bumped with ON THE MUSCLE early and was taken up then moved out, went
four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond. HERE COMES KYLE settled on the inside, saved ground while ridden along on the turn and also failed
to respond. (Rail at 16 Feet)

GENTILLY STAGE quickly moved clear to set the pace racing well off the inside, moved in to the two path entering the turn, edged away from rivals on that
bend, was put to urging past the quarter pole and opened up further, was eased up late. TIZ NEYNEY AND RAD chased the winner while inside a rival but
well off the inside, went three deep through the turn and asked for more past the three-eighths pole, proved no match for the winner but was second best.
HARPER'S DEELITE was brushed at the break, raced in behind foes heading to the turn, moved out from the two path to the four path by the three-eighths
early on that bend, came into upper stretch five wide and ran on for show honors. TIGER ROAD was bumped from both sides at the break, went two to
three wide outside a rival on the turn and ran on evenly in the stretch. DOUBLE COOL bumped a rival hard at the break and was slow to gather thereafter,
advanced inside a rival on the turn moving out to the three path through that bend, swung five wide into upper stretch then moved out seven deep and
widest near the three-sixteenths and ran on with mild late interest. FIX D FENCE brushed a rival and was slightly steadied at the start then stoutly urged
forward to chase inside, dropped back a bit on or just off the rail through the turn and continued to weaken. SENATOR CON chased from outside going four
wide on the turn and came up empty. FLEET RUN got away awkwardly and bumped with a rival at the start, raced well back in the three to four path through
the turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

EZMOSH went to the front, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, moved clear early on the backstretch, rounded the far turn on the inside, responded
well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch and was fully extended to last under strong urging. TWO EMMYS
was fractious entering the track from the paddock tunnel, came away in good order, was taken up nearing the first turn then checked in the three path early
on that bend, settled off the pace, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong,
was guided out coming to the sixteenth-pole then switched back to his inside lead, gained fast on the outside late and just missed on the wire while able to
get the place. VIVID VERSE was hustled from the start, contested the pace in the three path on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch then
tracked the pace, chased two to three wide on the far turn, brushed with foe then drifted out at the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive into
the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. IRISH HEATWAVE moved in early, checked sharply from between horses nearing the first turn, went
five wide on that bend, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while three to four wide on the far turn, brushed with a foe and was carried out near
the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and also finished willingly but just missed the show. DON'TASK DON'TTELL
was briefly fractious in the post parade, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked nearing
the quarter-pole then shifted into the two path entering the stretch, chased into the final furlong and was out-kicked. MARKITOFF bumped lightly with a foe
just after the start, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. KEEP QUIET (FR) was taken up nearing the first turn, went seven then six wide on that bend, settled on the outside, went
five then six wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was hustled from the start, went four wide
on the first turn, settled towards the front, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. LUNA DE
LOCO was reserved on the inside, moved closer near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground while dropping back through the far turn and was no factor.
DUNCASTLE was last away while off awkwardly then bumped lightly with a foe and was taken up, was taken up significantly nearing the first turn, went six
wide under tight restraint on that bend then was reserved on the outside, came under urging while four to five wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the
stretch and also failed to respond. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
CAEUS IN PASADENA settled off the pace, was asked while inside to the two path early on the turn, angled four wide late on that bend, floated six wide
into upper stretch, rallied on the outside, drifted out under a left-handed whip outside the eighth-pole then was switched to a right-handed whip while making
a bid into the final furlong, shook clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. KISS YOUR BRIDE dropped back while awkwardly into stride,
settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, dropped in near the furlong marker and
finished with good energy for the place. ROUND QUARTER pressed the pace on the outside, vied outside while in the three path on the turn, took a short
lead in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip into the final furlong then bumped lightly with a foe and was outfinished while just able to get the
show. FLASHYBOY BOBB was hustled from the start, dropped back midway down the backstretch then was angled to the outside, went six wide under
urging on the turn, floated nine wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong but flattened out and just missed the show. QUISTY BOY settled off the
pace, went three to four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, moved in under a drive near the furlong marker then back out around the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. HALFOURRETIREMENT bumped with a foe after the start, was urged along on the outside, chased four to five
wide on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, bumped lightly with a foe near the furlong marker and weakened. SIDNEY'S HUNCH lost his footing at the
start and was last away, raced on the outside under urging, was carried out nearing the half-mile pole, went four to five wide on the turn, gained into upper
stretch but lacked the needed kick in the final furlong and finished evenly. KING BAYOU was hustled from the start, set the pace while getting pressure to
his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and faded. RHETT N' SCARLETT bumped with a foe shortly after the start,
chased the pace down the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn and capitulated.
