Footnotes
HOLY MUCHACHO was allowed to settle early, began closing in four wide after six furlongs, caught the leaders from outside in mid stretch and drew away
under pressure. EMBRACE MY UNCLE raced three wide around the turn improving position, loomed a threat between horses in upper stretch, could not
match strides with the winner past the eighth-pole but was clearly second best. UNO BABY BIRD sprinted clear early, set a brisk pace inside to the stretch,
and gave way through the furlong grounds. CONSILIUM raced three wide to the turn within range, and faded before reaching the stretch. STARSHIP
BUBBA gave chase early between horses, moved inside around the turn, and lacked the needed late response. SUPER EDGAR came under pressure four
wide early on the turn, and had no response. AYCAPOTE steadied slightly inside while in the process of giving way past the half-mile pole.

Footnotes
SO CHARMING was away in good order and positioned forwardly on the first turn, raced along the inside and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch,
advanced up the rail to challenge for the lead mid-way on the far turn, shook free at head of the lane then held late under a driving finish. SHE FLED THE
SCENE tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, prompted for more near the quarter pole then dug in five wide in stretch run and was inching up on the
winner in final strides. STRELLA'S WAR secured inside position and settled while saving ground not too far off the early pace, was patiently handled on the
far turn then tipped out top stretch and put to a drive, advanced into close contention deep stretch but lacked the final kick to contend for the win. SHIKAKA
stalked three to four wide for six furlongs, vied three deep for the lead at the quarter pole, could not move on with the winner at head of the lane, remained in
close contention a furlong out then flattened. TALKTHETALK led the way around the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead racing
inside a duo at the quarter pole then tired in the drive. ANDI'S KITTEN rated three to four wide positioned off the second flight mid-way down the
backstretch, prompted four wide at three eighths pole but failed to respond and dropped back. GOLDEN TAP hopped then checked at the start, was
reserved in the back, saved ground on the far turn then had no response under right handed pressure upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARIALUISA steadied slightly outside CRACK OF DAWN shortly after the start, lagged well back for a half-mile despite some urging, suddenly began
picking it up around the turn inside, got through on the rail at the top of the stretch, wrested command from inside RHYTHM TREE and drew off under
pressure. RHYTHM TREE vied inside FIERY PRINCESS up the backstretch, battled back fending off challenges from UNCAPTURED RUBY and SHINING
COLORS late on the turn shifting to the two-path, could not handle the winner in upper stretch and ran on second best. SHINING COLORS moved up
menacingly four wide approaching the three-eighths, reached the throatlatch of RHYTHM TREE going by the five-sixteenths, but fizzled out abruptly by the
top of the stretch. UNCAPTURED RUBY broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and was away alertly, lodged a mild bid three wide midway on
the turn, but gave way through the lane. FIERY PRINCESS vied outside RHYTHM TREE early, and gave way with five-sixteenths remaining. CRACK OF
DAWN was up with the leaders before backing off entering the main track, stayed in range to the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
NIGHT WATCH secured inside position on the first turn then stalked along the inside down the backstretch, waited patiently on far turn then brushed with
FEATURE CREATURE while switching out a path top stretch, dug in determinedly four to five wide and got a head up in final stride. COMIC KITTEN was
forwardly placed around the first turn then advanced to vie for the lead with ALGODONAL, dueled outside foe around the far turn, battled on gamely through
the lane and got out-nodded for the win. ALGODONAL cleared on top and angled inside heading into the first turn, vied for the lead racing inside of COMIC
KITTEN down the backstretch and continued to battle back gamely through the lane and got denied in final stride. STARSHIP TRIBBLES steadied entering
the first turn then steadied repeatedly around the first turn, settled while rated near the inside to the far turn, hustled up and shifted out entering top stretch,
advanced closer along the far outside then yielded late. FEATURE CREATURE steadied nearing the first turn then tracked the pace through early stages,
prompted around the far turn then brushed with eventual winner top stretch, continued in close contention then had no closing kick. FANTASTIC KINGDOM
raced in the back although never too far back, shifted out top of the lane, gained ground then shifted to the inside, lacked late racing room and steadied.
JANET B DOESIT ALL rated off the second flight through early stages, prompted to advance on the outside late far turn but came up empty and gave way.

Footnotes
GIVEMETWENTY saved ground within range for three furlongs, shifted out to the three-path leaving the turn, shied out briefly from left-hand pressure in mid
stretch, straightened out and drove past the leaders from outside. LIVING VICARIOUSLY set the pace inside, could not cope with the winner in deep stretch
but dug in to save the place. SEA TRIDENT pressed the pace outside LIVING VICARIOUSLY to the stretch, and lacked a final bid. AMERICAN PHENOM
broke slow and was outrun to the stretch, and was going well belatedly inside while not fully clear behind horses. MORE LIKE IT cut the corner and put in a
mild run coming off the turn, but flattened out late. EXTRA DOUGH brushed the left side of the gate coming out, swung five wide past the quarter-pole and
could not gain. LANSE MITAN went along in easy striking distance three wide, shifted out a bit further at the top of the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
HELPING LISA D saved ground and rated through early going then prompted along the rail on the final turn, cut the corner and advanced to duel for the
lead, kept on determinedly under steady pressure and edged away deep stretch. BOLD SCRIPT tracked the pace along the outside down the backstretch,
prompted and raced in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, vied three deep with a furlong left to run then lacked the closing response to advance with the
winner. GUACAMOLE set a pressured pace down the backstretch then vied for the lead while maintaining a slight edge on the far turn, battled back
between foes with a furlong left to run then gave way grudgingly in final sixteenth. BELLA CIAO applied pace pressure to GUACAMOLE through early
stages, vied for the lead in two path around the turn then failed to sustain bid upper stretch and gave way. TAKE CHARGECHRISTY raced between foes
not far off the lead at the half mile marker, prompted but failed to advance around the turn then came out wider and faded. BIMINI raced in range through
early stages then came up empty on the far turn.

Footnotes
FIBER OPTIC dueled for the lead outside HIRE THE LADY for three furlongs, gained the upper hand being roused outside the eighth-pole, and moved clear
under pressure. CAT'S ASTRAY saved ground behind the battling leaders to the end of the turn, shifted out for the drive, could not reach the winner but
finished willingly to best the others. PAULA ANDREA advanced two then three wide approaching the stretch, had aim outside the leaders and finished
one-paced. GOLCONDA (FR) was outrun early, cut the corner into the stretch, went around a tiring HIRE THE LADY into the final furlong and improved
mildly. TRIXIE'S TIME raced in the second flight four wide to the end of the turn, and made no headway widest in the stretch. NILESTAR had her head
turned to the left and spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, steadied along the rail entering the turn at the back, and remained outrun. ANJALI
stayed in range early three wide, shifted further out and gave way approaching the stretch. HIRE THE LADY dueled inside the winner to the top of the
stretch, and retreated through the final furlong.

Footnotes
UP IN SMOKE was away in good order, dropped back to last between calls into the turn, swung wide beginning to find stride approaching the stretch, kicked
into gear, surged with willing response and finished with a flourish to win going away. MERSEYSIDE vied for the lead in opening stages and continued to
match strides with BALLADONNIA into the turn, shook free near the five sixteenths pole then pulled away to a clear advantage at the furlong marker, stayed
on with good response but was no match when the sharp victor swept by. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE raced along the inside positioned in range of the early
leaders, prompted two wide at the quarter pole then stayed on with interest along the inside in stretch run and prevailed for a share. LET'S BE HONEST
veered out, bumped with foe and slightly steadied at the start, took closer order then steadied along the inside at seven sixteenths pole, continued to try and
made a rebid along then outside in the lane but needed more for late impact. RICHIES GREAT GIRL got bumped back at the start, raced in the back then
hustled up along the outside around the turn, gained position upper stretch then flattened out. AUNT NADINE raced off the top pair in early going, continued
in close range and hustled along three to four wide around the turn then gave way. BAHAMIAN GIRL hustled up from the get go but lacked early kick and
raced off the pace then urged along the outside around the turn but failed to move on. BELLADONNIA vied for the lead racing inside of MERSEYSIDE in
early stages, continued to match into the turn then failed to advance with rival near five sixteenths pole then dropped back and not persevered with in late
stages.

Footnotes
MIAMI CROCKETT pressed the pace outside BOLT from the outset, gained command in midstretch and repelled late challenges from both flanks for a
hard-fought decision. REMASTER (IRE) bumped with FENTYNOLA at the start, tracked outside the leaders into the turn, had aim three wide through upper
stretch, and finished gamely to just miss. BAHAMIAN PRINCE bumped with NO NAY MAYBE at the start, saved ground behind the leaders to the stretch,
got past BOLT and moved to the rail with a sixteenth remaining and could not reach the top two. BOLT bumped with NO NAY MAYBE at the start, set the
pace hounded by the eventual winner, and gave way the last eighth of a mile. FENTYNOLA bumped with REMASTER at the start, raced three wide around
the turn, and improved position late while never a factor. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) bobbled and was bumped between BAHAMIAN PRINCE and BOLT at the
start, bobbled behind the front flight approaching the top of the stretch, and could not gain. SARASOTA BOY gave chase four wide to the stretch, and tired.
PRICEY VICTORY hit the right side of the gate and was slow to begin, and trailed inside.

FAST VENEZUELA advanced up the inside and set the pace through early going, widened to a clear advantage on the turn then kept clear under steady
urging in the lane. DON'T GET KHOZY raced widest off the early pace, continued on the far outside and showed response late turn, set down for the drive,
came in a few paths and produced a solid finish. MIDNIGHT GEM raced in the back in opening quarter, hustled along racing two wide on the turn, continued
with response two path in stretch run and cleared a share. AFANDI was the closest pursuer of the early leader and chased after rival around the turn, stayed
on upper stretch then faded in the final furlong. PROBABLY GRACE saved ground in early stages, switched out on the turn, hustled along six wide in the
lane and move into close contention. MAGICGIRL hustled along in steady pursuit along the inside, continued to save ground and pushed along in the turn
then gave way in the lane. MARCHING IN steadied awkwardly at the start then hustled along and showed response to gain position on the turn but failed to
keep pace and tired in the drive. BLESSED BEAST broke on top then lacked response and dropped back. CROWN REAL showed response in the opening
quarter then retreated.
