Footnotes
MICHELLE'S GRACE lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground through the turn, moved out for the drive, roused, split foes, late surge to be up at
the wire. WILLOW MOON broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn along the inside, shook well clear past the furlong
marker, could not contain the winner in the final strides, held the place. COUNT UR BLESS'N in the second flight off the inside, angled out three wide late in
the turn, staged a mild rally to be slowly gaining late. SUSPECT THE WORST within striking distance along the inside, came off the inside a bit for the
stretch run, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. CINNAFRIJOLE forwardly placed while three wide, weakened in the drive. FLORA GROVE lacked
speed, three wide through the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. WARM BEAUTY last away, trailed well back in the two path, passed a
couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. SHES GOT ME GOING lacked speed, remained always back. KEENE'S DESIRE pressed the runner up from the
outside for a half, backed up through the stretch. PORTION in the main group outside, four wide out of the turn, faded through the stretch.

home, long drive, dug in gamely late while between horses at the wire. RONAMO bothered at the start, raced back, moved closer in the second turn, waited
briefly midway on the second turn, moved out three wide into the lane, outside bid late, missed. FIRST CITIZEN pressed the pace off the inside, took over in
the second turn, before a half, showed the way into the final turn, responded when challenged into the stretch, long drive closest to the inside, proved
stubborn to the end. REVENIO lacked speed while racing off the inside, came three wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick.
JACKS FIRE BALLS bothered at the start, trailed much of the way, made little impact. while continued to save ground. AGITATOR within striking distance
three wide, gave way midway on the final turn. WE'RE STILL HERE broke in, cleared to the inside, set the pace for less than a half, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
ITALIAN JUSTICE forwardly placed off the inside, engaged the leader from the outside through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, proved
best in the drive while being kept to task. FIESTA IN VEGAS within striking distance off the inside, moved a bit closer behind the winner entering the stretch,
proved no match for that one, held the place. HUSH Y'ALL back off the pace just off the inside, three wide into the lane, rallied, getting to the runner up late,
clear of the others. ATHENASWAY went one paced while racing off the inside. FRONTIER WOMAN clipped heels, bobbled and steadied soon after the
start, raced back, four wide turn, improved position in the drive with some mild late interest. FRIGID lacked speed inside, continued to save ground through
the turn, lacked a serious response in the bid. WESTERN ATTIRE four wide into the turn, failed to respond when asked for the drive. WACCA WACCA
WACCA sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner late in the turn. FLAT PRECIOUS stalked
the pace in the three path, had little left for the drive. FAIRY shuffled a bit in some traffic into the turn, remained always back. SETTLE IT broke back,
showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
LANEYS LOVE in the second flight inside, crept closer while continuing to save ground late in the turn, switched out for room approaching the furlong
ground, bid soon after, drove quickly clear. MILLIE'S AN ANGEL took command soon after the start, set the pace inside, was no match for the winner the
final furlong, clearly second best. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE pressed the runner up from the outside, could do little with that one entering the stretch, no match
winner, clear of the others. THURSDAY MORNING within striking distance while racing in the three path, continued evenly through the lane in lacking a
closing response. ELLA'S MY GIRL off slow, raced far back for a half off the inside, showed some mild, belated interest to improve position.
CLOUDYWITHACHANCE forwardly placed, in the two path into the lane, lacked a response in the drive. BE DONE WITH IT void of speed after breaking a
step slow, raced inside improved slightly while never a threat. LYNNE T tired while racing off the inside. DUES PAID broke inward and slowly, mid pack
early, had nothing for the drive. BLACK PATENT SHOES broke in, a bit rank soon after, was never involved. HAMAZING MARNIE tired after racing off the
linside.

Footnotes
STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO close from the start from between horses, closest to the leader into the turn, ranged up and took over turning for home, slowly
drove clear under steady handlin. LOUISE THE LASER broke alertly, got clear soon after, set the pace inside, offered brief resistance when the winner
came alongside entering the stretch then proved no match, remained clear of the others. DAVE'S BABY GIRL within striking distance while racing outside
went evenly in the drive to prove no match for the top two, came back to narrowly gain the show. HIGH CLASS EURO settled off the pace and the inside,
lacked a response in the drive. SHE'S A LUCKY ONE lacked early foot off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, improved position slightly without
posing a serious threat. WISE EYES settled in mid pack early outside, dropped steadily to the inside through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on
for the drive. NORTHERN CONNECT saved ground to no avail. ANITA MARIE forwardly placed while racing off the inside, faded. HEART'S PASSION off a
step slow, was not a factor while racing off the inside. CRITTER lost action late backstretch, moved out wide, remained well back.

ROAD TEST raced back off the early pace and the inside, made a strong move into contention three wide in the second turn, bid upper stretch, drove well
clear. LADY CLEOPATRA away in good order, narrowly showed the way onto the backstretch in the two patch, larger lead into the far turn, shrugged off a
rival turning for home, was challenged by the winner soon after, no match for that one, remained clear for the place. H. M. S. PINAFORE dueled into the first
turn closest to the inside, prompted the runner up in the run up the backstretch, lacked a closing punch through the stretch, saved the show. MOLLY'S
GAME settled in mid pack toward the inside, two path through the final turn, lacked a serious response in the drive. MOONLIGHT TRAIN lacked early foot
off the inside, race four to five wide through the final turn, made little impact in the drive. DESHA forwardly placed, crept closer and lodged a brief bid outside
the runner up late in the final turn, faltered in the drive. MOSTLY AWESOME reluctant to load, fell back to trail after the start, was never a threat. SEXY
DANCE was never involved. COWGIRL CALLIE forwardly placed for six furlongs, gave way late in the second turn, pulled up soon after, walked in.

Footnotes
THE GREAT DANSKY prompted the pace from the three path, advanced and challenged into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker, drew away late
under firm handling. SHANGHAI'S DREAM broke alertly, set the pace inside, dueled with the winner through upper stretch then could not keep up, clearly
second best, returned bleeding from the mouth. HANEY BOYS pressed the pace, off the inside, closer between rivals late in the turn, no match for the top
two in the drive, came back for the show while between rivals at the wire. JEALOUS EYES lacked speed, three wide through the turn, in some traffic
entering the stretch, vied for show, outkicked for that position late. I LIVED IT settled behind the pace, slipped through along the rail to improve into the lane,
closest to the top two a furlong out, also was outfinished for the show spot. MAYBE A SPIDER within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn,
lacked a rally. BEAVER HAT hesitated at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to mid pack, steadied behind horses late backstretch,
moved out to be five wide into the stretch, remained back. RIP IT RYAN trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
AUGIE broke well, raced forwardly along the inside, behind traffic late in the turn, waited along the inside past the furlong marker, altered course to the
outside, bid, finished gamely between horses to prove best. STRIKE THAT moved up to become a forward factor into the turn off the inside, was four wide
turning for home, late bid outside, not enough in the final strides, narrowly gained the place. IMPRESSED away in good order, dueled up front off the inside,
narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved stubbornly. BEST OF GREELEY settled off the pace, outside the winner in some traffic late in the
turn, continued in company past the furlong marker, steered out slightly late, lacked the necessary closing response. MARKET KING lacked early foot, three
wide through the turn, improved slightly while out in the strip. NAUGHTY ALFRED broke well, narrowly set the pace along the inside, weakened in the drive.
JUNGLE WARFARE broke back, dropped inside, lacked a closing kick in the drive. SABRENA'S BLING void of speed, five wide through the turn, picked off
a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ALKHAATAM remained back after racing four wide. LULLABY BLING in the second flight early, was five wide
late in the turn, backed up through the stretch. STAR OF KODIAK pressured the pace while racing three wide, gave way. NICE WORK was finished early,
trailed home.

PARADE FIELD in some traffic through the first turn, continued in midpack, raced in the two path and in traffic again late in the second bend, set down when
clear, in time up rail. CARIBBEAN (AUS) prompted some soft fractions off the inside, put a head in front when straightened for home, dug in gamely late to
narrowly miss. MICA BAY forwardly placed out in the strip, continued three wide and in a forward position through the second turn, lacked a winning punch
late, narrowly gained the show. MUTINEER five wide into the first bend, continued to race outside, four wide through the second turn, in striking position
midstretch, flattened a bit late, missed the show while between horses at the wire. STARRING JOHN WAIN in some traffic, tight first turn, mid pack, five
wide through much of the final turn, also did not have enough for the show late while widest of the second flight. TAKE CHARGE NOW broke on top, set a
soft pace along the inside faltered in the final furlong. MAJORS VINDICATION forwardly placed while saving ground, had little left for the drive. BOTERO in
some traffic through the first turn, three wide trip, failed to muster a rally. KNOWYOUROPTIONS remained back while racing toward the inside. PEPPERED
was never a factor. TRACKING GOLD off slowly, always outrun.
