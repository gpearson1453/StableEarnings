Footnotes
FLEDERMAUS broke sharply to gain the advantage in the opening furlong, prompted the pace inside a rival into the backstretch, edged forward after a half
to dictate terms into the far turn, shook clear nearing upper stretch, shifted out racing through the lane but steadily widened under firm right handed
pressure.. READY TO MINGLE broke inwards exchanging light contact with MORE THAN TEDDY, was righted to track off the second flight outside foes
racing to the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to,edge a rival for the place honors. CPL. DIONICIO, caught four wide
tracking off the first flight in the opening stages, advanced three deep after a half to gain terms with the first flight, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to
upper stretch and flattened out. DONNIE BRASCO was rated off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted four wide entering the far turn
gaining striking distance, was taken in hand racing while drifting inwards into upper stretch while his rider attempted to correct his course but continued to
lug inwards while finishing in hand through the last furlong. BRANDY CHASER tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, was
prompted to advance inside foes when presented an opening racing into upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. MORE THAN TEDDY exchanged
brushes at the start, settled last while climbing a bit near the inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. LEAVING HOME, pulled his way
to terms with the leader pressing the pace into the backstretch, continued between foes into the second bend and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CULTURAL MANDATE broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin through the backstretch into the turn, then held the challenge
of RETURN THE FAVOR through the stretch to prove best under firm right handed encouragement. The latter broke outwards bumping MARDI GRAS GIRL
while crossing over the path of MEMORABLE ANGEL, was righted to track the pacesetter inside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch while
moving to striking distance but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. FIDDLER, carried out at the start, was settled well off the field while angling to the
inside, saved ground to the lane and displayed some late interest to edge several rivals for a share on the wire. MEMORABLE ANGEL, restless in the gate,
broke slowly while being pinched back at the start, gained a position off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and was
just outfinished for a share. MY COTTON CANDY tracked off the second flight while angling inwards nearing the turn, shifted out approaching upper stretch,
was fanned five wide entering the lane and had no late kick while missing for a share. MARDI GRAS GIRL, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to track
the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening quarter, shifted three wide nearing the lane while being prompted to lodge a brief bid but came up empty
entering the stretch. CONGRATS GOLDA tracked off the second flight under light rating racing three deep into the turn and faded nearing the stretch.
CONCERTOS APPEAL ducked out at the start into the path of FIDDLER, was settled outside rivals and never gained contention. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE RIDER OF MEMORABLE ANGEL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RETURN THE FAVOR ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT
THE START WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BERRY angled to the rail while being urged along in the opening stages to gain a position just off the leaders racing into the turn, shifted out
three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest command and kick clear under firm right handed encouragement
BAHAMA PEARL broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a comfortable advantage racing into the turn, came under pressure to maintain the
lead in upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner late. FLAMING INDY was urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the
pacesetter racing into the turn, closed the gap to lodge a brief bid entering upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. TIMELESS DI swerved well to the
outside at the start, was righted to track the leaders in second flight racing four wide to the turn, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch but had no late
response. LINCOLN CENTER broke a step slowly, was settled off the second flight while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch but never
gained contention. STACK SHACK settled outside foes dropping off the second flight and failed to menace. SIDNEY SUE broke slowly and trailed the field
to the stretch. DRAMATONE made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes racing to the turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LAST PROMISE came in at the start shifting into the path of MY COWBOY, was held up off that rival after the opening sixteenth, continued under light
reserve along the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance into the backstretch, angled out three wide nearing the far turn while being
prompted to advance with an early challenge, took over in that path midway through the second bend then held sway to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. THE CURT FOX (GB), reserved last along the inside from the outset to the far turn, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with late interest to prove best of the others. QUALITY STEP was rated outside foes in the opening stages tracking the leaders from out of striking
distance to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and gained some position between foes in the closing stages. MY COWBOY,
unsettled in the gate before the start, came through close quarters along the rail at the break, then sprinted clear into the backstretch, held sway to the far
turn but came up empty once headed by the winner. ASTUTE WARRIOR was rated out of striking distance along the inside to the far turn, shifted out while
awaiting an opening racing into upper stretch, angled outside foes in the closing stages but offered no rally. BUNSTER, forwardly placed stalking the
pacesetter from just out of striking distance in the opening half, was prompted to close the gap on that foe in tandem with eventual winner racing into the far
turn but came up empty in the drive. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MY COWBOY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE START WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
MY BOY LENNY broke sharply to gain the advantage while angling inwards, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating racing just off the rail
into the turn, held sway on a widening advantage while shifting out nearing upper stretch and came under some right handed encouragement and to extend
the margin to the end. TOWN CLASSIC tracked just off the pacesetter three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch,
was prompted to advance in that path lodging a brief bid nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum while proving best of the others.
GENERAL PADDY switched out five wide in early stages racing as part of the second flight, conceded some position nearing the turn while angling inwards,
split foes entering the turn while angling to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position along the inside late. DIVINE
AMBITION broke in the air, was quickly righted to gain a position tracking just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn, angled inside the leader
nearing upper stretch but faded in the drive. LUDINGTON tracked the pacesetter along the rail as part of the second flight racing into the turn and steadily
faded nearing the lane. CAVE RUN broke slowly, was settled in hand racing to the turn and failed to menace. SACRAMENTO Q was a brief factor in second
flight racing four wide between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
NORTH DAKOTA, lightly brushed at the start, was settled in hand near the inside leaving the chute, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, was
prompted to advance after a half racing three deep to the second bend, shifted out four wide while coming under a left handed prompt to advance nearing
upper stretch, readily took charge in that path entering the lane under left handed encouragement and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue
was decided. IDLE TIME tracked the first flight from out of striking distance between foes racing to the backstretch, gained some momentum advancing just
inside the eventual winner racing into the far turn, angled inside foes to advance along the rail entering the lane and proved best of the others. TIZ LIGHT
THE WAY gained the lead along the rail leaving the chute, conceded that advantage while switching outside a rival to attend the pace into the backstretch,
pressed the issue between foes on the far turn to upper stretch, couldn't match the top pair but finished with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire.
ENJOY THE MUSIC bobbled slightly at the break brushing the eventual winner, was righted to stalk the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted
out three deep leaving the midway point of the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch but flattened out when failing to match the winner in
late stages. WINTER'S WONDER tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight to the far turn and continued evenly between rivals in that path
late. SAUCY DEREK, urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, angled to the rail nearing the backstretch, dueled inside foes entering the
far turn and emptied out in the drive. TOPSFIELD was settled between foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. RIONERO tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the far turn and came up empty. O DANNY BOY, rank under restraint while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dropped out
early. BURNING BRIGHT proved no factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE GUY broke readily to race on terms with a rival on the pace stalking that foe under light rating into the backstretch, shifted outwards after being
lightly bumped midway through the backstretch by RICKY RUN, continued three deep into the second bend to challenge for command after five furlongs,
then quickly forged clear, held sway under pressure past midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire. SILENT MISCHIEF, caught in close quarters at
the start, was held up off the second flight to the backstretch, switched outside foes commencing a steady, three wide advance after a half and proved best
of the others in the closing stages. SHIFT THE BLAME was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, then advanced four wide
into upper stretch to improve position late. OLD NEWS, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, briefly contested
the issue inside foes but gave way racing into the far turn. RICKY RUN, forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, angled inwards entering the
backstretch while being prompted to make an early challenge then bumping the eventual winner, pressed the issue between foes into the second bend and
quickly came up empty. MAMAIGOTTHIS, fractious in the gate before the start, broke awkwardly, settled well off the field to the far turn and passed only
tiring rivals. COOL RIVER DS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled inside after a half and faded early. DIAMOND
DREAMER came through close quarters at the start to track the leaders three deep into the backstretch, shifted inwards to race between foes after a half
and gave way into the far turn. SALLY'S SALUTE was a brief factor inside foes as part of the second flight but dropped out early. DELIVERED BY AKISS,
caught in close quarters at the start, settled outside foes and proved no threat.

Footnotes
INCA PRINCESS was settled last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes after three furlongs, commenced a steady advance three deep racing into
the far turn, moved to terms with the leaders leaving midstretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm left handed encouragement. NERISSA, pulling
against light rating from the outset, switched outside a rival racing into the first turn to assume command, dictated the pace along the rail on her own
courage to the second bend, was roused to maintain her advantage racing into upper stretch and just failed to contain the winner. V K LEGACY tracked off
the first flight a bit off the inside under light rating in the opening half, steadily gained terms with the pacesetter between foes racing into upper stretch and
was just outkicked by the top pair. TWO STEP BEAT was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing into the
lane but continued with interest to improve position to the end. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and continued
evenly three deep between foes into the lane. BIZ MAKER, unhurried while angling inside, dropped out last racing through the backstretch, angled out five
wide entering the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. VUYELWA settled off the second flight racing outside a rival in the
opening half, continued between foes on the far turn but offered no rally. MISS WROTE sprinted to the lead leaving the chute, but became rank when
coming under firm restraint nearing the first turn, was held up off the pacesetter to rack that rival along the inside, was prompted to advance nearing the far
turn but emptied out early. LA CAFETERA angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight racing to the backstretch but was through after a half.
