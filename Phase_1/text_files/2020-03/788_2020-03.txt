Footnotes
MEAN ERIKA stalked the pace, raced three wide in the lane and finished well to be clear under strong pressure. REGAL JAZZ stalked the pace, raced
along the inside into the lane and finished second best. LEGENDARY SONG stalked the pace, raced three wide in the stretch and made a mild late gain.
LADYBUG'S HOLIDAY pressed the pace and weakened. MARK HER PRECIOUS failed to respond. S C ANGEL stalked the pace from the outside and
weakened. HARERAISING vied for the lead from the inside and tired. HOLY CABALLERO was slow early and never threatened. EIGHT SISTERS failed to
sustain a bid. ITS NOON SOMEWHERE raced far back and never threatened.
