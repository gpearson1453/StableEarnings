Footnotes
P R RADIO STAR forwardly placed while off the inside, advance three wide turning for home, challenged soon after, brief duel, kicked clear. HE'S NO BULL
moved up to show the way inside, dueled through the turn closest to the rail, shook off the other speed as the winner was moving to challenge, briefly
dueled inside that one then could not keep up, narrowly lasted for the place. CONQUEROR outrun in the early going, came three wide out of the turn,
finished willingly to be gaining on the runner up late. GRAY SKY bumped at the start, raced back, improved through the turn four wide, flattened out a bit in
the drive. SING HIM A SONG forwardly placed along the inside, came up empty when called on for the drive. ROCKYS WARRIOR bumped at the start,
pressed early off the inside, advanced to duel outside the runner up through the turn then faltered in the drive. QUALIFLY remained back and three wide.
CEEKY tired four wide. TRES EQUIS steadily faded while racing three wide.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY WHO forwardly placed off the inside, advanced on the leaders three wide, bumped by the runner up when challenging that one past the furlong
marker, floated out in the run to the wire by that same rival, proved best in determined fashion. RED AGAIN away well, dueled up front in the two path, vied
between foes late in the final turn, shook clear entering the stretch, drifted out, bumped the winner a furlong out, continued to drift and float that foe out,
outkicked in the late going. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
DAPPER JACK dueled up front along the inside, continued to alternate into the far turn, weakened in the drive, saved the show. CARMELO forwardly
placed in the three path, continued in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, challenged briefly three wide second turn, failed to sustain that advance
in the drive. ELITCH went one paced throughout toward the inside. TALES OF WAR remained back in failing to menace. TRAVEL WEST was never
involved. CADDO DADDO raced back, gave way in the second turn, pulled up late in the final bend, vanned off.

Footnotes
AQWAAM with the pace from the start inside, continued to vie along the rail firmly in hand through some soft fractions, quickly shook clear upper stretch, not
threatened the final furlong while being kept to task. JAY VEE BEE last to leave, raced back early while saving ground, began moving a bit closer in the final
turn, two path into lane, split foes, rallied to earn the place, no threat to the winner. NEXT GEN forwardly placed off the inside, dropped to the two path in the
second turn, lacked a closing punch to be caught late for the place. LNGTERMRELATIONSHP void of speed off the inside, four out to five wide turning for
home, staged a mild rally to improved position a bit, not enough to contend for the place spot. HARD TO PARK lacked speed off the inside, moved a bit
closer three wide in the final turn, flattened out in the drive. EXECUTIVE BRANCH settled off the early pace inside, came three wide into the stretch, also
lacked a closing response. CHANNEL CROSSING pressed the winner through those soft fractions then gave way in the drive. ONE LAST STRIKE was
finished early.

Footnotes
LIAM'S PRIDE with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled through the turn, three wide into the lane, kicked clear. DUST DEVIL broke back, trailed
early, raced three wide through the turn, rallied to narrowly prevail for the place, no match for the winner. VIOLENT PASS forwardly placed off the inside,
three wide into the turn, four wide exiting, also proved no match for the winner, outkicked for the placed spot while between horses at the wire.
UNDERSCORE behind the early pace, bit closer in some traffic in the turn while remaining off the inside, closest to the winner a furlong out, weakened.
FAST CASH in the second flight while along the inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, lacked the needed response. PLANE TALK main body
early outside, four wide through the turn, had nothing for the drive. SMACK ATTACK broke to the outside, was straightened, showed little while four wide
through the turn. QUALITY WARRIOR narrowly helped show the way along the inside for a half, was giving way in the drive when encountering traffic
midstretch.

Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE broke out, recovered to move up and duel up front along the inside, clear into the lane, drew off under a steady hand ride to win ridden
out. REELFOOT forwardly placed outside, asked three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place late. ALEX'S STRIKE
void of speed well out in the strip, four out to five wide late in the turn when beginning to rally, finished up willingly to be getting to the runner up late down
the middle of the strip. ZEROED IN broke on top, set the early pace off the inside, dueled through the turn outside the winner then began to weaken.
ATTAIN SUCCESS lacked speed, three wide into the turn, two path exiting, had little left for the drive. GOLDEN TIGER made little impact while racing
toward the inside. MOST AMUSING in mid pack early outside, three wide turn, tired in the drive. JIMMY AT LAST settled inside, backed up through the
stretch. TEMPLE BAR last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MY GOLDEN DIABLO within striking distance outside, challenged three wide late in the turn, shook clear inside the furlong marker, enough to hold the
runner up safe in the late going. CHICKEN HAWK away in good order, tracked the lead pack through the turn toward the inside, steered out exiting the bend
to lose some ground to the winner, set down, finished willingly to be getting to that rival late. PAY DIRT broke sharp, pressed the leader from the two path,
continued to vie into the stretch, briefly offered resistance to the winner, stayed on to save the show. MR. COUGAR off step slow, raced back and reserved,
improved through traffic. JAMES'S MOONSHINE in mid pack early outside, four wide through the turn, got out when moving a bit closer late in the turn, was
straightened and finished up evenly. MACHO ROCCO broke well, showed the way early after moving to the inside, dueled through the turn, weakened in
the drive. HAMAZING SONG went evenly in the three path. TRAFFIC CONTROL lacked speed, made little impact three wide. FLAMIN FIRE broke back,
failed to menace while racing four wide. BOO BE RIGHT in some traffic early behind the first flight inside, had nothing for the drive. SMARTY GRIMES was
finished after a half.

Footnotes
MISTY BLUE broke alertly, got clear before a quarter, breather turn, cruised home while being kept to task. JEWEL THIEF broke toward the back, moved up
to chase the winner into and through the turn, proved no match for that one in the drive. SYMPHONY HALL forwardly placed along the inside, continued to
save ground in pursuit of the top two through the turn, had nothing for that pair through the lane. FOREIGN EXCHANGE in the main body outside, four wide
into the turn, three wide exiting, when evenly through the lane. COMPETITIVE FIRE broke back, improved into the lane on the outside, not a serious threat.
FIFTHATNARRAGANSET back off the pace and the inside, failed to respond when called on for the drive. CHEROKEE CHATTER in the second flight while
between horses, came in slightly to tighten up TAP AND SPIN midway on the turn, continued one paced to come up empty in the drive. TAP AND SPIN in
the second group along the inside, in tight along the rail midway on the turn, checked up, fell back.

Footnotes
WHITMORE last to leave, crept up closer along the inside, continued to bide his time while saving ground through the turn, eased out into the two path
when straightened for home, kicked down the leader and won going away. MR. JAGERMEISTER broke sharp, set the pace inside, shook clear into the
lane, proved no match for the winner late, comfortably held the place. WENDELL FONG away in good order, raced within striking distance outside, three
path through the turn, along for the show while widest in the drive, no threat to the top pair. BOLDOR fell back to trail after the start, went evenly in the drive
to make little impact. SHARE THE UPSIDE pressed the runner up off the inside, was losing touch with that one into the lane when brushed slightly by the
winner in upper stretch, weakened, lost the show late.

Footnotes
SHEDARESTHEDEVIL settled off the pace toward the inside through the first turn, patiently handled the middle half mile, moved out a bit for the drive,
angled out then back in when accelerating to split foes inside the furlong grounds, finished up willingly to prove best in a solid effort. ALTA'S AWARD asked
a bit to move closer past the wire the first time, stalked the pace three wide, advanced and challenged in the three path turning for home, put a head in front
inside the furlong marker, could not contain the winner to be outkicked late. MOTU closest to the leader while off the inside, challenged between horses
turning home, could not match strides with the top two late. QUEEN BRIDGET settled off the pace and the inside, in the second flight four wide through the
second turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a serious closing punch. RING LEADER broke on top, rank while attempting to get out in the three path into
the first turn, moved inside, continued to show the way when confronted through the second turn, weakened steadily the final furlong. RAGGEDY ANNIE in
mid pack while racing just off the inside, continued to race one paced, lacked a closing response. FIFTYSHAYS OFGREEN last to leave, raced back, four
out to five wide in the second turn, also failed to muster a rally when called on. TURTLE TRAX remained always back while racing toward the inside.

Footnotes
YOU SPLIT TENS allowed the leaders to go early, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, steered out three wide when advancing late in the final
turn, challenged on the outside entering the stretch, powered clear to finish up strongly. ISTILLGOTIT pressed the leader early off the inside, challenged that
one between foes turning for home, briefly dueled with the winner then could not keep up, all out to last for the place. SATELLITE void of early foot,
improved inside into the lane, angled out, finished willingly while too late for the winner, getting to the runner up. TITOCHIP unhurried in the early going,
moved closer along the inside far turn, flattened out a bid in the drive to lose the show. HYNDFORD in mid pack off the inside, raced in some traffic in the
second bend three wide, went evenly in the drive. MAHALO JOHN forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. LOOKIE LOO lacked
speed off rail, remained back in lacking a closing bid. VOKAZAK void of speed in trailing much of the way, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. COLLECTION broke on top, narrowly set the pace, caved in when headed. STORMINSIDE reluctant to load, stumbled badly to begin, raced back
and four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide again through the second bend, remained back. UNSTABLED tired after racing four wide most of the
way.
