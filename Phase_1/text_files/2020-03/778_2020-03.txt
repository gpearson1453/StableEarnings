WINTER FOG hustled to the front, set the pace two wide to the stretch, responded when set down and held on stubbornly. BIG HEATER stalked the winner
from the rail to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but was outfinished while saving the place. ICE OR FIRE also was stalking to the turn, raced two
wide to the stretch then could not make an impact late. I'LL DASH FOR GOLD ducked inward sharply and bumped ROCKY ROSES hard, recovered and
was hurried up to chased the winner, raced three then four wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was also outfinished. SECOND BOLD
had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then was closing the gap to the line. ROCKY ROSES was bumped off stride by I'LL DASH FOR GOLD at the
start, pressed three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

TASTE'S LEGEND was never far back, saved ground to the stretch then eased out, rallied once clear and wore down ZEDEKIAH late. ZEDEKIAH pressed
the pace two wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch, dug in but could not stall the winner. CALL ME SOUL was allowed to settle for a half mile, raced
two wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. SOONER BETTER trailed the second turn, got fanned out to the four path to the stretch and was
outfinished late. HARDY CHISEL went right to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken and weakened. REY COLIMAN settled
mid pack for a half mile, was three wide on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
PIONEEROFTHESTORM went right to the front, set all the pace, saved ground to the stretch then dug in determinedly to hold off his stable neighber.
SHIFTY DANCER chased his stable partner to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished but
second best. ARCH ANTHEM had no speed, settled for a half mile, tried to rally three wide on the second turn but could not threaten the top two in the
drive. EARNEST had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. MAGIC RATE pressed the
winner for six furlongs, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. AMERICAN CAMP tracked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but
came up empty in the drive.

PRINCE was settled to the half, raced two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but was easily second best. FANTASTIC ARAGORN had no
speed, settled to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but could not impact the top two. PAMPERS N' BOOTS also was unhurried to the second
turn then saved ground to no avail. UR NOT MY PRESIDNT pressed the winner for five furlongs three wide but was outrun to the stretch and tired in the
drive. KID ARCADE had no speed and was never a threat. GET LIKE ME stalked the pace to the backstretch, went wrong leaving the nine sixteenths, was
pulled up and vanned off.

wide to the stretch, was not a threat to the winner but just missed second and third. CHARMING LASS pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, was
outkicked to mid stretch then got outfinished in the final sixteenth. BIG FUN tracked the leader to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed
late response. JUSTA POPPIN had no speed, raced three wide on the turn but was not a threat in the drive. BLUE BREEZE broke awkwardly and had no
speed, raced off the rail on the turn and did not offer a late response. SUBTWEET had no speed and was never a threat. IMA SILVER LADY chased the
