Footnotes
ANITA LUCKY BREAK moved inside the early leader to press, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, ran out entering the stretch, widened into the final
furlong and held under steady urging. ARCHANA was slow to settle, raced the five path around the turn and was going fastest at the end. DRIVER'S
LICENSE broke slowly, lagged inside, angled out steadily through the lane and was up for the show. ALPHARDINI ducked out sharply a stride out of the
gate, stayed out from the rail and lacked a closing. SEPTEMBER BREEZE was forced out leaving the gate, raced two wide between rivals and tired. SIX
PACK GAL took command at once, made the way two wide outside the winner into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
RORAIMA DOS dueled inside of MISTRESS AT SEA, cleared away from that foe into the turn and widened her lead turning for home, drifted outwards a bit
at the furlong marker, but was kept to task while holding sway to the wire. ZANDORA saved ground from midpack before angling to the three path in upper
stretch to make a place bid, shied outwards while gaining even terms with her inner drifting rival passing the furlong pole, causing her to flop leads, but kept
on through the left stages while on her left lead to secure place. LOLA'S KISSES stalked in the two path early on, angled in to forge place from an outer foe
at the quarter pole, but drifted outwards at the furlong pole while holding that position, and lost place in the late stages. TRINKET broke outwards and
bumped SOBEIT SYLVIA at the start, tracked from the four path in midpack around the turn, then finished evenly. SOBEIT SYLVIA was bumped by an inner
foe at the start causing her to brush her outer rival, saved ground far off the pace, shifted two wide around the turn, but finished evenly through the lane
without threatening. HURRICANE PATRICIA stalked in the three path, but weakened turning for home. ANNA MAY OUR QUEEN trailed in the five to six
path around the turn, and failed to factor. BAYANNE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, took the turn in the four to five path while far off of the pace,
and never got involved. MISTRESS AT SEA dueled outside of RORAIMA DOS, but failed to keep pace with that rival into the turn, weakened between
horses turning for home, and stopped through the lane.

DISCREET TATTOO opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed along the rail around the turn and remained clear under urging. KITTEN'S PEEBLES
wasn't far back from the outset, raced the three path around the turn, moved closer into the final furlong then flattened out. DOUBLE CROSSED came out
into the three path on the turn and continued evenly. GRACEYGAB fell back outside leaving the backstretch, raced wide around the turn and passed tired
ones in the lane. SNOW BLOSSOM chased early in the two path then tired. CHEERMENOW was outrun. MERROW ducked out sharply, reared up and
nearly unseated the rider a few stride out of the gate, was sent up the outside early, raced wide around the turn then wasn't persevered with through the
lane.

SKOOKIE set the pace from the onset, established a clear lead into the turn, widened her advantage in hand while shifting to the four path around the turn,
and won easily while never being asked for run. ORENDA saved ground from midpack, surged through a rail opening at the quarter pole to grab place, but
was no match for the leader and proved second best. LAST GREAT saved ground while far off of the pace, then improved position inside of tiring rivals in
upper stretch, and failed to threaten. LUNAR STAR chased the loose leader from the three path, but weakened turning for home. COURAGEOUS KATIE
trailed, came into the lane in the five path, and failed to factor. FINDER ANGEL R V F was forwardly placed in the four path and outside of rivals, but
weakened turning for home.

around the turn, the rider dropped his whip leaving the furlong grounds then held under a brisk hand ride. BLUEGRASS POSSE bumped with the winner
leaving the gate, maintained position along the rail but lacked the needed rally. SILVER STARSHIP was slow early, made a four wide run on the turn,
moved closer into the stretch then flattened out. SATURDAYNITEAFFAIR raced the three path around the turn and passed tired ones while no factor. ONLY
THE TRUTH bumped with WILL MUNNINGS leaving the gate, wasn't far back between horses, steadied in tight approaching and entering the lane, angled
out between horses and gained mildly. KOWBOY KING raced the five path around the turn and failed to menace. WILL MUNNINGS bumped with
SATURDAYNITEAFFAIR leaving the gate, chased outside the winner in the three path to the stretch, stopped and was eased up late.

Footnotes
BROAD STREET BULLY tracked two wide from midpack, advanced to be behind the leaders into the far turn, waited full of run around that bend before
splitting the leaders three wide in the four path at the quarter pole, then drew off through the final furlong. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY vied between horses while
being kept in the three path, forged a slight lead away from his inner rival at the quarter pole, but was headed by BROAD STREET BULLY's outside rally
approaching the furlong pole, then just kept KNOWN QUANTITY's inside place bid at bay to the wire. KNOWN QUANTITY stalked from the inside of the
leading trio and from the pocket, waited for running room inside of the inner tiring leader at the quarter pole, made a rail bid as that foe drifted off of the
fence turning for home, but was no match for the leader and just missed place at the wire. JONATHANTOQUICK trailed in the two path early on, advanced
in the three path around the far turn, then kept on late for a minor reward. DIGGERS DIAMOND prompted the pace outside of a pair of rivals while in the
four path, continued to vie around the far turn, but was floated to the five path at the quarter pole and weakened in upper stretch. CATTLE DRIVE saved
ground far off of the pace, trailed in the two to three path around the far turn, and passed tired rials without factoring. STARINTHEMAKING set the pace
inside of a pair of rival while staying a path off of the rail, but weakened at the quarter pole. PHARAOH'S CITY bore to five path into the first turn, gained
slightly in the five path into the far turn, but weakened. Following the race, the rider's objection; #8 JONATHANTOQUICK against #7 BROAD STREET
BULLY for interference into the first turn; was disallowed by the stewards.

INSIDER bobbled leaving the gate, was unhurried early, rallied the two path around the turn, stayed inside horses while moving to command in midstretch
and held under urging. IT'S NOT FUNNY chased the early leader in the three path, was carried wide into the stretch while vying for command, took over
leaving the furlong grounds but gave way. GAMBLIN was slow early, raced the three path around the turn, edged out in midstretch and finished well.
NEGRITO chased in the two path, steadied when caught in tight between horses while carried wide into the stretch, angled out in midstretch and finished
willingly. ZEUS ODIN was hustled to a clear lead after going a furlong, stayed close to the rail into the turn, ran out entering the stretch then faltered in the
drive. ALBERTOS AL QUINTO wasn't far back along the rail to the turn then faded.

Footnotes
GOLDEN ACES tracked from midpack three wide and between horses, failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, but kept on, quickened passing
the furlong pole, rallied late, and got up at the wire. STONE COLD was fractious in the gate, set the pace from the onset along the inside, drew clear to
widen his margin in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead, tired in the late stages, and got nipped on the wire. HOOF HOOF AWAY saved ground while far
off of the pace through the turn, tipped to the four path approaching the furlong pole, commenced a late surge, but ran out of ground. JEALOUS HEART
stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then kept on to battle for minor rewards, but got outfinished. TWO WAY
ROAD prompted the leader from outside of his flank into the turn, but was put to a drive to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, failed to do so turning for
home, then subsequently weakened. ON MAGIC WINGS tracked from midpack four wide and outside of horse, but weakened turning for home. CANDY
PANTS took the turn in the five path while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. JERSEY STORM tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but
failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, and faded.
