LUCHADOR lugged out, floating out and later tightening his outside rivals near wire. ODEEMEISTER bore out badly. RTEMPTING FORTUNE was carried
very wide. LOUISIANA SHAKER was carried wide, then checked off heels late. SENSATIONAL RUBY sluggish start, outrun. JESS CRUIZEN did not keep
up. The stewards conducted an inquiry and after reviewing the tape disqualified LUCHADOR from first to fourth for lugging out, floating RTEMPTING
FORTUNE and LOUISIANA SHAKER very wide, eventually causing the latter to check off heels near the finish.

Footnotes
SMOKIN VOLCOM led every jump. WILLIE BIG BUX strong return. JACKSONS DYNASTY no match for top two. WICKEDLY CORONA lacked serious bid.
REQUIRING FIRE some late interest. EAGLE FEATHERS FLY early foot, weakened. PSYCHEDELIC TRES one-paced. CALLED TO FREEDOM bit
fractious in gate, sluggish start. CHEVAUX off slowly, bumped. CANNONS FURY broke in, no threat. CZECHMATE broke slowly, bumped both sides.
