Footnotes
DE PURA SANGRE went up after FERNANDA from outside into the turn, outdueled that foe by upper stretch and kicked clear, and held firm to deny SHELL
BEACH PARTY through the closing stages. SHELL BEACH PARTY enjoyed good position tracking the embattled leaders around the turn, came three wide
with dead aim, ranged alongside the winner in deep stretch but hung through the last 70 yards. FERNANDA held a short lead early inside, got outdueled by
the winner around the turn and into upper stretch, and salvaged the show despite weakening. CRACK OF DAWN angled widest coming off the turn, and
lacked the needed closing bid. JIMMYS LASS was slow into stride, saved ground to the stretch and gained mildly while not a factor. MIRIANA'S QUEEN
stumbled at the start, raced in the two-path on the turn and made no impact. BLAME THE STORM was finished inside after three furlongs. PAZYARMONIA
retired early three wide.

Footnotes
SEPTEMBERTEN vied for the lead down the backstretch then cleared on top midway around the turn, widened advantage without asking and continued to
pull away through the lane. ODDS IT'S REAL vied between foes for the lead in opening stages then weakened off the top pair near the half mile marker,
chased on and saved ground on the turn, shifted out three wide in stretch run and finished second best. HONOR THIS raced in the back for the opening
quarter, saved ground along the rail into stretch run and churned on for a share. PARKLAND STRONG bumped with foe at the start then bumped with
GOLDEN IDOL early backstretch, raced widest in the backstretch and around the turn then retreated in the lane. TORTOLA PRIDE vied for the lead out of
the gate, continued to duel along the outside into the turn, could not move on with the winner at five sixteenths pole and had nothing left in the lane.
GOLDEN IDOL bumped with rival at the start then got bumped by PARKLAND STRONG shortly after and dropped back after the half.

Footnotes
BLUE BLUE ICE raced four wide in close touch with the leaders, rallied steadily through the stretch to overtake QUEEN KANTHAROS past the eighth-pole,
and drew clear through the last 70 yards. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL lagged at the back three wide on the turn, angled widest for the drive and was up in the final
strides for the place. QUEEN KANTHAROS slipped through on the rail getting past three opponents with a nifty move near the quarter-pole, edged away in
upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong on the wrong lead. SABINA PARK saved ground taking closer order on the turn, moved out in the
stretch and lacked a solid bid. TAKE CHARGE AGAIN pressed the pace in the three-path between horses, and faded in the stretch. TONG SHU broke
alertly and was hustled to establish the pace in the two-path, came under pressure from both flanks late on the turn, and had nothing left in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN AMI sped to a slim lead out of the gate and set a pressured pace in the opening quarter, edged away to a clearer advantage around the turn,
prompted a couple times right handed past the furlong marker, responded sharply, pulled away and finished under a strong hand ride in the final sixteenth.
JEANA'S GEM was keen and tugged up along the inside to race in close contention, stayed under a firm hold into the turn then let out past the quarter pole,
advanced on the inside to gain position then steadily drifted out wider under right handed urging. BERNIE'S MISTRESS applied pace pressure to GOLDEN
AMI in opening quarter, could not remain in touch but stayed on in close range around turn then churned on for a share. EMPIRE MOON stumbled at the
start and lagged behind, saved ground early then raced wide entering the lane and failed to factor. AMADORA raced in range through early stages, came up
empty midway around the turn then allowed to gallop home under no exertion from the rider.

Footnotes
FANCIFIED settled comfortably in the second flight for six furlongs, swung out smoothly four wide into the stretch, responded well to reach the leaders from
outside through the furlong grounds and kicked away from POLISHED COPPER the last sixteenth of a mile. POLISHED COPPER hit the right side of the
gate and bumped into SEA ANNA DREAM at the start, recovered to a forward position saving ground, shifted three wide leaving the far turn, bid between
horses through mid stretch and was outkicked by the winner while best of the others. POSITIVE POWER bumped with A BEAUTIFUL DAY at the start,
steadied keyed up on the rail approaching the first turn, remained well back three wide on the far turn, moved in a path and finished well to get up for third.
JOSEFA fought restraint pressing A BEAUTIFUL DAY from the rail early, moved outside that rival early up the backstretch and went up to challenge, fought
on to mid stretch and gave way. GRAVEL GERTIE was never far back, had aim at the leaders three to four wide approaching the stretch, and came up
empty. TONED UP was well back for six furlongs, came under pressure midway on the far turn, got carried extremely wide by SEA ANNA DREAM nearing
the top of the stretch and could not gain. A BEAUTIFUL DAY bumped with POSITIVE POWER while getting away alertly, moved in from the two-path after
waltzing through an easy opening quarter, gradually picked up the tempo through the middle fractions, and shortened stride into the final furlong. MALIBU
RUN broke awkwardly at the rear, steadied in tight between horses heading to the first turn, and was never involved. SEA ANNA DREAM bumped with
POLISHED COPPER at the start, went along in the middle of the field to the end of the backstretch, came under heavy pressure with little response by
midway on the far turn, drifted wide taking TONED UP out with her past the quarter-pole and dropped far back.

PLATO applied pace press to NORTHBROOK out of the gate and continued to force the issue down the backstretch, took command near the three eighths
pole then quickly came under attack from CAUSALISTIC, dueled inside of rival entering the lane, battled back gamely from the inside position and held firm
in final strides. CAUSALISTIC stalked along the outside through early stages then advanced to challenge PLATO for the lead nearing the quarter pole,
battled for the lead racing outside of rival through the lane and got edged out in final strides. FRANK FIRST settled in good position sitting just off the top
pair, prompted to pick up the pace near three eighths pole, drifted out wider in the lane and stayed on with response. NORTHBROOK set a pressured pace
down the backstretch, lost the lead to the winner near the three eighths pole then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FOXY LADY broke out in front of PRINCESS CARRIGAN while away to the lead, responded when challenged around the turn by SECRET MISS, shook
that one off through upper stretch, and kept TWO CENTS WORTH at bay to the finish. TWO CENTS WORTH hit the right side of the gate at the start, sat
behind the leaders around the turn, shifted to the three-path with a clear shot after straightening away, and finished with good courage outside the top one.
ONEZY'S DREAM was outsprinted to the stretch inside, and finished willingly on the rail. PRINCESS CARRIGAN had the winner cross in front of her at the
start and was last away, advanced mildly three then four wide around the turn, but had nothing further. SECRET MISS hit the left side of the gate at the
start, went up to challenge outside FOXY LADY into the turn, could not match strides by upper stretch and weakened through the last furlong. KERRY IT
lost ground to the front flight in the two-path on the turn, and had nothing late.

Footnotes
BABY ICE was allowed to settle in the opening quarter, remained patiently handled then began to pick up the pace around the turn, raced five wide and
given cue entering top of the lane, roused forward to challenge GILDA F. for the lead near the furlong grounds then drew clear under steady pressure.
GILDA F. raced in the second flight and tracked the leader in early stages, advanced and took a slim lead leaving the five sixteenths pole, continued with
good response on top into stretch run, challenged by winner near the furlong marker, continued to put in a good effort but could not match with rival in late
stages and gave way grudgingly. TUESDAY'S ROSE raced in the second flight near the inside while being ridden along to maintain position, was under a
strong ride around the turn then raced wide into the lane, churned on with interest and bested the rest. MAJESTIC MAIARA raced off the early pace while
saving ground, tipped out a path a put top a drive around the turn then came up empty a furlong out. SHALL RETURN tossed head awkwardly at the start,
was reserved in the back then driving four to five wide entering the lane and failed to threaten. SALSA RITA broke on top then quickly conceded position to
MEMORIZE, raced in the second going by the half mile marker, advanced three wide to race in aim for the lead at the quarter pole then gave way.
MEMORIZE was sent hard at the start, briefly held a clear advantage then failed to hold a diminishing lead entering the turn, got collared near five
sixteenths pole and had nothing left in reserve.

Footnotes
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN settled inside early, sat chilly behind the leaders around the far turn, shifted off cover to the four-path into the stretch, rallied
determinedly and was along outside GHOSTLY BEAUTY in the final yards. GHOSTLY BEAUTY was prominent from the outset three wide, fought her way
to a short lead in mid stretch, and finished well though unable to contain her stablemate. CANDY MONEY broke to the lead inside but was eased back going
to the first turn, moved out going up to vie outside FAITH N HOPE soon after entering the backstretch, continued to contest the front between that one and
GHOSTLY BEAUTY around the far turn, fought on between those two to the furlong grounds and weakened. FAITH N HOPE cleared from the three-path
moving in with the lead through the first quarter-mile, set a pressured pace through the middle stages, and stayed on to the eighth-pole before giving way.
MUCH ABOUT IT raced at the back early in the two-path, moved inside and failed to reach contention. JUST SASSY raced three to four wide for six
furlongs, and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
YOLANDA'S PRIDE quickly cleared on top and crossed over to the inside, set the uncontested pace down the backstretch and held firm around the far turn,
was put to a drive upper stretch, stayed sharp in response and finsihed clear. DAYS OF SPRING secured inside position around the first turn then tracked
the pace to the far turn, tipped out a path and hustled along then shifted wider upper stretch, sustained a steady outside bid and got up late for place. I'LL
DO IT MY WAY saved ground around the first turn, stalked down the pacesetter to the far turn then coaxed two wide past the quarter pole, chased on
through the lane and finished on equal terms for show. LA RUSIA was forwardly placed on the first turn and continued to stalk rival to the far turn, launched
a bid near the quarter pole, moved into stretch four wide, continued a steady bid and finished on equal terms for share. JOYOUS TIMES took over the rail
position entering the first turn, settled and saved ground down the backstretch then stayed inside and hustled along up around the far turn, moved into
closer contention near the furlong marker then flattened late. JUST A BIT SASSY broke out at the start then settled nicely while rated three wide to the far
turn, prompted near the quarter pole, roused five wide into the lane and failed to move on. MISS MY MACHO raced off the pace, saved ground around the
far turn, tipped out a couple paths top stretch and lacked a needed rally. INTEREST stumbled badly at the start, was reserved for six furlongs, hustled along
five wide upper stretch and failed to move on. BABYBEL steadied off heels while awkwardly in stride entering the first turn, raced near the back and failed to
move into contention. KISSES FOR TIZZY raced in range three to four wide through early stages then began to weaken around the final turn. LEMON
SCAT raced in the back, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten.
