Footnotes
HARDLY A SECRET broke sharp, allowed the leader to go the opening quarter, continued to pursue that rival up the backstretch in the two path, ranged up
to challenge turning for home, long duel, led, headed late, regained the advantage in the final strides to narrowly prevail while fully extended. SECRET
TOUCH took command past the wire the first time inside, set a soft pace while continuing to save ground, responded when challenged by the winner
entering the stretch, dueled to the wire, proved stubborn to the end. TAPSOLUTE behind the pace while along the inside, continued along the rail turning
into the lane, moved out a bit, lacked a winning response. CANDY CARLOS stalked the pace while racing in the three path, crept a bit closer in the second
turn, flattened out in the drive. ATTENTIVE went one paced in the two path. EXEMPLAR off a step slow, trailed while saving ground.

Footnotes
MILLIE'S AN ANGEL broke alertly, dueled early off the inside, shook clear in the turn, got out a bit late in the bend, maintained daylight while being kept to
task. NAPILI forwardly placed while racing inside, continued to save ground into the lane, moved out slightly for the drive, could not get to the winner, clearly
second best. MORNING VALENTINE fell back into the second flight the opening furlong, two path through the turn, sent evenly to the wire to prove no
match for the top pair. DIXIE CAT also behind the leaders, three wide turning for home, outkicked for the show spot late. DUES PAID void of early foot, in
some traffic far turn, two path entering the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. THURSDAY MORNING dueled inside the winner early,
chased that rival through the turn, weakened in the drive. BLACK PATENT SHOES bothered at the start to be last away, used a bit early to move up to mid
pack, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing response. BRAHMS IS WHO void of speed, in some traffic far turn, made little impact in the drive. LYNNE
T off the pace and the inside, four wide late in the turn, tired in the drive. ESTHER four wide late in the turn, remained always back. DRAMATIC ENTRANCE
was finished early. CYBER SENSATION broke in, was always outrun while racing outside.

Footnotes
HARLEQUIN raced toward the front off the inside, advanced three wide into the stretch, outside bid past the furlong marker, drove clear late.
GUMWRAPPER closest to the early leader, chased that one in the two path through the turn, bid between horses with a furlong remaining, briefly dueled
inside the winner then could not match strides, clearly second besdt. IMEANTTOPAY lacked early foot, three wide through the turn when advancing,
continued to improve through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. FAIR CATCH broke sharp, quickly sprinted out to a long lead, maintained sizable
advantage through the turn, faltered when headed in the final furlong. PRIMORDIAL BOY void of early foot, saved ground turn, in some traffic turning for
home while continuing inside, improved position while not a serious threat. EMPTY NESTR went evenly while racing four wide. PEWTER remained back
while also going one paced while in the two path. AXIS tired while racing toward the inside. AGITATOR void of speed, trailed much of the way, picked off a
few tiring rivals while never a threat. NIALL was not a threat while racing four wide. COPPER MOUNTAIN was off slow, always outrun. DAZZLING
REUNION in mid pack early, retreated in the two path.

Footnotes
BROADWAY ICE fell back to trail well back soon after the start, continued to trail while saving ground through the turn, moved out for the drive, set down,
finished furiously through traffic, inside bid late, gained nod. AL RHYTHM in the second flight off the inside, went after the leader in the three path turning for
home, took over, clear late, nipped late. DOC CURLIN off a step slow, raced back, lagged three wide through the turn, steered out a bit and like the winner,
finished full of run through traffic. POCKET PERSONALITY raced in mid pack early, three wide trip turn, displayed some modest late interest. FLASH
ATTACK evenly paced while three wide and outside turn, continued on the outside to widest through the stretch, improved position slightly. PARK RIDGE
BENNY in the second flight while in the two path, had little left late. COLLECTION went one paced throughout while in the two path. EL VENUE chased for
a half, gave way in the drive. CADRON FLATS in mid pack for four furlongs along the inside, steadily faded. DOM THE BOMB broke on top despite
stumbling badly at the start, quickly cleared after recovering, continued to hold a large advantage through the turn, faltered when headed entering the
stretch by the runner up.

Footnotes
CHERISHED broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn under light restraint, shook off a brief bid late in the turn, kicked well
clear through the stretch to win ridden out. BETWEEN THE HEDGES also away in good order, moved a bit closer to that one in the two path exiting the
turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. MOORAC in the second flight while between rivals, continued in traffic nearing the furlong marker,
had little for the top two late, proved game for the place. BLINKERS in the second group while along the inside, also was no match for the top pair in the
drive, outkicked for the show. GINNY B forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. GHAALEB'S STORM last away, improved
position a bit while never a threat. HALEYS HEIST fell back after the start to trail, showed little. MUCHO MAS lacked speed, failed to muster a closing
response when called on for the drive.

Footnotes
LADY MCKENZIE behind the pace inside, continued to track the leaders while saving ground, advanced and challenged along the rail late in the final turn,
long drive, proved best in determined fashion. CLAY'S MOON STONE forwardly placed while racing outside, continued to stalk while four wide into the far
turn, vied three wide into the lane, could not match the winner late, came back for the place. SHACKADELIC prompted the early pace, took over in the
second turn, vied between rivals into the stretch, weakened late while remaining between the top pair. MI BELLA settled off early pace toward the inside,
raced in the second flight the middle half in the two path, steered out three wide into the lane, could not get to the top three the final furlong. HASHTAG
WINNER void of speed, angled out four wide in some traffic turning for home, improved position while also not a serious threat to the top trio. ADDI lacked
speed while saving ground through the first turn, raced two out to three wide through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late
punch. HOUSE DRUNK fell back into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not posing a threat. IT'S ALL CASH brushed at the start, void of
speed, also improved position by passing faltering rivals. BIG LUCK in tight to be last away, trailed most of the way, picked off faltering rivals as well. GOLD
INCLUDED four wide in the first turn, remained always back, four wide in the second turn as well, tired. HUNGRY N SCRAPPY void of speed, floated out
five wide while remaining back turning for home, failed to deliver a kick. COCO CABALLO away in good order, sprinted clear early, set the pace, stopped in
the second turn.

Footnotes
ROYAL COMMISSION broke best of all, dueled up front along the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, well clear a furlong out, enough left
to withstand a late close from the runner up. BUBBA CABALLO lacked early foot outside, raced three out to four wide in the turn, began to advance midway
on the bend, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. DIGITAL STAR in the second flight while saving ground, bit tight
while remaining inside past the furlong marker, finished up best of the rest. TAPSOLUTION settled in mid pack while racing off the inside, remained in the
two path stretch, lacked a closing punch. MR. SHAPOOR within striking distance while off the inside, two path into the lane, came up empty for the drive.
