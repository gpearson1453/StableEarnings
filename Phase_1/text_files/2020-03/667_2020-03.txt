Footnotes
VERYNSKY set the pace clear up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path entering the turn, angled over to the inside and kept near the rail to the
stretch, urged left-handed through the lane and held safely. DUTT BART chased the leader from the inside to the turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane,
failed to threaten the winner late but proved second best. DIXIE DOO RUN RUN stalked outside a rival, three wide into the turn then two wide into the
stretch and lacked a bid. BAJA WARRIOR raced outside a rival up the backstretch then two wide into the turn, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and
weakened. DARING WAYS off a bit slow to begin, trailed the field wide up the backstretch, entered the turn four wide then three wide into the stretch and
proved no menace.

REIGN ON (GB) settled off the pace, advanced near the inside, saved ground into the lane, rallied along the fence and edged rivals in closing moments.
SWISS CHEESE dueled for the lead from the inside, fought back through the final furlong and shared the place honors. QUANTUM FORCE dueled with
SWISS CHEESE for the lead, battled three wide into the lane, grabbed a brief lead a sixteenth out but was outkicked by the winner. FOUR GAELS stalked a
bit off the rail, angled four wide and came out further in the stretch and kept on willingly from the middle portion of the stretch. ADRIATIC SON off slow to
begin, went three wide around the turn and never threatened.
