the sixteenth pole. TREASURED BOND saved ground the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the five path, angled to the inside through the upper stretch and finished evenly. RUN ON ENERGY settled off the pace in the three
and four paths then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn and showed little more. LOVE HAPPY stalked the pace two deep

Footnotes
FLEETRESS gave chase through the backstretch and drew to even terms two deep leaving the quarter pole, drifted outward toward the head of the lane but
dug in for the lead mid-stretch and raced clear the final yards. EVER SO D'WILD set a pressured pace off the rail, was met at even terms leaving the quarter
pole, raced at the rail through the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch, relented later yards and just lasted in second. WITCHY WINDSOR gave chase and
rounded the turn off the rail then angled out later yards and just missed second. LIVE FREE chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the
six path and was closing well through the lane. ADIOS HILLARY gave chase toward mid track, rounded the turn in the four path then finished well near the
rail. SHANNA'S GRAY gave chase and raced close in the four and five paths on the turn, drifted outward toward the top of the lane then finished evenly.
MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased the pace from the outside, rounded the turn about the six path, was carried out toward the head of the lane and flattened
stride later yards. CASHMEIFUCAN pressured the pace from the inside then faded into the turn. FURRFIELD FURRST saved ground. QUALITY DESIRE
came away a bit rank, raced outside and never factored.
