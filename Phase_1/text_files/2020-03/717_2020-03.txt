Footnotes
WILL SING FOR WINE broke in at the start bumping BOLD VICTORY, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before advancing five wide
through the turn stacking outside a quartet three furlongs from home, remained patiently handled through the bend taking over command near the quarter
pole, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to prevail. COUSIN ANDREW chased three wide down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn, raced in behind a wall of rivals midway on the turn as the remainder of the field stacked across the track in front,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just latch on the winner as that rival hit the finish.
BOLD VICTORY bumped at the start by WILL SING FOR WINE who broke inwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. CONTINUATION dueled from the two path early on with FIXATION to his
outside before vying inside a trio and then a quarter through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. SEMPER FI broke in at the start bumping FIXATION, raced four wide in aim of the front before advancing tucked three wide to
vie between foes among a quintet stacked across the track at the three-eighths when placed to coaxing, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. FIXATION bumped at the start by SEMPER FI, dueled from the three path with CONTINUATION before tucking to the two path into the turn, vied
between rivals among a quintet midway, got shaken off through the latter portion of the bend, cut the corner into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
LOVE AND LOVE away without apparent mishap, was along the inside route disputing the pace with ALPHADORA to the outside, rated along, edged away
from that opponent during the run around the bend, was allowed to shift into the two path when called upon for more run in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, offered up the desired response and stayed well in the clear, kept to some urging to the end. LEM ME HAVE IT tracked the pace
while saving ground on the turn, cut the corner into the lane, proved no match but stayed on for the place. QUESTEQ loped along as the trailer on the
backstretch, stepped onto the turn from path two, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, went on to secure the show. ALPHADORA sparred
with the winner two wide for three-quarters and gave way. FAIR LASSIE attained a forward position after the field had been sent off and running, pursued
the front runners from the three path on the turn, fanned out five wide entering the lane while backing away. LOOKBOTHWAYS took up the chase two to
three wide on the turn, swung approximately six wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. DIAMOND N SIMON at a considerable distance from
off the rail throughout, travelled in the four path on the turn, got sent out into the seven path during the initial portion of the stretch, venturing onward as the
widest of all, never made its presence felt. MY LAST MILLION saw the pilot re-mount after acting up a bit prior to the start, proceeded to lunge out springing
from the gate, was under some hand urging being spotted on the rail, kept pace with the others for the opening hand then faltered.

CAUSE FOR APPLAUSE five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing
near the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide straightened away into upper stretch, rallied to tackle the top pair taking command at the eighth pole,
then edged away kept to task to the finish. PRINCE OF NEW YORK forwardly placed from the gate, ranged up to vie for command four wide down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path and dueled with VIOLENT DELIGHTS to his outside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, came
inwards near the five-sixteenths as the rider began to employ the stick and forced BRONXVILLE to check along the inside, spun just off the inside for home,
dug in knocking heads with his main pace rival when displaced from command at the eighth pole, ran on to secure the place honors. VIOLENT DELIGHTS
just off the pace in the early going, advanced to vie from the five path for the front down most of the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn and dueled
with the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch, got overtaken in tandem a furlong out

Footnotes
NUEVA YORK took up position towards midpack after the field had been released, went about the turn two to three wide, tipped to the outside as the half
was being completed, eventually winding up four wide at the top of the lane, steadily advanced on the ones to catch, got engaged in a late duel with the
runner up and gamely got the job done. QUICKFLASH away in good order, crept up to the front runners taking the three path on the turn, got cued up
challenging as the widest of a threesome on near even terms with each heading home, forged to the front end, albeit barely, began to inch away from the
others with approximately a sixteenth remaining only to get pounced upon by the winner, fought onward with determination locked in an one on one tussle
with that foe, got nipped. MORGANTOWN secured a prominent position after being ridden from the gate, was gradually worked over to the rail, vied with
LEAP TO GLORY to his outside, came under additional pressure in the form of the second place finisher as the second fraction was being finalized, was put
to a drive for the drive home, relinquished reluctantly, vied with vigour as the innermost of three to around the sixteenth pole, then stayed on well to save the
show. LEAP TO GLORY sparred for the top from the two path, was forced to undergo the task from between rivals beginning at the quarter pole, kept at it
well enough to finish in a dead heat for third. CENTRIST three wide entering the turn, was sent out five wide exiting, mustered up a mild response en route
for a minor slice of the purse. FREUDIAN SIP was along the inside route loosely drafting behind MORGANTOWN, came under encouragement cutting the
corner into the lane, failed to fire appreciably. POSSETIZZLY underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive home, lacked the
necessary response. COOLBOY chased the pace from the two path, mostly between rivals for the opening half, stepped into the lane and folded.

Footnotes
DIAMOND KING away well, got engaged for command nearly from the get-go, went at it pitted up against two others for most of the opening three-quarters,
arguing from between rivals during the run around the bend, got set down as the pace contest intensified coming up to the quarter pole, dug in with good
determination to prove best. AMERICAN ANTHEM off the inside throughout, moved up to contest the pace as the widest of a threesome approaching the
conclusion of the backstretch, got turned loose spinning into the lane, ventured onward with willingness but was staved off. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON
pursued the pace from the three path on the turn, was already being called upon by the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into lane, made no headway on the top
twosome while holding on well for the show nevertheless. LONE ROCK took up the chase from the two path in midpack, angled four wide into the lane,
lacked a solid closing punch. WICKED TRICK pulled off another after springing from the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn, fanned out into the five
path from upper to midstretch, made no impact. STAN THE MAN responded to some coaxing on the chute to cement himself into a forward position, was
along the rail contending for the top as the innermost of three, although not always against the same two foes, came under a drive late on the bend,
remained at the task for a little while longer then gave way. JOEVIA towards the two path disputing for the lead during the initial stages, got guided over to
the rail at the half mile pole, steadily retreated leaving that station.

Footnotes
WATER WHITE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge through the final eighth and was just up in the very last jump to prevail. KANSAS KIS
four wide in pursuit from near the rear, advanced quickly tucked three wide into the turn into prominence, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and
took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in being directed out to look her lone threat in
the eye and was nailed at the finish. PANTHERA ONCA five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. LAKE AVENUE tussled briefly with PERSISTO before emerging with sole albeit narrow command
in hand just off the inside, faced pressure from that rival and tucked inside half a mile from home, began to shake that foe off when confronted by KANSAS
KIS midway on the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was displaced from command, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. MO CITY three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, chased two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened. MAEDEAN five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, came under coaxing half a mile from home
and continued five wide through the turn under a drive from midway, went six wide into upper stretch and came up empty. PERSISTO led early on soon
after the start and jumped the tracks of the horse path nearing the seven furlong marker, tussled briefly with LAKE AVENUE before prompting that rival from
the outside in the four path, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out in the midst of being shaken off, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and folded.

MISCHEVIOUS ALEX vied among quartet down the backstretch while in hand four to five wide, tucked to the two path as rivals backed away and advanced
to take command at the seven-sixteenths, began to slip away near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home roused for the drive, edged clear
under a drive to the finish. UNTITLED forwardly placed from the start, vied from the five path with a trio to his inside, tucked three wide into the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and chased the winner home running on willingly for the place honors.
ATTACHMENT RATE broke in at the start bumping WAR STOPPER, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MONTAUK TRAFFIC bumped at the start by FLAP JACK who broke inwards, chased
along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick. NECKER ISLAND broke in at the start filling the space vacated by ATTACHMENT RATE who also broke inwards, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. FLAP JACK broke in at the start
bumping MONTAUK TRAFFIC, raced forwardly placed five wide down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn emerging to be just off the top pair
nearing the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. INFORMATIVE
brushed the off side stall at the start, raced just off the inside in aim of the front, got forced to briefly steady nearing the seven-sixteenths as ATTACHMENT
RATE tucked inwards from the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths now along the inside, swung two to three wide for home and weakened.
FIRST DEPUTY forwardly placed six then five wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. SIXTO
seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, got coaxed along three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper
stretch and tired. WAR STOPPER bumped at the start by ATTACHMENT RATE, who broke inwards, came under hustling and led briefly before vying with a
trio while three then two wide down the backstretch, tucked to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing nearing the seven-sixteenths and
yielded the front at that station, faded through the latter portion of the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. CELTIC STRIKER
veered in at the start and was corrected, came under coaxing and showed brief speed to vie briefly inside a trio down the backstretch, got shaken off into
the turn and briefly steadied inside of INFORMATIVE near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at that station, retreated through the turn, went four
wide for home and faltered in the stretch. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of INFORMATIVE alleging interference against ATTACHMENT RATE
at the seven-sixteenths. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.
