Footnotes
LUXE DIAMOND attended the pace while racing just off DAT HOT MATCH in early stages then matched strides along the inside while still unleashed
around the turn, shook free entering top stretch then drew off while ridden out and finished in hand. TOONIE LOONIE raced near the lead in opening stages
then tracked the top two leaders, positioned as a sharp factor mid-way around the turn, given cue to head in pursuit at the quarter pole, was no match for
pulling away winner but continued a steady bid in stretch run for the runner up spot. UPSY DAISY DO was ridden along from the get-go and briefly moved
inside late backstretch then swung out around the turn, raced wide entering top stretch, continued a bid along the far outside and prevailed for a share. DAT
HOT MATCH held a slim lead over LUXE DIAMOND in early going, vied for the lead with rival around the turn, could not maintain equal terms with eventual
winner entering top stretch then steadily weakened in the lane. SNAKE N SHAKE raced two wide leaving the backstretch, hustled along five to six paths
wide entering the top stretch and lacked a needed rally. I'M A ROCKSTAR steadied at the start then raced widest near mid-pack at the half, prompted four
wide around the turn, kept under a ride in stretch run but lacked the needed response for impact. LONG STORY SHORT was off slow at the start and
rushed up into contention then failed to sustain quick response on the turn and steadily weakened. GRACIE'S DREAM raced in the back, moved into three
wide under pressure and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
SMACK stalked outside MUDSLIDE WICKED for three furlongs, ranged alongside getting pushed out and brushed by that rival in upper stretch, and
shrugged off that minor annoyance to kick clear past the eighth-pole under a drive. NOBLE ALMA tracked along the rail around the turn, shifted to the
three-path at the top of the lane and rallied into second late while not a threat to the winner. MUDSLIDE WICKED popped clear out of the gate but soon felt
outside pressure, drifted out brushing SMACK in upper stretch while weakening, and yielded the place late. QUIET COMPANY chased between horses
three wide into the turn, and lacked the needed closing bid. BRAMBLE BERRY raced four wide and failed to menace. WIND DREAMER moved inside
around the turn, and made no impact. IMA N H LADY CAT hesitated at the start spotting the field a couple lengths, and trailed throughout. THE HORSES
STOOD IN THE GATE FOR SEVEN MINUTES WHILE A FRACTIOUS HORSE REFUSED TO BE LOADED IN THE OUTERMOST STALL AND WAS
ULTIMATELY ORDERED SCRATCHED.

Footnotes
MARY LEE AND ME raced just off the leader in the opening quarter then advanced to dispute the pace racing between, continued to duel around the turn
then battled on with THREE ILLUSIONS into stretch run, challenged by outside running GRACE'S DRAMA in the final furlong, refused to be denied, turned
back bid and held firm. GRACE'S DRAMA was well placed racing off the embattled trio through early stages, prompted four wide around the turn then
swung wide into stretch, advanced to challenge MARY LEE AND ME for the lead in final furlong but could not get by. LEDECKY settled not too far off the
pace, coaxed along the outside around the far turn, slightly brushed with FINAL FURRY top stretch then drifted out wide under left handed pressure and
continued a steady effort to capture show. FINAL FLURRY raced in the back and saved ground, shifted out nearing top stretch and brushed with LEDECKY
then switched in a couple paths, raced between foes at the furlong marker then narrowly missed show. CAPE MIST raced in range through early stages
then hustled along two wide around the turn, kept under a ride then shifted inside with a sixteenth left to run and chased on evenly. THREE ILLUSIONS
advanced after the opening quarter and vied for the lead, continued to battle with eventual winner past the furlong marker then was all out and faded in late
stages. MAJESTIC MAIARA held a slim lead in opening quarter then vied for the lead down the backstretch, continued near terms around the turn then tired
in the drive.

Footnotes
ROYAL MEGHAN chased after CAROLYN'S SMILE to the turn, moved out and wrested command approaching the quarter-pole, edged clear in mid stretch
and held under a drive. TIZ ENOUGH lagged behind early, saved ground beginning to find stride leaving the turn, and rallied along the rail to best the
others. KASHAN took a slight hop at the start, chased three wide to the top of the stretch, and could not gain on the far outside late. CAROLYN'S SMILE
broke out at the start, set the early pace inside, yielded to the winner after a half and weakened in the two-path. AVUNCULAR veered in sharply to get away
behind the field, checked early with the rider off balance and bottled up behind horses, gained clearance midway on the turn but was empty. DON'T
EATTHE APPLE hit the left side of the gate at the start, was put to pressure three wide on the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
TAKE TEN raced two wide entering the first turn then remained settled in the back, began to pick up the pace near the three eighths pole, showed willingly
response and circled up four wide to race in aim late turn, vied four deep for the lead near the furlong marker then edged by to a narrow lead and held safe
under a driving finish. TIZAHRA settled nicely and tracked the top two leaders down the backstretch, prompted and advanced three wide to vie for the lead
at the quarter pole, continued in aim at the furlong marker then raced just off the eventual winner and kept on stubbornly to the wire. ELLE M'A SOURI (FR)
was a step slow at the start then rated off the early pace, shifted out leaving the far turn, set down for the drive, raced widest and steadily edged up closer to
the end. PARDON MY HEART tracked the pace near the inside through early stages, had to wait for clear racing room at the quarter pole, raced behind a
wall of pursuer top stretch then switched in a couple paths, put to a drive and inched up closer in final stages. TAPIT TO RIDE stalked the leader down the
backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, vied into stretch run then gave way in late stages. BAY HARBOR cleared on top and
crossed inside in opening stages, set the pace down the backstretch then challenged for the lead at the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch then
gave way.

Footnotes
STARSHIP ARAMIS broke alertly and grabbed the lead, rated along inside to the far turn, briefly lost the advantage to KAHRAMANI after six furlongs,
fought back gamely inside that foe and prevailed after a stretch duel. KAHRAMANI raced in striking range three wide to the far turn, poked a head in front of
STARSHIP ARAMIS approaching the stretch, battled outside that foe to late and was outgamed. TWO STEP SLEW became keyed up under a firm hold
around the first turn and into the backstretch, settled down after a half-mile or so, had aim outside the leaders turning for home and was one-paced to the
finish. LAPOCHKA raced three wide, came under pressure on the far turn and could not gain. HE'S SMOKIN HOT went into the first turn four wide before
moving inward, put in a mild run along the rail on the far turn, but flattened out. ICONIC underwent a four-wide journey and did not become a factor. MR
CHAPLIN was five wide into the first turn, moved inward a few paths and pressed the pace outside the eventual winner up the backstretch, and dropped
back between horses before completing six furlongs. DOUBLE WHAMMY stopped approaching the far turn, was eased into the lane and pulled up before
the finish, and walked off.

Footnotes
CAMP RANDALL broke on top then conceded position to the top pair and tracked embattled duo around the turn, roused forward under strong handling in
stretch run, edged by to a slim lead deep stretch and just lasted over rail gaining SARASOTA COUNTY. SARASOTA COUNTY hustled along not too far off
the early pace in early stages, saved ground around the turn then dug in gamely up the inside in stretch run and edged closer to the wire. MACHO BLUE
dueled for the lead in opening stages with REAL MONEY, continued to battle around the turn, kept on gamely, stayed in aim for the lead deep stretch but
lacked the needed surge for victory. WHAT'S TO BLAME raced off the early leaders and hustled along three wide around the turn, lacked clear racing room
in two path upper stretch, tipped out a couple paths but continued without a clear path and never got to show best. BY THE SEY SHORE was ridden along
through early going and driving widest in stretch run, raced in range in the final furlong but needed more for serious impact. REAL MONEY dueled for the
lead at the outset, continued to battle racing inside of MACHO BLUE into stretch run then was all out and faded in final sixteenth. JAKE ROCKS raced in the
back and saved ground then raced three wide upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
GAME BOY BENNY vied early between horses, dueled inside SAINT LARNED around the turn, shook well clear hand ridden through the furlong grounds,
and came under a late drive to remain in command. BEAU TRACE got bumped between horses and checked back after the start, advanced in the two-path
midway on the turn before having to pause behind horses just outside the quarter-pole, moved to the rail into the stretch and finished well. ZIPPY bumped
with SAINT LARNED at the start, raced three wide for a half-mile, and gained mildly on the far outside late. NACHO PAPA vied early inside rivals, and
dropped back into the turn. MEET CUTE bumped with BEAU TRACE at the start, went along in the two-path to the stretch, and lacked a late response.
SAINT LARNED was bumped between horses at the start, raced outside NACHO PAPA and GAME BOY BENNY intent on getting the early lead, got
outdueled by the latter after a half, and gave way.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET broke out and bumped with foe then quickly advanced between to take a slim lead, cleared on top still unleashed near the quarter pole
then pulled away upper stretch under a strong hand ride and stayed sharp while ridden out. DIXIEINCANDYLAND raced along the rail and forced to check
while in tight near the seven sixteenths pole, lost momentum then put back into action along the rail late turn, roused up the inside in stretch run, was solid in
response but was no match for the clear winner. AWSUM ROAR bumped slightly strides out of the gate and chased in three path around the turn, continued
a steady bid under steady pressure in stretch run and drifted wider in final stages. FIGHTRESS was away in good order and angled in to race two wide, was
forced to steady while in tight near three eighths pole, stayed inside to two wide around the turn then shifted wider top of the lane and failed to move on.
BENTLEY'S DREAM raced three wide in the rear early on, saved ground near the inside on the turn then prompted three to four wide in stretch run and
improved position without threatening. TIZ RED WINE raced in close contention along the inside on the turn, stayed on two wide upper stretch then failed to
sustain bid and gave way nearing the furlong marker. HY DOLLFACE got bumped between foes just after the start, raced in the back along the outside then
widest in stretch run and lacked a needed rally. DEALER'S GIRL got bumped a bit shortly after the start then checked near the half mile marker, raced wide
into the stretch and offered no late rally. TAP TAP TAPAROO was off to a good start and raced in aim for the lead, continued in close contention around the
turn then came up empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
LADY PANDA bumped with LOVE RANGER at the start, then shifted out contributing to crowding, settled in the second flight to the far turn, began moving
four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied steadily to overtake TYNAN and draw clear. TYNAN quickly cleared to the lead, rated along inside to the
stretch, could not withstand the winner but held well. SISTER OTOOLE took up after getting squeezed back between LOVE RANGER and PRETTY AND
FAST a couple strides from the gate, trailed three wide into the far turn, moved out widest for the drive and rallied late to get up for a share of third. PRETTY
AND FAST bumped with MO OF THE WEST at the start, then was bumped again between that one and SISTER OTOOLE, advanced three wide
challenging between horses after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. MO OF THE WEST bumped with PRETTY AND FAST at the break and again
a couple strides later, raced in the second flight three wide to the lane, and lacked a solid response. BY HIS GRACE prompted the pace outside TYNAN for
six furlongs, moved inside through the stretch and weakened. LOVE RANGER got bumped around repeatedly between LADY PANDA and SISTER
OTOOLE at the break and through the first few strides, and was no menace inside. COUPLE OF NIKKIS was under a firm hold steadying slightly behind I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT after a quarter-mile, and was empty when roused. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT steadied inside behind the leaders approaching the
backstretch, stayed close to the stretch and faded under pressure.
