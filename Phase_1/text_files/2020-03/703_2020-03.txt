Footnotes
MY PERFECT GRAYDAR vied for the early lead, raced three wide and just up got in the final stages under strong pressure. COLLEGE PARTY pressed the
pace, raced two wide and finished gamely to the wire. PERFECT LINE showed good speed from the inside and weakened a bit late. MASTERPIECE DAY
dropped back early, angled four wide through the lane and closed belatedly. OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY was hustled throughout, raced along the inside in the
stretch and had not enough late. IT NEVER HAPPENED stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and weakened late.
FIRST MOON dropped back early and failed to have a response. MISS M KAYS DEPUTY was slow early and never threatened. COUNTRY KING showed
little. SCOTTY G raced far back and never threatened.
