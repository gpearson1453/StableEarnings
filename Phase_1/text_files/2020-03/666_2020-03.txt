Footnotes
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA stalked the pace three wide around the turn, bid for the lead outside DON'TBAGGAGECHECK, near the three sixteenths pole,
drifted in near the eighth pole and drove clear late. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK lightly bumped with PIGEON CREEK leaving the starting gate, showed speed
along the rail, rated back leaving the backstretch, angled to the two path entering the turn, gained the lead approaching the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. PIGEON CREEK lightly bumped with the winner at the start, saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home and had a
slight rally between rivals. EXPECT TALK , two wide on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. PARCHED GHOST saved
ground on the turn, angled out for the drive and finished willingly between horses. JUST FOR SPITE sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, angled in, set
the pace along the rail and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
FONTAINE broke a step slow, regrouped and edged up off the rail nearing the turn, gave chase three to four wide around the turn and into the lane, rallied
under left handed pressure, took command a sixteenth out then was fully extended to hold off an inside challenge from KICKSTARTMYHEART.
KICKSTARTMYHEART saved ground chasing the leaders, took closer order approaching the quarter pole, steadied off heels in upper stretch, shifted out a
bit then closed gamely inside the winner to miss. HYDRA bobbled slightly at the break, prompted the pace outside HICKORY MADE, applied more pressure
past the three eighths, dueled into the lane, gained the advantage past the three sixteenths, failed to resist the winner and faded late. GIULIA AMMANNATI
broke outward, was corrected and moved up, rated back briefly then was shuffled back a few lengths while saving ground into the turn, angled out and was
put to a hearty ride, circled five wide advancing into the lane, ranged up in mid stretch but failed to seriously follow through. GOLDEN CHANCE settled off
the pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch and offered a mild response. HICKORY MADE was sent to the front, angled in and set the pace,
took outside pressure into and around the turn, dueled past the three sixteenths then succumbed through the final sixteenth of a mile.

Footnotes
BANDOLINI , three wide leaving the backstretch, was taken to the inner rail mid way on the turn, found room inside horses to take command in upper
stretch then quickly drew out. GOODLUCKCHUCK , bumped by PLAY BOY SKOAL about a sixteenth of a mile after the break, circled the turn, floated six
deep in upper stretch and rallied. COAST TO COAST bobbled at the break, eased off the rail mid way on the turn, was steadied when placed in tight
quarters by LEADING MAN in upper stretch and weakened. WINSTON'S WAY , two wide on the turn, was carried to the five path in upper stretch and
weakened. THEKIDSBACK , two wide on the turn, was not a factor. LEADING MAN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the rail around the turn,
drifted out on COAST TO COAST in upper stretch then tired. PLAY BOY SKOAL bumped GOODLUCKCHUCK when drifting in near the six furlongs pole
then was outrun.

Footnotes
LADY ROZINA settled off the rail and commenced a run as a pace battle developed past the five sixteenths, angled five wide into the lane, closed in under
pressure, hit the front near the sixteenth marker, kicked clear then held sway. CHICKEN DINNER , towards the inside leaving the far turn, swung wide for
the drive and closed steadily to gain the place. LISA MILA broke outward, corrected and moved up outside DATA PRINCESS nearing the turn, vied four
wide outside that rival entering the lane, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, fought on past the sixteenth marker then faded late. DATA PRINCESS sped to
the front, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure around the turn, dueled two wide and to the inside of a rival in upper stretch, battled past the furlong
grounds then weakened in the final seventy yards. REDEEMED SPIRIT stumbled at the break, recovered and moved up to stalk the pace, failed to kick on
past the five sixteenths, faltered through the drive and was eased late.

FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY chased the pace, circled the turn three wide, secured command at the top of the stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole, remained on
his left lead and drew away under brisk, left hand urging. WHATS THE CHANCES rushed up inside horses to take the lead mid way down the backstretch,
hugged the inner rail, weakened through the stretch but held on for second. GOTTAWAY saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the
stretch and passed tired horses. GET THERE JOHN , well positioned two wide on the turn, angled outside entering the stretch and weakened. ALEPH
prompted the pace two wide and gave way in upper stretch. BOURBON AGOGO was outrun. MR. RAINBOW trailed. Due to a timer malfunction, the
fractions and final time were hand timed.

TWIXY CAT , bumped at the break and a bit rank, recovered and stalked the leaders into the turn, took closer order as a duel developed around the turn,
rallied four wide and moved clear of rivals a furlong out, switched over to his correct lead near the sixteenth pole and widened under pressure. TAPPIN
HONOR bobbled at the break, was hard sent then bumped and put FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET in tight when angled towards the rail in the opening sixteenth,
straightened and went clear, was joined leaving the far turn by QUAD EIGHTS, dueled with that one from the five sixteenths to the three sixteenths, could
not resist the winner near the furlong grounds but continued willingly to the line. QUAD EIGHTS leaned in at the break and bumped with TWIXY CAT,
moved up outside and bid to join TAPPIN HONOR past the half mile pole, sparred from mid turn to past the three sixteenths then faded. INSIDE RISK ,
bumped at the break, raced outside a rival into the turn and lacked a response. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET broke awkwardly and towards the inside, was sent
up along the rail, was bumped and checked out of tight quarters leaving the five and a half furlong pole, dropped back into the turn and failed to recover.
Following an objection by the rider of FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET, TAPPIN HONOR was disqualified from second and placed last for causing interference in
the opening furlong.

Footnotes
TOM TERRIFIC stalked outside a rival, bid to engage mid turn, took command four wide into the lane, was joined from his inside in mid stretch, kept on
under left handed rousing and just held. VEE'S SUPER STAR stalked the pace while saving ground, got through along the rail in upper stretch, bid to
engage the winner a furlong out, battled gamely but just missed. PERFECT HEIR , off the early pace, moved up between foes mid turn, shifted out, loomed
nearing mid stretch but flattened out. NONNO PIETRO broke outward and bumped a rival, was ridden along mid turn, swung wide and had a belated kick. V
FOR VIOLENCE broke a step slow then was bumped, was taken wide and used about five wide to advance into the turn, ranged up near the quarter pole,
chased to mid stretch then faded. SWAMP WATER , off the pace inside, angled out in the drive but failed to menace. LITTLE BAY sped clear early, took
pressure leaving the far turn, drifted three wide into the lane and weakened. UNBELIEVABLE STORY gave early chase and weakened.
