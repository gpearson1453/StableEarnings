Footnotes
LUCILLE OF TROY was rated in good position along the rail, swung to the outside leaving the turn, quickly ran clear into the final furlong and drew away
under mild urging. SUPER DONNA G was reluctant to leave the paddock then was reluctant to load, ducked out while breaking sharply, stalked outside,
raced three wide into the stretch and continued evenly. UP JUST IN TIME was bumped soundly leaving the gate, was hustled to a clear lead before going a
furlong, stayed out from the rail around the turn, ran out entering the stretch then tired. MUSICAL TIMES stumbled badly leaving the gate, came in, bumped
UP JUST IN TIME, stayed well out from the inside and trailed.

Footnotes
TOP HAT TREASON was knocked around at the start by an outer rival breaking inward, tracked from midpack in the two path, shifted to the three path at
the quarter pole to be outside of the leading pair turning for home, produced a three wide bid passing the furlong marker, and drove past in the final
sixteenth. LORD RED PEAK broke inwards, was forwardly placed, shifted from the four to the three path into the turn to engage the loose leader, made a
two wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, inched a slight lead in upper stretch, but was surpassed by an outer oncharging rival in the final sixteenth.
PENNY'S LEGACY sped to a clear lead early on, met a challenge from LORD RED PEAK at the quarter pole, dug in as that rival grabbed a slight lead, but
yielded late. VISHNU was put to an all out drive in the four path into the turn, and lacked a kick through the lane. START A FIRE saved ground while trailing
around the turn, hesitated to gain inside of the inner drifting A T M AWESOME in upper stretch, got through along the rail at the furlong pole, and offered a
mild kick, but never threatened. RIVER FLYINRED RVF broke inwards, took the turn in the three to five path, but failed to factor. A T M AWESOME was
broken into by an outer rival and was jostled between horses at the start, saved ground from midpack, shifted to the two to three path around the turn,
drifted inwards in upper stretch and weakened through the lane.

COOLWATER showed speed outside from the start, moved two wide to a clear lead into the turn, remained out from the inside into the stretch then was put
to urging. NEXT QUEEN was very slow leaving the gate, lagged early, began a run along the inside into the turn and finished willingly. SUNNY HILL
BOBBIE ran inside the winner into the turn, fell back, angled out into the three path approaching the lane and continued evenly. MINNOW was unhurried
inside, came out two wide on the turn then gained outside through late stretch. THISONESFORJEN broke slowly, stayed out from the rail around the turn
and found best stride too late. PRIDE IN THE BIZ was slow early while in the three path around the turn and failed to menace with a late gain.

Footnotes
EYES ON ME set the pace in the two path, dueled inside of HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME around the far turn, dug in gamely while holding a slight lead in
upper stretch, and prevailed gamely after getting away in the final sixteenth. HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME prompted the leader from the outside while being
kept in the three path, inched forward to duel for the lead into the far turn, sustained the duel in upper stretch without achieving an advantage, and got
outdueled and gave way in the final sixteenths. BELLOWS stalked in the four path, stayed in range of the dueling leaders through the far turn, but lacked the
needed kick to threaten in upper stretch, then made mild headway in the late stages. RUN AWAY raced close up to the pace along the inside, but weakened
into the far turn. MONEYBAGS was crowded at the start and took back between horses, trailed along the inside around the turns, and failed to play a factor.
CINCO Y CINCO was outrun two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
BOOMBA BRAD settled outside, commenced a rally three wide into the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drew even on the front end while outside
horses leaving the furlong grounds and was going away at the end of a stiff drive. LONG TOM wasn't far back along the rail into the far turn, fell back,
swung three wide between horses into the stretch, vied on near even terms inside the winner until deep stretch then faltered. BIZ NASTY was unhurried two
wide following a slow break, was caught behind the first flight in early stretch, edged to the outside in midstretch for room and finished gamely. PIPPIN
stalked under rating in the three path, moved to a short lead midway on the final turn, remained in control while between horses entering the final furlong
then gave up position late when not persevered with. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the rail while
making the way in the two path, remained prominent inside the first flight into the final furlong, faded and was eased up late. JASPER K failed to matter.

ROLLING PALISADES took multiple brief bumps to his hind quarters by his inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, shifted from the two to the
three path around the far turn while meeting a challenge from THUNDER GRUNDER, repelled that foe in upper stretch as that one lugged in, then held
sway to the wire while under light encouragement late. THUNDER GRUNDER advanced three wide from midpack to chase the loose leader into the far turn,
produced a bid at the quarter pole while being floated to the four path by the inner leader, but got outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, lugged in under right
handed pressure approaching the furlong pole, failed to match strides the eventual winner, then lugged in twice more in the late stages when the rider
switched back to right handed pressure. DARLING DARIO broke out a bit and bumped his outer foe two times at the start, stalked along the inside from the
pocket, but failed to keep pace with the leader around the far turn, then kept on through the late stages to secure show, but was no threat. SPOT OF GOLD
took both turns three wide while off of the pace, then failed to produce a bid and weakened. STARRY SKY trailed by a distance early on, cut the gap on the
field around the far turn in the two to three path, then failed to make an impact through the lane. DETERMINED PURSUIT pressed the pace two wide, but
weakened between horses into the far turn, and stopped through the lane.
