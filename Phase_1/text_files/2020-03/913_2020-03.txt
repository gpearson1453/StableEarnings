AFLEET SNIPER hugged the inner rail around the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch, stalked the pace, advanced three wide on the far turn, bid
for the lead outside KIRK OF DIAMONDS in upper stretch, dueled with that one and got the fortuitous bob at the wire. KIRK OF DIAMONDS , off slowly,
rushed up three deep on the first turn, angled in on the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the far turn, dueled outside the winner in the stretch
and just missed in a game performance. FLASH FORCAST advanced four deep on the far turn then flattened out. SONIC JET , unhurried down the
backstretch, failed to rally. FAFA hugged the inner rail around the far turn then gave way in the stretch.

KRIS ME DEADLY sprinted to the early lead, angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, repelled a challenger in mid stretch and drew
away. SHAWN AGAIN , bumped by RIVAL CONQUEST leaving the starting gate, moved up outside SAZERAC REMEDY mid way down the backstretch,
was bumped by that one entering the turn, challenged for the lead outside the winner in upper stretch then flattened out. TOPOGIO , four deep on the turn,
had a mild rally. OKIE BUCK , three wide on the turn, failed to rally in an even effort. SAZERAC REMEDY bumped SHAWN AGAIN when bearing out
entering the turn, chased the pace inside horses and weakened. TWIST BACK CREEK raced in mid pack and failed to rally. COPE'S HOPE was outrun
after breaking slowly. GRUFFANDTOUGH was no factor. RIVAL CONQUEST bumped SHAWN AGAIN when bearing in at the break, steadied in traffic near
the half mile pole, hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run into the turn but no action was taken.
