MY IDOL was unhurried to the half, bid two then three wide on the second turn, rallied when set down for the drive and wore down WAVERLY WAY late.
WAVERLY WAY chased the pace to the second turn, ralied three wide to get to terms into the stretch, pushed to a short lead leaving mid stretch but could
not stall the winner. PRIVATE KITTY set the pace from the rail to the second turn, met bids from both TOOLEY TUNES and WAVERLY WAY to mid stretch
then was outfinished. TOOLEY TUNES pressed the pace outside of PRIVATE KITTY to the second turn, pushed up to try to engage for the lead into the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME broke a bit slow, had no speed and trailed to the second turn, swung out four
wide into the stretch but could not threaten in the drive. SURE MAGIC had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONESS was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, responded when set down and closed steadily to win driving. PROUD TO
SHOYU had no speed, was three wide into the turn then came out slightly and bumped CHARMING ANGEL nearing the quarter pole, shifted out for room
and closed with a rush but too late. TIZ THE STANDARD stalked the leaders to the turn, pushed up two wide to engage for the lead into the stretch, dueled
past the furlong grounds then was outfinished. EIGHT O FIVE hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure while two wide to the stretch, responded to
mid stretch but was weakening late. CARIBOU CHIANTI got outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late
response. COACH'S VALENTINE brushed the gate coming out and was a bit slow, hustled up to press the pace inside to the stretch but tired in the drive.
CHARMING ANGEL was chasing to the turn, bid three wide then was bumped by PROUD TO SHOYU and pushed out to the five path into the stretch and
gave way.

BULLETPROOF ONE zipped to the front, set the pace two wide to the stretch then was well clear to mid stretch and under steady hand urging to the line
without use of the whip. SMILEFORME bobbled then bumped with FOREIGN PROTOCOL, was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and dug
in to save the place. JIVE TALKIN chased the winner from the rail to the stretch then lacked a closing bid. LITTLE CENTS had no speed and saved ground
to no avail. ADMIRABLY was also chasing to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. FOREIGN PROTOCOL bumped with
SMILEFORME at the start, had no speed, was four wide to the stretch and came up empty.
