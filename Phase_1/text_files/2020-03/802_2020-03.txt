Footnotes
AFLEET ROGER broke out at the start, was eased back nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was rated just off the pace then asked in
the three path on the far turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, drew away under a couple of very light taps of a left-handed whip into the final
furlong, was placed under a brisk hand ride into the final forty yards then came under lighter encouragement while much the best. HE'S A CLIMBER went
around the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace between horses, took the lead inside the five-eighths, vied in the two path on the far turn, lost the
lead to the winner nearing the quarter-pole and proved no match while just able to get the place. ZARTASTIC went six then five wide on the first turn,
tracked the pace on the outside, was asked to keep his mind on business near the half-pole, chased five then four wide on the far turn and narrowly missed
the place while clear for the show. CABO HEADACHE went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn
then driven three wide into the stretch and was no threat. DYNA GHOST set the early pace on the inside, lost the lead inside the five-eighths, dropped back
under urging while along the rail on the far turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and tired. JENNOVODKA tossed his head just as the gate opened
and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along while two then three wide on the far
turn then driven five wide into the stretch under the whip, drifted out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to respond. SILENT CRY went five wide
early on the first turn then dropped to the four path, settled towards the back on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went five then six
wide on the far turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and showed little. PRIME HOOK broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the
pace on the outside, dropped back while four wide on the far turn and retreated.

LISTEN UP pressed the pacesetter from outside, went three wide on the turn shadowing that one, took a very narrow lead just past the three-sixteenths,
was given a few right-handed cracks from the whip in upper stretch, began to edge away nearing the sixteenth and continued to extend the margin
thereafter under hand urging. MILLENNIUM FORCE broke inwardly, set the pace inside the aforementioned rival but off the fence into the turn, was
challenged in upper stretch, fought on gamely but yielded grudgingly late. JIM'S BRONZE STAR bumped the inside rival at the break, moved in heading up
the backstretch, saved ground on the turn before coming out a path into upper stretch, was no match for the top pair. HANDS UP raced at the rear inside,
saved ground on the turn, came out to the two then three path for the drive and improved position inside. TEXAS PROMO GIRL broke outwardly and was
thereupon taken hold to correct, raced outside rivals at the rear, went five then six wide on the turn coming seven deep past the quarter pole, gained late.
PINK POSSE was positioned mid-pack going four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. THREE QUARTER TIME was encouraged along early but devoid of
speed, checked early on the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, moved out in mid-stretch but failed to rally. STORMY MERLOT was brushed at the
break then taken up soon after as the offending rival moved in, switched outside a foe heading up the backstretch who was moving in, went in the three path
on the turn entering that bend between rivals and was never a threat. GO TWEET raced off the leaders inside up the backstretch into the turn, entering that
bend quickly moved off the rail to the two path then to the three path still inside a rival and nearer the leaders, swung four deep out of that bend before
moving six wide near mid-stretch but faltered and faded. HALF DIALED chased from outside early after breaking well, went three to four wide on the turn,
dropped back and faded. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
LONTANO tracked in behind the leaders near but just off the inside, moved out from the two path to the three then four path when beginning to edge closer
leaving the turn, came five wide past the quarter pole and was asked for run, struck the lead in upper stretch and drew clear under urging then was eased
up late. SALADO was hustled from the gate, set a pressured pace inside, saved ground on the turn and was just clear leaving that bend, drifted from the
whip near mid-stretch and proved no match for the winner. HAIG POINT was off a step slow, settled towards the back, went two to three wide on the turn,
was guided out at the quarter pole then pulled back in by the rider, finally moved out soon after before lugging in and brushing a rival near the furlong
marker, ran on well to be gaining late and galloped out strongly. GOOD ONE bumped the inside rival then was bumped in turn at the start, shifted in rapidly
soon after the start, pressed the pace from outside two wide on the turn then weakened. JUPESTAR raced outside at the rear going five wide on the turn,
improved position in the stretch. BROADCAST LEGEND broke outwardly and exchanged a sharp bump with a rival, raced in behind. CITRUS BURST raced
between foes early, went in the three path on the turn, had no late bid. TWO POINT OH was forwardly-positioned early up the backstretch chasing from
outside, went four to five wide on the turn, was bumped near the furlong marker while beginning to weaken and continued weakening thereafter. AND HE'S
LOOSE chased from outside rivals mid-pack into the turn, went five wide on that bend, steadied just past the quarter pole as a rival veered out and came up
empty. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY was bumped between rivals at the break, raced at the rear just off the rail through the turn and was not a threat. (Rail at 9

Footnotes
CHANGE DIRECTION broke very alertly, set the pace under pressure to his outside, dropped from the two path to the rail while under heavy pressure from
the runner-up early on the turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths, fought back gamely along the rail into the final furlong, regained the advantage into
the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong handling. MR LEO pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader while three then two wide on
the turn, took the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage back to the winner into the final furlong
and was outfinished while clear for the place. POCHO'S DREAM was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, came three wide into
the stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the show. TAPIZART bumped with foes on both sides at the start then was taken up while squeezed back,
angled in at the rear of the field, moved up near the half-mile pole, started the turn in the two path then angled five wide at the three-eighths, spun six wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. EGOBUSTER bumped with a rival at the start and was off a half-step slow, moved up then chased the
pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn and tired. MESSED UP lacked speed on the outside, went four wide on the turn under urging, came five
wide into the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. WICKED STATEMENT bumped with an opponent at the start and was off
a half-step slow, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. MORO PHAROAH was urged along on the outside, dropped from four to three
wide early on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip and failed to respond. RONNIE'S REASONING settled under some urging, fell back
leaving the backstretch, dropped from three wide to the rail early on the turn, took an awkward stride against the rail inside the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
NET A BEAR settled at the rear inside, saved ground on the first turn, began to advance inside on the far turn still saving ground, found a wide opening in
upper stretch and was asked at the quarter, got through to take command past the three-sixteenths under left- then right-handed urging and held safe. IS
TOO broke on top and quickly moved clear, set the pace racing well off the rail in the two to three path, extended the margin early up the backstretch, began
to lose ground still removed from the inside on the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on to save the place. TAP DANCE STAR exchanged a
couple light brushes at the break, raced between foes into the first turn going two to three wide on that bend, was given a little more encouragement past the
three-eighths on the far turn going three then four deep on that turn, moved out inside the furlong marker and ran on well to get show honors over
BERMUDA STAR, who got away cleanly, shifted in heading to the first turn, saved ground on that bend off the leader, edged closer on the far turn going
from the inside to the three path on that bend, could not kick on with the top ones and lost position late. ESKENFORMORE broke outwardly brushing with a
rival a couple times at the start, threw her head going down the home straight into the first turn, saved ground on or just off the rail through that bend, came
out and went three deep into the far turn while being encouraged a bid midway on that bend moving out a further path, came five wide to the quarter pole
and failed to menace late. ROOM TO FINISH was outside foes mid-division three wide early, was within range four then five wide on the far turn, came six
wide into upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch. THEGRAYSPIDER raced outside three to four wide on the first turn, continued outside foes five wide
into the far turn and was not a factor. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
SEATTLE SLANG leaned out and brushed the gate at the start then brushed with a foe, saved ground on the first turn, moved up quickly between the
five-eighths and the nine-sixteenths, tracked the pace from that point, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch
while on even terms for the lead with KIZZY B, dueled inside that foe into the final furlong, shook clear shortly thereafter, extended the advantage under the
whip until just outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride while widening to the wire as a much the best winner. KIZZY B moved in
entering the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, moved out near the five-eighths then settled on the outside, advanced closer midway down the
backstretch, ranged up three wide on the far turn, made an outside bid passing the five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the winner into the final furlong and
proved no match while well clear for the place. TIZSO AWESOME went to the front, dropped from the four path to the three path early on the first turn then
moved to the two path late on that bend, set the clear pace, raced inside on the far turn, was asked under threat from the top two at the five-sixteenths, lost
the lead outside the quarter-pole and tired while able to hold the show. FRESHMAN CLASS broke a step slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled near
the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn while moving closer, came three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the
three-sixteenths and failed to respond. ANIMA GEMELLA raced inside for most of the first turn then moved to the two path, settled towards the front, chased
three wide on the far turn, dropped back while crowded a bit around the three-eighths then moved to the four path and capitulated. ORB'S SOUL brushed
with a foe at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was taken in hand near the three-quarter pole, settled well back in the field, dropped from the two
path to the rail early on the far turn and was no factor. TACTFUL SUSAN was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
was ridden along while four then three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
FRENCH EMPIRE went three wide on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, rounded the far turn in the two to three path, was asked while five wide
into the stretch, kept PUCA PENNY in behind foes at that point, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker and just held off the aforementioned foe under
strong urging. PUCA PENNY settled on the inside, shifted four wide at the top of the stretch then was kept in behind horses by the winner, came under
urging behind horses before the three-sixteenths, rallied when finding room outside the furlong marker, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth and
just missed while clear for the place. GLAMOUR GAL went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far
turn, spun three wide into the stretch, made a bid near the three-sixteenths, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get a share of
the show. APPEALING AUDREY went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, was roused while six
wide into the stretch, gained on her inside lead into the final furlong, switched to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to get a
share of the show. AWESOME ONE was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper
stretch and gave way. ZURLIN angled in early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved at the back, rounded the far turn in the two path, lacked room
behind horses in upper stretch then altered course to the outside, dropped in outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. MAGICAL PEAPOD
leaned in at the start, was taken under a tight hold early then rated on the inside, saved ground just behind the leader on the far turn, was kept In while
trying to get out outside the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong and weakened. CONNECTIVITY went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the
pace on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths,
dropped back under the whip into the final furlong and came up empty. GRANDEZZA went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged
along while four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 9 Feet)

strongly to win going away. GOOD OLD CHARLIE went around the first turn in the two path, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside on the
far turn, moved clear inside the three-eighths, remained clear into the final furlong under a drive, led until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear
for the place. BROKEJAW went three to four wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn,
turned into the stretch under the whip and improved position to get the show. MAJESTIC SOCIETY bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up
