weakened in the late stages while getting the nod for the show honors. HIGH OPINION chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, bid
three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. WISHES AND DREAMS two to three wide in pursuit, came under an off sided stick near the

Footnotes
Following a delay of twelve minutes necessitated by a trio of late scratches, ROUSEY raced four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing in steadily and was up in the very last jump to prevail. PENDOLINO coaxed from
the gate, chased inside briefly before racing two to three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a
drive taking command just inside the eighth pole, came under growing threat and came out to look the challenger in the eye and was nailed on the wire.
DEJA RACONTE showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from VITANZA and LOVELY ESCORT from flanking positions, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat from only the outside prompter, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in and yielded just inside the eighth pole,
then weakened in the late stages. VITANZA prompted the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. FUNDERELLA coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LOVELY ESCORT prompted the pace from the two path until tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn and cut the corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive.
FIRESTORMY chased just off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and made no impact. GOLDEN SLUMBERS brushed the off side stall at the start, chased five then four wide down the backstretch
before taking to the three path through the turn, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and trailed throughout.

down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, ran
