Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE MESA was reluctant to load, had a slow start, swept past inner rivals with a four wide blitz into the turn, made a bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, and kicked away under driving pressure in upper stretch. TONIGHT MAYBE stalked in the two to three path, attempted a bid at the quarter
pole, but was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, then edged place away from her inner foe at the sixteenth pole. RUSSIAN MELODY
prompted the pace three wide, forged a slight lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was quickly hounded by QUEEN OF THE MESA, proved no match for that
rival in upper stretch, dug in for place, but was edged out of that position at the sixteenth pole. LET'S GO DANZING chased the pace setters along the
inside, but was shuffled back behind THREE POTATOE FOUR into the turn, shifted to the four path, and stayed on through the lane, but failed to threaten
the leaders. THREE POTATOE FOUR dueled inside a pair of rivals early on, but failed to keep pace with them into the turn, and weakened. PRINGIPESSA
had a slow start, trailed while staying in the four path through the turn, and was no factor. DECOLLETE dueled between horses early on, but weakened at
the five sixteenths pole, resented the kick back once behind rivals at the quarter pole, and subsequently stopped through the lane.

SUNDAY IN L B C advanced the rail to a short lead midway on the backstretch, drew out early on the turn and held under confident handling. DEIRDRE OF
LEGEND held a short early lead outside the winner, fell back on the turn, angled to the rail in early stretch and gained to the end. GIULIANA VEE bobbled
leaving the gate, was unhurried early, raced three wide around the turn and finished fastest outside. FAIRY DUST advanced the three path around the turn
but failed to sustain her run through the lane. SANSA wasn't far back along the rail into the turn then weakened. SPECTACULAR NOW broke in the air, was
bumped a few strides out of the gate, stayed inside and failed to matter. CATALINA R briefly showed speed between rivals. NORMANS GIRL GAYLE came
out into SPECTACULAR NOW after the break, wasn't far back between rivals to the turn then stopped.

THURMAN MERMAN stalked three wide before making a bid for the lead into the turn, forged a slight advantage while hanging on his left lead in upper
stretch, changed leads and shifted in a bit at the furlong pole, then drew clear in the late stages. OLD FAITHFUL prompted in the pace inside a pair of rivals,
took back and shifted to the four to five path at the quarter pole to attempt a three wide bid outside of those rivals in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead,
and produced a mild grind to reach place in the closing stages. TIPSY MOOSE set the pace between horses in the two path, met a challenge from
THURMAN MERMAN into the turn, held a slight advantage to the quarter pole, dug in as that foe inched a slight lead in upper stretch, then gave way after
that rival shifted slightly inwards and into him at the furlong pole, but he did not have his momentum hindered. AGAINST THE ODDS saved ground while
rating off of the pace, and failed to threaten. BIG DAVE hopped a bit at the start, but was outrun throughout, and showed little in a dull effort.

IM FOREVERYOUNG established a clear advantage early on, held his margin while in hand in the two to three path around the turn, then responded well
when asked passing the three sixteenths pole, and held sway under driving pressure to the wire. GOLDEN SPUN LAD stalked from outside of the loose
leader, chased that foe from the three to four path around the turn, but proved no match in upper stretch, kept on through the lane, and was clearly second
best. WAR OF THE NORTH was reloaded after a gate scratch of his adjacent rival, trailed along the inside early on, passed a weakening foe into the turn,
then another turning for home by saving ground, and failed to threaten while staying on for a minor reward. SURPRISE VISIT was hard hustled in the early
stages for position, chased three wide, but weakened around the turn. FORMER MARINE broke outwards, weakened to trail the field into the turn, was
eased through the turn, pulled up passing the furlong pole, then was dismounted and unsaddled at the sixteenth pole, and walked off.

RAISETONEW HEIGHTS settled outside, rallied three wide into the stretch, took over from the outside leaving the furlong grounds, drew clear before a mile
and widened under urging. JEWELS AND PEARLS stayed out from the rail while chasing the early leader, moved two wide to a short lead nearing the
quarter pole and couldn't stay with the winner through the lane. BIG SHOT POSSE fell back along the rail on the backstretch, angled out nearing the stretch,
bore out through the lane and continued evenly late. SWEET DANCER moved to a clear lead before going a furlong, angled to the rail on the first turn,
remained in command for just over six furlongs then tired in the drive. SO WHO'S BACK stayed outside, drifted badly through the lane and was eased up
late.

POLAR JET stalked from the four path outside of a rival, inched forward in the three path to make a bid outside of the leader at the quarter pole, forged a
slight lead turning for home, but hung on his left lead, failed to kick away, but just held his inner rival's rebid at bay to the wire. MY ONLY SUNSHINE quickly
cleared off, set the pace under a loose rein in the two path, met a challenge and was headed by POLAR JET turning for home, but dug in gamely as that
rival hung on his left lead, rebid in the late stages, but did not have enough to reclaim the lead. WHOSE BABY IS THAT trailed in the four path around the
turn, shifted to the six path turning for home, and rallied outside of horses for show. TUFF DUFF shifted from the three path to the five path to be outside of
the leaders turning for home, but lacked the needed kick to threaten, and was ridden under light urging through the late stages due to being in tight quarters.
TELLING YOU TWICE advanced position and chased from the four path and outside of rivals around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, and tired
while in tight quarters in the late stages. DOWNHILL RACER saved ground off of the pace into the turn, but steadied when he ran up into the tiring
SMOOTH TALK at the five sixteenths pole, split foes, shifted off the inside to the four path to make a bid for minor rewards, put other rivals in tight quarters
by doing so, but no contact was exchanged, then got outfinished by those foes for a minor reward. SMOOTH TALK rushed inside of rivals to chase the pace
setter from the three path, but weakened into the turn, rapidly faded around the bend, and was eased through the lane.
