outfinished. WHATAROCKET pressed leader to to deep stretch, grudgingly to the wire. WAVERLY SUNSET set a pressure pace to the stretch, wore down,
faltered. PHONE BOOKIN IT no speed to far turn, swung widest past quarter pole and improved through the stretch far outside. BUSBY SPRING outside
position with no late response when needed. MOUNTAIN MELODIES never a menace. SHE'S FLASHY never a menace. PROSSER'S KITTEN never a
factor. HIGH VISION outrun. THE MORE I BURN never close. NIVA through after half, dropped back.

Footnotes
FLIRTY was off a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, raced along the six path into the lane, rallied in the stretch and drove past the leaders three
wide in the final stages. PURE SUGAR set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch from the rail but did not have
enough in the final stages. MOMENTA KAT chased the pace while widest along the backstretch, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch
from between horses but hung in the late stages. CATTY KRYS chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.
NO INTEREST raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. MARIA ROSE was in the six path into the lane and
improved position. DANCE THE DAY AWAY stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. FASHION ENVY was
never a threat. VORTICES was through after three quarters. LADY LEAH had early speed then folded up.
