Footnotes
KATHIA dueled with GRACIE'S GIRL up the backstretch, kicked clear around the turn and drew away into the stretch, held command under a drive and held
safely over the late run from the runner-up. BRITE TAN settled off the rail then angled out further, angled to the inside on the turn and saved ground to the
stretch, rallied along the fence through the final furlong but was not enough to overtake the winner. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE stalked a bit off the inside then
angled out on the backstretch, lugged out around the turn, entered the stretch four wide and gained the show. MADERA JUBILEE raced off the pace and
outside a rival, traveled two wide around the turn then came out nearing the eighth pole and never rallied. GRACIE'S GIRL dueled from the outside up the
backstretch, could not match the leader around the turn, chased three wide into the stretch and faded through the lane. TOO SOON TO KNOW angled to
the inside, saved ground around the turn and had little left for the drive.

WARM IT UP off slow at the start, trailed the field early, shifted out and bumped rival near the three-eighths marker, made progress from off the rail to the
turn, bid three deep into the stretch, gained command prior to the sixteenth pole and drew away to the wire. UNCHANGED forwardly placed early traveling
just to the inside of CHARMING WEEKEND, put in tight quarters and steadied briefly entering the turn, moved out into the two path, looked to advance but
lacked room behind a trio of rivals in the lane, found a clear path and rallied late to pick up the place. BLAZING MISS pressed the pace from the outside
then dueled around the turn, gained the lead and held command between rivals entering the stretch, lost the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and was
edged for second in the closing moments. MERGIE TROID reserved from off the rail, bumped by inside rival near the three-eighths pole, went four wide
through the turn and lacked a response. CHARMING WEEKEND set the pace off the rail with pressure to the outside, dueled along the inside through the
turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
UNEXPECTED JOURNEY dueled for the lead from the inside, a bit off the rail into the stretch, cleared JASMINE SKY in the lane and drew away. JASMINE
SKY dueled from the outside, two to three wide into the lane, could not match the winner and lasted for second. NEVADA WILD CAT stalked off the rail then
angled in approaching the turn, saved ground into the lane, finished willingly along the inside but missed the place. PAPA CABALLERO crowded between
runners and steadied early, angled out up the backstretch, traveled four wide then came out entering the stretch and found his best stride late. NOVA
stalked outside a rival, took the turn two to three wide, angled out in upper stretch and could not rally.
