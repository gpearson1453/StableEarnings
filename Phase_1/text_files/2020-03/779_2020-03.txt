Footnotes
BELLATRIX'S WAND broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and came away alertly to contest the pace, dueled outside HER ZEALOUS into the
turn, got the best of that dispute but was pounced upon from outside by DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB past the five-sixteenths, got shaken off through the furlong
grounds, moved to the rail and was resurgent through the final yards to get up. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB had aim off the dueling leaders, wrested command
three wide late on the turn, pulled clear through the stretch, but faltered the last sixteenth of a mile. HOLLY HILL moved menacingly four wide approaching
the quarter-pole, was late changing leads and could not sustain the rally. ROSASPARKS got bumped and put in tight by HER ZEALOUS and checked
sharply on the rail near the half-mile pole, and could not recover. HER ZEALOUS broke a step slow, rushed up and angled steadily inward impeding
ROSASPARKS and IMPRESSION GIVEN, dueled inside BELLATRIX'S WAND around the turn, and retreated through the lane. IMPRESSION GIVEN
bobbled appearing to clip heels behind ROSASPARKS and IMPRESSION GIVEN after a quarter-mile, and tired. PRINCESS LACIE spotted the field two or
three lengths at the start, and saw all the heels throughout.

Footnotes
ITSMYLUCKYGIRL raced in range along the inside, angled out and hustled up around the turn, gathered strong momentum under pressure and kicked
clear past the sixteenth pole. HARTS N FLOWERS lacked early foot and raced in the back, gained ground along the rail on the turn, shifted out near the
furlong marker and finished well to clear second best. SILVER NINA held a slim lead in the opening quarter then gained a clear advantage near the three
eighths pole, continued clear along the inside upper stretch then failed to sustain bid in final sixteenth. NENITA raced in touch with the leader in the opening
quarter, could not remain in striking distance of the leader past three eighths pole but chased on around the turn then flattened upper stretch. TOO STYLISH
hustled along in steady pursuit and raced two wide leaving the backstretch, stayed on with response around the turn then failed to move on in the lane.
AWESOME EVIL raced two wide off the early pace then driven along five wide a furlong out and lacked a needed rally. BELLA BIONDA raced up close in
the opening quarter, stayed on three wide around the turn then faded. FURY SONG raced off the pace along the outside and failed to move into close
contention. C EST FAST bumped with foe at the start and hustled along but lacked the needed response to gain close contention. AWESOME FLYER got
hung out wide and never reached contention. BABY SABRINA broke out at the start, hustled along through early stages then came up empty and dropped
back.

Footnotes
CRUMB BUN was sent up inside to go after SUBSIDIARY early, bumped with that rival in tight entering the turn, opted to ease back and go around with
five-sixteenths remaining, reengaged the pacesetter from outside turning for home and kicked away the last sixteenth of a mile. SUBSIDIARY bumped with
CRUMB BUN as they battled entering the turn, edged away approaching the quarter-pole in the two-path, got outdueled through upper stretch and proved
no match while best of the rest. CHUTZPAH broke slowly, saved ground throughout and offered a mild response to pick up the show. PEACE CONTROL
was no factor racing in the two-path to the stretch. MY SEBASTIANA was well placed behind the dueling leaders into the turn, had every chance putting in a
mild run from outside approaching the stretch, but flattened out. FOREVER MARTA was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
STAMINA PRINCESS settled in early stages then prompted nearing the three eighths pole, gained closer contention on the leader around the turn then was
set down driving three wide entering top stretch, took command near mid-stretch and pulled away. WATER WIZARD broke on top then dropped back and
angled inside to save ground, continued unhurried then gained ground along the rail around the turn, moved into contention then continued a steady bid
near the inside through the lane. LA VIEXA raced near the inside through early stages then tipped a bit wider and headed in pursuit around the turn, ridden
along six paths wide entering top stretch and steadily gained through the lane. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL took the lead shortly after the start and set the pace
down the backstretch, held a clear advantage at the quarter pole then put to a drive entering stretch run, got collared past the furlong marker and gave way.
UNION LANE was the closest pursuer of the leader down the backstretch, launched a bid for rival around the turn, stayed on two wide entering top of the
lane then gave way. HECHIZADA raced along the inside through early stages then shifted out wider around the turn and failed to advance in the lane.
SIGNING BONUS raced five wide off the early pace then moved three wide under pressure into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. DEBBIES UTUBE
DIVA got bumped at the start, raced in the back, moved into stretch wide and failed to move into contention.

CAPTURED BY FATE popped out of the gate with a clear lead, got hooked from outside by FLUENT IN SARCASM into the turn, got the best of that
skirmish by upper stretch and pulled clear, then had just enough to hold off MUSKOKA STORM in the closing yards. MUSKOKA STORM chased four wide
around the turn, finished determinedly and was closing in outside the winner late. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT was ridden along through the turn two to three
wide, and could not seriously menace with an even finish. FLUENT IN SARCASM went up to engage CAPTURED BY FATE from outside into the turn,
could not match strides through upper stretch, lugged in past the eighth-pole and gave way on the rail. SAIL AT SUNRISE bumped with SAM'S SPIRIT at
the start, and was outrun inside. CONFORMITY cut the corner turning for home and made no headway. NASSAU STREET raced four to five wide and was
never involved. SAM'S SPIRIT bumped with SAIL AT SUNRISE at the start, and showed nothing at the back.

ASSAIL sped to the lead strides out of the gate and quickly moved away to a clear advantage, remained well clear and raced three to four wide entering top
stretch, steadily drifted out wider and finished going away while ridden out. DIXIE PRINCESS hustled along in steady pursuit and chased three wide around
the turn, kept after the clear leader in stretch run and cleared second best. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN was the closest pursuer of the clear leader and chased
two wide around the turn, pushed on near the inside through the lane, could not gain closer contention but stayed clear for a share. SWEET YARE N DIRA
hustled up out of the gate but lacked the early foot to sustain a forward position, raced six wide into the lane and offered no late bid. IT'S EASY TO SAY
showed brief response then failed to keep pace and steadily faded.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MOON was never far back, moved up under his own power taking over three wide after six furlongs, and was under a steady drive through the
stretch to hold sway. ST JOE VIPER bumped with NEVERSTOPDREAMING at the start, went up to set the pace inside, fought back when SHANGHAI
MOON ranged alongside turning for home, and stayed on gamely. QUALITY ON TAP bobbled a couple strides from the gate, raced close up inside to the
turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and was one-paced to the finish. L' CRISTABAL saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed late
bid. ROAN MOUNTAIN came under a ride three wide on the turn, and had no response. EXATLON was no factor inside. NEVERSTOPDREAMING broke
inward and was knocked back after bumping into ST JOE VIPER, advanced mildly four wide under pressure midway on the turn, but could not sustain the
rally and dropped back. CONGRATS THAT prompted the pace from the start, bid between ST JOE VIPER and SHANGHAI MOON around the turn, and
gave way soon after completing six furlongs.

MUSIC OF LIFE steadied entering the first turn then secured inside position and tracked the pace under slight restraint down the backstretch, came out a
path and picked up the pace near the quarter pole, launched a bid and tipped out wider making contact with BEAN COUNTER top of the lane, roused
forward under pressure, dueled for the late lead with AUGUSTA MOON, dug in determinedly and edged away. AUGUSTA MOON applied pace pressure to
JEN TAKE CHARGE down the backstretch, advanced to gain a slim lead near the quarter pole, continued with the advantage under pressure near the
furlong grounds, fought back when challenged by MUSIC OF LIFE deep stretch but could not hold off the winner nearing the wire. SASSY JUSTICE rated
under slight restraint racing in close range through middle stages, moved around the far turn two to three wide then shifted out wider and put to a drive top
stretch, showed response racing widest and got up late to take a share. JEN TAKE CHARGE took the lead after the start and crossed over to the inside
entering the first turn, set the pace with AUGUSTA MOON applying pressure along the outside, got collared for the lead on the far turn then was all out and
got edged late for show. BEAN COUNTER was a step slow at the start, advanced into close range and tracked the pace down the backstretch, loomed
three wide near three eighths pole, hustled along but could not reach the frontend, got brushed by MUSIC OF LIFE top of the lane and gave way.
CHAMPAGNE HORIZON got loose and ran around in the post parade, raced in the back, saved ground then shifted out and had no response

LIL MISS HOT MESS vied for command inside REGGAE REVOLUTION going comfortably through the first half-mile, began to edge away when set down in
upper stretch and widened under a drive. ADDISON had aim off the battling leaders three wide, was roused in earnest outside the quarter-pole, and ran on
with good courage to get up for second outside nearing the wire. REGGAE REVOLUTION maintained a short lead outside LIL MISS HOT MESS to the top
of the stretch, could not match strides after straightening away, and yielded second late. AMELIA MADELYN had an inside trip, and could not gain under
pressure by late on the turn. SHELLPHONE was between horses up the backstretch, and moved inside dropping back through the turn.

Footnotes
ARITHMETIC rated along the inside to the far turn then angled out a path and picked up the pace, roused forward to challenge MYSTERY BANK for the
lead in stretch run, dug in two wide and prevailed in final strides. MYSTERY BANK led the way entering the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch and
kept clear around the far turn, challenged by ARITHMETIC in stretch run, battled back gamely but could not match in final strides. DR. DOYLE tracked the
pace along the inside, prompted two wide near the quarter pole, roused five wide into the lane and stayed on to edge out foe for show. FORK UNION rated
three wide through middle stages then launched a bid near three eighths pole, hustled along two wide past the furlong marker then finished evenly and got
edged for a share. BUDGET BUSTER settled off the pace and saved ground, remained near inside on the far turn then shifted out four to five wide at head
of the lane and produced a mild bid. KUDURO stalked the pacesetter through early stages then coaxed along the rail in the final turn, failed to gain closer
contention and steadily weakened. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT raced three wide off the pace, put to a drive around the turn, drifted out wide under pressure in
the lane and lacked a needed rally. SEE THE PYRAMIDS settled four wide off the early pace, stayed in same path and prompted around the turn, gained
ground near the furlong marker then failed to sustain bid and gave way in the lane. WINTER AT BASTOGNE hopped in the air and lost a lot of ground on
the field, raced in the back and had no response. SOBEK was off slow and bobbled a step out losing a lot of ground, never recovered from the poor start,
was pulled up on the backstretch and walked off after the race.
