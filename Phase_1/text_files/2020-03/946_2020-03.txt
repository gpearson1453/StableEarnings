Footnotes
BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY had the best speed, pushed away in a quick second quarter, was given a breather to the second turn, met the bid from
HERDSMAN, dueled that one to mid stretch then edged away and held gamely. CLASSIC CHAMP broke slow and was outrun to the half, saved ground on
the second turn and finished steadily for the place. HERDSMAN pressed the pace to the backstretch, was chasing the winner to the second turn, pushed up
to engage that one for the lead, dueled to mid stretch then was outkicked and weakened. CATS OUT TONITE also was chasing the winner, raced off the rail
on the second turn then came up empty in the drive. AERIAL DECOY had no speed, trailed to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and
finished evenly late. SMILING MATT was settled to the half, offered his best bid three wide on the second turn but was outkicked to mid stretch and
weakened. POPPY'S C NOTE chased the pace to the second turn, was two then three wide to the stretch but tired in the drive.

determinedly. RUNAWAY INDY chased the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, loomed boldly in mid stretch then dug in late but settled
for the place. NORTH FORK had no speed, settled to the second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then finished
evenly. FORT JACKSON had no speed, trailed tdo the second tursn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. CODE
GRAY set the pace early then pushed clear on the backstretch, was collared at the quarter pole and tired. APATHETIC was chasing to the half, raced off the
rail while giving way on the second turn and gave out in the drive.

I DECLARE WAR pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide and got on terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch and held under steady
urging. MANY ROSES set the pace from the rail for five furlongs, remained inside to the stretch, was collared nearing mid stretch then saved the place.
GOBSMACK tracked the top two to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. LIBERAL (IRE) trailed to the second
turn, bid two wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. SOUTHERN THUNDER was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second
turn, tried to rally three deep to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
UNUSUALLY GREEN had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to be
along in time. KONA COAST set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner while saving second. FOR
HIM pressed the leader to the second turn, made a bid two wide to the stretch, loomed a threat leaving the furlong grounds but hung. THE REF was settled
to the half, raced two wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch,
stayed on to mid stretch but was giving way late. STONE GROOVE was rank and hard to place into the first turn, settled on the backstretch, tried to rally
three wide to the stretch then was in a bit of traffic in upper stretch and finished evenly. KOA CAT had no speed and saved ground to no avail. ELEVATE
hopped at the start, had no speed and was not a factor. THREE RED SEVENS got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced two then
three wide to the stretch but tired in the drive.
