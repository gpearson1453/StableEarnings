Footnotes
LONEMIRE was reserved off the pace, loomed four wide upper stretch, took over 1/8 and held sway. CHANGE FURR BETTER chased the pace, enjoyed a
rail trip, gained a bit up the inside through the lane but came up second best. Z CORONA sprinted early, bore out turn, was collared near the quarter pole,
dug in to mid-stretch but eventually gave way. LOTA EXCESS raced three-wide on the turn, challenged for lead entering lane, gained a brief lead coming to
the head of the stretch, was engaged by Z CORONA and faded. LOTA JAIL TIME was bumped in the hindquarters by LONEMIRE at the start, raced
erratically for a few strides, dropped well back and trailed.

SHEZACROWDPLEASER speed, outfinished. MY LOUISIANA KISS awkward start, bumped twice. SM RED COUNTRY STORM well placed, no kick.
ELLENS HERO did not contend. SIX PRIZE SHANA broke in the air, bumped twice. RESERECTION lacked quickness. KG A LOTA SMOKE broke in the
air, off very slowly.
