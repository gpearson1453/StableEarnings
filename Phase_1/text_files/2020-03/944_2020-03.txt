Footnotes
SWEET LEAF was prompted to gain a position tracking just off the first flight between foes into the first turn, angled nearer to the rail on the backstretch,
was prompted to advance through tight quarters to challenge along the rail nearing the three sixteenths marker, wrested the advantage under a few right
handed taps and was taken in hand approaching the wire. MALICED, restless in the gate, raced unhurried three deep to the backstretch dropping off the
second flight, was prompted to split foes in that path racing into the far turn, was urged to split foes in that path in upper stretch exchanging contact with
UPPER CHARLIZE DS but continued with interest to edge a rival for second on the wire. CHICA DIFISEL broke inwards bumping FREIGHT TRAIN LANE,
then was held up out of tight quarters just after the start, settled to the backstretch while shifting out, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn,
angled six wide entering the lane and finished with interest while just missing for second. I AM A. LURING was hustled to the lead outside a rival racing into
the first turn, attended that foe's pace for a half, was urged to press the issue between foes into the far turn to upper stretch and gave way entering the lane.
MIGHTY FROSTY, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival just off the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way between
foes in upper stretch. WINDY COUNTY, reserved last to the backstretch, improved position between tiring rivals in a belated effort. UPPER CHARLIZE DS,
urged to gain a forward placing three deep, shifted inwards on the backstretch crowding OLANA momentarily, shifted out to lodge a brief, three wide bid on
the far turn, exchanged contact with MALICED in upper stretch and quickly came up empty. OLANA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight,
shifted inwards avoiding traffic near the half mile marker but lacked a rally. ITSALLRIDINGONME hopped at the start while breaking a step slowly, was
caught four wide racing through the first turn and retreated early. FREIGHT TRAIN LANE, bumped at the start, raced in close quarters along the rail losing
some position into the first turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SACCO AND VANZETTI broke sharply, angled inwards disputing the pace four wide on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, shook clear while
shifting inwards a bit racing into the turn and was kept to firm right handed encouragement to maintain a clear advantage to the end. JUST SHOOT
ALREADY was urged three deep between foes pressing the pace into the turn, couldn't maintain terms with the winner into the turn but proved best of the
others. PRIVILEGIO, caught in close quarters at the start, gained a position four wide between foes tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted
inwards on the bend and improved position between foes while failing to threaten the top pair. MUST BE A MONSTER tracked just off the first flight five
wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn making brief, three wide progress but flattened racing into upper stretch. ROCKY DIPLOMAT
was settled in hand early, then split foes four wide into the stretch gaining some position in an even effort. SHACKLEFORD DANCER angled inwards
pressing the pace between foes through the backstretch, shifted into the path of BOY SCOUT racing past the half mile marker and gave way racing through
the turn. FUNNEL CLOUD broke outwards bumping BOY SCOUT, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but faded on the
bend. ROYAL FAMILY, caught in close quarters at the start, settled off rivals and was fanned five wide in the stretch while proving no threat. MISTER
MISTER, caught six wide in early stages, failed to menace. TOMMY TUESDAY, caught four wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn, retreated
early. GALLEON LIGHT swerved out sharply to race seven wide on the backstretch but soon dropped out. BOY SCOUT, bumped at the start, was urged to
press the pace along the rail, steadied out of tight quarters racing past the half mile marker and quickly emptied out.

FACTS DON'T MATTER, restless in the gate, was urged to lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into
the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn to upper stretch while being headed but regained the advantage in the final stages to resolutely prevail
in an all out drive. AGUAS COLORADAS tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out three deep on the far turn while being
prompted to advance, bid for command between foes in that path in the drive and just missed. MY MASTERPIECE, forwardly placed along the rail in the
opening stages, conceded the lead while switching outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue racing into the far turn to gain a
narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but faltered nearing the wire. UNABRIDGED (IRE) tracked off the second flight in the opening stages, shifted out
four wide after a half, was prompted to advance in that path racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while just outkicked. NO SNIVELING
tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, continued three deep between foes into the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and
made some mild progress in that path late. ALYDARIUS ducked in at the start, was settled into stride but never gained striking distance. CONGRELLA,
reserved near the inside early, failed to menace. PURO BLANCO, held up between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was
shuffled out of tight quarters nearing the far turn and soon dropped out. BETTYB angled inside tracking off the second flight in the opening half but came up
empty racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
MALIBEAUTY broke outwards bumping LILY CHASER, was quickly righted to track just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out while
awaiting an opening leaving the midway point of the turn, came through when presented an opening to split foes racing into upper stretch, was prompted to
wrest the advantage, then was taken in hand midstretch once striking the front and made the balance of the pace under confident handling in a ridden out
effort. ANDREA'S WORRY broke sharply, angled in to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch but proved no
match when confronted by the winner nearing midstretch. WILLYOUBEMINE tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the turn,
advanced three deep nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but flattened out late. RACHEL'S WISH tracked off the second flight between foes racing to
the turn and gained some position late in an even effort. LILY CHASER, bumped at the start, was held up avoiding tight quarters while switching outside
foes in the opening stages and never gained contention. PERFECTCOMBINATION, off a step slowly, then pinched back while steadying off rivals at the
start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders racing into the turn but proved empty in the drive. SANGUINE, urged to dispute the pace while angling
to the rail, dueled for command into the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch and finished in hand through late stages. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE was settled
in hand in the opening stages and proved no factor.

Footnotes
MIGHTY GHOST angled to the rail tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn gathering
momentum, shifted out in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. TAOS was urged forcing the pace
outside a rival racing into the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace to upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but proved
only second best. DRILLOMATIC was settled inside foes racing to the first turn, switched out four wide nearing the second bend, then continued in that path
to late stages to make some mild progress. ABSALOM, forwardly placed along the rail, conceded the lead while switching outside the pacesetter racing to
the backstretch, continued in pursuit of that foe to upper stretch and gave way. LUIS TWO GUNS, reserved near the inside in early stages, angled outside
rivals racing through the far turn and gained some position in an even effort. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY, reserved between foes in early stages, angled to the
inside entering the far turn but lacked rally. IRISH EXPECTATIONS was settled outside foes to the backstretch and proved no threat. DYNAMITE KARMA
tracked the leaders three deep in second flight, made brief progress in that path into the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. TEDDY'S HONOR,
urged to a forward placing between foes, emptied out early.

Footnotes
SUNSATION sped to the fore while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the second turn and held sway to the end under firm
handling. SAFE AND SOUND, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, continued in pursuit of that foe into the lane but
couldn't gain terms while holding well for the place honors. DOUBLY BLESSED shifted inwards in early stages to track off the second flight between foes,
shifted out four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, lugged inwards under pressure carrying a rival inwards midstretch but edged foes for
a share. FIT FOR A KING was steadied along the rail in early stages, continued under reserve to the backstretch, shifted out to improve position between
foes racing to upper stretch, then shifted five wide late gaining position to the end. QUID settled last early and improved position between foes just off the
inside in late stages. EYES OF GLORY tracked off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to advance three wide between foes nearing the lane,
was carried inwards midstretch and quickly came up empty. EMPTY HOLSTER settled outside foes in early stages, angled out five wide racing into the lane
but had no rally. MR. QUALITY tracked the leader inside a rival as part of the second flight and gave way into the far turn. VICARAGE settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge. GRAYCAPADE angled to the rail early but proved no factor.

Footnotes
NATIVE HAWK came through close quarters in the opening stages to track off the first flight three deep between rivals on the backstretch, was prompted to
advance in that path racing through the turn, moved to challenge nearing midstretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm left handed
encouragement. SAUCY DON was urged to the lead while angling to the inside, disputed the issue racing just off the rail into the turn, dispatched a rival
racing into upper stretch, then resisted the winner's bid but couldn't contain that foe late. LEGACY AZTECA settled between foes dropping off the second
flight in the opening stages, was prompted to split foes four wide racing into the turn commencing a steady advance to gain striking distance in upper stretch
but had no final kick. FAST MASTER angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, then shifted to split foes just off the inside gaining
position to the end. FORWARD MOTION tracked just off the first flight inside foes racing into the turn, bid along the rail when presented an opening in upper
stretch but proved empty late. HURRICANE DANCER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, then steadily faded into the stretch. HEY JABBER
JAW angled inwards to prompt a rival's pace racing to the turn and gave way in upper stretch. MR LIGHTNING BOY was settled out of close quarters early
and never gained contention. JACK B WINKLE tracked off the first flight racing five wide in the opening quarter but faded early. TOTAL DISTRACTION
tracked the leaders four wide between foes as part of the second flight, was fanned five wide nearing the lane and soon faded. HALFBACK dropped well off
the field in early stages and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FAST FIRE, reserved in the last flight along the inside in the opening half mile, shifted outside foes leaving the second bend to advance on the leaders four
wide, continued in that path through the third turn and responded to firm handling to just edge DOVER CLIFFS nearing the wire. The latter secured a
forward placing along the inside stalking a rival's pace, took over from that foe nearing the third turn, held sway to upper stretch, grudgingly resisted the
winner to late stages and just missed. HOPE AGAIN (GB) tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, shifted out leaving the third turn to split foes and
edged rivals for a share in late stages. BOURBON EXTENSION, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced three deep
nearing the third turn to challenge between foes nearing the lane but had no final kick. SMALL HOPE settled between foes early, angled inside after a mile,
was steadied out of close quarters midway through the third turn but continued with a solid second effort to regain position inside foes late. ONAROCK
,reserved in early stages, angled nearer the inside after a half, swung out five wide on the third bend and continued in that path to improve position.
PROQUESTOR was settled outside foes in the opening mile, angled six wide racing into the lane to gain some position while making no real impact.
DOMAIN tracked just off the leaders, three, then four wide in the opening mile and faded between foes into the stretch. JIMMY D settled near the inside
early and failed to menace. JORNS broke awkwardly, pulled his way to the lead outside foes, then angled to the rail once gaining a clear advante, set the
pace for six furlongs, briefly disputed the issue inside a rival to the third bend and gave way into the lane.
