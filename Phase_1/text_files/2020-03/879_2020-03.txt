KIANA'S LOVE good speed from the gate, well rationed throughout and held sway to the wire. HETTY G. chased winner from the turn to no avail and
bested the rest. DREAM BOAT ANNA hopped in the air start, with winner to the turn but faltered in the late going. STELLAR STILETTO raced evenly
throughout between horses, came three wide through the stretch with no gain. COMPETITIVE QUEEN never factored while well off rail to the stretch. CAFE
MISCHIEF close to the turn, floated five wide into stretch and faded.

Footnotes
I GOT IT perfect position inside to far turn, scooted thru past the quarter pole and drew off as much the best. AT LEAST set pace to the stretch off rail,
drifting in the late going but saved the place. SWEET ROCK was compromised at the start when breaking awkward, raced the rail throughout and rallied
along for the show spot. ABOGADA void of any early speed, made up ground from far turn and improved though the stretch. HERO OF THE BEST raced
evenly throughout with little improvement in the stretch. BRILLIANT KITTEN good position just off leaders to deep stretch but came up empty. JEWELISA
through early and dropped stopped. UKNOWIAINTLYING showed brief foot early and gave way quickly. MISS FRANK E dueled first turn, chased to the half
then gave way quickly.

TWELVE MONARCHS unhurried early, well off rail first turn, rail gain through the stretch and was all out under stout handling to the wire to prevail. MY
SWEET BABOO dueled early, edged off to far turn, stayed game to just miss at the wire. PEPPER THEM GIRL good position outside throughout and
stayed on for the show spot. ON STRIKE never far back from inside, checked past half mile pole but raced on in good fashion. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE
had an awkward start, raced outside while no real menace. VIVA PER LEI was bumped hard at start, raced inside throughout with no late gain. GOING TO
TEMPLE speed to battle on the front end but gave way after a half. EMELY HEART good position inside for half mile, went wrong and was vanned off in
distress.

TWINKLING KNIGHT allowed to settle outside, made a steady run to the leaders with a wide run out of the turn and rallied willingly to be along in time.
GOLDENPENCE just back to the turn, rushed to lead three wide into the stretch but was outfinished when changing leads in the final sixteenth. AUSTIN
RAY good position to race evenly throughout with no late bid. LUCKY LOOKIN skimmed the rail throughout but leveled off in the drive. GATTO ROSSO
inside run to turn, shuffled back and angled out past the quarter pole with no late bid. KISSEDTHEGIRLS pinched back at start, improved position in the
stretch. RAF tangled in the gate, broke thru, reloaded and showed little. ELI'S COMING quick speed to the turn between horses into stretch faded.
HELLUVA LIFE speed to the front, dueled to the quarter pole, empty. BRONZE MEDAL never a menace. HE'S A BRAT always outrun.

drive. QUALITY TOO SPARE set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and no match for the top two in the stretch run. ATHARY (IRE) pressed the
pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. SPRING FROST raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane
and moved up in the stretch. MILLION TALES was through after a half. SENDA was done early. MORE MO FOR ME had brief speed then folded up.
