Footnotes
DROP THE CHALUPA chased outside then four wide into the turn, came three deep into the stretch, rallied under urging to the front a sixteenth out and
proved best. AMERICAN CODE had speed inside then dueled a bit off the rail, inched away inside on the turn, came off the fence into the stretch, drifted
inward in midstretch, could not hold off the winner but saved the place. CANDY FURY dueled outside the runner-up, stalked off the rail on the turn, was
between horses in the stretch and held third between foes. BELIEVE NOW pulled his way along a bit off the rail and was in a bit close off heels a half mile
out, continued just off the inside, angled to the fence into the stretch, came out past midstretch and was edged for the show three deep on the line. STILL IN
THE GAME saved ground stalking the pace, came a bit off the rail for room in midstretch and lacked the needed late kick. MOON MISCHIEF bobbled at the
start but broke on top, stalked three deep, angled in between horses on the turn and could not offer the necessary response. BEACHCOMBING chased
between horses then off the rail, dropped back on the turn, came a bit wide into the stretch and did not rally. POLAR WIND broke a bit slowly, settled off the

angled in on the second turn, dueled inside leaving that turn and bested the others. ZIYANAIR chased between horses then inside on the second turn, came
out in the stretch and improved position. NIL PHET sent between rivals early, chased inside then outside a rival on the second turn, came out into the
stretch and weakened. BIG HEADED BABY angled in and pressed the pace three deep then between foes midway on the second turn, fell back outside a
rival leaving that turn and weakened. THE EASY WAY pulled his way along four wide into the first turn, stalked between horses, dropped back off the rail
