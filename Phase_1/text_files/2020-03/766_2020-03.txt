Footnotes
ANGELINA'S HEAVEN was unhurried early while never far back, shifted out for the drive, bid seven wide, closed under steady urging, got up past the
sixteenth pole, inched away and was all out at the wire. S U M RACER raced in the back, went ten wide at the top of the stretch, found her best stride late,
was gaining fast and got up for place. PEACH COVE (NZ) vied to the second turn, inched clear, led past the sixteenth pole, yielded grudgingly and lost
position late. ACEITUNA raced close to the pace, bid eight wide, closed well and didn't have enough late. LESEDI led around the first turn, contended to the
second turn, fell back and hung late. SHOE GAME moved up to challenge between horses entering the second turn, was squeezed, checked, dropped back
and gave way.

SATURDAY SHOCKWAVE set a pressured pace, drew clear in the upper stretch, was under pressure late and held under steady urging. SIX CIDER was in
tight quarters early while racing off the rail, angled out on the turn, bid five wide, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. OMACHE KID
pressed the pace, weakened in the drive and held safely for show. PASSED BY PAUL lacked a response in a wide trip. MR VIEW was never far back, went

Footnotes
RIVER HOUSE pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, angled out, bid willingly, dueled late and inched away to prove best. FENDER
BENDER broke slowly and was crowded at the start, pressed the pace, assumed command leaving the turn, dueled to late stretch and yielded grudgingly.
SPITTIN HAVOC raced close to the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, closed once straightened and was gaining fast late. WILD WILD KINGDOM raced
mid pack, closed steadily mid track and didn't have enough late. THISISMYSTORY saved ground, failed to rally and did not threaten. JOHNNY RAY was
void of early speed, altered course in the upper stretch and finished well. DAD'S A GAMBLER veered in and was steadied at the start, put in an even effort
and was outrun. SOLAR HEAT raced in the back, bid along the rail on the turn to get within range and came up empty. GO YOUR OWN WAY set the pace
to the turn, fell back and gave way. PREACHER'S BLUFF was not a factor. WILD ATLANTIC WAY raced outside, showed speed to the turn and stopped.
