Footnotes
TIZ WONDERFULLY sped to the early lead, angled in and set all the pace along the rail, inched away nearing midstretch and drew clear under a tap on the
shoulder with the whip turned down, a moderate hand ride and a hold late. MAJESTIC DIVA had speed between horses then stalked a bit off the rail to the
stretch and was clearly second best. INDYPENDENT DEPUTY a step slow to begin, went three deep into the first turn, stalked outside the runner-up then
off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and bested the others. SEMI SWEET also went three wide into the first turn, settled off the rail, angled in outside
a foe leaving the second turn and weakened. CHALKY (IRE) pulled her way between horses then chased outside a rival, angled in approaching the second
turn, continued inside into the stretch and also weakened. TWITTERATI saved ground chasing the pace, dropped back into the second turn, drifted out into
the stretch and gave way and was eased through the drive, but eventually walked across the line and also walked off.

UNCLE RAY chased off the rail then three deep leaving the turn and four wide into the stretch and gained the place. JAXON'S GOLDIE sped to the early
lead, inched away and set the pace inside, kicked clear on the turn, fought back in midstretch and just held third. BEDROCK bobbled at the start, angled in
and chased outside a rival, split horses leaving the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was edgged for the show. ARCH ABILITY broke a bit slowly,
saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and put in a late bid at a minor award. SHANGHAI CURLY angled in and stalked inside, continued
along the fence in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. NEUTRINO broke slowly and pulled and was climbing while in an awkward stride early, went
outside a rival into the turn, continued inside on the turn and into the stretch and did not rally. TAILBACK prompted the pace outside a rival then stalked a bit
off the rail, was between horses into the stretch and weakened. CONTE CAVOUR settled wide early then angled in outside a rival on the turn and lacked a

Footnotes
PARKOUR had speed between horses then outside a rival, inched away and angled in, set the pace along the inside, opened up on the backstretch and
second turn and in the stretch and held under some urging and steady handling late. MIND OUT hesitated to be off slowly, angled in outside a rival,
continued inside on the second turn, came out into the stretch and edged a rival for the place. K P DREAMIN broke a bit slowly, angled in and saved ground
off the pace, came out into the stretch and again in upper stretch and was edged for second. CLIVETTY chased inside then outside a rival on the second
turn, came three wide into the stretch and was outfinished for a minor share. LUCIA'S DESIGN bobbled at the start, was between horses early, chased
inside, came out into the second turn, continued three deep on that turn and into the stretch and could not offer the needed late response between foes on
the line. ALMOST A FACTOR saved ground chasing the pace, went outside a rival in the stretch and could not summon the necessary late kick between
foes late. GOING TO VEGAS four wide early, angled in and chased outside a rival, angled to the inside into the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
TEACHERS BIG DREAM broke through the gate before the start, stalked the pace outside a rival and weakened in the stretch. SAVVY GAL saved ground
stalking the pace, came out into the stretch and also weakened. STORIE BLUE chased three deep then outside a rival, dropped back on the second turn
and had little left for the drive. MADAME BOURBON broke through the gate before the start, was reloaded then refused to break with the field. The stewards
conducted an inquiry into the start before furling MADAME BOURBON was the cause of her own trouble.

Footnotes
CANYON CREST unhurried a bit off the rail on the first turn and backstretch, went outside a rival leaving the second turn, came out in the stretch and rallied
under urging to get up three deep on the line. JAMMING EDDY stalked off the rail then bid outside a rival on the backstretch, took the lead on the second
turn, inched away leaving that turn, kicked clear, drifted out from the whip in deep stretch and just held second. I CAN DO THIS bobbled some at the break,
stalked off the rail, came out four wide into the stretch, moved up off the rail then steadied when crowded behind the runner-up in deep stretch but continued
gamely between foes late. IF ID TOLD YOU angled in and set the pace inside then dueled along the rail on the backstretch and second turn, stalked inside
leaving that turn and weakened in the stretch. FAST AS CASS chased three deep then outside a rival on the backstretch and off the rail on the second turn
and also weakened. NONNO'S POLARIS in tight in the run to the first turn, saved ground chasing the pace, came out in the stretch and lacked a rally.
DANO'S DREAM angled in approaching the first turn, saved ground chasing the pace, continued inside into the stretch and weakened. Following a
stewards' inquiry JAMMING EDDIE was disqualified and placed third for interference in deep stretch.
