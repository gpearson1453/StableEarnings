evenly from inside with no late gain in the stretch run. ONEJUMP never a factor. GRAND SLAM GETAWAY through after half. WISE SOLDIER dueled early
on, stopped badly after the half.

into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. BOURBON SHOTTE raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and improved position.
NATIVE FLORA set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and gave way in the stretch run. MAJOR SILAS was never a threat. IRON MIKE tracked the
pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded in the stretch. HARLAN'S VADOR (ARG) was checked hard along the first turn, rallied along the far
turn but was empty in the stretch. SWIFTY SAM was never a factor. EDZO was through after a half. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE flipped in the gate in the
