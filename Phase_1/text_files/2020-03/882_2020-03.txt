Footnotes
SPICY PERFECTION had good speed, dueled ANGELS HOLIDAY to the turn, edged away from that one to the stretch then pushed clear to mid stretch
and held driving. MISS VANJIE NATION broke a bit slow then was hustled inside to stalk the winner, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch
then could not make an impact in the drive but gamely saved the place. BEAUTIFUL BABE had no speed, was fanned four wide to the stretch and could not
offer the needed late response. ANGELS HOLIDAY attended the pace inside the winner early then pressed the pace from the rail to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. CARIBOU CHIANTI broke inward, was corrected but had no speed and was not a factor. CHARMING LASS
chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. POWER OF SEVENTEEN was green and throwing her head down
the backstretch then saved ground to no avail.

KITTEN'S ROYAL settled mid pack for a half mile, was asked for speed three wide on the second turn, rallied to collar GIANT MARK leaving mid stretch
and edged clear driving. GIANT MARK broke a bit slow then was under hard urging to get to the front, eased over and set the pace from the rail to the
stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but dug in late to hold the place. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) pressed GIANT MARK for six furlongs while
two wide, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. NATIVE CHIEFTAIN had no speed, was four wide throughout and did not rally. RENO JOHNNY
chased the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch and also lacked a closing response. ON THE WINGS OF had no speed and saved ground
to no avail.

Footnotes
KISS RIDE GOODBYE had no speed, was three wide into the turn, swung out five wide into the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down DOGGY
DREAMS late. DOGGY DREAMS contested the pace inside of POULAPHOUCA, disposed of that one in upper stretch, was clear to mid stretch then could
not stall the winner but held off MIME for second. MIME broke a bit slow then pulled in the opening furlong, was three wide on the turn, swung out for room
into the stretch and finished in a rally. CAROLINA MIA stalked the leaders to the turn, got fanned out four wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch
and finished evenly. GET'EM TIGER got outsprinted early, was two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing bid. POULAPHOUCA attended the pace outside
of DOGGY DREAMS, got outkicked in upper stretch and weakened. BLACK DROP chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch then weakened. LA GATA
ELEGANTE had no speed and was always outrun.
