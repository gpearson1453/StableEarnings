rivals. RIGHT ON BY saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and weakened. CHECKERBOARD , four deep entering the first turn, was
well placed three wide the far turn then failed to sustain her bid. KONAWA KWEEN saved ground the first turn, drifted very wide turning for home and gave

NATIVE RIVER sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, drifted out turning for home and dug in tenaciously through the stretch the hold sway.
CONCRETE FINISHER , four deep entering the first turn, was angled in leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, took aim on the
leader while remaining along the rail through the stretch and flattened out. ABSTRACT PAYNTER , well positioned in the two path around the far turn, failed
to sustain his move. EVIE'S PRINCE lacked speed, raced in the two path through the stretch and passed tired rivals. CROWNED LEADER , three wide the
first turn, was four deep leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. PRESLEY CHIME raced along the inner rail on both turns and was not a factor. OKIE BUCK
chased the pace, raced two wide the far turn and gave way. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.

SHRED THE RULES advanced four deep to challenge for the lead mid way on the turn, dueled to mid stretch and drew away. MY WISE CAT showed
speed in the two path, dueled with the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. KATS SECOND SILVER stalked the pace, was four deep leaving
the turn and offered a slight rally. TIMELY REPLY lacked speed, swung very wide leaving the turn and passed tired horses. CATALE STORM saved ground
on the turn and weakened. STARWARD was not a factor along the rail. EURAMASTER chased the pace racing in the three path and gave way.

Footnotes
FIDDLERS TSUNAMI stalked the pace, was five deep around the turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and was kept to her business in the drive. GIRLS A
BULLET , taken to the five path in upper stretch, angled inside the winner near the sixteenth pole and closed. REACHREACHREACH lacked speed, swung
to the seven path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. BROADWAY COUNTY moved up in the two path inside horses to challenge
for the lead at the head of the stretch and weakened the final furlong. LAKOTA PRINCESS disputed the pace, raced four wide around the turn and
weakened. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT prompted the pace between horses and weakened. UNPROVOKED , a forward factor along the rail, chased the pace
on the turn and weakened. DICEY , no factor, hugged the inner rail around the turn. LESLEY'S SONG disputed the pace inside horses and gave way.
RUNAROUND ROSEY , very wide on the turn, was outrun.
