Footnotes
STRIKE MAGIC worked her way to the inside around the first turn, followed along saving ground in the middle of the pack, moved out to the four-path
roused into the stretch, and rallied steadily without benefit of a lead change to be along late. FLORADO hugged the rail tucked in behind the leaders for six
furlongs, awaited an opening past the quarter-pole and through upper stretch, found room on the rail past the sixteenth-pole and finished gamely. SHE
THROWS HEAT was well back two wide to the stretch, shifted to the far outside through the furlong grounds and was going well at the finish. PHILLY
SPECIAL got bumped by CHOUCHOU DE BOO and pushed out into LAKE PARIMA at the start, advanced four then three wide around the far turn, bid
between rivals through the stretch but was outkicked. CHOUCHOU DE BOO broke out into PHILLY SPECIAL causing crowding, set the pace inside to the
stretch under pressure, and gave way late. LAKE PARIMA delayed the start a couple minutes difficult to load, got bumped by PHILLY SPECIAL at the start
to no ill effect, pressed the pace outside, bid turning for home but was overrun from both flanks late. NOBLE ENTERPRISE steadied between horses at the
start, saved ground well back to the stretch, and gained mildly. FORMULA got shut off and checked back behind horses at the start, and was never close.
GINGERONMYMIND was in the second flight throughout, and could not gain into the far turn three wide. SENSE A MILLION was reserved in striking range
outside the leaders to the far turn, and came up empty when asked.

Footnotes
TIME TO TWO STEP was away last then raced in crowded quarters early on, gained a clear path then tugged wanting to go while racing under a snug hold,
let out a notch and took over the lead in hand on the turn, widened to a clear advantage then prompted for more when SIGNING BONUS cut into the lead
with a furlong left to run, had more left in reserve and kept clear under a mild drive. SIGNING BONUS was placed forwardly and pressed the pace in the
opening quarter then edged back into tracking position, was under a drive three wide at the furlong marker, showed good response and went after the
winner but could not reach foe and settled for second best. I'M A ROCKSTAR settled and saved ground through early stages, roused along the rail on the
far turn, continued a steady inside bid through the lane and gained a share. MUSIC CITY WOLF set a pressured pace down the backstretch, briefly cleared
on top, got collared by the winner nearing the midway point and steadily weakened. GRACIE'S DREAM raced six paths wide sitting off the early pace,
prompted without gaining closer contention around the far turn then stayed widest into the lane and failed to threaten. DISTINCTLY SASSY raced off the
early pace and five wide going by the half mile marker then failed to respond when called upon. AURORA NATION raced in the back three to four wide and
failed to move into contention. POWERFUL WORDS got bumped after the start but was away quickly and raced in aim for the early lead, pressed the pace
to the far turn then came up tired and retreated in the far turn.

Footnotes
ISLAND TAP sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along inside, widened under urging coming off the turn, and was kept to steady pressure to remain in
command. WHAT'S TO BLAME waited inside through the early part of the turn, moved out and around rivals approaching the stretch, and whittled the
winner's margin late without seriously threatening. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR bumped lightly with CLAMOR at the start, chased three wide from the outset,
and was one-paced through the lane. WILD ONE FOREVER bumped lightly with CLAMOR at the start, trailed to the stretch and made no impact. CLAMOR
was bumped lightly between horses at the start, pursued outside the pacesetter for three furlongs, and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
PURECRAZIDUDE moved up the inside at the five eighths pole and vied for the lead with BLIP, continued to match strides past the quarter pole then shook
free leaving the turn, had plenty left in tank when roused for more and finished going away. CONSILIUM was well placed stalking the duel down the
backstretch, hustled up near the inside on the far turn, made slight contact with BLIP near the furlong marker, came under strong right handed pressure and
continued a steady effort for second best. MOUNTAIN TREE raced in range along the outside, hustled along three wide in close contention at the quarter
pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on with response through the lane and prevailed for a share. ISLE OF MAN lost some footing at the start then
rated while never far off the early pace, roused for response near the three eighths pole then came out wide entering top stretch and needed more for late
impact. BAMBINO tracked the pace and steadied between foes in the backstretch, lost position near the half mile marker then launched a four wide rebid
near the quarter pole, raced in contention then flattened in the lane. BLIP sped to the lead then quickly came under attack from PURECRAZIDUDE, vied for
the lead racing outside of rival down the backstretch and into the turn, could not move on with sharp winner turning for home, brushed with CONSILIUM
near the furlong marker then had no kick left in late reserve and gave way.

Footnotes
FRENCH QUARTER pressed the pace from the start, battled between PACHANGA PARTY and STARSHIP APOLLO from midway on the turn to upper
stretch, edged away with a furlong remaining and had just enough to hang on. DESERT GENERAL was well back for a half-mile two wide, shifted out in the
drive, rallied between horses late and just missed outside the winner. STARSHIP APOLLO pressed the pace three wide, got shaken off by FRENCH
QUARTER through the furlong grounds but ran on with good courage. KARMA KING stayed close early, dropped back under heavy pressure around the
turn inside, then ran on late to gain the last major share. CHARGE CARD raced three to four wide for a half, and lacked a bid. PACHANGA PARTY set a
pressured pace to the top of the stretch, and weakened inside. LI'L MEATBALL was strung out four then five wide around the turn, and faded through the
stretch.

Footnotes
QUICK STEP ED raced in contention while forwardly placed in the opening quarter, edged a bit closer then remained patiently handled around the turn,
shifted out wider for the drive then given cue, responded and drew clear late. CELTIC BROTHERHOOD moved up the inside and cleared on top shortly
after the start, continued to set the pace by a clear advantage, held off the challenge of FREEDOM FORCE near the quarter pole, pushed on with a slim
lead over foe at the furlong marker then held firm over rival but got outkicked when the winner drew by late. FREEDOM FORCE was away in good order
and forwardly placed then prompted to go after the leader nearing the quarter pole, continued a bid in striking distance near the furlong grounds then
evened out in the final sixteenth. SHAW raced in range while saving ground through early stages, angled out on the turn, raced six wide under a drive
entering the lane and continued a mild bid. VIPER had no early speed and lagged behind then raced wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. W W CANDY
raced off the pace then saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention. WEST SIDE WARRIOR hustled up from the get-go, chased three
to four wide and lacked the needed response for impact. DISTURBIN BOURBON chased two wide not far back in opening quarter then gave way on the
turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TAPIT was slow into stride and allowed to settle, began to get rolling around the far turn circling five wide past the quarter-pole, responded readily
and swept past the leaders from outside entering the final furlong, and drew off under hand urging. KID BOURBON saved ground for nearly six furlongs,
shifted off the inside briefly awaiting room at the top of the stretch, gained clearance and rallied outside rivals to pick up the place. SOUPER SCAT DADDY
lagged in the second flight near the three-path early, moved a bit wider late on the far turn, tipped to the far outside once straightened away and came with a
good finish to get up for third. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE took closer order after a half-mile, lodged a mild bid three then four wide approaching the top of the
stretch, and faded the last eighth of a mile. BOURBON IN MAY was outrun to the stretch, and improved late in the four-path without becoming a factor.
RESIDENT LIBERAL saved ground at the rear for six furlongs, stayed inside for the drive and lacked a clear path through the late stages.
EVERYONELOVESJAMES hustled to the lead from the start, set an ambitious pace inside to the top of the stretch, and tired from his early efforts. CABLE
CHANNEL raced forwardly inside to the stretch, and came up empty. FLAWLESS BOURBON prompted the pace outside to the stretch, and tired
approaching the eighth-pole. TABIA raced three wide early, and did not make his presence felt. COOL GIZMO broke slowly and was outrun throughout.
KING DADDY edged a bit closer to the front flight four then three wide through the middle stages, but tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNEONME raced along the rail off the early pace then angled out around the turn, raced wide under pressure entering the lane, responded and
roused forward to race in aim for the late lead, dug in gamely, edged away from FRONT LOADED and held firm. FRONT LOADED slightly steadied in
opening stages then sat back three to four wide through early stages, picked up the pace on the turn then roused four wide upper stretch, advanced to race
in aim for the lead at the sixteenth pole, was game in response but lacked the closing surge to get by the winner. GLORY OF FLORIDA bumped with
STORM ADVISORY a couple times just after the start then raced along the outside in range, headed in pursuit around the turn, advanced to duel three deep
at the furlong marker then failed to move on when the top two finishers kicked by with a sixteenth left to run. STONE HANDS tracked behind the leader in
the opening quarter then launched a bid for command around the turn, advanced to duel between foes with a furlong left to run then had no late kick left in
reserve. FORTUNE COOKIE broke on top then conceded position to the early speed, angled to the inside and hustled along nearing the half mile marker,
continued to rouse with strong handling along the rail on the turn, shifted out three to four wide late and lacked the needed response for serious impact.
STORM ADVISORY bumped with GLORY OF FLORIDA a couple of times just after the start but was away sharply and quickly cleared on top, held the
clear advantage around the turn, fought back when headed near the eighth pole then was all out and faded in late stages. HARD BELLE raced two wide not
too far back in opening quarter then failed to respond and dropped back, moved into stretch four wide under a drive and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
HEAR MY PRAYER grabbed the early lead inside, shook off FOOLISH HUMOR going comfortably turning for home, and was put to pressure through the
last furlong to remain in command. COMPENSATE saved ground behind the leaders for three furlongs, moved out three wide at the top of the stretch, and
rallied to go clear of the others while not a serious threat to the top one. FOOLISH HUMOR bumped with JUST SMOK'N at the start, pressed HEAR MY
PRAYER from outside, could not match strides by the top of the stretch, and salvaged the show while weakening. MRS. MAISEL was outsprinted toward the
inside early, had the two-path coming off the turn and improved past tired horses. FREE THE BEAST angled out from the two-path at the top of the lane,
and gained mildly. SILVER TUNES had plenty of elbow room with no one near her around the turn, but failed to respond when called on. JUST SMOK'N
bumped with FOOLISH HUMOR at the start, chased outside the leaders three wide for three furlongs, and faded. STILL ALIVE was always outrun.
RANDIABBY saved ground to no avail. REGGAE REVOLUTION raced two to three wide around the turn, and never got involved. TAKE CHARGE EH
trailed all the way showing nothing.

Footnotes
CAJUN CASANOVA brushed with ANOTHER MIRACLE at the start, settled off the leaders two then three wide around the turn, kicked in through
midstretch and rallied determinedly to overhaul R MAN JOE from outside in the closing strides. R MAN JOE was bumped between horses at the start, vied
early outside AYE AYE SIR, cleared off and moved inside around the turn, maintained a healthy lead past the eighth-pole while beginning to tire, swapped
back to his left lead while drifting out in deep stretch and could not hold on. GUILDSMAN (FR) missed the break, advanced a bit through the turn shifting out
four wide, and finished well too late. IKEISGREAT bumped with R MAN JOE at the start, chased after the leaders three wide to the stretch, and could not
gain under pressure. ROCKCREST bumped with ANOTHER MIRACLE at the start, dropped back somewhat cautiously handled inside early on the turn,
stayed on the rail for the drive and had no rally. AYE AYE SIR vied early inside R MAN JOE, got outpaced into the turn, stayed on the chase moving to the
two-path leaving the quarter-pole, and faded through the late stages. ANOTHER MIRACLE hit the left side of the gate and was jostled around between
ROCKCREST and CAJUN CASANOVA at the start, and never reached contention. AIN'T WASTING TIME broke in at the start bumping R MAN JOE into
IKEISGREAT, went into the turn three wide and could not gain.

down the backstretch, picked up the pace racing two wide on the far turn, lacked racing room at head of the lane, shifted out six paths wide, got clear, dug in
gamely between foes and got up in time. GREAT KAHUNA tracked the pace along the inside, was patiently handled near the inside around the far turn then
shifted out entering top of the lane, roused forward to race five deep near mid-stretch then took a slim lead, stayed on with game response but got caught in
final stride. TOUPHA settled along the inside to the far turn, picked up the pace racing two wide near the quarter pole, fanned out wide entering top stretch,
hustled along seven wide with a furlong left to run and inched up closer to the end. PHILO raced two wide off the pace then saved ground around the far
turn, tipped out top of the lane, lacked racing room, angled in, split gamely, advanced to race in aim for the late lead then yielded. CASH CALL KITTEN

the far outside, was not far off the lead but lacked the needed kick for serious impact. BONDURANT tracked the pace to the far turn, moved up three wide to
challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, battled back past the furlong marker then tired late. TIZZARUNNER applied pace pressure to CHUCKLES
CANDY down the backstretch, moved up and vied for the lead between foes at the quarter pole, fought back top stretch then tired in the final sixteenth.
CHUCKLES CANDY led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead racing inside at duo near the quarter
pole then faded in the lane. SHIDOSHI raced off the pace, saved ground into stretch run and failed to rally. DIFFERENTIAL raced in range along the outside
