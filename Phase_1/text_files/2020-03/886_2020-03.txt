Footnotes
BRAVE HELIOS chased the pacesetter then went up inside to duel for command, gained the lead and traveled in the two path entering the stretch, cleared
the runner-up and drifted out in the lane inching away to the wire. NAHOY bumped at the start, shook it off to speed clear of the field and set the pace,
dueled with BRAVE HELIOS into and around the turn, drifted out into the lane, could not match the winner and held the place. SON OF A QUEEN stumbled,
broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, raced outside a rival and five wide on the backstretch, angled in some and traveled three wide into the stretch,
then finished willingly to whittle the gap on the top pair. DARING WAYS broke out and bumped rival, angled to the inside, saved ground around the turn,
came out a bit in the lane and never threatened. BLITZING MARIO bumped at the start, stalked the top pair from off the rail, angled in and saved ground
around the turn, then weakened in the final furlong. Due to a timer malfunction, the first race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.

Footnotes
AIMING STRAIGHT angled to the inside and settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, angled out upper stretch, closed fast and inhaled rival under a
drive and hand urging to the line for the win. CLEAN LIVING set the pace with pressure from the outside, dueled along the fence around the turn and
cleared that rival leaving the bend, led clear to the sixteenth pole but could not offer resistance to the winner in the closing moments. SLIGHTLY lacked
early speed, raced off the rail, two wide around the bend, drifted to the inside in the stretch and edged RON'S ANSWER for the show. RON'S ANSWER
pressed the pace from the outside, chased three wide entering the drive, drifted inward in the stretch and weakened. ROYAL ASTRONOMER broke well
from the outside, was asked early and chased the top pair to the turn, lost ground while four wide through the bend and never produced a bid.
