Footnotes
BLESSED AGAIN pressed the leader in hand and off the inside, continued in the two path the middle half mile, went after the leader turning for home, took
over, enough left to narrowly last. RAZEENA within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground, angled out three wide turning for home,
challenged outside the winner late, missed. SARA SEA broke alertly, set the pace along the inside under stout restraint, narrowly showed the way into the
start, gave ground grudgingly until late, saved the show. GOODBYE EARL last to leave, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat.
PROFOUND LEGACY four wide in the first turn, continued back, four wide again turning into the stretch, came up empty to finish up evenly. LADY C within
striking distance early while racing three wide, tired.

Footnotes
TIZANILLUSION stalked the pace while three wide, bid into lane, drove clear, won geared down late. M AND M GIRL broke in good order, set the pace
inside, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the place. OUR GIRL ABBY settled off the pace and the inside, two to three wide turning
for home, steadily getting to the runner up late. CAN'T TOUCH ME lacked speed, came four wide late in the turn, displayed some mild interest. MS FIFTY
FIRST ST. off the pace, dropped to the inside late turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a late response. SHE'S A QUEEN chased the runner up early,
pressed that rival from the outside through the turn, faded in the drive. DESPINA remained back while saving ground. ETTALUSIVE last to leave, remained
always back.

Footnotes
BABADOOOK never far back outside, four wide through the turn when prompting the issue up front, showed the way into the lane, shook clear a furlong out,
held sway late. KURTS RAIDER lacked early foot, rallied four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the winner. BRAVURA CREEK
away well, vied up front closest to the inside, continued to contest the issue into the lane then could not keep up with the winner nor contain the runner up,
comfortably managed to hold the show spot. BIG MACINTOSH vied up front between horses and weakened. PRINCE LEO one paced, two out to three
wide turn, finished up evenly. SUMMERTIMER off a step slow, swung five wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. ELM
STORE off slow, raced well back, saved ground into the lane to improve position, also was never dangerous. RICH ICON broke in, was soundly bumped
soon after, moved up, angled out and bumped with A P DANCER once again late backstretch, vied three wide turn, faded in the drive. OFFICER DONELL
in mid pack early, four wide through the turn, had little left for the drive. RISKY SITUATION was finished early.. A P DANCER came in, bumped soundly with
RICH ICON soon after the start, raced forward, was bumped by that same rival with a half mile remaining, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
FULL OF GRACE off a step slow, moved up to vie along the rail midway on the turn, long stretch duel, narrowly gained the nod in a game effort. FIRST
ALTERNATE in the second flight early off the inside, advanced and challenged with a three wide move midway on the turn, dueled with the winner through
the stretch, narrowly missed. WAR BALLAD in the second flight just off the inside into the turn, proved no match for the two two in the drive while remaining
well out in the strip. SANDY SANGRIA off a step slow, raced back, three wide into the stretch, also was going evenly at the end in lacking a late punch.
FIELD DAISEY fell back steadily off the pace the opening quarter, raced three out to four wide through the turn, failed to rally as well when called on for the
drive. MIA PROMESSA fell back after the start, saved ground when trailing through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. COWGIRL KIMMIE broke alertly, pace in had in the two path, weakened when headed entering the stretch. HAWT MESS forwardly placed, got out
in the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
DINNER AT CRUMPIES void of early foot, saved some ground through the turn, made little impact in the drive. EXPLOSIVE SHOES broke in good order,
got clear early, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner and another rival in the turn, gave way in the drive. SHAMEFUL PREACHER finished early,
trailed home far back. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY failed to menace while racing three wide. GRAHAMSTAN off a step slow, remained always back. HUMMEL
ONE went evenly while racing toward the inside. MY LITTLE TIP three wide trip, went evenly. LEO DEL REO close from the start off the inside, challenged
between rivals turn, kicked clear into the lane, drew off, ridden out. ROCK CITY ROCKET behind the leaders off the inside, angled out to be four wide
turning for home, no match for the winner, determined 2nd, no match. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR pressed the issue early, moved to challenge three wide and
outside the winner in the turn, also proved no match for that one, caught for the place. SEQUENCE in mid pack early, steered three wide late in the turn,
improved position slightly while not a posing a serious threat.

Footnotes
DRENA'S STAR closest to the leader off the inside, continued to apply pressure through the turn, challenged between rivals turning for home, extended
stretch battle, proved narrowly best while between foes at the wire. PAT DADDY behind the first flight inside, saved ground through the turn, split foes to
challenge when straightened for home, outkicked in the late going while closest to the inside of the first flight. VIOLENT RIDGE stalked the pace while three
wide, challenged on the outside turning into the lane, vied to the wire, was also outfinished by the winner, missed the place. KING OF THE COURT one
paced while off the inside, asked along when tilting out a bit late in the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing kick. DRC ALL INCLUSIVE lacked
early foot, steered out behind horses turning for home, also lacked a closing response. ENDER off a step slow, trailed well back for much of the way,
passed a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. NO FUNNY BIZ failed to menace while racing outside. SLADENS DREAM broke alertly,
soon got clear, gave way when headed turning for home.

Footnotes
TENTWELVEFOURTEEN never far back off the inside, raced three wide into the turn, fell back a bit off the first flight, came four wide into the stretch, set
down,finished with good resolve on the outside to be up in time. ACADEMY BAY prompted the pace out in the strip, advanced and challenged three wide
midway on the turn, showed the way into the lane, shook well clear, could not contain the winner. BROADWAY ICE void of speed for a half, steered out to
be widest into the stretch, finished willingly down the middle of the strip while too late. FIREHORN off a step slow, lacked speed, also moved out four wide
turning for home, also displayed some belated interest. OCTOBER SKY void of speed, improved position while not posing a serious threat. SACRED KIKI
BIRD broke on top, with the early pace while between horses, briefly vied into the lane, gave way through the lane. GREY MASK in mid pack early inside, in
some traffic when moving slightly closer late in the bend, came up empty when clear for the drive. TWIN FARMS back off the pace in the two path turn,
failed to menace. R H SMOAKEM has little left while racing three wide. MOST MISCHIEF moved up steadily the opening quarter to contest the issue into
the turn, was beginning to tire when in a bit tight late in the bend, continued to fade stretch. NOT TODAY ALFIE tired while racing four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
GEORGIA'S REWARD lacked early foot outside, tipped out to be four wide late in the turn, roused for the drive, finished willingly to kick down the leader.
EURO ME off step slow, moved up inside, steadied repeatedly into the turn, traffic late in the bend, moved out for the drive, bid while tiring to get in through
much of the lane, led late, caught. TIGER BAIT broke on top, set the pace inside, continued to show the way into the lane, briefly clear, proved stubborn til
late. SEKANI was bothered early, pressured the pace three wide and weakened. SUPERSTAR BEA off a step slow, raced back off the leaders but within
striking distance, lacked a closing response. JOY IN THE JOURNEY forwardly placed while racing four wide, came up empty for the drive. ORDAINED
KISS came out early to bother SEKANI, forced the pace in the two path, gave way.

Footnotes
SUBIACO within striking distance off the inside, ranged up to challenge into the far turn, dueled into the stretch, kicked clear the final furlong. LADY
MCKENZIE in the second flight inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. VISUAL MAGIC away in good order,
set the pace, responded and dueled inside the winner turning for home, no match for that one, weakened and was caught late for the place. DROP DEAD
GORGEOUS lacked early foot, three wide into the lane, lacked a serious closing kick. BIG LUCK off a step slow, raced well back, saved ground through the
final turn, improved position with some mild, belated interest. C'EST MARDI lacked speed while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide
again in the final turn, lacked a closing punch. FLASHY BIZ in mid pack while four wide into the first turn, three wide through the second turn, remained
always back. FUNNY FLOWERS pressed the early pace, gave way. ELSIE'S FIRST settled off the pace, backed up in the drive.
