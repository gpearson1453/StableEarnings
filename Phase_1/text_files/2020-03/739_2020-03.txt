Footnotes
CHAPEL BARN well placed, angled out backstretch, drove three wide while all out to the wire for the win. COMMISSARIO just off pace to far turn, hooked in
duel between horses but missed. SOFIA'S SLUGGER good position to the half, rider overreacted and checked and rallied back inside with a late run.
I'MYOURHUCKLEBERRY slammed at the start, far back to the stretch, made up ground. MAGNITSKY raced evenly with no late response when needed. C
C THE BOSS chain reaction bumping at the start, never a threat thereafter. CARIGNAN came over start causing chain reaction bumping, pace 1/2, faded.
THE LAST COOL CAT never a menace dropping far back, walked back. The rider of the third place finisher claimed foul against the winner which was
disallowed by the stewards. The quarter time is omitted due to a sun glare into the first turn.

eighth pole, inched clear and held off rival in the final stages. MCHENRY trailed the field early on, came with the winner into the lane from the three path,
made a bid four wide in the stretch and was gaining in the final stages. RIVER EVANGELIST chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane,
continued the bid in the stretch three wide but hung in the final stages. PRIMED FOR TALENT tracked the pace early, took over command near the quarter
pole and led the field into the lane while under pressure, clung to the lead near the eighth pole while between horses but yielded in the late stages. TIME
