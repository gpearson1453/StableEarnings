Footnotes
TRYST CAT rated on the front end while inside rivals, moved clear when allowed on the turn then steadily opened up under urging in the lane. CAROL'S A
CASE bumped with RUBY LEES SONG shortly after the break, forwardly placed from outside, was just off the rail through the bend then could only edge
ahead for second the last eighth. TAPNFIRE was soon well back, saved ground on the bend and passed between horses midstretch to be best of rest.
RUBY LEES SONG bumped just after the start, vied for the lead from outside on the backstretch, did not stay with TRYST CAT on the bend and flattened
out the last furlong. ICE ATTACK well placed from inside, weakened for the drive. SERENA'S HALO faded from outside on the turn. LIFE IS A RIDE was a
brief contender but began to tire after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
AMERICAN HOLIDAY rated on the front end between horses, moved ahead on the bend then gradually drew clear under a drive in the stretch. PINK FOR
ME raced in he second flight between rivals, was three wide taking the turn and edged ahead for second late. PRAISEM was caught in crowding and
checked shortly after the break, lost ground circling rivals on the bend, threatened with a furlong left but leveled off instead. LADY FURBEIN without early
speed, though hustled along, was widest taking the turn and passed weakening rivals from outside in the stretc. BROWN SHOES displayed early speed
from inside, did not keep up on the bend, came off the rail some and had no late bid. GOOD WISHES disputed the pace from outside, took the turn three
wide, fought for second in the stretch but flattened out the last furlong. I'VE GOT ISSUES also in the second flight early, did not keep up along the rail on the
turn, was blocked upper stretch, angled out with a furlong left and finished evenly. BELLAH DOWN contested the pace between rivals, gained the rail on the
bend then tired for the drive.

Footnotes
MORA VALLEY was sent to soon gain a clear lead, floated out some into the lane, steadily drifted out the last furlong, appeared to brush with THIRSTY
COWGIRL in the waning yards but held on. THIRSTY COWGIRL without early speed, steadily progressed from outside, lost ground five wide through the
bend, rallied under a steady drive in the lane, was crowded inside the seventy yard marker and had to settle for second best. MISS IZZY in contention from
the outset, advanced between rivals on the turn, was two wide into the stretch and could only make up minor ground in the late going. MISS LEARJET
prominent just outside MORA VALLEY, weakened between horses in the lane. TEMPLESIS was well placed from inside but flattened out the last eighth.
DANCING WELL helped prompt the pace from outside, came four wide into the lane and gradually yielded. LION'S WAGER void of speed, angled out
through the bend, was widest into the stretch and lacked a significant response. TOMASITA was a contender for a quarter mile between rivals but began to
tire on the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into the MORA VALLEY'S bearing out deep stretch and an objection lodged by the rider of THIRSTY
COWGIRL claiming interference from the former approaching the finish. After their review, the stewards disqualified MORA VALLEY and placed her second.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN pulled clear soon after the break, stayed off the rail some through the bend, widened command under hand urging upper stretch then
maintained control under a drive in the late going. VALIANT LADY pressed JETS A GINNIN from just outside, closed the gap on the turn, floated out some
into the stretch, was all out but started to drift out under right-handed pressure in the waning yards. DANCE in contention early, had the rail on the bend,
fanned out some for the drive, angled outside VALIANT LADY upper stretch then could only hold her position the final eighth. DEVIL'S ROSE between rivals
on the turn, was caught in crowding briefly upper stretch and had no late bid. COUNTRY ASSETS moved to the outside early on and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SIRCORRI stalked from outside, was three then four wide taking the bend, responded to urging in the lane and drew off the final sixteenth. BECAUSE IT'S
TIME vied for the lead from outside from the beginning, angled in some leaving the turn, battled between rivals in the stretch and lacked the extra needed
the last sixteenth. DRINKINATTHEBAR disputed the pace between horses, gained the rail into the stretch and gradually wore down inside the last furlong.
TRUE TEN chased from inside, angled out three wide leaving the bend and improved position between horses. G G'S SECONDCHANCE raced in
contention between horses, was just off the rail on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and failed to a significant response. PETEIZUM displayed early
speed from inside, began to yield on the turn, angled out some with two furlongs left and continued to wear down between horses. MR. LUV MAKER chased
from outside, angled in nearing the turn and failed to have a serious bid between rivals in the lane. AMAROQ void of speed, was widest through the turn and
also did not have a significant stretch bid. LITTLE IKE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

GIRLOLAMO'GLORY soon emerged with the lead with little asking, was encouraged leaving the bend and maintained control under a drive the last furlong.
ENDGAME pressed from outside, was two wide into the stretch, battled for second and edged ahead for the place late. PRINCE ABUBU hesitated at the
break, was hustled up to contention, took the bend three wide, lacked a serious bid but caught INSAME LIFESTYLE for third. INSANE LIFESTYLE pressed
from inside, fought for second in the stretch but began to yield in the late going. ONE WAY HOME chased from inside, swung out to the middle of the track
for the stretch run and improved position some. STEALIN' SUMMER was a factor just off the inside then boxed in for most of the stretch run.

HIGH HERO showed the way in hand on the backstretch, was urged leaving the bend and held sway under steady urging through the lane. GREENSPAN
prominent from inside, came off the rail some leaving the turn to make his bid at the leader, lacked the extra needed but was clearly second best. LIBOR
PLUS forwardly placed from outside, was three wide taking the turn, lacked a rally in the stretch but lasted for third. GREAT GRET hustled along between
horses to help prompt the pace, did not keep up leaving the turn, fanned outside LIBOR PLUS into the lane and gradually drifted out under right-handed
pressure. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) chased from inside, swung out to path three for the stretch run and lacked a rally from between horses. HONEYDOLIST
was just off the inside on the bend, swung to the middle of the track into the lane and lacked a bid as he gradually angled in. HEY RALPHIE BOY chased
from between horses and also had no stretch rally. LOOKIN' AT MIKE was a brief contender from outside but began to fade before finishing three furlongs.
BEE ATTACK saved ground and showed little.
