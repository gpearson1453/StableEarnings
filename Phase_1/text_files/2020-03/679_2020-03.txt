Footnotes
HYPERSONIC was reluctant to load, moved up outside along the backstretch to contend, inched away for a short lead, was under pressure through the
stretch and held under left handed urging. MY GOLDEN BOY was never far back, raced inside early, bid six wide, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get
by the winner. CLAVICHORD saved ground around the first turn, went ten wide at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and was gaining late. PRICE TO
PAY stalked the pace while racing inside, shifted out at the top of the stretch, bid willingly to threaten, hung late and lost position. FLORIDA TWO STEP
raced in hand early, set the pace, weakened in the drive and faded. EL BORRACHO raced in the back, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and offered a
mild bid only. KEEN JAMES stalked the pace, bid between horses into the second turn to challenge, was steadied slightly and stopped.

INTELICRYPT veered in at the start, dueled to mid stretch and drew off. COZY BAR raced close to the pace outside, went eight wide at the top of the
stretch and closed to get up for place. JOHN ARNOLD bumped and was crowded at the start, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and finished well.
BLAZINGULCH bumped and was crowded at the start, advanced to the turn, bid and hung. KNIGHT SOLAIRE stumbled at the start, pressed the pace
inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to mid stretch and faltered. RUNFORMEFREDDIELEE showed good early speed, was checked on the
turn, fell back and was squeezed near the wire. SHE GOT AWAY broke in the air and bumped at the start and failed to menace in an even effort. WHO'S
HOT was in tight and checked along the rail into the turn, fell back and had no further response. Following a stewards' inquiry, INTELICRYPT was
disqualified and placed fourth for causing interference at the start.

Footnotes
MY WAY OUT saved ground while racing close to the pace, assumed command along the inside on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and extended his
margin under steady urging. THIN LINE was unhurried early, angled out for the drive, offered a mild bid to earn place and was no match for the winner.
HANDSOME JOHN raced outside, pressed the pace to the turn, fell back, had no further response and held for show. BENTLEY'S SHOW was sent to the
front to set the pace to the second turn, tired and faded through the stretch. SMILING BANDIT pressed the pace to the second turn, tired, stopped, was
eased and walked off.

SHOOK set a pressured pace, drew clear in the upper stretch, led to the final strides and was outfinished. LIBERTARIAN pressed the pace, fell back leaving
the turn, continued willingly to the wire and held for show. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE saved ground, bid inside to threaten and didn't have enough late.
THETRAILERGUY was unhurried early, raced outside, went six wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and was gaining late. PLAYOFF BOUND raced
in the back in an even effort and failed to menace. PINE GROVE ROAD held a good position, was not urged through the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
OUR DANDY'S BOY was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied around the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and got up at
the wire. SPIRIT MISSION pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch, had the lead late and was caught. SKYCHIEF
stalked the pace while racing along the rail, angled out on the turn, bid willingly to challenge, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a good effort.
ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE saved ground, got through along the rail on the turn, closed steadily, shied from the whip late and didn't have enough left. KODIAK
KING was void of early speed, trailed the field, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and finished well. WISE MARKET set a pressured pace, responded
when challenged to duel past the eighth pole and was unable to sustain his bid. AWESOME SLATE raced in the back, went eight wide at the top of the
stretch and closed well. KIWITAHI showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. LOGAN'S LEOPARD stalked the pace to the second turn, tired,
stopped, was eased and walked off. BOURBON N LIME raced close to the pace outside, stopped into the second turn, was eased and walked off. Due to a
timer malfunction the seven-eighths fraction was unavailable.
