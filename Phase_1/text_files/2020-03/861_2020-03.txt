Footnotes
SWEET TATUM in the second group off the inside, three path into the lane, also lacked a closing kick. SHAHARAZAD off a step slow, remained always
back. LIPPY also broke a step slowly, finished early, trailed home in a dull effort. FINAL FORM broke alertly, sprinted clear, dueled through the turn closest
to the inside, shook off that foe to be clear again when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire while being kept to task. HAWT MESS closest
to the winner in the run up the backstretch, joined that rival from the outside into the turn, raced on equal terms through the bend, proved no match in the
drive, held sway for the place. RANSOMED back off the pace and the inside, raced in the three path through the turn, roused, angled in approaching
midstretch, getting toward the runner up late while along the inside. MUCHA MEZQUINA in the second flight inside, went evenly through the stretch in
lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
SIX FIRE off a step slow, moved up steadily in the run up the backstretch, continued to advance to challenge four wide exiting the turn, dueled past the
furlong marker and gradually wore that rival down under firm handling. ALENA MARIE dueled early off the inside, vied between rivals through the turn,
proved stubborn in the drive. ROZAFA void of early foot, came in the two path into the lane, switched out with less than a furlong remaining, found best
stride too larte. MESANGE back off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, went evenly in the drive. DEHYDRATION
prompted the early pace while well out in the strip, joined the leaders to vie three wide through the turn, faltered in the drive. UNSWEET TEA never
menaced in remaining back. CLEVER ARCH flashed early speed foot along the inside, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
ADHERETOME away in good order, set a quick opening quarter along the inside, alternated up front through the turn while remaining closest to the inside,
clear again drive, kept to pressure. HOPTOWN HONEY lacked early foot between horses, moved closer while steering out four wide late in the turn, chased
the winner past the furlong marker, could not get to that one late, clearly second best. ENJAY'S BRASS in the main body inside, continued to save ground
turn, steered out when roused into the stretch, lugged in with a furlong remaining, flattened out to finish up evenly. FABULOUS GIRL within striking distance
while racing three wide, lacked a closing punch when called on for the drive. FAIRWAYNGREEN chased the winner early, dueled with that one off the inside
through the turn, was giving way past the furlong marker when bothered, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. SOPHIE'S ANGEL off a step slow,
raced back, never dangerous. DICHOTOMY had little for the drive after racing in the two path through the turn. VIOLATION trailed throughout in showing
little. PER RULING DATED 8/31/2020 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2020-OP-32) ADHERETOME WAS DQ'D
DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HAMAZING VISION rated along the inside just behind the leaders, continued behind traffic in the second turn, waited briefly into the lane, got through along
the rail past the furlong marker, edged clear under pressure. PROMISING SHOES void of early foot, began to move into the far turn, challenged four wide
into the lane, led, outkicked by the winner when confronted by that foe the final furlong. LIEUTENANT POWELL settled off the early pace outside, moved
closer late on the backstretch, challenged four wide midway on the final bend, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. I AM void of speed while
saving ground, continued to save ground second turn, moved out for the drive, improved position slightly in the drive while not a serious threat.
WHENTHEDOVESCRY broke on top, set the pace along the inside, gave way when headed for the drive. JACK BE QUICK pressed the early leader in the
three path, vied between horses second turn, faltered in the drive. BOGEY four wide in the first turn when well off the pace, lacked a rally. IT'S BELLAMY
TIME prompted the pace off the inside, faltered in the drive. DOTHEBESTYOUCAN in mid pack early, stopped after five furlongs, eased in apparent
distress, jogged in, returned bleeding.

Footnotes
LIL RED VETTE with the pace from the start, dueled up the backstretch and into the turn, showed the way into the stretch, slight drift, edged clear late under
firm handling. ADHWAA angled in after the start, second flight in the two path turn, moved out for the drive, finished willingly to be gaining on the winner late.
SKYVALUE broke in, bothered foe start, in the second group inside the runner up, behind traffic into the stretch, got through and lodged a brief rail with with
a furlong to run, closest to the winner late, hung, caught for the place in the final strides. COLLUDE broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside,
weakened in the drive, lost whip just outside the furlong grounds. WHOVILLE prompted the two dueling leaders from the outside, weakened in the drive.
JAVISTHA lacked speed, failed to muster a rally while racing off the inside. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL bothered to be off slow, trailed for almost four
furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. BAILDON never a threat. TAPALONG was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
SPOKANE EAGLE broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace in the two path, shook clear midway on the turn, shook well clear past the furlong marker, held
the runner up safe late under steady handling. TOP BRASS void of speed, began to advance four out to five wide exiting the turn, finished willingly down the
middle part of the strip to be getting to the winner late. SEVIER forwardly placed, raced three wide through the turn, had little left for the top two in the final
furlong, saved the show. COAL TRUTH broke back, lacked speed despite being asked, tilted out three to four wide exiting the turn, showed some belated
interest while between horses. HE'S NO BULL away well, flashed some early foot along the inside, began to fade before a half. BOW AND ARROW back
early off the inside, three to four wide in the turn and inside the runner up, failed to match strides with that rival to be found lacking the final furlong.
KOWBOY KARMA off a step slow, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late after the issue had been decided. SHARP ART in mid pack
while racing three wide, backed up in the drive. REASON TO SOAR in the second flight for a half, retreated through the lane. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER
steadily faded.

FRANKNJYMME settled off the pace and the inside, advanced, four wide turning into the lane, took over, clear, held late. DETERMINANT last away, raced
outside and back, angled out to be five wide into the stretch, rallied out in the strip to be getting to the winner late. PROVERB settled off the pace along the
inside, moved closer while continuing to save ground late in the final bend, staged a mild rally when clear late. STARSHIP ZEUS back off the pace, came
four wide into the stretch, lacked a significant closing response. COMEDIAN void of speed, two path through the final turn, displayed a modest amount of
late interest. AQWAAM pressed the pace for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. INCORRIGIBLE showed the way early, vied in the second turn, faltered
when headed. GOLDEN SCEPTOR prompted the pace three wide, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
MY SIXTH SENSE outrun early, began a steady gain four wide through the second turn, continued with good energy to be up in time in the waning strides.
ROTATION tucked inside in the first turn to save some ground, raced in hand behind the leaders into the second bend, angled out three wide late in that
turn, took over into the lane, clear late, could not contain the winner. CASHANOVA off slowly, raced back, four wide rally too late for the top pair, gained the
nod for the show. ALWAYS lacked early foot, four out to five wide in the second turn, late run midtrack, missed the show. HUNKA BURNING LOVE in traffic
into the first turn, rank, dueled off the inside, continued to contest the issue into the lane, faltered in the final furlong. HOME RUN TRICK broke through the
gate prior to the start, broke in good order, set the pace, dueled second turn, weakened in the final furlong. EMPTY TOMB broke back, raced three wide,
had little left for the drive. EBBEN devoid of early foot while saving ground, asked along into the far turn, failed to respond, faded stretch. DRIFTING WEST
broke through the gate prior to the start, raced within striking distance just off the inside, gave way in the stretch. STREET TO INDY forwardly placed in the
three path, stopped after five furlongs, distanced stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
WILD DEZ broke alertly, raced with the leaders three wide, continued to vie through the turn, larger lead into the lane, held the runner up at bay the final
furlong under steady handling while drifting out. CYBER AFFAIR lacked early pace, moved closer three wide late in the turn, challenged the winner from the
outside nearing the furlong grounds, could not get by. HALE'S ANGEL hesitated at the start, raced well back early as a result, swung four wide into the lane,
finished willingly while too late. DANZIG STAR lacked early foot, three wide when moving closer into the stretch, angled in, flattened out. CIDER HOUSE off
slowly, raced back and inside, moved out for the drive, improved position while not a serious threat. WISH FOR CANDY in mid pack inside, checked when
in tight along the rail late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch after recovering. SCIOTO'S SHOES raced in mid pack while off the inside, failed to
respond when called on for the drive. CYBERBURG with the pace while between rivals for four furlongs, gave way in the drive. LUCINDANSHADY
contested the pace for a half along the inside, gave way. LUCK'S GOOD GIRL within striking distance early, stopped before a half, far back.
