Footnotes
JUDITHS COUGAR bumped at the start by LOST IN ROME, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand just off the inside slipping away down the
backstretch and through the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, held clear under a drive to the eighth pole,
dug in growing leg weary late and held on to prevail. ICY DUDE three wide down the backstretch in pursuit from the tail of the field, tucked inside half a mile
from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, closed in with late energy to miss at the end. LOST IN ROME broke in at the start
bumping JUDITHS COUGAR, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and gained late on to just
miss for the place honors. TIMING broke in at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and
offered up a mild bid. LIGHTNING ROB chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made
no headway. HOSTILE WITNESS three to four wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path placed to coaxing at the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. JOHN WANT REVENGE chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tipping three to four wide through the turn under
coaxing from the half mile pole, went seven to eight wide for home and made no impact. LUCKY E broke in at the start filling the space left vacated by the
breaking inwards LOST IN ROME, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch, fell heavily at the
three-sixteenths, got back to his feet sans rider, then got apprehended by the outrider past the finish line and was subsequently vanned off. There was a

under coaxing near the quarter pole and went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT to the outside, knocked heads
with that rival rebuffing the challenge a sixteenth from home, began to inch away to the finish when overtaken in the last jumps and was forced to settle for
the place honors. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside just off the pace, tipped four wide at the three-eighths placed to
coaxing, advanced and swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling with the aforementioned foe from upper stretch to the sixteenth
marker, brushing with his main rival a furlong out, ultimately got repelled with a sixteenth remaining and was along well clear of the rest for the show honors.

soon after the break and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from a pair to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths yielding the front, spun just off the inside for home and tired. BOARDWALK BOB chased two to three wide until tucked
inside half a mile out, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CHIRICAHUA bumped at the
start by IMPERIO D who broke outwards, pulled early under restraint three wide down the backstretch before settling to prompt the leader tucking to the two
