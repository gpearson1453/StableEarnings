MESMERIZINGPEGASUS took quick control of a clear pace then dug in under steady stretch handling. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE gave chase inside and
raced close to deep stretch before flattening stride. DAKOTA MIST angled in to give chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and
showed little more. CLERESTORY gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path, then showed little further. IRMA GIRL gave chase and saved
ground on the turn. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME raced well back and rounded the turn about the six path. EMPRESS HEART gave only distant chase after
hesitating at the break.

Footnotes
V FOR VIOLENCE rated a short lead inside the opening turn and was met at even terms leaving the turn, came under pressure at the three eighths pole,
contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn but took the nod past the eighth pole and dueled clear inside the sixteenth pole. U. S.
MILLENNIUM stalked the early pace and drew to even terms into the backstretch, dueled from the three eighths pole and contested the edge two deep on
the far turn, but was caught leaving the eighth pole, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened later yards. WATCHMENEIGHNEIGH settled off the pace
inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole then flattened stride leaving the far turn. PROSPECT TOY angled to the seven path into the opening turn then
moved in entering the backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, angled to the four path approaching the head of the lane then showed little more.
DON'T CARE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. OCONEE rounded the
opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded nearing the far turn. RUN
MOMO RUN drifted to the seven path into the first turn and was not a factor. HUNTIN' THE RUT drifted to the six path on the opening turn then stalked into
the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

CINDERELA EL CROME rounded the opening turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the
nod approaching the quarter, contested the far turn two deep and dug in determinedly to pull clear of JAXBRADENRISHI through the final sixteenth, the
latter of whom rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ceded the nod toward the quarter pole, contested the rail on
the far turn and dug in gamely to mid-stretch before giving way; reluctantly. KATMAN QUICK saved ground through the first turn then bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. HOSWAY rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail through the far turn and showed little more. NINETYEIGHTTWO stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn. JEWEL HEIST saved ground off the pace then faded through the
backstretch.

DYNACASTLE raced in the three path the opening turn then picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back through the far turn
and had to settle for second. BAYTOWN BABE rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace, started a bid toward the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn about the three path and showed little further. GORGEOUS ROAD settled close off the rail then bid leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and had little left. GREELEY AND ARIANA settled off the early pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole then
flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. TRUE DETERMINATION raced off the pace in the two and three paths and showed little response through the

MY CHESA CHARM stalked the pace two deep while between horses, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead approaching the
quarter, contested the edge through the far turn, drifted out entering the stretch then dug in under steady handling to hold on well. SWEET TWEET stalked
the pace from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn, was forced outward leaving the turn then dug in
to hold on for second. KENTUCKY DANCER saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled to the outside leaving the far turn and
was closing on the runner-up. OUR GRAYCIOUS GIRL rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod
toward the quarter, raced close at the rail through the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. HANALEI SUNSET trailed and showed no response
through the backstretch, was unsaddled on the clubhouse turn and walked off while appearing to be sore.

Footnotes
I'M A LAWMAN gave early chase toward the outside then took the lead two deep past the quarter pole, dueled clear toward the head of the lane and was
steadily encouraged down the lane. OPPORTUNITY CALLS gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and dug in through the
lane to get up for second later yards. TOO MANY CORONAS came away a bit rank, picked up the chase off the rail, rounded the turn in the three and four
paths then outfinished for second later yards. CRIMSON SPADE set a pressured pace toward the inside, was caught at the rail leaving the quarter pole,
dropped back approaching the head of the lane then flattened out inside the eighth pole. TRANSFIGURED chased the pace inside, raced at the rail through
the turn and showed little further. THE SON WIND raced well back toward mid track, came through the turn in the five path, angled out entering the stretch
and passed some rivals. VAULTED SON gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path and showed little more. STERLING REBEL raced well off the
rail and never factored. REALLY BOPPIN gave chase outside and weakened in the five path of the turn.
