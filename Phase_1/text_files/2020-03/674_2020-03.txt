second turn, drew clear, had the rider lose his whip past the eighth pole, led late and was outfiinished. DEPUTY DORA was never far back, went seven wide
at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and got up for show. TEQUILA MARY raced mid pack, saved ground, lacked a late response and was caught for
third. INDIAN BELLA vied two wide to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. PEACH COVE (NZ) was unhurried early, failed to respond and trailed the field.

DECARCHYS DREAM raced close to the pace, shifted out at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and inched away late to prove best.
SHESAIDSHESPERFECT moved up inside to assume command, responded when challenged to duel and was outfinished in a good effort. TAYLOR GALS
raced in close, went six wide at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late response and held for show. ESTRELLA POLAR saved ground, angled out
into the turn, bid seven wide and closed well. BELLE OF GOLD was void of early speed, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. NOT TO
CODE saved ground, challenged along the rail on the turn, dueled past the eighth pole and gave way. FORT DODGE RD led early, showed speed to the
turn and stopped. TIS MATT broke awkwardly, raced wide early and trailed the field.

BELLA'S BACK was hustled along to set the pace with a clear lead and was ridden out. WRIGHT WINGED chased the pace, lacked a rally and was no
match for the winner. COLLEGE QUEEN lagged early, raced outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to get up for show.
NOT THAT I RECALL raced in the back, rallied on the turn, had little left and hung late. EL BELL CAMP was unhurried early, trailed the field, went widest in
the drive and passed tiring rivals. GEMAGINE raced inside, showed speed to the turn and flattened out. YUMA THURMAN chased the pace and stopped on
the turn.

SAVAGE WARRIOR vied inside to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. DISPUTED raced mid pack, went seven wide
leaving the turn, finished well and gained late. TRAFFIC STOP raced five wide along the backstretch, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and closed
well to get up for show. MAE BELLE PASSE was never far off the pace, bid inside and came up empty. WED O'S CHAMP vied to the second turn, tired and
faded through the stretch. MAKERS WAY raced six wide along the backstretch, lacked a bid and did not threaten. ENOUGH OF THAT was not a factor.
DELUX PREMIER chased the pace, tired on the turn and gave way.

HE COULD raced mid pack, rallied on the turn, was carried out, bid eight wide to duel for the lead and inched away late to prove best. TOTALITY was slow
early, raced outside, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up late for place. SAMURAI JACK raced
three across to the turn, bore out entering the stretch, dueled for the lead and yielded late to lose position. ROCKING CHIEFTAIN vied between horses past
the eighth pole and faltered. BRAVE HELIOS ran up behind horses on the backstretch, was checked, shifted out, stayed close to the pace, was carried out
on the turn and leveled off in the drive. DIMERA vied inside, fell back into the turn, bid and came up empty. TRAFFIC THIEF was outrun in an even effort.
DOING FINE saved ground and failed to respond.

ANCONA vied inside to the second turn, drew off and extended her lead under mild urging. AVIE'S PARADISE vied two wide to the turn, fell back and was
no match for the winner. ITSTHE BLACK DALIA was unhurried early and trailed the field, was roused on the turn and closed well to be along for show.
EXOTIC PARADISE was never far back, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a stretch response. ANNA SIOUX raced in the back and failed to
threaten in an even effort. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE broke out, settled off the pace, had nothing left for the drive and faded through the stretch. SWEET
SOPHIE GRACE raced outside and was through early.

Footnotes
SMOKED PAPRIKA raced close to the pace outside, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended her lead under mild urging. LADY SUNSET
was pushed out and crowded at the start, saved ground, bid inside to challenge, fell back and was no match for the winner. WAY TOO CUTE raced in the
back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to be along for show. HAIL ON HOOFS vied for the lead early, was carried very wide
and dropped back. PATSY CLINE was never far back, went five wide entering the stretch and lacked a response. LUCKY LAST bore out badly and was not
urged late. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS was off slowly and had brief speed only. TAKE CHARGE GWEN was crowded at the start to be off slowly, trailed the field
and was not urged late.
