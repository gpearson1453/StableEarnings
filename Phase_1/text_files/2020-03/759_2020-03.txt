FLY FIRST CLASS pressed the pace, fell back leaving the turn, closed steadily and wore down NIGHT AT THE OPERA to get up near the wire. NIGHT AT
THE OPERA set a pressured pace, inched away entering the stretch and was caught in the final strides. OHTANI pressed the pace while racing inside, bid
willingly to contend, hung late and settled for show. TOP ROCKET bumped mildly at the start, was never far off the pace and lacked a stretch response.
MAXUM bumped mildly at the start, trailed the field, swung wide leaving the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

LUCKY MAC challenged between horses into the turn, dueled to the final strides, inched away and held off the late charge of SWEET POISON. SWEET
POISON pressed the pace outside, rallied four wide on the turn, was carried out a bit entering the stretch, closed steadily, was gaining fast late and just
missed at the wire. FRAN'S EMPIRE pressed the pace while racing inside, challenged leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and yielded in the final
strides. BESS EVER led early, swung out leaving the turn, fell back, continued willingly and didn't have enough late. STAR FEVER was outrun in an even
effort. FEATHER BOA was not a factor. REDHAWK raced inside and had brief speed only.

Footnotes
WARNING BELLE sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead, drifted out late and held safely while kept to task. EBB AND FLOW ducked out at the start
to be off slowly, was unhurried early and raced inside, bid four wide leaving the turn and got up for place while no threat to the winner. HER NAME IS UM
raced mid pack inside, was roused on the turn, bid, hung and was best of the rest. THE MALLARD QUEEN broke awkwardly and was off slowly, was
unhurried early and raced inside, angled out into the turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. PRINCESS NICOLE was outrun in an
even effort. SHY settled off the pace, tired on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
BIG LARRY was never far off the pace, rallied five wide into the turn, bid five wide into the stretch, closed willingly, got up past the sixteenth pole, inched
away for a short lead and held under pressure. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT raced in the back, rallied around the turn, bid six wide and closed to get up for place.
BARONS BOY broke awkwardly, raced close to the pace, challenged for the lead entering the turn, dueled past the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly.
TOP HAT HUSTLE trailed the field, advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and failed to rally under mild urging. MENSCH stalked the pace
while racing inside, bid along the rail into the turn to challenge, dueled past the eighth pole and faltrered. ZOE'S PAPA CEE set a pressured pace to the
second turn, tired and stopped. DAKOTA ACADEMY pressed the pace to the second turn, tired, was steadied, stopped and was not urged through the
stretch.

PULPITS POWER stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew clear in the drive and held under steady urging. BOB'S
ALL IN was unhurried early and saved ground, awaited room on the turn, bid five wide, closed willingly and gained late to get up for place. TYLER'S TEK
held a good position, bid five wide, closed steadily and was gaining late. THE COMMON MAN set the pace to the second turn, fell back and faded from
contention. REDROCK TRAIL was checked on the first turn and again into the backstretch, saved ground and failed to rally. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT
raced in the back, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. PACIFIC NIGHTS was never far back, raced outside, swung wide leaving the turn and
lacked a bid. The half mile fractional split of 48.49 was removed by Equibase.

Footnotes
LOVELY STORM raced in close along the rail, was checked hard entering the turn, fell back, got through along the inside to challenge, dueled past the
eighth pole, inched clear and was all out at the wire. TOCCALOT raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid nine wide, finished well and was gaining late.
FELLINA raced close to the pace, closed inside and didn't have enough late. STRATAGEM raced in close, went seven wide leaving the turn and lacked the
needed late response. SPIRITA bobbled and bumped at the start, dueled to mid stretch and was unable to sustain her bid. BLUEGRASS BETTY bumped at
the start, vied off the rail, angled out entering the turn, fell back and lost momentum. I AINT NO SAINT bumped at the start, dueled to the eighth pole and
faltered. PERFECTUS bumped and was crowded at the start and outrun. SPIRITA raced as AIM HAPPY.
