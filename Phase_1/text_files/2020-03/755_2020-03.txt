Footnotes
SURF KITTEN assumed command into the turn, drew clear and extended her lead while ridden out. AMERS was void of early speed, swung wide leaving
the turn and closed to get up at the wire for place. TORENO raced close to the pace, hung in the lane and held safely for show. RAGING LADY saved
ground, lacked a rally and failed to menace. BEAUTY BLACK got away well, led early, fell back on the turn and faded through the stretch. BULLICIOUS was
in tight while racing between horses early, fell back and had no further response.

unable to sustain his bid and held safely for show. STORMY SAILOR raced in close, bid inside on the turn, lacked room in the upper stretch and fell back.
NEVADAN pressed the pace, challenged for the lead into the turn, fell back, angled out and faded. BETATHANABOYFRIEND was unhurried early, saved
ground, lacked a bid and was outrun. The quarter mile fractional split of 21.81 was removed by Equibase and the half mile fractional split was hand timed.

CONSTANT CRAVING advanced to turn, rallied three across, drew clear near the eighth pole and held off the late charge of ONTTELLMYHUSBAND.
DONTTELLMYHUSBAND was unhurried early, raced in the back, rallied around the turn, shifted out for the drive, found his best stride late, was gaining fast
and just missed at the wire. TOMORROW'S MINE pressed the pace bid inside on the turn to contend, faltered near the eighth pole and held for show. PASZ
THE PEPPER dueled two across to the second turn, inched clear briefly and faltered mid stretch. SEA MYRTLE was never far back, went six wide leaving
the turn and lacked a bid. TRAPPIZA was through after a half and not urged late. GOLDIE'S DARLINS tired into the second turn, stopped, was eased and
walked off.

ground. DREAMY EYES pressed the pace while racing between horses, was taken back on the turn, angled out, bid nine wide and earned show. VICTORY
ICE raced in the back, bid inside on the turn, closed steadily and didn't have enough late. TRINNI raced in the middle of the pack, bid inside and hung late.
BABY ROSE pressed the pace while racing outside, weakened in the drive and faded. DERBY ROYALTY went widest in the drive and passed tiring rivals.

Footnotes
MUSIC GIANT was unhurried early, raced inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, bid nine wide and got up late. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY stalked the
pace while racing inside, got through along the rail on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. FATS DOMINUS set a pressured
pace, responded to duel to deep stretch and was outfinished. KALEIDOSCOPE KID broke slowly, trailed the field, got through along the rail on the turn and
finished well. PLUM LUCKY raced close to the pace outside, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the needed late rally. FOREVER THE CHIEF
failed to menace in an even effort. CAUSEWAY RUNNER pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, weakened and faded through the stretch. GIMME
SOME SLACK pressed the pace while racing between horses to the stretch, weakened and faded. SILENT PARADISE lacked a bid.
