PIOCHE GOLD went evenly angling out on the far turn hustling four wide from the quarter pole moving evenly down the lane. EMPEROR'S GOLD sent hard
while in close early, pursued under use through the far turn wilting in upper stretch. ISLAND VICE had brief speed fading from the half. STAR HAWK was

Footnotes
WICKED BETTY checked leaving the gate, regrouped to advance on the far turn taking aim while angling to mid track in upper stretch getting up on the
wire. SISTER DIABLO advanced on the backside bidding to a clear lead on the far turn, digging in down the lane would shy out from the whip in mid stretch
being out gamed in the last strides. BLESS THE RAINS slow early advanced to threaten on the far turn then traveled evenly through the lane holding
position. TURKICANUS FREAK stalked the pace edging closer threatening through the far turn, wavered in upper stretch fading from contention. GOLD
LADYBUG gained on the backside chasing through the far turn, weakened in upper stretch fading there. EVEN IF slow early played no factor. BETTER
VIBES hustled out set the pace through the backside then gave way on the far turn. GUN THING was never involved. MAGICAL TIME gained on the
backside chasing through the far turn then wilted in upper stretch. WHEEL SNIPE CELLY was always outrun.
