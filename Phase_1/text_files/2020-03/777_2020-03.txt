Footnotes
GOODNIGHT GRACIE was well placed down the backstretch, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked in the three path into the stretch, made a bid
between horses in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. TODAYISNOTTHEDAY was
forwardly placed on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch, battled with the
winner into the final sixteenth then was outfinished while just able to get the place. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY bobbled at the start then bumped with a rival,
settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch then moved off the rail while put to a drive and
finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. ONE FAST SONG was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the
three path on the turn, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
weakened. CALAJA settled on the outside, dropped from four to three wide early on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, lugged in some while
resisting the rider trying to guide her out under extra right-rein pressure in the drive and failed to rally. INTERATIFWITHLEU was sent hard from the start,
set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch
and gave way. SMART PEGASUS was fractious in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start, moved in towards the rear early, went around the turn in the
two path, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BIND ME UP broke a bit awkwardly and was last to commence, raced at the rear, rounded
the turn in the four path, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
WAR COUNT broke out at the start, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, dropped from the two path
to the rail on the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under solid hand urging. MR. FOUR SEVENS
went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, made a bid inside the five-sixteenths,
lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and proved no match but willingly held the place. STUCK IN VEGAS broke in at the start, was taken in hand
nearing the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled in third down the backstretch, moved closer near the seven-sixteenths, drafted inside on the far
turn, bumped with BIG BOY DAVE REX inside the five-sixteenths while steadying off the heels of the leader, came under a drive in upper stretch and just
missed the place while able to get the show. BIG BOY DAVE REX bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace,
raced three wide on the far turn, bumped with foes on both sides inside the five-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick.
MISTER INTUITION bumped with a foe at the start, was taken in hand early, went five wide early on the turn then dropped to three wide later on that bend,
was reserved off the pace, moved closer while inside on the far turn, steadied off heels inside the five-sixteenths, was put to a drive in upper stretch and
failed to rally. RICHIE GARY saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and
also failed to rally. MUCHO MARVIN bumped with foes on both sides at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along
while four wide on the far turn, bumped with BIG BOY DAVE REX inside the five-sixteenths then came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. (Rail at

Footnotes
HEY GRACE tracked in behind the leaders racing off the inside up the backstretch, moved out a path outside the leaders entering the turn going four to five
wide on that bend, struck the lead about the three-sixteenths and drew clear under urging. WAR BANDIT steadied at the start to avoid the inside rival who
had been bumped, settled into stride shifting in toward the rail heading up the backstretch, saved ground going near then just off the rail through the turn
coming out three wide to the top of the stretch, kept on under urging to gain the place from between rivals. DREAMING OF CURLIN was
forwardly-positioned outside runners early, went three to four wide on the turn, bid between runners coming to the quarter pole but lacked the needed late
kick and saved show honors from ROSE CROWN, who raced well off the inside up the backstretch, was asked for more past the half-mile marker, went in
the four path through the turn coming out a bit wider turning for home, ran on but needed more. DIGNITYTO INFINITY bumped with the outside rival at the
start, raced close up in behind the leaders from off the fence, waited just briefly lacking room behind those near the five-sixteenths going two to three wide
on the turn, had clear sailing thereafter but failed to rally. CHARSEY was urged at the break, set a pressured pace between rivals, weakened through the
stretch. MARGIE'S ROUXBEE raced widest at the rear up the backstretch going in the six path into the turn before moving inside ROSE CROWN on that
bend, failed to threaten. ORANGE TWISTER exchanged a bump at the break forcing her out, chased in behind three to four wide on the turn and was empty
in the lane. JERRY'S LEGACY pressed the early pace from inside, dropped back and faded, was eased through the lane and walked off.

straightened for the drive, made a bid between horses into the final furlong, gained the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under a strong hand ride.
SAVVY ALLY broke out at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, came under a
drive in upper stretch, took the lead near the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the
place. PRINCESS TRINA pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, took a narrow advantage coming to the quarter-pole,
was asked for her best in upper stretch, lost the lead near the furlong marker and weakened while able to hold the show. STELLAR AGENT came in early,
was reserved at the rear of the field under restraint, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, moved out while put to a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. I LOVE TO RACE was hard held while keen under restraint, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three then
four wide on the turn, was asked while five wide into the stretch and came up empty. HELLO BUBBLES settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then dropped further back and failed to respond. GREY SEAL was carried
in early then steadied, angled out at the rear of the field, went five wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and also failed to respond. TEN COUNT

DESERT THIEF pressed the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn taking a narrow lead at the quarter pole and was put to a drive at that juncture,
edged away. MONARCHOS PRAYER set the early pace on a narrow margin, vied inside the winner but just off the fence through the turn, proved no match
for that one but clearly second best. DORA MAAR broke a half step slow and was bumped by the outside rival then the inside foe, went four deep through
the turn, fought outside IN FULL SWING and beat that one for show honors. IN FULL SWING bobbled into the outside rival at the start but recovered well to
track from inside, entered the turn along the rail moving out to the two path then three path late on that bend, failed to rally in the stretch. LU SEA bumped
with the inside rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path on the turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and vanned off.

STRUT THE RING went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the
stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead inside furlong marker, moved clear under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed
under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. EXECUTIVE BONUS moved in entering the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated just off the
pace, came under urging on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and got up for the place while no match for
the winner. FOLDOVER broke in at the start then was hustled, went around the first turn in the two path, set the pace with company to his outside, was
asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, came back to regain the advantage nearing the furlong marker, was collared by the
winner just inside that marker and proved no match then lost the place late while clear for the show. MR. PAPILLON went around the first turn in the two
path, settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a drive around the
three-sixteenths, angled out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. SENOR BLANCO dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first
turn, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then put to the whip while moving closer in upper stretch but flattened
out. RESILIENT RICK raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, went two to three wide on the far turn, moved out some in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. FREEDOM FACTOR came out into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was rated just off the pace, moved up between
horses to make a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path while asked on the far turn, gained a short lead at the quarter-pole, battled under a drive
in upper stretch, lost the lead back to the pacesetter approaching the furlong marker and tired. WILDCARD PRADO went around the first turn in the two
path, settled towards the rear, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the
three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. SON OF A SAINT went four wide on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field on the outside, was urged along
while three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. CADET CAPTAIN went around the first turn in the four path, prompted the pace on the outside,
dropped back under urging in the four path on the far turn and retreated. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF rounded the first turn in the five path, tracked the pace on
the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, was urged along in the three path on the far turn and faltered. GUSTNADO was taken up while in tight
after the start, went three to four wide on the turns and showed little. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
TWO MIKES N DOC G was forwardly-placed after mild coaxing following the start racing outside LITTLE TOE who dictated terms into the first turn but off
the rail, went three wide through that bend, applied a little further pressure up the backstretch, was encouraged along late on the far turn having lost ground
on that rival and gone three wide again, edged closer taking a narrow lead just past the three-sixteenths, was clear past the furlong marker under steady
urging and edged away to a safe advantage. WOMAN WITH A BOOK exchanged a light brush soon after the start, tracked the leaders from inside just off
the rail and just off those foes, was ridden a bit past the half-mile marker, switched out early on the turn to be three wide by the three-eighths pole, ran on to
gain the place late. LITTLE TOE set the pace racing off the rail in about the two path but briefly a bit wider through the first turn, faced mild pressure up the
backstretch, edged clear still just off the fence leaving the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened thereafter. DONWELL exchanged a bump
at the break, raced off the inside in the three path mid-pack on the first turn, edged a little closer up the backstretch having switched out widest of all, went
five then six deep through the far turn and failed to rally in the drive. REIGNING WARRIOR raced outside rivals four wide moving in a path and a half
midway through the first turn while at the rear, continued outside foes into the far turn going four wide on that bend, lacked room in behind a drifting rival
inside the furlong grounds and altered out at that juncture then ran on. MY LITTLE ROCKSTAR stalked the leaders from outside four wide on the first turn,
was in close range up the backstretch from outside those, dropped back on the far turn in the four then five path, drifted out under a left-handed whip in
mid-stretch then corrected and continued to fade. NASTIDA MAST was taken up slightly at the break then again entering the turn off the heels of a rival,
raced inside foes on or just off the rail through the turns and was never a threat. MONO exchanged a bump at the start then was urged along but was taken
up briefly entering the first turn while throwing his head, went in the two to three path on that turn, was ridden a bit more three wide on the far turn coming
wider into the stretch and was not a threat.

vied inside of a foe while inside on the turn, shook clear under her own power into upper stretch then showed good acceleration, responded well when
asked inside the three-sixteenths, came under the whip nearing the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. RESERVE LIST bumped with a
rival at the start then came in and bumped with another foe, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, passed foes under a drive along the
rail in upper stretch, moved out just inside the furlong marker and finished with good courage to get the place while unable to threaten the winner. GOOD
ON PAPER broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and finished with
good energy to just miss the place while well clear for the show. G KATE was bumped after the start, established a good position just off the pace, drafted
two then three wide on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the winner past the three-sixteenths and weakened. CAZADORA was hustled

settled just off the pace, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole and came up
empty. MEDIA MENDACITY was off slow and spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. RAIN DANCE
broke a half-step slow, chased the pace on the outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied outside the winner in the two path on the turn, lost touch
with that foe into upper stretch and tired. ARTISTIC JEWLER broke a half-step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, came in briefly inside the half-mile
pole, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was carried out after falling well out of contention at the furlong marker and
capitulated. MAM'SELLE settled off the pace, steadied briefly when ARTISTIC JEWLER came in inside the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the
turn and failed to respond. CANDY BIZZNESS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the turn and never reached contention.

Footnotes
WASNT JOKING went around the first turn in the four path, tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid outside of two foes while three wide on the
final turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, moved clear nearing the three-sixteenths and drew away under strong urging. FLOATIE bumped with a
rival at the start, was caught in the five path on the first turn, raced up close to the pace, chased two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, proved no match for that foe, stumbled and fell passing the wire then stayed down for quite a while before
regaining her feet and was walked off. SLEW CITY SUSIE went six wide on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch, settled on the outside, was
ridden along while three wide on the far turn and weakened but earned the show. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE was last to commence then taken up briefly while
tugging at the bit in the two path early on the first turn, moved up with five furlongs to run to contest the pace, vied inside of two foes under urging along the
rail on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. SARAH ANN'S POINTE broke out then was hustled to the lead, went around the first turn in
mostly the three path, set the pace under pressure to her inside, vied between horses in the two path under urging on the far turn, lost the lead before the
quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong, fell over a fallen foe just past the wire, stayed down for quite a while before
regaining her feet then was walked into the horse ambulance and subsequently vanned off. HONDURAS GIRL went five then four wide on the first turn,
settled well back in the field, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. IDEAL MALLORY
went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and came up empty.
BULLETSANDBOURBON raced inside to the two path on the turns and was no factor. ANGEL CAT went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor.
RED RIVER CHASE bumped with a rival at the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back while inside on the far turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path, went wrong near the back of the field late and fell then was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch
run, no change was made to the order of finish.
