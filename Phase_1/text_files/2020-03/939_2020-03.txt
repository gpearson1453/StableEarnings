Footnotes
CARACORTADA pressed the pace from the inside, gained a short lead midway through the turn, kicked clear into the stretch and widened under
right-handed encouragement. MADAME JEANETTE stumbled badly at the start, raced off the rail, angled to the inside on the turn, raced a bit off the rail into
the drive, could not threaten the winner in the late stages but held the place. WINDI'S MOMENT settled off the pace, angled to the inside, saved ground
around the turn, angled out approaching the eighth pole, angled back to the inside in the lane and gained the show. MY PROJECT GIRL forwardly placed
early, raced three deep outside the leader then chased just off the pacesetter into the turn, traveled four to five wide into the lane and weakened. CAT'S
DESSERT asked early and sped to the front, set the pace under pressure, led from the two path into the turn, lost command around the bend, chased three
to four wide entering the stretch and gave way.
