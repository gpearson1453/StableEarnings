Footnotes
TIME FOR SUZZIE tracked pacesetter from along the rail into and on the turn, came out some departing the bend, rallied under right handed urging, wore
down pacesetter through the drive and was along in final yards. TIZ A MASTER quickly stepped to the front and crossed over, dictated the pace while
slightly off the fence, retained cushion into the lane, dug in along the rail in the drive but could not hold the winner. SHEZA FACTOR tracked leader from
between rivals, continued two then three wide to the stretch and finished willingly. DONUT GIRL was off a bit slow, settled outside, chased four wide on the
turn and into the stretch and bested others. SENORADIABLO stumbled slightly leaving the gate, chased well off the rail, remained four then five wide into
and on the turn, was fanned out further entering the stretch and failed to threaten. TODOS SANTOS stalked from the outside then three deep nearing the
turn, drifted out five wide departing the turn and also lacked needed response. MAJESTIC DIVA was between rivals early, dropped back some approaching
the turn then secured the rail around the bend, later weakened from the inside.

pressured pace while bit off the fence, continued two wide then edged away from along the rail in upper stretch, was overtaken past eighth marker but safely
held second. BIG BARREL prominent early from the outside, continued four wide into the bend, moved up and loomed three wide on the turn, remained on

Footnotes
BIG SWEEP was sent up inside to grab early lead, padded cushion around the turn and in upper stretch and proved best under steady handling and one
right handed tap late. LOVELY FINISH settled outside, chased, five wide to the turn, moved up some while four wide around the bend, continued well off the
rail in the lane and whittled gap on winner in final sixteenth. APPROVED FOR FLYBY was off a step slow, chased from the inside, hugged the rail around
the bend and into the stretch, came out slightly and drew clear off others in final furlong. LOUD LOUD MUSIC had good early foot and pressured the winner
to the bend, dropped back some around the bend and weakened in the drive. PUSHING SIXTY tracked leaders from between rivals, came in some later
and also weakened. MOUNTAIN PASS chased from off the rail early then four wide around the turn, drifted out further entering the stretch and lacked any
response. LOVELY FINISH wore mud calks.

Footnotes
KADESH tracked pace three wide to the last turn, moved up and bid midway on that bend, gained lead entering the lane, drifted out bit, came back in under
asking then powered away. BIG HOOF DYNAMITE crossed over and secured the rail into initial turn, chased inside, came back out in upper stretch and
was along late for the place. ITSTHATTIME forced the pace outside rival into and through the backstretch, moved up and grabbed brief lead nearing quarter
marker, was overtaken by winner into the stretch, lost contact with that rival and lost the place late. LEATHERNECK chased from off the rail, continued on
three wide path to the stretch, came in some through the lane and failed to threaten. ARC NATION bobbled slightly in opening strides, recovered and
stepped to the front, set pressured pace past half-miler marker, relinquished command on last turn, dropped back then was eased in the late going and
walked off. KNIFES EDGE settled inside, saved ground stalking the leaders, dropped back around the last turn, was also eased in the stretch and walked
off.

CHARLATAN quickly sped to the front while crossing over, controlled the pace slightly off the rail, roused approaching top of stretch and padded cushion,
then extended margin through the lane while drifting inward a bit and receiving few left handed taps. RUSHIE stalked from along the rail into and through the
backstretch, remained inside into the stretch and pulled away from rival late to prove second best. GREAT POWER tracked pace from off the rail then three
wide into the backstretch, brushed with inside rival a half-mile out and was out finished for the place. PRINCEOFTHENORTH settled inside, saved ground
chasing the pace and failed to make any late impact. SILENT FURY bobbled a bit leaving the gate, led pursuers to the second bend while bit off the rail, fell
back around that turn then was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
CE CE broke out bit then was caught four wide into first turn, stalked from the outside, advanced into and on the final bend, challenged outside pacesetter
then gained control pass the quarter marker, continued slightly off the rail and edged away under urging to prove best. HARD NOT TO LOVE was sent up
inside to grab command, set pace from the inside, was overtaken inside quarter marker, continued inside through the lane but could not match the winner.
OLLIE'S CANDY tracked pace from between rivals and inside winner to second bend, lost contact with top pair around that turn, remained bit off the rail and
safely held the show. KAYDETRE reserved in early stages while crossing over, chased from the inside thereafter and found her best stride late. ZUSHA
settled off the pace, saved ground chasing the leaders, angled out some in upper stretch but never reached contention. DER LU forced the early issue while
outside pacesetter, continued two wide, dropped back some around the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
GALWALKSINTOABAR was off a step slow then rushed up from outside to engage leaders while five wide, gained slim lead then dueled outside a rival on
the turn, gained control in upper stretch, edged away and was under long hold in final stages. BLAZING CHARM hesitated and broke inward in a slow start,
lagged well back inside early, swung out on the turn, was caught six wide entering the stretch, closed strongly from the outside and was along late for the
place. FLYING BUSINESS had good early foot from between rivals and four deep, dueled inside winner on the turn, lost contact with that rival in upper
stretch then lost second nearing the wire. KEEP IT CLASSY flashed early speed between rivals, dropped back a bit while three wide on the turn, came in
some into the stretch and finished with interest. CASILLALATER forced the early issue from along the rail, dropped back some around the turn, remained
inside but lacked needed late punch. OUR ROMANCE dueled then forced the early pace from between foes, also dropped back some on the turn, remained
off the rail and weakened. DURGA among the early leaders while two wide, continued on same path around the bend, angled out some and also weakened.
ON THE VERGE was off a bit awkward, stalked four then five wide to the stretch and weakened. FLAT QUICK settled off the pace and bit off the rail,
chased two or three wide to the stretch and lacked needed late response.
