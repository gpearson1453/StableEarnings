Footnotes
LEMON DROP TWIST was taken in hand early and let the runner-up cross in front, stalked that foe on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two to
three path on the turn, gained the advantage just inside the five-sixteenths, was very confidently ridden under mild urging into upper stretch, shook clear
when asked at the furlong marker and extended the advantage under strong hand urging and one tap of a down-turned whip to prove much the best.
DAYLIGHT DEELITE moved in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside a foe while inside to the two path on the turn,
was asked outside the five-sixteenths pole then lost the lead just inside that pole, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and proved no match while clear for the place. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA settled just off the pace, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. MISS DAWN broke out at the start, was rated just off the
pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and came up empty. FLUGEL BINDER bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, moved up then
settled just off the pace on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
COLOR FASHIONED bobbled just after the start, was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. MY MY MY broke
a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the three path, came six wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and
showed little. FICKLE FLASH broke out then bumped with a foe and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, moved up on the outside under urging,
went five then four wide on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SOUPER DORMY broke a step slow, settled well off the pace on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch
then leaned in before being corrected with a few tugs of the right rein, came under a left-whip around the three-sixteenths while lugging in a bit, rallied on the
outside while continuing lug in a bit and periodically getting a tug of the right rein and closed well to go by two foes late and prevail under excellent handling.
LONELY PRIVATE broke in at the start, showed good speed between outside of two foes then was eased back in a good position just off the pace, stalked
three wide on the turn while in dead-aim of the leading duo, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased outside in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed whip
outside the furlong marker then made a bid outside of HOMEBRED, battled determinedly into the final sixteenth, reached even terms for the lead late but
was denied while just able to get the place. HOMEBRED broke in and bumped MAYBERRY SALOON hard at the start, disputed the pace on the outside of
that opponent, vied in the two path while still outside that foe on the turn, was asked after turning into the stretch then thrown in by the rider to get him to
switch leads approaching the three-sixteenths, drifted to the rail outside the furlong marker then came under a left-handed whip, led determinedly until the
final strides but was caught and just missed the place. SHASHASHAKEMEUP was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled under some urging,
saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten while up for the last superfecta late. MONEY BIZ was bumped hard at the start then was hustled, disputed
the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and
tired. MISTER NOT FUNNY was taken up at the start and off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to
threaten. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased the winner into upper stretch and tired while well clear for the show. GOLDEN V C was
reluctant to load, raced up close on the outside, chased four then three wide on the turn and came up empty. JOHNNY CASINO was urged along off the
pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. MAYBERRY SALOON was a bit reluctant to load then off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was
urged along near the back, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. LEGENDARY HERO broke a step
slow, dropped well behind, went around the turn in the two path and showed little. DREAM TWISTER settled on the outside, moved in near the
seven-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered.

restraint, moved to the lead with five furlongs to run then went clear, rounded the far turn in the two path, responded well when asked at the
three-sixteenths, drew off under urging into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final seventy yards while much the best. TUPELO HON E brushed

while no match for the winner. MISS SOONER GIRL bumped with foes at the start, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under
urging late on the backstretch, was ridden along in the two path for most of the far turn then moved to the three path, turned into the stretch under a drive

first turn, went three then four wide on that bend, swerved six wide onto the backstretch, tracked the pace while rated on the outside, was urged along in the
four path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. SWEET BLINDNESS bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the first turn in the two

wide early on the far turn then swerved four wide around the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BULLETSANDBOURBON
went to the front, was guided around the first turn in the three path with extra left rein pressure, lugged out onto the backstretch, lost the lead near the
five-eighths pole then dropped off the pace, saved ground under urging while dropping further back on the far turn and faded. ANGEL OF VERDUN brushed
with foes at the start, went four wide for most of the first turn then shifted five wide, was carried seven wide onto the backstretch, raced on the outside under

Footnotes
PICASSO showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear when asked into upper stretch,
extended the advantage under a solid hand ride into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage while ridden out. MAJOR ATTRACTION broke a
half-step slow then bumped with a foe shortly after the start, steadied between horses at the five-eighths then moved out, settled outside under some urging,
was ridden along while four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then passed foes on the outside, drifted in a bit around the sixteenth-pole and
finished willingly for the place. CAVALRY CHARGE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
chased three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, raced between horses under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in a bit outside the
sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage but missed the place while clear for the show. FAIRWAY MAGIC was off slow and spotted the front a couple
of lengths, moved in midway down the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. STEADYTILLREADY bumped soundly with a rival
at the start, was urged along between horses then dropped back midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, steadied some behind a rival
inside the three-sixteenths and came up empty. DON'T RECALL bumped soundly with a foe at the start then bumped with another opponent shortly
thereafter and was taken up, dropped well behind, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and
failed to threaten. SYMPHONIC disputed the pace between horses, was ridden along in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated. KEEN SAMURAI broke a half-step slow, disputed the pace on the outside of multiple foes, vied four then three wide on the turn, dropped back
into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ROYAL PRIORITY showed good speed and set the pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch
and held under steady urging. LEBKUCHEN settled on the outside, bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch, was asked while three wide on the turn,
pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and earned the place. FORTY NINE MODEL broke in then was hustled, established a good position just off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and missed the place while clear for the show. FILM STUDY leaned in at
the start, was hard held while rated off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path still under tight restraint, was let out while three wide into the stretch then
came under a drive and lacked the needed response. TENSAS WEEZY bumped soundly with rivals on both sides at the start then checked while pinched
back, spotted the front many lengths, raced at the rear under some restraint, went three wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. JOE G'S PAYBACK was hustled from the start then taken in hand early while showing speed on the outside of the winner, moved in behind that
foe near the half-mile pole, bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch, raced between horses in the two path on the turn, dropped back inside the
five-sixteenths and came up empty. LADY BE GONE broke out and brushed the gate then bumped with a rival at the start, was pulled off that foe while
snatched with the left rein and dropped back, spotted the front a few lengths, raced under restraint while keen and fighting the rider, came out leaving the
backstretch, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. BOSTON CADILLAC bobbled at the start then bumped with a rival, was taken up then dropped
back, spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the far outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

MORE disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, drifted out while shaking clear in upper stretch and proved best under strong
urging. ITS COLD IN DEHERE was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked with a clear rail opening at the quarter-pole, chased
the winner in the stretch and was second best. BONNET was rated just off the pace, drafted in the two to three path on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out at the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show.
DIAMOND CRAZY settled towards the rear while moving out, went four then five wide early on the turn then was carried six wide around the five-sixteenths,
was asked for her best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. UNFADING BEAUTY was rated under a strong hold, started the turn in the two
path then shifted four wide, moved to the five wide near the five-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. BELLA FALAYA was
rated just off the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, steadied briefly when the winner came out near the
three-sixteenths and came up empty. DESTINY'S DARLING disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied in the two path while still inside that foe on
the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. WILD MUNNY broke a step slow, was hard held while tossing her head on the outside, bore
out badly on the turn and was pulled up then walked off.
