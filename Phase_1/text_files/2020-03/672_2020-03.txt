Footnotes
AL RHYTHM pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead, met the bid of BIG BAD JOHN, dueled briefly and drew off as an easy
winner. BIG BAD JON was allowed to settle early, made a bid on the winner, dueled briefly, couldn't sustain the run, was no match late and finished second
best. A WARRIOR DEFINED was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn, angled out and was along for the show position. ON THE RIGHT was
outrun early, went four wide into the turn and never fired. TIMELESS INDY set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out and faded.
SHANGHAIED ROO was not far back, went seven wide into the turn and weakened. SPURR ONE flipped gate break, walked off.

Footnotes
DOUBLE STORM was away in good order to dispute early fractions while racing four-wide, responded when challenged by MY LITTLE RIVER nearing the
three-sixteenths marker, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and gamely prevailed. MY LITTLE RIVER was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid into the stretch, vied with the winner but could not get by that foe through the prolonged drive.
JAZZONFRIDAY dueled for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way through the final furlong. JAZZINIA was forwardly
placed from the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. FEISTY HALO settled off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, drifted in with a furlong to run and steadied in the closing yards. JADEN'S TRICK showed no
early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. MCMISSY raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out
into the stretch, was pushed inward nearing the sixteenth pole and did not threaten. TWENTYFOUR K CAT was checked at the start, lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHAKURA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.
SNUGGLES N HUGS broke sharply to vie for the early advantage from the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole and weakened. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF SNUGGLES AND HUGS AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT SNUGGLES AND HUGS WAS TRYING TO LUG OUT AND MADE NO CHANGE.
