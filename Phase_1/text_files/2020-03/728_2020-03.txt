A B G GUERRERO away alertly set the pace holding daylight through the far turn, dug in to upper stretch finding more widening under a drive.
OVERWATCH stalked the pace shadowing rival through the far turn, looming while all out in upper stretch proved no match late. LAFLEUR raced mid pack
traveling evenly to upper stretch lacking surge while holding position there. PAY NO RENT slow early lagged to the far turn gaining some there proving no
menace through the lane. U. S. MILLENNIUM stalked the early pace then flattened out on the far turn easing the final eighth. PERFECT PAL gave early
retreat. SCHILLER NAV was never involved. CHOCOLATE TWIST struggled throughout.

Footnotes
EMPTY TALK pressed the pace dueling through the turn wresting a short lead in upper stretch edging clear under stiff urging in the four path. DANTU raced
mid pack losing ground to upper stretch rallying late six wide to save place. DYNAMIC KID saved ground giving a mild rally to upper stretch finishing well in
the two path. QUICK COWBOY slow early lagged through the turn, mustered a mild response down the lane to improve near mid track. MAXXIMUM
ENERGY hustled along chased to upper stretch weakening late. LONESOME PHIL gained on the turn then leveled off in upper stretch. KANDY CHARGE
pressured the pace dueling from the rail to upper stretch wilting late. HEATHWOOD was never involved. CHIEF RED BULL played no factor.
FLYINUNDERTHERADAR pressured the pace through the turn then folded up the final eighth.
