Footnotes
KULIK BEAR went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace inside to the two path, responded well while under threat from two foes at the
five-sixteenths, kicked clear when asked for more in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. LIMNERY went three wide on the first turn, settled
towards the front on the outside, ranged up three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid outside of two foes at the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner
under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match but was well clear for the place. PASSION PLAY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off
the pace, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show.
SAMARONTI was taken in hand early after being hustled from the gate then rated on the inside, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, chased three
wide into to the stretch and came up empty. TIMES SQUARE hit the gate at the start and broke a bit awkwardly, went three wide on the first turn, settled at
the rear, went around the far turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch, steadied behind horses while out of contention late and was no factor.
PEACE OF EKATI went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two to three path on the far turn, vied
between horses from the five-sixteenths into the stretch, switched out after dropping back at the three-sixteenths and capitulated. WHATDATPAY RAY
saved ground towards the rear of the field and was no factor. IRISH WIND bobbled shortly after the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, dropped back while four to five wide on the far turn and faltered. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
OLSON showed good speed and set the pace, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and held under
strong urging. ESTABLISHED was well placed just off the pace, drafted near the inside on the turn, was asked late on that bend while moving clearly into
the two path, chased the winner in the stretch and finished willingly while second best. RING OF FIRE tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide
on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to hold the show. CAROLINA AIRNESS was reluctant to load,
settled off the pace, dropped from three wide to the rail early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch, angled out significantly just inside the
three-sixteenths then drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to menace. MINE THAT STAR was coaxed along between horses, chased four wide on
the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and came up empty. GREENBACK was coaxed along on the far outside, chased five wide on the turn, dropped back
while moving out behind a drifting foe in upper stretch and capitulated. YASHIMA dropped back while urged along, went three to four wide on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. IRISH PAUL settled just off the pace, dropped back early on the turn then was roused, went three
wide through the bend, was driven into the stretch and had nothing left. BUCKY broke very slow and spotted the front many lengths, went three to four wide
on the turn and was no factor. FORTUNE TICKET settled under some urging, dropped back while inside on the turn and showed little.

INCA WARRIOR bumped the inside rival at the start, was taken back in the early going when in tight then settled in the two path on the first turn before
moving out, began to advance rapidly outside rivals four to five wide on the far turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, was clear by mid-stretch and held over
RELUCTANT WARRIOR, who was bumped at the start, raced mid-pack into the first turn having switched off the inside to the three path entering the first
turn before moving back in to the two path soon on that bend, tracked inside up the backstretch then moved outside a rival midway up the straight, went in
about the two path on the far turn before shifting to the rail at the top of the stretch, steadied about the three-sixteenths as a rival drifted in then ran on
gamely late. AMAVI raced wide in the back half of the field four deep into the first turn moving in a bit on that bend, advanced while shifting in past the half to
be nearer the inside entering the far turn along the rail moving just off it later on that bend and three deep past the quarter pole, ran on well late. LES PAUL
exchanged a light brush at the start, raced well back on or just off the rail on the first turn, continued toward the rear along the inside into the far turn shifting
to the three path late on that bend, came out wider in upper stretch and showed some late foot. JACI'S ROYALTY broke awkwardly and exchanged a light
brush with a rival, veered out a bit to the five path entering the first turn correcting to about four wide through that bend racing outside rivals, advanced four
to five wide on the far turn then evened out in the drive. CREOLE CANDY was just a bit fractious in the gate then hopped at the start, raced toward the back
three deep through the first turn, was well back at the rear outside a foe three to four wide on the far turn, moved out eight deep by upper stretch and
continued evenly. IBEAM broke out bumping a rival, was caught five deep into the first turn racing mid-pack off the leaders but moved in three abreast on
that bend then edged past a rival and moved nearer the inside early up the backstretch, came out three wide into the far turn and was put to urging on that
bend, began to weaken in upper stretch and altered out but failed to rally thereafter. BING BING raced outside foes four to five wide through the first turn,
steadily dropped back leaving the backstretch and on the far turn going three deep on that bend, failed to threaten. SPECIAL BINGO sped clear under mild
coaxing racing off the rail in the three then two path on the first turn, widened the margin up the backstretch, began to weaken leaving the far turn having
gone in the two path on that bend then continued weakening. HALF PIPE was a bit reluctant to load, broke well despite being bumped and was
forwardly-positioned shifting in heading into the first turn then abruptly altered out a path going in the two to three path on that bend, chased the pacesetter
into the far turn going in about the two path on that bend, lugged in near the three-sixteenths and tired. CHARLIE HOSS was forced to alter outside of HALF
PIPE entering the first turn to the four path but was able to move back in a bit, went off the fence in the three to four path mostly thereafter through that
bend, was in pursuit from off the inside three to four wide on the far turn, was in tight between rivals in upper stretch and faded. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
MUSCADINE was taken up after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace under some restraint, drafted in the three path on the far
turn, was asked while shifting five wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid at the three-sixteenths, gained the lead outside the eighth-pole,
responded well under threat from the runner-up in the final furlong and held under strong urging. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT broke in at the start, went two then
three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, moved from the two
path to the four path while unasked on the far turn, waited behind the winner while five wide into the stretch, moved out outside the three-sixteenths for room
then was asked, chased the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place while unable to get to that opponent. SMART ARCH went four wide
on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied three to four wide on the far turn, took the lead at the
five-sixteenths, came under a drive while still in front in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for
the show. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS broke a bit slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, moved closer while two then three wide on
the far turn, was roused while swinging seven wide into the stretch, moved further out behind foes nearing the three-sixteenths, drifted in near the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while just able to get the last spot in the superfecta. FOGGY ALBION saved ground on the first turn, was
well placed towards the front, moved closer with a half-mile to run, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased three
wide into upper stretch and came up empty. DEMI PATRICK saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch then tracked the pace,
made a bid outside of the pacesetter at the half-mile pole, vied in the two path while between horses on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated. TRUENO bumped with a rival after the start while hustled, went five wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, chased five
wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, came six wide into the stretch, was carried out nearing the three-sixteenths and had nothing
left. HOPE FOR CHANGE went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace, vied inside while put to urging on the far turn, lost the lead
outside the five-sixteenths and faded. RUNCIMAN bumped with a rival after the start, went five wide on the first turn, had the rider fall back in the saddle
briefly while between horses onto the backstretch, settled well off the pace, moved from four to six wide on the far turn, dropped to the five path into the
stretch then drifted in and failed to respond. DISTORED HALF was carried out after the start, went six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged along midway down the backstretch, came under stronger encouragement while six wide on the far turn and faltered. BOOGIE SHUES bumped with
foes on both sides after the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, dropped in while well back on the backstretch and came under urging, raced
inside to the two path on the far turn and showed little. ATLAS MOON lugged out from the four path to the seven path on the first turn, dropped well behind
and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
GYMNASTIC broke on top and soon went clear, set the early pace racing on or just off the rail, continued to lead up the backstretch near the rail before
moving out to the two path entering the far turn, edged clear late on that bend into upper stretch where put to a drive and held sway. LITTLE SNIP threw her
head at the break and was consequently away a touch slowly but recovered quickly enough, bobbled slightly nearing the first turn, raced mid-pack just off
the rail in the two path through that bend and up the backstretch, continued to bide time still just off the rail on the far turn before moving nearer the fence
turning for home, altered outside the aforementioned about mid-stretch but couldn't make any headway while just saving the place from MISS BROOKSIDE,
who was unhurried early racing along the inside, began to pick it up going two wide into the far turn moving three then four wide coming out of that bend
before angling seven deep past the quarter pole, still had much to do but ran on strongly late. BACK PAGE STAR shifted in heading to the first turn, saved
ground tracking along the inside through that bend, was given more encouragement late on the far turn moving from the rail to the two path on that bend,
shifted three wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MY LITTLE PRINCESS settled outside a foe at the rear three wide early, went four then
five wide on the far turn outside rivals still well back, passed some but needed more. GIRLS LIFE pursued the leaders from outside four wide through the
first turn as well as the far turn but came up empty in the stretch. FORGOTTEN raced in the three path off the leaders early as well as through the far turn
and was not a threat. PLAY ON BECKY broke a bit awkwardly and a half-step slowly, saved ground on both turns to no avail. C ISLANDSURPRISE broke
outwardly a bit, pursued the pacesetter from outside three wide, dropped back in the stretch and faded. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
FLATTER THE QUEEN was hustled from the start while losing his footing very slightly, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside early on the
turn then moved to the two path, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, tipped into the three path entering the stretch, began to drift out while dueling inside
of the runner-up into the final furlong, was straightened by the rider approaching the sixteenth-pole, continued his spirited battle with the runner-up, drifted
out again late and gamely prevailed. DIXIE BEAT tracked the pace on the outside, inched closer while three then four wide on the turn, was confidently
ridden into upper stretch, drew even with the winner while asked at the three-sixteenths, was carried out while dueling with that foe into the final furlong,
fought determinedly on the outside to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. SENOR BLAIR settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn
in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in under a right-handed whip at the
sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy for the show. OVERANALYZFAKENEWS settled off the pace, moved in midway down the backstretch,
dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
PERFECT PIRATE settled off the pace, was urged along while four then three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally.
MINI CHUNK brushed with a rival early, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, vied two then three wide on the turn,
was asked at the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and came up empty. SPARKY SPARKLES was off slow and spotted the
front a few lengths, settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WIDDLE GIANT bumped the inside rival at the start, tracked in behind the leaders racing just off the fence through the turn, found room between rivals in
upper stretch and took command, drew clear under a strong drive. RHETT'S RACER stalked from outside going four then three then back four wide on the
turn, was within range into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. ELLA'S LIL STAR was bumped between foes at the start, raced well back early
from off the inside, switched out further into the turn going four deep, shifted six wide about the five-sixteenths, improved position while unable to threaten
the top pair. STANG IT was taken up at the start after being in tight quarters near the outside then inside rival, raced toward the rear going two to four wide
on the turn, angled eight wide into upper stretch, drifted out a bit near mid-stretch and produced a good late effort to improve position. EMERY'S DREAM
set the pace inside, was challenged in upper stretch then weakened. COOL SIS pressed the pace from outside EMERY'S DREAM going three then two
wide on the turn and coming out a bit turning for home, weakened therafter. SANDY'S WAGER chased from outside going five wide on the turn and failed to
produce a bid. INTERSLEW raced in behind rivals but off the inside in about the three path into and through the turn, failed to rally. MATTIE E went two to
three wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. IONA GUITAR exchanged a hard bump at the break, appeared to be lugging in early up the
backstretch as the rider tugged a bit on the right rein, raced inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
OUR LIL RASCAL was sent hard from the start, showed speed on the outside then moved clear briefly leaving the backstretch, dropped to the rail early on
the turn, was challenged at the three-eighths, turned into the stretch under the whip, dueled inside of PRAY FOR LISA until inside the furlong marker, shook
clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under vigorous handling. SUSURRO was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and finished
willingly for the place. LADY CARLOS broke a half-step slow, was urged along well off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and finished with good energy to just miss the place while able to get the show. MANE PRIORITY was away alertly, showed good speed on the inside of the
winner, dropped back leaving the backstretch then moved to the two path early on the turn, chased into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. CRYPTO
BRAVE was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and gained some but failed to seriously
threaten. PRAY FOR LISA chased the pace on the outside, made a bid while four then five wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch, dueled with the
winner until near the sixteenth-pole then weakened. RUNAWAY RAE hesitated at the start, saved ground towards the rear and failed to threaten. DARING
DARIAN broke a half-step slow, was urged along while well off the pace, went four wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor.
DIAMOND LADY broke a half-step slow, climbed towards the rear leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and showed little. LADY RAD was off
slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went four wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT was urged early then coaxed along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, drifted in into upper stretch, rallied along the rail
outside the furlong marker, closed well to get lead inside two foes at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging. SOUTHERN LIGHT bumped with
a rival at the start then was taken up, was urged along towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, chased
into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just get the place. FIRST METAL COUNT pressed the pace on the outside,
vied in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, took a narrow advantage at the three-sixteenths, led until the sixteenth-pole then was
overtaken and just missed the place while able to get the show. WESTERN STAR was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the
turn, moved off the rail under the whip at the three-sixteenths, shifted further out just inside the furlong marker, was carried out around the sixteenth-pole
and also finished willingly but missed the trifecta. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, set the pace under pressure from his
outside, vied along the rail while inside of a foe on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, was headed at the three-sixteenths, battled into the final
sixteenth and weakened. EEPOPPORK TIME settled on the outside, was urged while three to four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip
and failed to rally. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back under urging, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail under
the whip into the stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten.
