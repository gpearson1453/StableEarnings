Footnotes
BOERNE quickly gained command, sailed along clear slightly off the inside for a half-mile, shifted further out at the top of the lane and was kept to pressure
unchallenged. PILOT EPISODE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased outside the winner throughout and was much best of the others. YOU'RE
THE BEST became skittish in the post parade and warming up, lagged a long way back inside after breaking slowly, moved out three wide approaching the
stretch and offered a mild response. PASSION FACTOR was devoid of speed to the stretch, and passed tired horses on the far outside. TAKE CHARGE
RO stayed in range early, came under a ride three wide late on the turn, and faltered in the stretch. A LOOKER hit the right side of the gate and was
crowded back behind PILOT EPISODE at the start, and stayed far back. ADRIATIC HOLIDAY was no factor four wide. LASHARA (GB) gave chase in the
two-path for a half and tired. WINNIPEG WONDER chased inside and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
KHOZY MY BOY was allowed to settle In early stages then advanced up the inside around the turn, raced in aim for the lead upper stretch, roused forward
to a slim advantage and held late under a driving finish. CHINOMADITO raced in early contention then moved up the inside to take command at the five
sixteenths pole, started to drift out wider leaving the turn, came under strong right handed pressure into the lane, straightened for the drive, came again with
game response and just missed. W W ARCHIE tracked in close contention along the outside, remained a strong contender turning for home, raced in
striking distance near furlong grounds then yielded in final stages. HANDSOME PRINCE set a pressured pace in the opening quarter, got collared by
CHINOMADITO at five-sixteenths pole, stayed on with response upper stretch then had nothing left in late reserve and faded. RED ASTAIRE hustled along
three to four wide and failed to move into close contention. ARMANDO'S TEAM drifted out for a slow getaway at the start, lagged behind and raced widest,
continued wide under right handed pressure into the lane and never got in gear. TOOK A CAB applied pace pressure to HANDSOME PRINCESS in
opening quarter then came up tired around the turn.

Footnotes
O. K. KAY prompted the pace outside BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD, challenged between that one and DRINKS ON ME approaching the stretch, reached the
front a furlong from home and forged clear. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD showed the way for six furlongs inside, fought back when hooked into the lane, could
not match strides with the winner in the closing stages but saved the place. DRINKS ON ME sat outside the leaders three wide to the top of the stretch,
finished willingly but drifted way out and missed second. AMAZING AUDREY trailed inside to the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch and gained
mildly. SWEET BLOSSOM became unsettled inside and under a hold nearing the first turn, continued to save ground and made no headway when roused.
LOVE DADDY raced in the two-path on the turns, and was no factor.

Footnotes
WAR GIANT held a slim lead while being pressed along by LEMNISCATE around the first turn then cleared on top entering the backstretch and set the
uncontested pace, widened advantage and held clear under pressure around the far turn, stayed strong on top along the rail in stretch run and held firm.
ADMIRE saved ground around the first turn, raced behind the leader and stalked rival through early stages, launched a bid for widening on top winner
entering the far turn, coaxed two wide around the turn, stayed in pursuit while lugging in under left handed pressure, put in a solid run but could not get to
then winner. GRAN OMERO (VEN) settled in the back four wide, angled inside to save ground and prompted late backstretch, shifted back out near the
furlong marker, drifted out wide near the furlong marker, switched in a couple paths and churned on for a share. MOTAGALLY rated along the outside never
too far off the early pace, headed in pursuit nearing the half mile marker, briefly gained position on the far turn then failed to sustain his bid. LEMNISCATE
applied pressure to WAR GIANT around the first turn then edged back into tracking position and faltered after the half mile marker.

Footnotes
SYLVANELLA took command at the start, established an even tempo showing the way inside to the stretch, got set down in earnest through the furlong
grounds and stayed well clear. BETTER WITH AGE was slow into stride and saved ground trailing early, remained with a lot to do three then four wide
around the far turn, found her best stride entering the last furlong and was up for second on the far outside. WICKED MERCURY bumped lightly with OUR
FANTASY at the start, raced in striking range three wide to the stretch, and was outkicked between horses. CAREFREE HIGHWAY went along covered up
inside behind the leaders for six furlongs, drifted out under heavy pressure through the late stages and bumped with OUR FANTASY nearing the wire. OUR
FANTASY bumped lightly with WICKED MERCURY at the start, prompted the pace outside SYLVANELLA, could not get to that one through mid stretch,
and bumped with CAREFREE HIGHWAY coming to the finish. TOASTNJAM settled in midpack for six furlongs, and made no progress behind horses in
deep stretch. DELANCEY'S PHILLY broke out at the start, raced in the second flight hanging in or around the three-path much of the time, lugged in tough
to handle in upper stretch, and wound up lacking room behind horses a sixteenth out. UNIQUELY MINE was carried out a bit at the start by DELANCEY'S
PHILLY, was outrun for six furlongs and eased up through the lane. RYE STREET dropped far back inside after six furlongs, and was eased up in the
stretch.

Footnotes
YOUNGEST OF FIVE angled to the rail position shortly after the start, sat just off the quick pace down the backstretch, tipped out and headed in pursuit
nearing the quarter pole, matched strides with GRAY'S FABLE entering top stretch, roused forward to slim lead then responded sharply under right handed
pressure and finished going away. ARMANDO R switched out to race widest in opening stages and continued reserved, hustled along under pressure
around the turn, continued a bid along the far outside and rallied up for second best. GRAY'S FABLE held command out of the chute and crossed over to
the inside, set a sharp pace through the backstretch, fought back when challenged by YOUNGEST OF FIVE near the quarter pole, vied entering top stretch
then failed to match with the winner and weakened to show. COASTAL DEFENSE raced off the top trio in the opening quarter and hustled along with five
furlongs left to run, produced a solid bid moving up into contention mid-way around the turn but failed to sustain needed response and flattened in the lane.
GHOST ON A MISSION was reserved racing near the pace, saved ground into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. DYN was forwardly place while racing
up close behind the quick pacesetter, given cue to advance nearing three eighths pole, had no kick left in reserve and faded. SOLE SEEKER raced in the
back then two wide around the turn and had no response.

STATED raced forwardly three wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly to catch the leaders from outside a sixteenth out, and drove clear. LITTLE BELLA
bumped with FOLLOW ME MOM at the start, then lacked room between that one and STATED a stride later, raced well back three then four wide to the top
of the lane, and rallied on the far outside. FOLLOW ME MOM bumped with LITTLE BELLA at the start, then bumped lightly with MOON EYES after another
couple strides, vied outside GREY MANNERS up the backstretch, edged away around the turn, battled on between horses to deep stretch and just
salvaged third while weakening. MOON EYES bumped lightly with FOLLOW ME MOM after the start, made no headway between horses around the turn,
shifted out in the final furlong and was gradually gaining to the finish. QUIET ALL AROUND chased behind the leaders to the stretch in the two-path, and
was one-paced between horses the last eighth of a mile. GREY MANNERS bumped with BROADWAY PEGGY at the start, vied early inside FOLLOW ME
MOM before letting that one go, rebid turning for home, but gave way on the rail through the closing stages. BROADWAY PEGGY bumped with GREY
MANNERS at the start, saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, lacked a clear path behind GREY MANNERS and QUIET ALL AROUND through the
furlong grounds, and was wrapped up late with all hope lost.

Footnotes
NOBLE INDY held a slim lead heading into the first turn, set the pace along the rail to the far turn, challenged by MONARCHS GLEN near the quarter pole,
dug in and shook off foe leaving the turn, widened advantage under right handed pressure and held firm. SAND DANCER slightly bobbled a step out, raced
under a snug hold to rate off the moderate tempo, given cue late far turn and swing wide into upper stretch, finished with good response and got up late to
capture place. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) steadied along the inside entering the first turn then tugged while a bit keen racing under restraint, saved ground
then switched out a path and produced a two wide bid to move up near the quarter pole, could not match strides with winner top of the lane but stayed on
with response and got edged late for place. GOLDEN DRAGON raced in contention and tracked in close range down the backstretch, hustled up three wide
around the far turn then chased on evenly through the lane . GUNNISON stalked in close contention down the backstretch, launched a bid around the far
turn then continued three to four wide in range but lacked the needed surge for serious impact. HAYABUSA ONE (FR) was unhurried, came under a ride on
the far turn, shifted out six wide upper stretch and produced a mild bid. PROFITEER settled off the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, gained
position on the far turn, continued an inside bid in contention at the eighth pole then gave way.

FREUDIAN FINISH grabbed the lead at the start, went along hounded from the outside by MIDTOWN ROSE, dug in along the rail through the stretch to turn
that foe aside, and was moving away the last 50 yards. MIDTOWN ROSE chased outside FREUDIAN FINISH from the start, ratcheted up the pressure
around the turn, made repeated attempts to get by through the lane but was denied while clearly second best. BARGAINAIRE bumped and brushed with
FREE TO FLY as they got away slower than the others, moved off the inside to wind up in the three-path at the top of the lane, and could not gain with an
even finish. LADY FIORELLA chased after the leaders for a half-mile, came four wide into the stretch, and was making no headway when the rider dropped
the whip approaching the sixteenth-pole. FREE TO FLY bumped and brushed with BARGAINAIRE at the start coming out slowly, raced three to four wide
outsprinted through the turn, shifted further out to the stretch and remained at the rear.

CRYPTO GOLD saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace down the backstretch, prompted four wide around the far turn then put to a drive at the
head of the lane, responded sharply, rallied along the outside and finished going away. CASTILLETE bumped the gate at the start, rated in close range
along the rail, waited for a clear path on the far turn, shifted out and put to a drive three wide, raced in aim for the lead then failed to be a match while game
for the place. DUELLIST raced off the pace, prompted along the inside entering the far turn, edged closer then waited in traffic late far turn into upper
stretch, shifted out wider and rallied for a share. DREAMMASTER raced in range to the far turn, picked up the pace then edged closer then raced in some
traffic, shifted wider and improved late. NOBLE NEBRASKAN stalked through early stages, moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, fought
back top stretch, briefly shook free to the lead then gave way. ALPERES rated along the outside through early stages, raced three to four wide and loomed

down the backstretch, vied for the lead at the quarter pole and fought back top of the lane then tired in final furlong. PERFECT ENOUGH raced five wide
entering the first turn, raced off the pace then prompted five wide around the far turn and failed to respond. WARRIOR SPIRIT applied pace pressure to
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY to the far turn then came up empty midway around the final turn.
