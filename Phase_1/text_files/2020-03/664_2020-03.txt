WONDER OF AUTISM broke a bit slow and had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive and closed steadily to collar
SPARKLING UNICORN late. SPARKLING UNICORN was chasing the leader to the turn, rallied inside to the stretch, took a short lead in mid stretch then
battled but could not stall the winner. NORTHERN QUEST hesitated and broke about three lengths last, trailed three wide to the stretch then shifted out
widest for the drive and finished in a rally. HULA KING was chasing to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, loomed a factor to mid stretch then weakened.
SENSATIONAL ROCKET got outsprinted early, was forced to circle four wide on the turn and lacked a closing response. PAPA SUGAR pulled to the lead,
set the pace three then two wide but stopped once in the stretch.

Footnotes
DR. BAGLEY pressed the pace for six furlongs while two wide, rallied to take over in mid stretch then dug in desperately and held on by the slimmest of
margins. CURRY NATION trailed to the second turn, bid four wide, had to circle five wide into the stretch, responded determinedly in the final sixteenth but
lost by a whisker. HERDSMAN had no speed, raced three then four wide on the second turn, rallied to mid stretch then was outfinished in the late stages.
BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared in upper stretch by the winner and weakened.
BATTALION WON was chasing the pace to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. LEGENDARY NIGHT
was allowed to settle inside to the half, continued to save ground on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
TOMLIN stalked the pace to the turn, was following MOTHER OF DRAGONS two wide to the stretch, shifted inside that one in upper stretch, rallied once
clear and closed steadily to get the nod. MOTHER OF DRAGONS contested the pace two wide to the stretch, drifted out under left handed whipping,
bumped repeatedly with COCO BEE from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth marker but was nipped on the wire. COCO BEE attended the pace three wide
to the stretch, responded when set down then was bumped three times by MOTHER OF DRAGONS from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth pole and was
bested. GOTHAM DESIRE bobbled to begin, was outsprinted to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, was trying to rally then was carried out by COCO
BEE in mid stretch and finished evenly. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run and disqualified MOTHER OF DRAGONS from second to
third for interference to COCO BEE. It was a unanimous decision.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT BIRD pressed the runnerup for six furlongs in the two path, responded when set down for the drive and closed determinedly to get the nod.
GOLDEN IRIS (GB) set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in stubbornly in the late stages and just missed. CREATIVE ROMANCE never far back,
saved ground to the stretch then shifted out for room, responded and surged but was too late. ROSE PRINCESS was allowed to settle to the second turn,
came two wide to the stretch then finished willingly in the late stages. SLOANE GARDEN (GB) settled mid pack to the half, was fanned four wide to the
stretch and finished in a rally. SUTRO trailed to the second turn, was also four wide to the stretch and closed the gap late. OUR BOLD PRINCESS had no
speed, settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch but was outfinished late. BABE DIDRIKSON stalked the pace to the half, made a bid three
wide to loom a threat into the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. QUEEN HELENE was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the
second turn but had to circle five wide to the stretch and could not make an impact.
