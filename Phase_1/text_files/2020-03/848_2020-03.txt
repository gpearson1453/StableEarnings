Footnotes
FFURGIE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the drive, responded and wore
down SAVVY SPENDER the final furlong. SAVVY SPENDER broke sharp from the inside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch,
continued to show the way through the second turn, held a clear margin at the eighth pole but was caught late. DEEPLY unhurried early from the outside,
inched closer entering the second turn, responded but could only gain the show. COMBINE ROAD forced the early pace inside but came up empty in the
drive. LOST COUNTY chased the early pace from the inside but had nothing left. PROUD THREADS was never a factor. GOSPEL ZESTY trailed
throughout.
