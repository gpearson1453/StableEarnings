Footnotes
INDY RIDE tracked just off the the pacesetter three deep in the opening quarter, continued with a steady bid prompting the pacesetter on the turn, wrested
the advantage racing into upper stretch, went clear under firm encouragement and was gathered up nearing the wire. LARGE, restless loading in the gate,
ducked out at the start, was righted to track the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn, angled inside entering the lane and edged a rival for the place
honors nearing the wire. VEGAS LIFE, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command inside the winner through the turn, proved no match
entering the stretch and gave way. BURL switched out early tracking just off the second flight, made brief progress four wide racing through the turn but
flattened out entering the lane. MEDAL OF FACT tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes into the turn and faded into upper stretch. CITY GUY shied away
from LARGE at the start, was settled outside foes and soon dropped out. COURAGE DE LION hesitated at the start losing contact with the field and trailed
thereafter.

Footnotes
KARATBARS, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace, advanced to press the issue racing through the turn to upper stretch and edged clear under a drive.
I'MTHEKATSMEOW ducked out at the start bumping RONNIE, was righted to track off the leaders outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted three wide in
upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. HIFALUTIN, urged to the lead along the inside racing through the
backstretch, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and gave way. DONNAMEUP, held up momentarily when caught in tight quarters at the
start, was righted to track just off the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the turn, then faded in late stages. DATA DOLL tracked off the second flight outside
foes racing to the turn but never gained striking distance. FREUDYCATFEVER was settled outside foes in the last flight and failed to menace thereafter.
DREAMS OF SHIRLEY exchanged bumps with RONNIE at the start, angled in tracking off the second flight in the opening stages but faded early. RONNIE,
bumped from both sides, then pinched back at the start, trailed throughout.

HE HAD A SECRET, urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, dueled
inside a rival while being headed racing into upper stretch but resisted gamely to late stages to just prevail under firm right handed encouragement.
POZNAN, in touch from the outset stalking the pacesetter under light rating, steadily gained terms with that foe to bid between rivals leaving the midway
point of the bend, pressed the into upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage and dueled outside the winner to the wire to just miss. IMPERIAL IVOR shifted
out four wide early tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, angled inwards nearing the lane and improved position in late stages while no real
threat. BUC'S INVESTMINT shifted out three wide early while being prompted to a forward placing, pressed the issue in that path through the turn and gave
way into upper stretch. BIP BIP FULL POWER tracked the leaders five wide in the opening stages and soon retreated. JUST A DUKE hopped at the start
while breaking slowly, angled to the inside early but proved no threat.

Footnotes
CAPOEIRA, reserved out of striking distance along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced inside foes on the far turn, shifted out three wide
to challenge for command in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed pressure. VAUNT, forwardly placed stalking a
rival's pace under light reserve in the opening half, shifted out advancing on that foe on the far turn, took over to gain a brief advantage entering upper
stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner while holding the place honors on her own courage late. CATSOUTOFTHEBAG sped to the
lead along the rail, set the pace on a comfortable margin into the far turn, was roused to maintain the advantage but gave way into the lane. TEGLA ducked
in at the start, angled inside tracking off the second flight, came out in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. CHASING HELICITY, reserved along
the inside early, swung outside foes racing through the far turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and gained some position while making no real impact.
ADONAI BLESS tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing into the lane while fading.
BIZNESS BEAUTY, off a step slowly, was settled between foes but offered no rally. SHENU SHENUME angled in tracking the leaders from just out of
striking distance, shifted out while being roused to make a brief bid on the far turn but soon emptied out. CELESTIAL ORB tracked the leaders between foes
in second flight, shifted out entering the lane and gave way.

BLACKLINE broke readily to gain a forward placing, was rated stalking a rival's pace racing into the first turn, continued under patient handling just off that
foe racing to the far turn, was prompted to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and made the balance of the pace under firm encouragement.
JACK THE CAT was rated off the second flight inside rivals while ducking away from close quarters in the opening stages, came around a tiring foe racing
into the far turn to advance along the rail, shifted out to,split foes entering upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap on the winner. J
BERESFORD TIPTON broke outwards brushing the gate, tracked the leaders racing three deep into the first turn, shifted inwards on the backstretch gaining
a position in second flight, briefly awaited an opening racing through the far turn, shifted out three, then four deep entering the lane and continued well
enough to edge a rival for a share. AMERICANDY broke readily to gain terms with the winner leaving the chute, was prompted to gain the lead along the rail
racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way. HEY BIG GUY settled last racing to the backstretch and gained
some position inside foes late. HONEST TO GOODNESS angled inwards to track just outside rivals in the first flight in the opening half, was prompted to
lodge a brief, three wide bid leaving the midway point of the far turn but quickly came up empty. IRONWOOD was settled outside foes tracking off the
second flight, angled out five wide entering the lane but proved no threat. ENGLISH LAUGHTER tracked off the first flight along the rail in the opening
furlong, was getting out a bit racing through the first turn and dropped out early.

THE GODDESS LYSSA, restless in the gate prior to the start, showed quickly in front, dictated the pace near the inside racing into the turn, held sway on a
widening margin into the lane and was taken in hand nearing the wire in a handy effort. CHICK'S SHADOW broke a step slowly, switched out racing through
the backstretch tracking off the second flight, advanced four wide through the turn to upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prove clearly best of
the others. DIAMOND NEWS tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into the stretch. LA BELLE DE COURSE
tracked the pacesetter four wide, then three wide between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. COUNTESS JESSICA was rated off
the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the stretch but made no impression. GRAYCLIFF tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part
of the second flight racing to the turn and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
MATINEE GIRL readily went to the lead while angling inwards racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin into the backstretch,
widened the advantage on her own courage entering the far turn and held sway to the end under firm left handed pressure. JACKIES DREAM settled last
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes three deep in upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to close the gap late. MELISSANI settled
near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane to split foes just off the inside steadily gaining position late but was outkicked for the
place honors. ROSALDA was bothered at the break while being taken up momentarily, gained a position tracking the leaders well out of striking distance as
part of the second flight but had no final kick. TEACHER DRAMA, fractious in the gate, ducked into the path of STRONG GEM at the start, tracked off the
second flight to the far turn and had no late response. STRONG GEM shied outwards at the start into the path of ROSALDA, was collected to track the the
leaders three deep in second flight, was fanned four wide into the lane and gave way. WOWEE, forwardly placed along the rail tracking the pacesetter to the
far turn, gave way nearing the lane. HER NAME IS STAR dropped out early.

Footnotes
TOTAL TAP broke readily, was rated outside a rival tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing
into upper stretch, took over nearing the furlong marker and went clear under firm right handed pressure. WHISTLE ME HOME sped to the fore along the
rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, couldn't contain the winner's bid but prevailed for the place honors. COMPLETELY BONKERS
tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide in upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final
kick. DON'S MARSH tracked off the second flight near the inside in the opening half, angled out five wide entering the lane and gained some position in an
even effort. CROWN TO THE GOLD, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, split foes racing into the lane but made no impact. CLASSY
INDIVIDUAL settled along the inside early, switched outside foes after a half while being urged to advance but offered no rally. BOLD RESPONSE,
forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace into the far turn, gave way into the stretch. BEYOND SMART, going a bit erratically along the inside tracking just
off the leaders under light restraint racing to the first turn, was through early. BIG MONEY MACHINE, reserved outside foes to the backstretch, never
seriously menaced. ALMOREB was pulled up racing to the backstretch and was vanned off the course.
