CANDY FOR ALL broke readily, stalked just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, steadily moved to terms with that foe on her own courage racing through
the bend, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and was prompted right handed to go clear. SHARPERTHANME, off a step slowly, was urged to
gain a position just off the pacesetter near the inside on the backstretch, switched out three deep entering the turn and continued with a steady effort to
prove best of the others. PLUIE D'AVRIL bobbled slightly at the start, recovered quickly while angling inwards to track the pacesetter between foes, was
prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. OURHANDSOMEGAL tracked off the second flight
racing four wide into the turn and lacked a late response. MISS LOTUS FLOWER settled outside foes early, raced five wide through the turn while making
progress between calls but failed to seriously menace. VICTIM, urged to the lead while angling inside, set the pace on a narrow margin into the turn and
gave way racing into upper stretch. BOURBON TRACE proved no factor.

EXCHEQUER broke readily to gain the advantage while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, steadily widened the
advantage nearing upper stretch and came under right handed pressure to maintain that margin to the end. JUAN PABLO, reserved along the rail tracking
off the second flight into the far turn, shifted out near midstretch and split rivals to finish with interest while proving best of the others. FLIGHT DECK tracked
off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued well enough to gain a share.
PROFESSIONAL tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival under light rating in the opening half and came up empty racing into the stretch. TETSU
tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge brief bid racing through the far turn but proved empty in the
drive.

Footnotes
CANDY COVE broke readily despite being brushed by a rival at the start to gain terms prompting the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch,
pressed the issue entering the turn to gain the advantage, went clear into upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin to the end under firm handling and
left handed pressure. THE GREAT LOUDINI settled well off the second flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide nearing the sixteenth marker while
finding his best stride late and prevailed for the place honors in time. SECRET LIFE STYLE was urged to gain a position racing four wide tracking just off the
first flight into the turn, continued with a steady effort in that path racing into the stretch but was just outkicked for second. GREELEY'S FAREWELL
switched off the inside early while being urged to a contending position three deep between foes racing into the bend, closed the gap on the pacesetter
racing into upper stretch but flattened out leaving the furlong marker. AMERICANO was urged disputing the pace racing a bit off the rail into the turn and
gave way into upper stretch. J B QUICK dropped out early. DEBDURITE made brief pursuit of the leaders along the along rail but emptied out early.
MALEKITH, restless in the gate before the start, broke slowly while brushing the eventual winner and trailed throughout.

LION CHARMER tracked just outside the pacesetter under light rating racing to the first turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage racing into
the far turn, moved away to clear advantage in upper stretch and came under brisk left handed pressure to turn back a challenge from
CAUSFORCELEBRATION to prevail. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival under light rating in the opening half, shifted out racing through
the far turn while commencing his advance, gained terms with the pacesetter nearing midstretch challenging for command but hung approaching the wire.
PAPA RALPH J settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing through the lane and continued well
enough to prevail for a share. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked the leaders outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to make a brief advance on the
eventual winner racing through the far turn but came up empty in the drive. HEX moved to the lead along the rail racing into the backstretch, set pace to the
far turn and gave way. I HAVE HOPE was settled last, proved no threat.

KONZA KANDY hopped at the start while breaking slowly, shifted out four wide racing through the backstretch to gain a position just off the first flight,
steadily advanced on the pacesetter racing through the turn, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement.
VIVA FOREVER angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued with interest to gain the place honors in the
closing stages. SUPER TWENTY FIVE broke outwards bumping SIMPLY GREAT, was righted, then urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on
a narrow margin into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge but yielded leaving midstretch. RACINROSEMARY angled inwards gaining terms with
the pacesetter prompting that rival to the turn, gave way between foes, then shifted out five wide in the lane. MAMMA WHITE SOCKS tracked off the
second flight racing four wide to the turn but offered no rally. SIMPLY GREAT, bumped at the start, settled off the second flight, never gained contention and
was fanned six wide into the stretch. G Q GIRL tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the
lane.

OLD DOMINION went readily to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating to the far turn, turned back a
rivals challenge nearing upper stretch, then resisted a bid from NOBLE LION leaving midstretch shifting inwards under pressure racing past the chute but
just held that foe under firm encouragement. The latter angled to the inside to track off the first flight under rating to the backstretch, was prompted to
advanced inside foes racing into the lane, bid for command inside the pacesetter leaving midstretch, was carried inwards by that foe racing past the chute in
the final stages and was just outkicked. LUIS TWO GUNS, forwardly placed inside the eventual winner, switched out attending that rival's pace racing into
the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn and weakened in the drive. TRAVEL AGENT was rated off the second flight along the inside in the
opening half, lost some position racing into the far turn, angled four wide racing into the lane while making some late progress and drifted inwards in late
stages. CHIEF OF JOY tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, then continued evenly between foes into the stretch. STREET
LEGACY, taken up avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled last, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, had no rally and
was steadied off TRAVEL AGENT when losing his path to that foe late. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS, extremely rank from the outset while ducking outwards, then
pulling against restraint racing to the backstretch, emptied out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

gain terms with the winner nearing midstretch but proved no match in the last furlong. VUYELWA was firmly rated off the second flight in the opening half,
angled out five wide nearing the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. MIGHTY FROSTY switched outside foes early tracking off the second
flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide pursuing the leaders into the far turn, couldn't gain terms with the first flight and proved empty
in the drive. I AM A. LURING, urged between foes pressing the pace into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, gave way into the lane and
altered course in late stages avoiding a tiring rival. INCA PRINCESS was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight, was prompted to advance after a
half but came up empty racing into the far turn. CAPTAIN ANGEL, caught five wide racing through the first turn racing as part of the second flight, shifted
inwards on the backstretch to advance on the leaders three deep, bid for command striking the front between calls on the far turn, lost momentum racing
into upper stretch, then ducked inwards crossing the path of I AM A LURING midstretch while quickly giving way. JEANIE VEE tracked the leaders four
wide, then three wide between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch but retreated early. TRAP GIRL tracked the leaders between foes
in second flight into the backstretch and emptied out after half.

Footnotes
SHARI'S TUNE was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shook clear racing into the stretch and was kept to pressure.
TWIRLING STAR settled off the second flight while angling inwards in the opening stages, shifted out four wide racing into the lane steadily gaining position,
came around a drifting rival midstretch and secured the place honors late. BAND SWEETHEART tracked the leaders three wide between foes in the
opening stages, continued in that path to lodge a brief bid racing upper stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker and had no final kick. RACHEL'S
WISH, unhurried along the inside in the opening stages, was held up avoiding close quarters entering the turn, switched outside foes racing into the lane but
had no rally. LOVE MY SUNSHINE broke sharply, forced the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. SIX
STRING KISS, bumped soundly at the start, settled last and never menaced thereafter. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL ducked out bumping SIX STRING KISS at
the start, was guided to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn but soon faded. PESARO, caught four deep in second flight racing to the
turn, emptied out early.

Footnotes
RARE HUE tracked off the first flight outside rivals under light rating in the opening quarter, advanced on the leaders four wide racing into the turn, moved to
challenge for command three deep entering upper stretch and continued with a sustained effort to prevail in time under firm left handed pressure. HAPPY
GUY angled inwards to prompt the pace between foes in the opening stages, pressed the issue gaining a narrow advantage racing into the turn, edged
forward into upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge grudgingly to the end but just failed to contain that foe. SEVERUS tracked off the first flight under
light rating in the opening quarter, came through close quarters splitting foes to challenge for command nearing upper stretch but was outkicked by the top
pair late. LITTLE GUY, bumped at the start, was righted to track off the second flight racing to the turn, came through close quarters splitting foes nearing
upper stretch, angled to the rail entering the lane to lodge a brief bid flattened out late. FLUG broke slowly, settled into stride racing to the bend, advanced
five wide on the turn to upper stretch and made some mild progress. STARSHIP FONZY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, came
around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch and steadily faded in the drive. NOBLE KING broke inwards bumping LITTLE GUY, was settled last to the turn,
angled out six wide in the stretch but proved no threat. MY COMPUTER, restless in the gate, never gained contention. ALL STARR RUNNER dropped out
early. STERLING JUDGE flashed brief pace three wide between foes racing to the turn and emptied out abruptly nearing the lane. OLD NEWS, urged to
dispute the pace while angling inside foes racing through the backstretch, emptied out after a half. THE FIRST QUARTER SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.
