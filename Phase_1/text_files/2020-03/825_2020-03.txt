Footnotes
LADYGOGENTLY settled on the outside, was roused while five wide on the turn, rallied seven wide into the stretch, closed strongly in the center of the
track, took the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. SHE'S SEVENTEEN bumped lightly with a rival after the start, showed
good speed and set the pace under pressure from her inside, vied in the two path while inside of a foe on the turn, lost the lead passing the three-eighths,
regained the lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place.
QUIET TRIP pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, took the lead passing the three-eighths, lost the advantage under a
drive in upper stretch, battled with the runner-up for the place in the final furlong and missed that position while clear for the show. RED PRINCESS bumped
with a rival early then dropped back, settled off the pace, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn then driven into the stretch, angled out outside
the furlong marker, moved further out behind a drifting foe outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. LIL MS BOSSY PANTS tracked the pace on the
outside, ranged up three to four wide on the turn, floated five wide into upper stretch, dropped back while still on her inside lead into the final furlong and
came up empty. LADY DATE bumped lightly with a foe just after the start, bumped with another foe early, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on
the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out under a drive near the three-sixteenths while still on her inside lead, came further out still on her
inside lead inside the furlong marker and failed to respond. CAN'T COUNT THAT stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths,
moved in outside the half-mile pole, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. HARVEY'S SONG raced well back in the field, rounded the turn
inside to the two path and showed little.

DUNCASTLE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, cruised into upper stretch under his own
power, shook clear at the three-sixteenths then was asked, extended the advantage under one tap of a down-turned whip into the final furlong and proved
much the best under a brisk hand ride. OVERNIGHT SUCCESS bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the three
path on the turn, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. MINE MY TIME settled off the pace,
dropped back while having a bit of trouble cornering into the turn then was roused, saved ground on that bend, swung four wide into the stretch then tipped
out further and came up empty. JAZZY JUSTIN bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, came under urging approaching the half-mile pole,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, was ridden along in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then drifted in nearing the
three-sixteenths and failed to respond. (Rail at 9 Feet)

ASHLEE'S REWARD was in contention early from between rivals into the turn, went three then two deep on that bend, was challenged by GO GET THAT at
the top of the stretch, dueled inside that one and dug in late under steady handling to prevail. GO GET THAT raced between foes in the second group early,
went four wide on the turn advancing late on that bend to challenge, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, dueled but was outfinished. CIVIL was encouraged
along early racing well outside, was clear late up the backstretch into the turn going in the six path on that bend, began to weaken nearing the quarter pole
and could not kick on with the top two. V MAN was very briefly taken hold of in behind rivals leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn,
drifted out late under left-handed encouragement. HITTHEGROUNDRUNNIN bobbled just slightly at the start and raced way back early, went in the three
then four path on the turn swinging six wide into upper stretch and improved position. GRAND TY vied inside, began to weaken early on the turn and was
unable to rally. BLUEWATER CAT shifted inside a rival up the backstretch but was still wide going five deep on the turn, failed to threaten. JAIL HOUSE
raced inside into the turn moving just off the rail on that bend, came up empty.

Footnotes
HENDY WOODS broke in and hit the gate then was taken in hand early, settled on the inside, was asked while shifting three wide into the stretch, rallied on
the outside to take the lead into the final furlong and proved best under strong handling. GINSENG was hustled to the front, set the clear pace on the inside,
was asked nearing the three-sixteenths then came under a drive, lost the advantage into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to hold the place.
SHE CAN'T SING brushed with a rival early then was taken back under a strong hold, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the
far turn in the two path while still under restraint, was asked outside the quarter-pole, gained ground into the final furlong, altered course to the outside of
two foes outside the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the show while lacking the needed kick late. ENDURINGLY went around the first turn in the two path,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, was carried four wide into the stretch and tired. DUPLICITOUS broke out at the start,
was taken in hand then moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back of the field, saved ground while roused on the far
turn and failed to respond. MAGA SUITE brushed with a foe early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three wide on
the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS was bumped at the break, settled off the leading quartet racing in the clear and off the inside, went in the three to five path on the
turn, came out a bit wider into upper stretch, hooked up with a rival near the furlong marker then drew clear under urging. REBECCAS TRUTH bumped the
inside rival at the start, stalked from outside going in the four to five path through the turn, bid for a narrow brief lead in upper- to mid-stretch but was no
match for the winner while clear of the rest. STARS FOREVER was kept wide up the back stretch while contending for the lead, went in the four path well
removed from the inside through the turn, lacked the needed late kick. HANGING LAKE was last but one early, went in the three path through the turn,
shifted in to the rail in the stretch and improved position inside rivals late. SWEET AMELIA exchanged a very light brush at the break, was unhurried early,
raced inside on the turn, shifted out in the stretch and gained a bit late. SWEET PRAYERS exchanged a light brush at the break, set the tempo inside on or
just off the rail on the turn while shadowed by a far outside rival, came out turning for home, drifted about a bit in mid-stretch while weakening.
CARONDELET exchanged some brushes at the start, tracked the leaders just off the inside going in the two path on the turn, altered outside a drifting rival
about mid-stretch and was empty.
