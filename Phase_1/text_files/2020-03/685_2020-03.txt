Footnotes
I'M AN EIGHT was never far off the pace, rallied on the turn, angled out for the drive, bid six wide, wore down his rivals and got up a the wire. DEMERARA
got away well to set a pressured pace, inched clear in the upper stretch and was caught at the wire. XTREME LYRA was taken off the rail, pressed the
pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, went willingly to the wire and earned show. SIX POINT RACK stalked inside and got boxed in along the
backstretch, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide, closed steadily and was gaining late. HE'S MUNNIE stalked the pace, fell back entering the turn, went
eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed well in a steady effort. RAOFTHESUN advanced to the second turn, bid inside to loom a threat, hung late and
fell back. SATURDAY SHOCKWAVE was unhurried early and trailed the field, bid along the rail on the turn and lacked a response. SAND HARBOR was
through after a half. NUDIAMOND was outrun in an even effort. Hand timed.

Footnotes
CALL YOUR BLUFF pressed the pace, was carried out on the turn, closed steadily and drew off past the sixteenth pole. HAPPY MARGARITA set the pace,
bore out on the turn, fell back, came again to vie and was outclosed to finish second best. SOPHIE T was void of early speed, angled out to be widest in the
drive and finished well to get up for show. APRIL'S LADY DI was never far back, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the needed late
response. DEVIL'S WILDCAT pressed the pace while racing inside, assumed command on the turn, inched clear and faltered near the sixteenth pole.
CHARMING JILLY B failed to respond. BANDOLERA'S GOLD showed speed to the turn and stopped. BRIARTIC GAL was eased and vanned off.

COSA NOSTRA (IRE) advanced to the turn, fell back entering the stretch, closed under strong urging and got up late. IRISH CHARLIE raced close to the
pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outnodded to just miss. MEET JOE set the pace, responded when challenged
to duel, faltered near the sixteenth pole and settled for show. PARKING PERMIT was never far back, put in a steady effort and improved position. UNION
STATION raced in the back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. ROCKET SHIP was fractious in the gate, raced mid pack in
an even effort and failed to menace. OUT FOR JUSTICE showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. LUCKY GENERAL was fractious in the gate,
trailed the field and lacked a response.

SOUGHT MORE PEP settled off the pace, rallied into the turn to challenge, drew off in the upper stretch for a clear lead and held off the late charge of IF
YOU WANT IT. IF YOU WANT IT stumbled at the start, raced in the back, rallied around the turn, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. WINNER'S
DREAM advanced to the turn, bid five wide, lacked the needed rally and settled for show. MY EXPRESSION raced mid pack and improved position in a
steady effort. FLASHY GOLD was unhurried early, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. MRS TAYLOR set the pace to the second turn and flattened out.
BEEJAYSBAR saved ground while racing close to the pace, bid and came up empty. SASSY MISS was through early and not urged through the stretch.
DESTINY'S STORM pulled up and was vanned off.
