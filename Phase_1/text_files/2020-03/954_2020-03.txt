Footnotes
OH NO WATA dueled three wide outside TIAGO'S SONG, wrested command inside the furlong grounds then edged away late under left handed rousing.
PROUD MARI edged up between foes early and stalked the pace, eased back off rivals nearing the turn, angled out, ranged up four wide approaching the
stretch, churned on willingly and nabbed the place in the final yards. TIAGO'S SONG was nudged to the front and gained a slim early advantage, dueled in
the two path and to the inside of the winner around the turn, maintained a short lead to mid stretch, weakened and lost the place. STAUNCH ELABORATOR
broke inward and was away slowly, advanced while saving ground into the turn, eased out soon after, moved up three wide into lane, swung out past the
three sixteenths and closed steadily. SMOKIN SHEETS , three to four wide pursuing the pace, offered a mild response but failed to seriously threaten. TELL
ME BOO BOO saved ground chasing the pace, raced in range to upper stretch and faded. OLIVE COUNTY hopped at the break to be away slowly, veered
out soon after, corrected and raced well back, angled out in the drive and had a belated gain.

Footnotes
PATRIOT vied early inside, eased back off the leader leaving the three eighths, angled out and rebid entering the lane, kicked clear under a drive past the
furlong grounds then held firm. SEAHAWK WAVE was bumped at the break, hustled up between rivals to stalk, shifted four wide for the drive and kept on
willingly. GINGE , four to five wide stalking the pace, ranged up to loom boldly soon into the lane but failed to seriously sustain. NOT TODAY ALFIE ,
bumped at the start, stalked the pace, angled out entering the stretch and churned on. PHELPS broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, eased out
nearing mid stretch and offered a belated kick. TALK GRUFF lagged under a ride, saved ground into the lane, continued inside past mid stretch angled out
late and had some interest. ROCKIN ROG came out at the break and bumped with a rival, vied outside a foe, cleared two wide past the three eighths, was
collared in upper stretch, kept on past mid stretch then faded. ATOMIC CANDY , four wide, was not a factor. RAPID IMPULSE , between foes leaving the
far turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
JAZZ MUSIC had speed outside foes, moved clear into the turn, set a rated pace three wide, drifted out a bit while being set down in upper stretch, kept on
under drive past the furlong grounds, remained on the left lead and held sway. RECORDER , in the clear chasing past the three eighths, edged up between
foes near mid stretch, continued willingly and grabbed the place to the inside of horses. CAT'S AMERICAN PIE stalked the winner four wide, was under
pressure in upper stretch and hung. GAMBLER broke a step slow, steadied when saving ground near the three eighths, came off the inside soon after,
worked outward in the drive and closed steadily. RUBBER BANDMAN broke slowly, was under a ride four to five past the five sixteenths and kept on with
some interest. HOT FUDGE LOUIE drifted out at the start, stalked inside, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. EUROEAST , away alertly, gave early
chase off the rail, dropped back leaving the far turn, came three wide for the drive but lacked a response.

Footnotes
HUSHED , with the pace three wide and between rivals, moved to short lead leaving the far turn, edged clear under nice handling past the five sixteenths,
spurted away after being set down soon into the stretch, remained on her left and held sway under steady handling. PORSUMSUGARONME lacked speed,
saved ground mid turn, eased out into the lane, leveled off past mid stretch, split rivals with about a sixteenth remaining and finished well to quickly gain.
SUTER SLEW , in the clear and off the inside nearing the turn, swung six to seven wide for the drive and rallied mildly. FINE CUT DIAMOND broke a step
slowly, quickly recovered and took aim off a contested early pace, angled five wide nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on past the eighth pole and faded.
BROWNWOOD vied two wide between runners early on, chased around the turn and came up empty. DREAM NURSE attended the pace four deep into the
turn, forced the issue under pressure past the five sixteenths and gave way. MOMMA D'S RIVER failed to menace. LG SHEZA RANDOMCAT disputed the
pace inside a trio of runners, stayed on to about mid turn then gave way.

Footnotes
QUICKSILVER steadied at the break, regrouped, moved up off the rail mid turn, split rivals near the quarter pole, shifted out four wide, surged to command
near mid stretch and eagerly widened under a drive. MICKEY THE MOOCHER prompted the pace while saving ground, eased out around the turn, bid
between foes soon into the lane and kept on willingly to be second best. SPECTACTICAL chased four wide and had a mild response. SMOKIN B, off slowly
when steadied and forced out, lagged off the pace, picked up steam three wide into the stretch, swung out and finished with good energy. LITTLE
AVENGER bobbled at the start, chased inside, dropped back mid turn, angled out in the drive and kept on willingly. ROCK PACHE bore out at the break,
corrected and vied inside a rival early on, chased around the turn, stayed willingly to upper stretch then faded. TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN bid outside the
leader early on, shook clear mid turn, shifted in and tired leaving the three sixteenths. FLAT OUT MINE rushed early early, chased four wide and faltered.

response. DOCTOR HENNY , four deep forcing the issue into the turn, pressed three wide between rivals past the five sixteenths then gave way through

Footnotes
KNOX COURT cleared early, dictated the pace two wide, responded when set down in upper stretch, switched over to the left near the sixteenth pole then
held sway under a drive. SILVER LUKE SILVER , three deep around the turn, finished well. NACOGDOCHES broke a bit slow, edged up saving ground into
the turn, angled four to five wide and had a mild run. INCLUSIVELY stalked the pace between rivals and faded. EYE CLOUD , four to five wide, was not a
factor. HANDSOME TRAVELER tracked the pace while saving ground, failed to kick on under pressure in upper stretch and gave way. SINFUL MOVES
gave early pursuit and tired.

Footnotes
OKIE QUEEN , away in good order, disputed the pace outside EUROMANDY while under confident handling, spurted clear into the lane, opened up in mid
stretch and held firm while under steady hand pressure the final yards. BRIGHT BLING stalked the dueling leaders, was under pressure four wide into the
lane, stayed willingly and saved the place. KEENA , five wide outside rivals nearing the turn, shifted out a bit wider for the drive and churned on with interest.
BREW CASA , four wide between runners heading to the turn, swung wider in upper stretch and had a mild kick. EUROMANDY was hard used and gained
a short lead leaving the chute, was hounded by the winner through the opening three and a half furlongs, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded.
FLYRTIE ROCKETTE , well back for a half, swung very wide entering the lane and had belated interest. DIAMOND LEGACY failed to menace. BETWEEN
THE ARCHES , urged along chasing two wide, weakened through the drive. POLLY TIZ saved ground, raced in range to the three eighths then faltered.
SHEZA HOT FLASH , in close at the break, raced three to four wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
BURGAMEISTER , fought rating mid way on the first turn, relaxed better past the three quarter pole while about five wide, moved up into far turn, bid
outside the leader past the five sixteenths, assumed command entering the stretch and steadily widened under a drive in the final furlong. FAR OUT
KAILEE prompted the pace, bid between foes nearing the half mile marker, dueled on a short lead past the three eighths, battled inside rivals past the
quarter pole, failed to match strides past mid stretch but kept on gamely for the place. BEN'S MAGIC STONE , four wide early, ranged up and bid three
deep heading to the far turn, briefly led, sparred between runners while under pressure past the five sixteenths then faded in the final furlong. SMOK'N
POLICY , in clear off the inside, moved up four to five wide into the far turn, chased and kept trying. FUSAICHI FLAME broke slowly, rushed up towards the
rail nearing the half mile pole, dropped back leaving the far turn, angled out into the lane, shifted back in and had some late action. INGE saved some
ground into the backstretch, edged up then steadied when in close around the far turn, shifted wide, circled into the lane but lacked a solid recovery. COOK ,
unhurried early, came under a ride near the three eighths, raced wide in upper stretch but lacked a rally. INDY PIRATE stalked off the rail, raced three wide
between foes near the half mile pole then gave way. STANTON C was outrun. SLEWA RED was sent to command heading to the first turn, set the pace
towards the inside, took pressure into the far turn and faltered.
