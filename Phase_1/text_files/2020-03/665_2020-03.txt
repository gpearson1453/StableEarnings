Footnotes
AT THE BEACH broke in at the start then cleared on top and led the way around the first turn, set the pace then raced under pressure late backstretch,
dueled for the lead racing inside of foes around the far turn, repelled challengers then quickly came under attack from rail running FAYEZ top of the lane,
fought back gamely under strong handling racing in two path, took on the added outside challenge of CUY, battled back gamely between and refused to let
rivals by. CUY steadied a step out and lost ground on the field, hustled up then drifted about six paths wide entering the first turn, was a bit keen and
appeared to be fighting the bit then made a mid-race move and gained closer contention, circled up closer late far turn then was set down for the drive,
moved up to duel three deep for the late lead, dug in gamely but lacked the surge to get by the winner. FAYEZ tracked the pace along the inside down the
backstretch and continued inside around the far turn, moved up the rail entering top stretch and began to battle for the lead with AT THE BEACH, raced in
tight quarters along the rail, got brushed and touched the rail but game rider never stopped riding and kept on gamely bogged down along the rail.
SHANGASSAH raced off the pace down the backstretch and continued near the rear while ridden along around the far turn, swung out wider entering top
stretch and produced a mild rally. STILL SCHEMIN advanced a bit closer near the mid-way point, was set down for the drive two to three wide at head of the
lane, raced in a contending position a furlong out then yielded. RAPSTOREROCKS slightly bumped at the start then secured inside position around the first
turn, steadied early backstretch and raced off the pace, was under a drive five wide top of the lane, began to advance closer but got in tight behind BERRY
HILL, steadied then continued with a mild gain. CAB BEEF raced off the pace down the backstretch, roused five to six wide in stretch run and needed more
for late impact. BERRY HILL raced four paths wide entering the first turn, stalked in close range down the backstretch, dueled three wide for the lead around
the far turn then gave way upper stretch. TEMPESTA raced near midpack near the inside, saved ground around the far turn then steadily weakened in the
lane. MONETIZED was forwardly placed off the leader around the first turn, stalked rival then applied pressure to foe late backstretch, briefly vied for the
lead around the far turn, failed to maintain equals terms and weakened out of the turn. PROUD COUNTRY raced in the back, stayed five wide and failed to
move into contention. STORMY SPLASH raced off the pace then left the far turn racing wide and had no late response. THE RIDER OF #7 FAYEZ
LODGED A CLAIM AGAINST #9 AT THE BEACH FOR INTERFERENCE IN STRETCH RUN, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTON WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
QUEEN ABARRIO brushed the left side of gate spotting the field a couple lengths at the start, knifed between horses moving up early, continued her
advance four wide past the three-eighths, collared MYSTIC COMIN HOME from outside turning for home and drove clear. MYSTIC COMIN HOME sped
clear early and moved inside, tried to fight back inside QUEEN ABARRIO past the quarter-pole, yielded with a furlong remaining and just saved the place.
MARKISTAN chased outside the pacesetter into the turn, lost some ground to the top two after a half-mile, and ran on with good courage narrowly missing
second. SMITTEN FOR SMITTY saved ground to the stretch, and finished evenly in the two-path without changing leads. HONEST GAL brushed with
LOVE OF GLORY through the opening strides, then bumped with that foe, chased three wide into the turn and faded after a half-mile. ZANGARVA was well
back in the three-path approaching the stretch, and could not gain. C EST FAST saved ground into the lane and made no impact. I'M A GINGER brushed
with LOVE OF GLORY at the start, then bumped with that rival soon after, and dropped back four wide around the turn. LOVE OF GLORY was brushed
between HONEST GAL and I'M A GINGER at the break, then got bounced around between those two shortly after, and retired early three wide.
BRATOUTTAHELL dropped back inside around the turn, and was not pressed when hopelessly far behind.

COMBINATION raced off the clear top pair near the half mile and hustled along in steady pursuit around the turn, swung a bit wide entering top stretch,
continued to gather momentum under steady pressure, closed with a sharp kick and prevailed in final stride. TRAVY BOY broke sharply from the gate and
quickly cleared on top, took on the challenged from SWAGGER at the half mile marker, vied for the lead always maintaining a slight edge over foe then
shook clear late turn, kept on determinedly in stretch run but got nailed when rival edged by in final stride, game try. SWAGGER chased after the quick
footed leader and reached rival near the half mile marker, dueled for the lead with TRAVY BOY to the quarter pole then failed to move on with rival,
weakened but held on for a share. ARRIVEDERLA steadied a step out then hustled along near the inside through early stages, continued a bid while well off
the pace entering the turn, pushed on through the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. DROP KICK raced widest in the back through early
stages, continued a wide bid into the lane and gained a couple spots without threatening. RAY'SWARRIOR raced off the speed, hustled along under steady
urging into stretch run and lacked a needed rally for impact. BORDINI was the closest pursuer of the clear top pair nearing the half mile marker, coaxed
along the inside around the turn, came out a couple paths top stretch then steadily faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SUMMER SANGRIA sped to the front at the start, rated along inside for three furlongs, shook off TRULY AMBITIOUS turning for home and drew away
under a mild drive. MYFIRSTEXWIFE broke out bumping SHELL BEACH PARTY, waited behind the leaders just off the rail past the quarter-pole, stayed
inside for the drive and held second late. ROYAL JEWEL stumbled breaking inward and bumping TRULY AMBITIOUS at the start, chased outside the
leaders three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed late bid. SHELL BEACH PARTY was bumped between MYFIRSTEXWIFE and TRULY
AMBITIOUS at the start, angled out leaving the turn and improved mildly. AZTEC MOON raced four wide around the turn losing ground to the leaders, and
could not gain in the stretch. TRULY AMBITIOUS got sandwiched at the start between SHELL BEACH PARTY and ROYAL JEWEL, pressed the winner
from outside for three-eighths of a mile and gave way. CAPTURED LIGHT was outrun inside. JUST LIKE INDY was slow into stride, and always outrun.
SICK SOCIETY broke slowly, and was far back throughout.

HIDDEN SCROLL slightly bobbled a step out of the gate then held a slim lead over UNPUBLISHED at the half mile marker, moved away on top then turned
back the bid from LORD ADARE near three eighths pole, widen advantage still unasked around the turn, saved ground entering the stretch run and
continued to pull away in hand. NOON TIME GEM raced in range along the inside in opening quarter then coaxed along two wide around the turn, continued
two path with response and edged out rival for the runner up spot. KINGSVILLE raced along the rail in early stages then switched out and hustled along five
wide in the drive, stayed on with response and got edged late for place. UNPUBLISHED held a slim lead out of the gate, briefly raced near equal terms with
HIDDEN SCROLL going by the half mile marker, could not move on with rival entering the turn and steadily weakened. STEALTH dwelt at the start, trailed
the field and saved ground to no avail. LORD ADARE raced in range in opening stages then moved up to race just off HIDDEN SCROLL at three eighths
pole, was no match for rival and steadily faded. VITA DOLCE hustled long but lacked the needed kick to race in close range, moved through the backstretch
three to four wide then drifted out wide around the turn and failed to factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE
RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FOUR GRACES was sent up along the rail early, poked a head in front of MYLASTFIRSTKISS after a quarter-mile, shrugged off that one as well as
GIBBERISH and SKINNY DIP through the run around the turn, and was under a mild drive to remain clear late. ESTILO TALENTOSO went along in a good
spot perched behind the leading foursome around the turn, swung four wide rallying into the stretch, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best.
MYLASTFIRSTKISS grabbed the early lead, was joined from the inside by FOUR GRACES midway up the backstretch, stayed close between horses
around the turn, moved to the rail unable to keep up with the top two, and ran on to salvage the show. GIBBERISH pressed the pace three then two wide
between horses to the top of the stretch, and weakened. SKINNY DIP banged into the left side of the gate at the start, gave chase four wide outside the
leaders for a half-mile, and faded through the stretch. STRIKING BEAUTY was outsprinted early, came under some urging three wide up the backstretch,
and offered little. TIZNOISE trailed to the stretch, and continued to fall farther behind despite urging.

Footnotes
OPRY disputed the pace to the first turn then lead way into the backstretch, continued on top with a length advantage and held firm still unleashed along
inside around the far turn, roused for more entering the lane, stayed sharp in response under steady pressure, continued to turn back bids through the lane
and kept clear. BOURBON IN MAY was unhurried in opening stages and continued in the back along the outside down the backstretch, picked up the pace
entering the far turn, swung into action entering top stretch and rallied up to gain the runner up spot. ROAD TO MEATH disputed the pace going by the wire
for the first time then edged back and stalked the leader down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for command around the far turn, advanced to race
in striking distance a furlong out but lacked the needed surge to get by. COUNTER OFFER secured inside position around the first turn, stalked along the
rail to the far turn, hustled up along the inside then switched out top of the lane, advanced to race in striking range a furlong out then yielded in late stages.
SURF AND TURF was a step awkward and came away last at the start the angled in and saved ground on first turn, settled off the early pace the picked up
the pace along the inside on the far turn, gained ground upper stretch but failed to sustain and flattened out. MOTATAABEQ raced in range and tracked the
pace down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
AREYOUTALKINGTOME lagged far back toward the inside for a half-mile, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, rallied late between horses and
was up in time. KAREN'S COVE got bumped into DR HARLAN by ZALZA at the start, advanced three wide to get behind the leaders past the quarter-pole,
split horses rallying in mid stretch, dueled late inside the winner and DESERT GENERAL, and edged the latter for second. DESERT GENERAL raced close
up four wide into the turn, lodged a bid at the top of the stretch, came away with a short lead through the furlong grounds but was outdueled between the top
two through the closing yards. DR HARLAN was bumped by KAREN'S COVE and steadied back at the start, advanced steadily after a half-mile, circled six
or seven wide into the lane looming a threat, then flattened out in the last sixteenth outside the top trio. STEADY EARNER raced far back to the stretch
three wide, and improved past tired horses while not a threat. CHARGE CARD settled in midpack early, came five wide off the turn and lacked the needed
response on the wrong lead. JAMAICAN stalked the leaders three wide into the turn, challenged in the two-path at the top of the stretch, but could not
sustain the rally and gave way. PACHANGA PARTY vied outside STOLEN IDENTITY early, moved to the rail around the turn, and weakened at the top of
the lane. AVAST MATEY hopped at the start to get away slowly, and was outrun four wide. OSKAR BLUES failed to factor, had the rider dismount soon
after the finish, and was walked off. ZALZA broke in bumping KAREN'S COVE into DR HARLAN, stayed in range for a half two wide, and tired. STOLEN
IDENTITY hustled up after the start to vie for command inside PACHANGA PARTY, and was finished before going a half.

Footnotes
MALIBU MUSIC hustled up away from the gate and near mid-range heading into the first turn, rated three to four wide down the backstretch then launched
a four wide bid around the final turn, kept under a rode into the lane, was forced to alter a path near the furlong marker then kicked by and held firm. A I
INITIATIVE was unhurried and settled near the inside through early stages, picked up the pace and shifted out on the far turn, raced seven to eight paths
wide at head of the lane, switched in a few paths while continuing to gain, roused forward into striking distance of the leader nearing the wire but could not
get to game winner. PREACHER MARSEE steadily advanced into closer contention moving through the backstretch, loomed a danger racing three wide at
the quarter pole then came out wide entering top stretch, lost position then drifted in a few paths and stayed on with response to re-gain a share. KING OF
LEINSTER (IRE) took the lead entering the first turn and angled inside, set a sharp pace through early stages, took on the challenged from SKY D late far
turn, dueled into stretch run, fought back at the furlong marker then had no kick left in late reserve and gave way. SKY D commenced well from the widest
position and angled inside on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch then moved up and challenged KING OF LEINSTER for the lead late far
turn, dueled into stretch run then faded In late stages. DING DONG DITCH settled near the inside through early stages, launched a two wide bid on the final
turn, moved into closer contention near the inside then steadied slightly near the furlong marker and gave way. STUCK WITH YOU was unhurried and raced
in the back, hustled along on the final turn then raced wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally for impact. MON CHEVALIER bumped the gate at the
start, wad unhurried and raced in the last flight, prompted two path on the final turn then drifted out five wide upper stretch and failed to gain a threatening
position. GONE DIESEL tracked the pace along the rail down the backstretch then came up empty on the final turn. GUESS FIRST was forwardly placed
around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch then retreated on the final turn.

Footnotes
MILLIONAIRE RUNNER was far back for a half-mile, advanced in the two-path around the turn, rallied outside the leaders being flashed the whip entering
the final furlong, reached the front a sixteenth out and drew away on the wrong lead wrapped up late. RATTLE'M broke out nudging ORGANIC JENNY at
the start, dueled for command outside QUALITY SPECIAL most of the way, and held stubbornly to best that one for second.. QUALITY SPECIAL vied
inside RATTLE'M from the outset, fought on to deep stretch and yielded the place grudgingly. FALSE ACCUSATION went along in the middle of the pack
early, came four wide off the turn and finished evenly between horses. SKY POINT advanced four then five wide on the turn, and needed more outside
through the lane. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) saved ground from the outset, and weakened after six furlongs. CAPE MARCO DRIVE was no factor two then
three wide. ORGANIC JENNY received a light bump from RATTLE'M at the start, and was outrun inside. TANGIBLE had aim outside the leaders for six
furlongs, and faltered in the stretch. LAWYER DRILL showed speed outside the leaders up the backstretch, and dropped back between horses approaching
the turn. FIVES WILD weakened on the turn, drifted way wide being eased up into the lane, and walked off.

angled inside leaving the turn and advanced up the inside with KING OF RANCH racing in tandem, got brushed by rival near the furlong marker then took a
slim lead, drifted out under right handed pressure which forced close running KING OF RANCH wider then held firm. KING OF RANCH was the closest
pursuer of the double-digit leader down the backstretch, launched a two wide around the final turn, closed the gap on clear leader and hustled along under
firm right handed pressure entering the lane, gained while racing in tandem with CASTANGO then switched in a path near the furlong marker and brushed

into the backstretch, led the way double digits and set a fast pace, the lead began to shorten around the final turn then got collared past the eighth pole, was
all out but continued to put in effort. HANDSOME LIL DEVIL saved ground around the first turn then settled and saved ground through the backstretch and

Footnotes
KATIELEIGH sprinted clear early, rated along in command for six furlongs, dug in when confronted by WHISKARITA in upper stretch, and battled gamely
through a long drive to prevail in a head bob. WHISKARITA went along isolated tracking the leader from the start, ranged up to challenge after straightening
away for the drive, reached even terms with 50 yards remaining and just missed. ELITE APPEAL advanced two wide after six furlongs, shifted out with dead
aim outside the battling leaders through mid stretch, could not gain late and just saved the show. BARBADOLLA bumped solidly with FOR KICKS at the
start and was far back early inside, moved out three wide advancing off the far turn, and rallied late outside the leaders. FOR KICKS was sandwiched
between BARBADOLLA and MARGIE MUSIC and checked at the start, raced far back inside for six furlongs, moved out a bit in the stretch and improved
position. NOBLE INTENTIONS advanced under urging to loom a threat three wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. STATED became keyed
up under restraint entering the backstretch in the four-path, stayed three or four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. GET REWARDED broke in
bumping MARGIE MUSIC solidly at the start, advanced four wide early up the backstretch, but made no further headway. RECESS was never prominent
while three wide to late on the far turn. GREY MANNERS stayed in range early inside, and lacked a response on the rail. TELL ME MAUX went three wide
into the far turn in the second flight, and dropped back. MARGIE MUSIC got sandwiched and steadied between FOR KICKS and GET REWARDED at the
start, and was always far back.
