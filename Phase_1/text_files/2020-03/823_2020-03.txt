Footnotes
CAUSE broke on top, reclaimed the advantage after getting necked by LONG ISLAND CITY on the backstretch, was being held in reserve opening things
up from the two path during the run around the bend, was coming up to the three-sixteenths marker when given his cue, began the final furlong in
possession of its largest lead, squandered some of it, but held sway. DANEGELD bumped with SHADOW CASTER in the shadow of the starting gate, took
up position in midpack, stepped onto the turn from the four path, got angled one wider during the early stages of the stretch run, chipped away at the deficit,
but all done with posing a serious danger. LONG ISLAND CITY rushed up the rail to briefly confront the winner, tipped into path two after getting flicked off,
haplessly watched that opponent draw well clear during the setting of the next split, got set down in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, commenced
the stretch from the three path, got outkicked. EMCEE PRIME checked on the backstretch, underwent a two pursuit on the turn, was just as wide spinning
into the lane, made no headway. DUTCHMEN FOREVER three wide entering the turn, was four wide exiting it, lacked the needed response. KID
CHOCOLATE mostly along the inside route for the opening half, was more in the two path at the head of the stretch, made no impact. VON ALDENBRUCK
chased the pace three wide, shifted six wide down the lane backing away. SHADOW CASTER strung out four wide on the turn, had no rally.

Footnotes
VIBRANCY three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the
eighth pole, dug in under threat to the finish and prevailed gamely at the end. MAKE OR BREAK broke out at the start, chased five paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong threatening latched on to the outside but was ultimately repelled to the wire. BECKY'S MISSION broke out at the start, chased just
off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. HOT LITTLE HONEY showed the way pulling a bit eager while under a rating hold
three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path given some rein to work with into the turn and slipped away through the bend, got let out
spinning three wide into upper stretch, lugged in a path straightened away, got collared near the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. ALL ABOUT
REYANA chased two then three wide before tipping four wide at the three-eighths put to coaxing, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CRYPTOGRAPHER stalked the pace from the three path, challenged in earnest spinning into the lane, wrested away the advantage at the furlong grounds,
felt the presence of the runner up late, but held well to stay in the clear. VALID QUEST tracked the pace from the pocket, rated along during the initial
stages, swung four wide into the stretch, straightened away and rallied for the place. FUTURE BOOK hustled from the gate, remained under such vigorous
handling for the opening panel, was switched over to milder hand urging after successfully claiming the top, showed the way from along the inside route,
with the winner in accompaniment one path farther off the rail, was put to the test by that one entering the stretch, relinquished then weakened. DAN THE
MAN CAN took up the chase three wide on the turn, moved out into path four for the drive home, had no offering. JUDITHS COUGAR sighted two wide on
the turn, was never in it. STONE GUITAR chased the pace from the two path, was through after going a half.

TIMELY TRADITION along the inside early on, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command nearing the
sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. LETMETAKETHISCALL broke out at the start bumping PEACHES AND SPICE, established the
front and showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused at the eighth pole coming under growing
threat for the initial time, dug in under a drive and was collared nearing the sixteenth marker, kept on clear for the place honors. BUSTIN TO PLEASE broke
in at the start bumping PEACHES AND SPICE, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top pair while running on to just procure the show honors on the wire. ARCHUMYBABY four then three wide in pursuit, got
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. FIRST FOREVER chased four paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside for home and tired.
PEACHES AND SPICE got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ELLA'S SONG
broke out at the start and was corrected, showed brief speed seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths and retreated, went six to seven wide into upper stretch before folding in the stretch.

Footnotes
SLASH GORDON sparred for the top from the two path, got roused coming into the lane, battled onward locked up a spirited tussle with MICROSECOND,
gamely won the bob at the wire. MICROSECOND fractious coming onto the track, left the post parade early, proceeded to out-break the competition by a
narrow margin, got hooked up a duel with the winner right afterwards, raced as a team with that rival all throughout the initial half, clinging to a slim lead,
was put to a drive for the drive home, remained determined to the end kept to strong handling, but got nipped. STASH MY MONEY moved over towards the
inside, loosely drafted behind the winner, got called upon for more in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, was maneuvered to the outside entering the
stretch, eventually getting worked into the five path for optimal clearance, closed in, fell short. SARATOGA PAL came in sharply losing his footing springing
from the starting gate, got going in short order, travelled three wide on the turn, was put to a drive as the half was being completed, gradually made its way
into path six in the lane, narrowed in in a steadfast manner en route for the last major check. DEVIL'S CODE pocketed keeping watch on the disputed pace,
got let loose approaching the quarter pole, came up empty. GANONDAGAN two wide stepping onto the turn, was about as wide exiting it, lacked the
necessary response. BOOK OF DELANCEY spotted along the inside route by the conclusion of the backstretch, trailed throughout.

OUR LAST BUCK four wide just off the duel in front down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, emerged head to head with the runner up
through the latter portion of the bend, got set down taking over the front four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BEBE BANKER
dueled three then two wide with TIZ MORNING to his inside down the backstretch to the midway point on the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths confronted by the aforementioned foe, got headed spinning just off the inside for home, ran on to chase that rival home well clear of the rest
and along second best. SOUL FIGHT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved
position to secure the show honors. TIZ MORNING dueled from the two path with BEBE BANKER to his outside, tucked to the rail half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths and was shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. Following a
shoe repair in the paddock, SNEADS showed brief speed just off the inside down the backstretch until nearing the half mile pole, faded into and through the
turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. AWESOME ADVERSARY chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went four wide for home and tired. QUIET OUT EAST
chased four to five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung five wide into upper stretch, tired. MY AMANJENA six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, angled six to seven wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
FREEDOM PRINCE gradually moved over to the inside route, vied to maintain control matched up with SCORESWHENHEWANTS, raced side by side with
that opponent, with the pilots of each holding something in reserve, all this starkly contrasting the drives the remaining foursome were under by this juncture,
saw his fellow pace combatant fall back suddenly after appearing to take a bad step in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, settled into upper now
in possession of a comfortable advantage and got switched over to stronger handling, emerged at the eighth pole leading by his largest margin, squandered
a good chunk of it afterwards but preserved the decision. HIGH AMPLITUDE forwardly placed from off the inside, was approximately two wide when set
down to a long hard drive the top of the turn, got maneuvered one path farther off the rail between the midway point and the five-sixteenths pole, narrowly
avoided contact with the troubled SCORESWHENHEWANTS late on the turn, stepped into the stretch, gained late en route to nailing down place honors.
FLYING CURLIN failed to muster up a stretch response following a ground-saving journey. HERSH took up the chase from the two path on the turn, was
called upon for more after about halfway around the bend, fanned out into path five during the stretch run, made no impact. SHADOW RIDER raced
sluggishly after getting off to a stutter-step start, departed the backstretch from the three path, was soon put to a drive, was induced into taking the five path
for entrance into the stretch after the incident late on the turn, failed to fire appreciably. SCORESWHENHEWANTS sparred for the top from the two path,
became unhitched from the winner after seemingly taking a bad step at the five-sixteenths pole, fell back abruptly having lost his best action and with the
rider displaying professionalism pulling up the mount, was indeed pulled up a short distance from the quarter pole, then after being examined by a track side
veterinarian, was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
DREAM BIGGER broke in at the start and was corrected coming under coaxing to be forwardly placed, knocked heads down the backstretch with SCILLY
CAY to the outside, steadily shook off that rival near the midway point on the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch let out for the drive, drew off under a drive to the finish to prevail. MORE GRAYTFUL broke out at the start bumping BOURBON BAY before
taking over his lane, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to safely preserve the place honors. BOURBON BAY got bumped at the start by MORE GRAYTFUL breaking outwards and was taken in hand
behind that rival shortly after conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and improved position in the late stages to be along clear for the show honors. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS chased four to five wide coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, went four wide into upper stretch and tired. TITAN'S WILL coaxed from the gate, chased five then six wide coaxed
along at the seven-sixteenths, angled in to spin three wide for home, made no impact. SCILLY CAY coaxed from the gate, dueled three then four wide with
DREAM BIGGER to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
GANDY DANCING bumped lightly with rivals from each side at the start, got going into stride in short order, raced from off the inside throughout, closed the
gap travelling in path three on the turn, was put to a strong right getting steered four wide into the stretch, straightened away and was given his cue in the
general area of the three-sixteenths marker, responded eagerly, taking charge in no time, drew off smartly, kept to some encouragement. FARRAGUT took
up the chase from path two on the turn, was let loose entering the stretch, made his way towards path six while rallying for the place. SENRIMA proceeded
along sluggishly after some contact with the winner in the shadow of the gate, was almost a sixteenth into the contest before settling into stride, cut over to
the rail, rode it to the end of the bend, was moved to the outside during the stretch run, winding up approximately five wide, closed in to get up for the show.
UNBRIDLED JOHN brushed with the top shortly after the start, got guided over to the inside, was just off the rail loosely drafting behind MIDNIGHT
WHISKEY on the turn, got let out a notch a short distance from the quarter pole, swung towards the outside once into the stretch, left midlane about five
wide, flattened out. NOT PHAR NOW disputed the pace from the two path, proved no match once the top one got rolling, gave way in the final furlong.
BLACK IRISH had the pilot take hold after stumbling at the start, dashed over to the rail approaching the half mile pole, cut the corner into the lane, failed to
fire appreciably. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY argued for the lead from just off the inside to upper stretch, faltered. ERNIE BANKER became choppy-gaited
approximately midway on the backstretch, was directed to the outside, fell back readily not being persevered during the run around the bend, got pulled up
as the half was being completed, then was subsequently vanned off.
