Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY settled on the outside, moved in midway down the backstretch, advanced quickly in the two path on the turn then was taken in hand
outside the five-sixteenths, drafted behind horses under restraint late on that bend, was asked at the quarter-pole then found room outside of the fading
pacesetter, rallied to take the lead just inside the furlong marker, drew clear under a solid hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final
three strides while much the best. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG broke out then bumped with foes on both sides, settled off the pace, advanced four wide on
the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. MIDNIGHT BAYOU was bumped at the
start then forced into another rival, raced on the outside under urging, went four to five wide on the turn, advanced nearing the five-sixteenths, chased
outside into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. SHOT ON WINDY HILL broke out and bumped with a rival, showed speed then
switched out midway down the backstretch and tracked the pace, ranged up three wide on the turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, was asked at the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner just inside the furlong marker and tired. BROTHER RICHIE was bumped at
the start and forced out, raced at the rear under urging, steadied when BOOTSIE'S GALAXY came in midway down the backstretch, moved closer while
shifting from the inside to the two path on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TACTICAL PRIORITY was hustled to the
lead, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage near the five-sixteenths, took an awkward stride while dropping back near the quarter-pole and
stopped.

Footnotes
LOGICAL MYTH dropped well behind early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, was roused while two then three wide
on the far turn then put to the whip inside the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, angled out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, rallied on
the outside, closed powerfully to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. SINGAPORE FLASH saved ground on the
first turn, was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn, altered course to the outside from behind foes at the three-sixteenths,
rallied to the lead at the furlong marker, lost the lead shortly thereafter to the winner and was outfinished while clear for the place. CLEAR FOR ACTION
broke a bit awkwardly then went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was headed while asked on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a strong hand
ride then was put to the whip, came off the rail while fighting on well into the final furlong, rubbed saddles with ANTARTIC while dropping back into the final
sixteenth and weakened but just earned the show. ANTARCTIC broke out and hit the gate, went three to four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, took the lead while asked in the two to three path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong, rubbed saddles
with CLEAR FOR ACTION while dropping back into the final furlong and tired then just missed the show. KING OF CANDY came outward at the start, went
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, chased outside into the final furlong and came up
empty. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
CHEERS TO BERTI was just lightly brushed at the break but recovered quickly to stalk the leaders from outside, edged closer three wide late on the turn,
took over just past the quarter pole and was put to a drive, responded and drew clear despite drifting a bit in mid- to late-stretch. WHERE Y'AT JOE JOE
tracked from in behind the leaders off the fence going in the two path through much of the turn moving out a path past the five-sixteenths and a further path
by the top of the stretch, ran on evenly in the stretch to get up for place over BETO, who was bumped lightly at the break, set a pressured pace inside, was
overtaken at the quarter pole, fought on in the stretch but was simply outkicked. BOOTH ROAD SHINE pressed the pace from the outset then applied more
pressure on the turn going two wide outside BETO, was between rivals to bid for the lead at the top of the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. AUTUMN
WARRIOR broke just a bit awkwardly but gained position along the rail tracking the leaders inside, saved ground through the turn to no avail.
ONEHOLYLION was keen in behind a foe along the inside early then moved out and up between rivals but still pulled against restraint, went two wide
through the turn, came out a bit in the stretch but failed to rally. JOHN'S LUCK bumped the outer rival at the start, raced in behind the leading group in the
three path leaving the backstretch, bumped the outside foe at that juncture nearing the seven-sixteenths, soon moved out to the four path and inside a rival
early on the turn, came five wide to the quarter pole and was empty for the drive. MEDIAMAKER was a bit fractious rearing up once in the gate, brushed the
outside rival lightly at the start and was slow into stride, raced outside foes heading up the backstretch and was bumped entering the turn, went four then
soon five wide on that bend coming out six deep into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
CRY LIKE A BABY was away alertly from the outside post, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while outside of two foes on the turn,
drew even with that duo near the five-sixteenths, was asked while in front into the stretch, drifted in under a right-handed whip coming to the furlong marker
and held under strong urging. RIVETRIX was rated just off the pace, steadied briefly leaving the backstretch, drafted two then three wide on the turn, was
asked while four wide into the stretch, chased past the three-sixteenths, made an outside bid passing the eighth-pole, battled with the winner in the final
furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. HERO OF GOLD was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the
rail under urging on the turn, dropped back a bit while under a drive in upper stretch, chased under the whip into the final furlong, paused outside the
sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA bumped lightly with a rival just after the start, was rated just off the
pace, drafted four wide on the turn, was asked while five wide into the stretch and came up empty. KENAI COOL moved up between horses to dispute the
pace, vied in the two path under urging while between foes on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. MY MY MY bumped lightly
with an opponent just after the start then was taken up, settled at the rear, was urged along while three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and
failed to rally while continuing on her inside lead throughout the drive. PAPER DOLL showed early speed, dropped back passing the half-mile pole, fell to
the rear while along the rail on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SOMEKINDAWICKED settled off the pace in the three path through the first turn, continued off the inside and unhurriedly up the backstretch going into the
far turn still in the three path, put to urging at the top of the stretch, was guided in past the three-sixteenths, surged late inside rivals to get up several strides
from home. HOT AND READY stalked the leader from outside in the three path, moved to challenge three wide leaving the far turn taking a narrow lead just
outside the quarter pole, was challenged by an outside rival nearing the furlong grounds, fought back to regain position from that rival but was outkicked by
the inside foe. DISTRACTOR FACTOR exchanged a bump with one foe at the break then was bumped by an outside rival just after, was mildly coaxed
forward and gained stalking position from off the inside going four wide on the first turn, began to edge closer still four wide leaving the far turn, struck a
narrow lead outside the furlong marker, drifted out under a left-handed whip and was outfinished by the top two. GIO ANGEL tucked in and saved ground on
the inside just off the leaders on the first turn, continued to track in behind just off the rail, went in the two path on the far turn, came out a bit into upper
stretch, made a brief bid inside foes near the eighth pole but could not sustain the effort. GOTTABEGOLDEN bumped the inside rivals at the start, raced
toward the rear outside a rival two to three deep through the first turn, still raced toward the back up the backstretch entering the far turn in the three path,
moved out four deep about midway on that bend, swung wider still then moved out in upper stretch to be seven wide by the three-sixteenths and ran on to
improve position. TREFOIL was just off the leaders five wide on the first turn, continued within range five wide and outside on the far turn but came up
empty for the drive. WIND ZEE broke outwardly just a bit, shifted in heading into the first turn racing just off or on the rail through that bend, dropped back to
last early up the backstretch, moved out and entered the far turn trailing and in the four path, passed a couple tired rivals on the stretch. TYPHOON ZING
was urged forward at the start, set the pace inside, was challenged on the far turn and overtaken by the top of the stretch then gave way. SHE'S OUR STAR
broke just a half step slowly then was bumped on both sides and squeezed back at the start, shifted in racing on or just off the rail early, advanced mildly up
the backstretch, saved ground the far turn but had nothing thereafter. (Rail at 27 Feet)

LETITHAPPENCARLOS went straight to the front and set the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was challenged by KNOCKALITTLELOUDER at the
quarter-pole, repelled that foe when asked at the three-sixteenths and drew off under hand urging to win ridden out. HERMANO T K settled between horses
then dropped back near the half-mile pole, moved from four to six wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and got up for the place while no
match for the winner. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER bumped hard with a rival at the start, moved up then tracked the pace on the outside, went around the turn
in the three path, made a bid while asked at the quarter-pole, was turned back by the winner in upper stretch then weakened and was caught for the place
while able to get the show. BET AGAIN broke in then bumped hard with a rival, was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and lacked
the needed response. IZZY'S BABY BOY was bumped hard on both sides at the start then taken up, raced at the rear under urging, went two then three
wide on the turn, dropped in under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MR. PRODUCTION was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back while
inside on the turn and failed to respond. BAYOU BODE was coaxed along on the outside, went four to five wide under stronger encouragement on the turn
and capitulated.

Footnotes
EKATERINOSLAV exchanged light bumps with an outside rival heading into the first turn, raced three to four wide on that bend and outside after the
aforementioned rival moved clear, continued in behind the stablemate three deep into the far turn but soon moved out a path on that bend continuing four
wide, struck the lead about the three-sixteenths and held sway under steady handling. KALININGRAD cleared a foe and moved in a bit to stalk the
pacesetter three wide into and on the first turn, continued just off the leaders into the far turn going three wide on that bend, fought on to gain the place but
did not make late headway on the winner and was second best. SUNRISE KITTEN exchanged a few bumps heading to the first turn, moved clear of rivals
four then three wide on that bend and pressed the pacesetter from outside heading up the backstretch, bid three wide on the far turn taking the lead about
the five-sixteenths, was just clear turning for home but soon collared by other rivals and could not kick on with those. BALLYHACK was bumped around
between rivals and checked at the break spotting the leader about five or six lengths early, raced just off the rail at the rear early, went in the three then four
path on the far turn moving out wider at the top of the stretch then to the eight path by the three-sixteenths, and gained late. IRISH HOKIE broke inwardly
bumping and in return getting bumped by rivals, steadied just slightly to be last but one heading down the home stretch the first time racing just off the fence
in the two to three path through the first turn, moved out a bit late up the backstretch to advance four then five wide on the far turn and reach striking
distance by the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. ARABIAN STORY exchanged repeated bumps at the break, was rank in
behind and between foes into the first turn then steadied easing back from between rivals, continued off the fence in the back-half racing in the two to three
path up the backstretch heading to the far turn, went in the three path on that bend then steadied in behind rivals inside the five-sixteenths, moved out some
turning for home then further still to be seven deep past the three-sixteenths but did not threaten. TAAMER was rank to place in behind rivals along the
inside into and on the first turn while fighting the rider's restraint, saved ground through that bend racing just off the leaders up the backstretch, continued
inside on the far turn then dropped back and faded. TRAELEE cleared the field and moved in to the two path heading into the first turn, set the pace facing
some outside pressure from a rival up the backstretch, was overtaken by that one late on the far turn then gave way and faded. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
CONFEDERATE YELL was hustled from the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn,
took the lead outside the three-sixteenths and drew away under a strong drive. ELLERBE saved ground on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch,
swerved out to avoid an injured foe outside the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide under strong urging on the far turn, passed foes while still on his
inside lead to the sixteenth-pole, switched to the proper lead at that point and safely secured the place. JACOBS FLYER went around the first turn in the two
path, was reserved off the pace, came under urging near the half-mile pole, raced just off the inside early on the far turn, shifted three then four wide later on
that bend, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. THREE RUN HOMER was hustled from the
start, raced in the four path on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace, vied inside on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the
lead outside the three-sixteenths and tired. BAND BOSS was hustled from the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along
while three then four wide on the far turn and came up empty. VICTORY BIND was hustled from the start, went six then five wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging in the three path on the far turn and faltered. THE GLORY MUSIC went two to three wide on the first
turn, was rated just off the pace, had the rider fall back in the saddle leaving the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the far turn and also faltered.
MIKEY'S MOUSE was restless in the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside, swerved out to avoid the injured foe nearing
the seven-sixteenths, went five wide on the far turn and was no factor. MISS YOU JO went three then four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the
outside, took a bad step approaching the seven-sixteenths and was pulled up then vanned off.
