Footnotes
WELLING circled the turn, raced four deep in upper stretch, was brushed by THE CAIRO KID inside the eighth pole then bumped SEA GHOST when
bearing in under right hand whipping about forty yards from the finish. SEA GHOST saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the
stretch, reached contention inside the sixteenth pole then was soundly bumped. THE CAIRO KID , reluctant to load into the starting gate, bobbled then
bumped with CECIL THE LION leaving the starting gate, made the lead about a furlong after the start, set an easy pace around the turn, drifted to the three
path in upper stretch, brushed WELLING when drifting out inside the eighth pole then gave way. CECIL THE LION bumped with THE CAIRO KID when
bearing out leaving the starting gate then was not a factor. LUV THE PAINTER , three deep on the turn, was outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry and an
objection by the rider of SEA GHOST, WELLING was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
CAPE LOOKOUT prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, moved to near even terms after a half mile, wrested command three sixteenths out,
kicked clear soon after, drifted in towards the rail then held sway under left handed pressure. KOSHER KONTRACT flashed speed inside, was shuffled back
a bit heading towards the half mile pole, angled out, circled five wide into the lane, advanced outside rivals in mid stretch and finished up gamely to gain.
ALWAYS FORGIVEN stalked the pace between runners, shifted out some in upper stretch and kept trying to the line. BAPTIZE THE BOY broke awkwardly,
regrouped and chased four wide, was under asking into the lane, raced between foes in mid stretch but came up empty. EL DULCE quickly went clear and
dropped down to the two path to set the pace, was joined mid turn, dueled into the lane, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then gave way. DAPPER MUN
, acting up a bit in the gate, had his head turned as the gates opened, was pinched back soon after and failed to recover. COOL MAN CLETUS stalked the
pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch and faded.

INCUBATOR prompted the pace outside GREEK GOD, moved alongside into the turn, put a head in front while under rating past the three eighths, spurted
away heading to the quarter pole, increased his advantage under solid handling in mid stretch, drifted in a bit and prevailed. ELUSIVE HERO , off the pace
while three deep into the turn, angled four wide approaching the stretch, straightened away, closed steadily through the final furlong and was getting to the
winner. QUIT YOUR MOANIN , in mid pack outside rivals, edged up a bit while three wide into the lane, chased then flattened out in the final furlong.
BLAME THE KIDS , between runners near the three eighths, angled five wide entering the stretch but lacked a solid kick. FREE TO TRUMP chased to the
inside of a rivals into the turn, faded past the three eighths and failed to make a comeback. GROSCO (MEX) stalked off the rail and faded around the turn.
GREEK GOD cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, could not withstand the winner past the three eighths and faltered. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR
broke a step slow, eased back off rivals early on, angled six wide and failed to menace.

WICKED AWESOME , bumped and forced in by ARTFUL SPLATTER leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the
stretch, found ample room inside CONJECTURE to wrest command in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. HELL OF AFIRE lacked speed, was
in the two path on the turn, raced between horses late and passed tired ones. CONJECTURE assumed the early lead, was kept well off the inner rail
throughout and weakened. ARTFUL SPLATTER bumped the winner when bearing in at the break, stalked the pace three deep on the turn and gradually
weakened in the stretch. CARAMEL CREAM , three deep on the turn, fell back through the stretch.

MARYLANDER well rated off of a keen to go OVERBOLD, edged up into the far turn, rolled past three wide and without much asking near the quarter pole,
opened up under left handed encouragement, ducked out briefly near the furlong grounds, was soon corrected and cruised home under a steady hand ride
the final seventy yards. SASSY KING settled off the pace, moved up some three wide into the lane and churned on willingly to gain the place. OVERBOLD ,
keen to go, opened up a lengthy advantage early on, set the pace towards the rail, was reeled in leaving the five sixteenths, was no match for the winner
from there but continued to give effort to the line. MARDEN , off the pace and towards the inside past the five sixteenths, eased out and lacked a solid
stretch response. EGO TRIP , three wide into the first turn, was outrun.

MY QUEEN MICHELLE , well positioned off the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the turn, gained command in upper stretch, drew
off and was kept to her business in the drive. MONEY FROMHEAVEN , rated in the two path on the turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch and
rallied mildly. SALTWORKS lacked speed, circled the turn three deep, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and rallied late. BLACK KETTLE set the pace
near the inner rail and gradually weakened in the drive. SONG OF THE NIGHT prompted the pace outside BLACK KETTLE and gave way in upper stretch.
SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM , a factor along the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, faltered on the turn and was distanced.

ROUGH SEA , jostled at the break, regrouped and was unhurried while saving ground, eased out leaving the half mile marker, edged up behind rivals while
confidently handled past the five sixteenths, found a seam and dropped inside soon into the stretch, closed in under left handed rousing to engage
BENINTENDI, took over from that one inside the furlong marker and drew out under mild encouragement. BENINTENDI grabbed command early and set a
rated pace, handled outside pressure into and around the turn, raced two wide into the lane, could not fend off the rail bid of the winner, faded and just held
for the place. MUNGOJERRIE , with the pace outside a pair of foes, came under a ride mid turn, raced five wide in upper stretch and found a bit more
through the final sixteenth. POPIZAR came in at the break and bumped with the winner, straightened and moved up to gain a stalking spot off the leading
trio, was under a ride saving ground past the five sixteenths, eased out leaving the three sixteenths but failed to generate a solid run. SEANY P forced the
pace between horses, shifted out four wide into the lane then tired through the final furlong. An objection by the rider of POPIZAR against the winner for
alleged interference entering the stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
FENDER BABY accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was kept under pressure in the drive. JOYFUL NOISE , caught in close
quarters leaving the starting gate, was nicely rated along the rail leaving the backstretch, eased out to the four path leaving the turn and rallied outside
horses. PRANK CALL , five deep leaving the backstretch, loomed three wide leaving the turn then flattened out. HIGHLAND LASS , four wide entering the
stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. MY T TALK , steadied when shuffled back leaving the backstretch, raced in the three path between
horses leaving the turn and lacked a rally. LADY KIM , four wide entering the turn, angled to the inner rail in upper stretch and passed faders. CASTLE
RIDGE prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way. SLEWZER , a forward factor in the four path between horses leaving the backstretch, gave
way on the turn.
