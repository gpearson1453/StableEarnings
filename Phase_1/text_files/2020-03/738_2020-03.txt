PARCHED sprinted clear to set the pace, was under pressure late and held well. BOBBY BABY was never far back, raced inside, rallied into the far tk urn to
get within range, closed under steady left handed urging and was gaining late. TIGER BY HIS TAIL was steadied after the start, rallied into the second turn
to loom a threat, had little left, dropped back and settled for show. FAMOUS ROCK STAR chased the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn,
dropped back and gave way. GENTLE PRINCE was checked after the start and trailed the field.

Footnotes
FIERY CAUSE pressed the pace, closed willingly, got up near the sixteenth pole, inched away and just lasted. POCO SUENOS was unhurried early, raced
outside, bid seven wide, closed steadily, was gaining ground and outnodded at the wire. CASHMERE BLISS set the pace past the eighth pole, was unable
to sustain her bid and held for show. YOU GOT THIS was never far back, saved ground, bid four wide and didn't have enough late. EXTRA GORGEOUS
raced close to the pace outside, rallied on the turn to loom a threat, fell back and went evenly late. LA MER was reluctant to load, showed good early speed
inside, was rated back and stayed close, bid willingly and hung late. NOUMEA broke awkwardly, trailed the field and was not urged late.

DAME DANGEROUS raced in the second flight, five wide along the backstretch, challenged for the lead on the turn, got a head in front, was under pressure
through the stretch and held under steady left handed urging. MISS WINE TOPPER set a pressured pace, was headed on the turn, continued willingly to the
wire, couldn't gain and was outfinished in a good effort. HONOURAPRILSRULES was unhurried early, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed
well to earn show. STELLA SWEEPER saved ground, bid, hung and failed to menae. LINDAS BLACK COMET raced in the second flight inside, bid along
the rail on the turn, was blocked and steadied, shifted out and leveled off in the drive. DAWNS MORNING was outrun in an even effort. WARTIME LADY
pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way.

ROI BELENCIAGA stalked the pace, rallied on the turn, dueled through the stretch in tight quarters, bumped and proved best in a long drive. DECOSTER
set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch in tight quarters, bumped and was outfinished in a game effort. STANLEY RYDER challenged for the lead
on the turn, dueled through the stretch in tight quarters, bumped and yielded in the final strides. S S TANK raced close to the pace while racing outside,
went six wide leaving the turn, closed and didn't have enough late. MADERA UNTAMED was fractious in the post parade, saved ground and lacked a rally.
DIEZ PESOS broke awkwardly to be away slowly, was outrun and not urged late. The rider of STANLEY RYDER claimed foul against the rider of ROI
BELENCIAGA for alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made.

back, advanced to the turn, swung wide, closed steadily and got up late for place. ARIZONA MOON was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn and
finished well. MORSE CODE held a good position inside, bid and came up empty. SALTINI raced in the back, offered a mild bid only and improved position.
CHOCOLATEICECREAM raced close to the pace, bid and came up empty. COURAGEOUS was outrun in an even effort. STRATTON fell, lost his rider and
was vanned off. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference in the stretch. No change was made. The quarter mile fractional split was

HEAT SCORE vied inside, drew clear leaving the turn and held well under urging. MOON JUICE was slow early, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed
with a rush and was gaining fast late. STONE CREEK pressed the pace three across, lacked the needed rally and was caught for place. JOHNNY RUNNER
ducked out at the start to be off slowly, steadily advanced and gained late. PRICELESS ALLSTAR was never far back, lacked the needed late response and
failed to menace. LUNAR PARTY dueled to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. OF COURSE IT IS raced in close outside, fell back on the turn
and finished evenly. FULL OF GOLD advanced to the turn, bid off the rail and was not urged late. WORTHY TO STAND trailed the field.

LOOK AT MY STAR was slow early, bid inside on the turn, angled out in the upper stretch and closed steadily to get up at the wire. LICORICE DROP POPS
raced six wide along the backstretch, challenged entering the stretch, drew clear past the eighth pole and was caught at the wire. RUNNING FOR GUS
pressed the pace, awaited room on the turn, got through inside, dueled past the eighth pole, weakened and was all out for show. ELUSIVE FLAME lagged
early, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to improve position. HUNDREDANDONEPROOF ducked out at the start, was void of
early speed and improved position in a steady effort. FORTHWITH pressed the pace, was checked leaving the turn and dropped back. CAPTAIN WAY set a
pressed pace to the turn, swung wide and gave way. WILT raced mid pack, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a response. JAY LOST
CONTROL pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, bore out and was not urged through the stretch.

Footnotes
WE'RE JUST SAYIN pressed the pace, fell back entering the stretch, closed steadily, drifted out late and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides.
MAMBOCELLO was never far off the pace, bid inside on the turn, shifted out, closed steadily and was outfinished in a good effort. PEACH TIME set a
pressured pace, drew clear entering the stretch, led to the final strides and was outfinished. TEDDY TIME was unhurried early, finished well mid track and
failed to menace. BAY AREA was crowded at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. BUYMEABOND was crowded at the start, raced close to the
pace outside, bid five wide and had nothing left for the drive. HOLY FRAZIER came out at the start and was outrun. REMEMBERTOBREATHE pressed the
pace to the final turn, tired and gave way. Fractional splits unavailable.
