Footnotes
BUFFON stumbled at the start then was hustled along to set the pace while bearing in down the backstretch, drew off in upper stretch and was much the
best in the end. SMOKIN B was settled then rallied on the turn, was three wide for the stretch drive and was up for the place in the end. DONNA'S COURT
was forced in on the turn down the backstretch and chased the pace while two wide, made a bid in the stretch but was outfinished in the end.
UNTILWEMEETAGAIN was angled out to be three wide off heels then was used up and faltered. MOSCA was unhurried early then rallied on the turn and
was no threat in the end. HOLY SUNRISE was bumped on the backstretch then was inside and shuffled back and lacked a rally in the stretch. CHASING
HAPPY was forced in on the backstretch and bumped then shuffled back and stopped in the stretch. A steward's inquiry was held concerning the run down
the backstretch. After reviewing the film's, no action was taken.
