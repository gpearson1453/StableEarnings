turn ceding there wilting in upper stretch. BOLD CHARMANT tracked the pace through the far turn then folded in upper stretch. OVERCRITICIZED was
never involved. APARTFROMTHECROWD was always outrun.

DOUBLE D'S REVENGE stalked the pace rallying to wrest a short lead on the turn, dug in from the four path down the lane holding on between horses late.
STATUS SYMBOL went evenly early rallying to bid on the turn, vied three deep from mid track down the lane pressing to the wire. EDGE OF NIGHT stalked
the pace being blocked on the rail on the turn, angled out a bit to the two path in upper stretch vying inside of rivals the final sixteenth. SOLE FACTOR slow
early came five wide to upper stretch bidding evenly late from mid track. SUCH APPEAL away alertly set the early pace, hooked at the rail on the turn cut
the corner to upper stretch gradually wearing down there. DREAMINOFJUSTICE slow early played no factor. EDGE OF PLEASURE was never involved.
MS. MAXIMA vied on the turn then flattened in upper stretch. DOLLY DEAR failed to respond.

Footnotes
COUNTRY CADEN stalked the pace through the turn rallying clear in upper stretch being ridden out the final sixteenth. ASPENS LITTLE ZIP went evenly
through the turn losing ground to upper stretch rallying late six wide to save place. WOLF EYES a step slow through the turn saved ground to upper stretch
responding to finish well along the rail. LINDA'S MUSIC pressed early then ceded on the turn racing evenly in the four path down the lane. MARIE'S
MANDATE raced mid pack failing to mount a credible bid. DIAMOND BREW slow early played no factor. KATIE'S SUNRISE hesitated breaking late.
DEPENDABLE LADY pressed the pace taking a short lead on the turn, ceded in upper stretch angling out while giving way. MILLBANK MAGIC was never
involved. MYLADYCHARLOTTE outrun early would tire.

horses in upper stretch ceding to outside pressure while securing place. MISS BOMBON pressured the pace dueling inside of rivals in upper stretch
weakening late in the three path. LIGHTNING MISS a step slow early raced four wide to upper stretch rallying past the others. PABLO CREEK hustled
along the inside faded to upper stretch. LEGITIMACY broke sharply working the pace through the turn wearing out from the eighth pole. IVORY NOT
WHITE pressed the pace dueling to upper stretch wilting the final sixteenth. TOO SHORT played no factor. REWARDED chased through the turn then gave
way in upper stretch. ONE LAST CAT was always outrun. CRAZY LADY offered little.
