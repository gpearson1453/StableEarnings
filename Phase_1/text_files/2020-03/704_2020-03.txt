THANKS had the best speed, pulled clear two wide to the stretch then was under hand urging only in the final furlong. AMERICAN ROYALTY got
outsprinted to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then could not threaten the winner but dug in to save second. VONHRA also was outsprinted, raced
inside of AMERICAN ROYALTY to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and could not catch up. MORNING DOVE was chasing to the turn, circled four
wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. SINAWAVA also chased to the turn then saved ground to no avail.

JUST CLASSY was unhurried to the half, advanced inside on the second turn, had plenty of room inside of URBAN DIVA, pushed to the front and was clear
to mid stretch then was all out to hold. AUGURE pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but
kept to task and was closing late. SNOW PACK was chasing the pace to the second turn, swung out four wide to the stretch and also finished in a rally.
URBAN DIVA set the pace off the rail to the second turn, drifted out into the stretch, was overtaken and finished evenly late. CHARLIE'S BELLE was outrun
to the half, saved ground on the second turn and closed the gap without threatening. MAMANUCA was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the half,
eased down to the two path on the second turn but gave way in the drive.

SHE'S SO SPECIAL stalked the leader to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, took over in upper stretch and pushed clear to the line. SMOKIN HOT
BOBBIE chased the pace to the turn, shifted off the rail mid turn then was not a threat to the winner but finished willingly for the place. HABOBANERO
hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken by the winner and could not save the place. I'M A ROCKETTE broke slow,
was outrun to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but did not threaten. RED DAHLIA trailed throughout.

COZZE KID dueled inside of HARDSENSE to the turn, inched away while off the rail, kicked clear under urging to mid stretch and held driving. CARRIE'S
SUCCESS was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was gaining without being a serious threat. DREAMING ABOUT YOU had no
speed, raced two wide to the stretch and was also making up ground belatedly. MERITOCRACY chased the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked
to mid stretch, finished evenly and was caught in a tie for the show. HIT IT TWICE lagged to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then failed to threaten in
the drive. HARDSENSE attended the pace to the turn, pressed three wide to the stretch then tired.

PASSING had the best speed and eased to the rail, saved ground to the stretch then responded in the drive and held. JOEJOE'S KINGDOM chased the
winner to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then dug in determinedly to hold the place. INDEPENDENT INDY pressed the winner while off the rail to the
stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. BOLD ROMAN was chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but was outfinished in the
final furlong. BROTHERCICCIO had no speed, raced off the rail to mid turn, saved ground into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. NUTTY
SIERRA had no speed and was not a factor.
