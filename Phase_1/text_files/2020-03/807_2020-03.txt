Footnotes
BECOMING MACHEN took immediate control and set a well reserved pace, pulled away through the backstretch while kept on the bit, was under moderate
urging to deep stretch then taken in hand later yards. BREAK DANCIN stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
though had to settle for second best. LIL TROUBLE came away a step slow and raced well off the pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and was along for third late. PRINCESS KENO settled off the pace about the three path and showed little
response through the backstretch. LADYS CROSS FIRST raced well off the pace while saving early ground and was not a factor. BADS LIL LADY saved
ground.

Footnotes
MY PEOPLE SING settled off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and dug
in through the lane to get up later yards. SOUL MACHEN stalked the pace two deep then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead and
contested the edge through the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but relented later yards. AFFIX saved ground off the pace the opening turn then eased out
into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and dug in
through the lane in time to share third. MAJESTIC DOCTOR settled off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then dug in
through the lane to hold on for third. JACKS CITY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail
approaching the quarter, dueled at a close disadvantage through the far turn then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. KUCHEROV stalked the pace three
wide then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, but dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. STRAPHANGER raced off the
pace about the four path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch and showed little response.

OUT OF CENTS raced with the pace two deep the first turn, dueled leaving the half mile pole and contested the edge two deep on the far turn, then dug in
determinedly through the lane to inch clear the final yards. MELTECH rated a slim early lead inside but was met at even terms into the backstretch, dug in
from that point and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn and continued on gamely to late stretch before ceding; grudgingly.
BROTHER CORBIN stalked in the three and four paths and gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled
through the stretch for third. FEISTY AND SASSY settled close in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole then outfinished in the stretch
duel for third. TRANQUIL BLUE raced off the pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. MAYHEM LIKE ME settled
close to the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.

through the backstretch and raced at the rail rounding the turn, then finished evenly. GHOST MINE gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn then
dueled through the stretch for third. After flipping his rider in the gate, INDIAN WILDFIRE settled off the pace through the backstretch, bid from the middle of
the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MACHEN BETS gave chase, raced in the five path of the turn and finished evenly outside. GRECIAN
ADMIRAL chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little more. FAST RIDE broke inward and was never a factor.

UNDENIABLE TOUCH angled to the inside to race with the pace and continued at even terms two deep on the turn, drifted a path into the stretch but dug in
under steady encouragement to hold on. GOOD KARMA gave chase and raced close three wide on the turn, was carried out a path into the lane, dug in to
take second later yards and just lasted. DIAMOND TRAIN chased the leaders through the backstretch, was carried outward on the turn and entered the
stretch about the seven path, dug in leaving the turn to finish strong and just missed second. CLUBIN TILL DAWN gave chase and entered the turn near the
rail, angled to the six path toward the top of the lane and raced evenly down the lane. DISTORTED SPLENDOR raced with the pace inside and contested
the rail at even terms, continued a factor through the upper stretch but weakened inside the sixteenth pole. Q'S SONG gave chase and raced in the four
path of the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MISS PROBLEMATIC gave chase inside then angled out at the same time as Clubin Till
Dawn and steadied off that one's heels at the top of the stretch, then showed little more. The stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul against the
rider of Clubin Till Dawn, lodged by the rider of Miss Problematic.

NELLYSFORD gave chase outside and raced close in the three path of the turn, then dug in through the lane to get up later yards. BRIDGING THE GAP
chased the pace inside through the backstretch but was boxed off the heels of Unkiss Me in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride to come
through the turn five wide and dug in through the stretch for a strong finish at the outside girth of the winner. LA MEDALLA DE ORO gave chase, rounded
the turn seven wide and finished well widest. AT THE HALF gave chase off the rail, was carried six wide on the turn, though, finished evenly. WIGGLE IT
JIGGLEIT pressured the pace and dueled to the lead two deep midway on the turn, raced clear into the stretch but was caught flattening stride later yards.
UNKISS ME pressured the pace then dropped back at the rail leaving the quarter pole, lacked room leaving the turn and weakened. TOTO'S DARLING
gave chase toward mid track, rounded the turn in the five path then weakened. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE saved ground. LOU'S CHARDONNAY was hustled
along inside to set a pressured pace but was caught at the rail midway on the turn and weakened.

AWESOME BUZZ stalked the pace toward the inside then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead at the rail past the quarter,
raced clear midway on the far turn and dug in under determined handling to hold off the later challenge of POET WARRIOR, who settled off the pace about
the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn, threatened mid-stretch but was outfinished the
final sixteenth. START YOUR ENGINE settled back off the rail the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn five wide then dueled through the stretch for third. LITTLE BARI rounded the first turn in the six path and raced outside into the
backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn six wide and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MOLOKAI came
through the first turn in the five path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, showed only mild response past the three eighths pole and rounded
the far turn in the five path. FIT BUT FAT surged to the lead and angled in to rate the pace off the rail, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, was
caught past the quarter pole and weakened. PLAYGROUND saved ground. SILVER CASTLE rated off the pace toward the inside the first turn then picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, though, faded on the far turn.
