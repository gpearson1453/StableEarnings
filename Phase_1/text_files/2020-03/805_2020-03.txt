Footnotes
MERCY RULE was always in good position tracking the leaders, bid three wide then swung out four deep into the stretch, rallied to the lead then drove
clear. THE REF had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then was no threat to the winner but finished willingly for the
place. JOURNEY TO RUN had no speed, raced off the rail on the second turn then could not offer the needed late response. KONA COAST pressed the
pace to the backstretch three wide, moved up to engage for the lead three wide, dueled on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
LOOKS GOOD N A TUX prompted the leader to the backstretch, pushed up to duel between rivals, was two wide to the stretch then was also outrun to mid
stretch and gave way. GIMME SPACE had no speed, settled to the half, had to circle four then five wide on the second turn but gave way in the drive.
INTIMIDATE hustled and set the pace to the five eighths, was collared, dueled tdo the second turn then tired before going six furlongs and stopped in the
stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ A RULE went right to the front, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch and held under steady urging. ACADIA FLEET
pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on late. SECRETLY PARANOIDE had no speed, was two wide on the turn,
stepped out for room nearing the furlong marker and took the path of HOPE WINS then was gaining but too late. RUEFUL'S NIGHT OUT was outsprinted to
the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, was widest in the drive and also gained ground belatedly. HOPE WINS stalked the pace three wide to the
stretch, was being outrun by the top two then had to check when crowded by SECRETLY PARANOIDE nearing the eighth pole and weakened. The
stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving SECRETLY PARANOIDE and HOPE WINS and determined that although SECRETLY
PARANOIDE did bother HOPE WINS, it did not cost that one a better placing and no change was warranted.

best. RAMONCITA LIGHT stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, remained a factor to mid stretch then was outkicked late. SHE'S IN LUCK attended
the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was giving way late. IT GIRL had no speed, raced two wide then swung out into the stretch but
could not make an impact in the drive. PASTORATE was on the pace from the outset, saved ground to the stretch then stayed to mid stretch but weakened
in the final furlong. SHEZ A GRINDER had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

TINSEL TOWN QUEEN bobbled to begin then was sent along inside to take the lead, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded in the drive
and held on determinedly. YOU WANNA EAR RIP had no speed and lagged to the turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch and finished in a rally but was
too late. LADY OF PERCEPTION chased the winner two wide to the stretch then shifted out, split rivals and was also coming on. PROMOTE (IRE) pressed
the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was outfinished in the final furlong. BOUNTY OF GOLD had no speed and saved ground to the
stretch then was outkicked in the final furlong. THANKS chased the pace three wide to the stretch but was tiring in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PENTEWAN (GB) was outsprinted to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, eased out for room, rallied when set down and pushed to the front then
held off WHEAL GRACE late. WHEAL GRACE hesitated and broke about four lengths last, had no speed, saved ground while advancing on the turn then
shifted out, lacked room briefly nearing the eighth pole but rallied between horses late in an impressive debut. HAPPY ROAD had no speed, was fanned
four wide to the stretch and closed steadily but too late. SWEET AND SOFTLY zipped to a clear lead, set the pace from the rail, got collared in mid stretch
and weakened. DIAMETRIC tracked the pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. SHELBY R. was chasing early
then pushed up to press the leader two wide to the stretch, loomed boldly to mid stretch but slackened late. MAGICAL PATH had no speed and was not a
factor. ZAKAR chased the pace also to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
MORNING CYNN never far back to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, shifted out and rallied between rivals to prevail driving. MYANGELCINDY attended
the pace outside MY SWEET LOU, was three wide into the stretch, responded when set down, could not stall the winner but held the place. REBALATION
tracked the leaders two wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and finished willingly but could not get second. JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT had no
speed, was three wide then swung out for room in upper stretch and closed ground belatedly. MOMMY ROSE also had no speed, settled to the turn, was
two wide to the stretch then also was gaining late. PLUM WILD was chasing to the turn, tried to rally three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid
stretch and finished evenly. MY SWEET LOU dueled for the lead from the rail to the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired. MEET MISS KITTY
got outsprinted early, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. RESPECT MY CANDOR hopped in the air at the start, lost about five
lengths and was not a factor. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY had no speed and was always outrun.
