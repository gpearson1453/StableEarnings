Footnotes
FRONTANA set all the pace, widened in the stretch run and coasted home while ducking in through the final seventy yards while well clear. JUST GUN IT
unseated the rider during the post parade while geared up, chased winner throughout, could not keep up and staggered while tiring in the stretch to just hold
the place spot. SKATINGONTHINICE just off winner early, shuffled back into the turn, to lose position and came on again through the stretch run to just
miss place. WICKED WORRY never a factor while passing stragglers in the stretch run. ONE SPUR MCGIRR failed to menace. FINNY'S MACHO MAN
was through after the half and dropped back readily. KOBE BEACH good position to the stretch, could not go on, stopped. ARCH DREAMER never a
menace.

Footnotes
SECRET TOWN tracked leaders to far turn, asked for run to the quarter pole, responded well to split horses into the stretch and was all out to be along in
time. PROM THEME set pace to deep stretch while outfinished in a game effort to hold the place spot. BARONET perfect position to far turn, rallied willingly
outside but too late. SOUR PEACH chased leader to quarter pole, weakened in the stretch run. SWEET ROCK off slow from the gate, made up ground
steadily while wide. SPERLING raced evenly with no late response when needed. MY LADY DOWRY never a factor. CLASSY SCARLETT through early,
dropped bacl. TIZ BEAUTY awkward beginning, never recovered, faded back.

wide past the quarter pole and rallied too late. GET TOUGH dueled winner to turn from two path, evened out in the drive. NUTTIN' FASTER no speed to the
turn, rallied off rail in the drive but leveled off in the final furlong. INDY RHYTHM void early speed, moved outside past quarter pole, moved up. TRAVEL
TRUE awkward start, recovered to race evenly to the stretch with no bid. KNOCKOUT RANGER never a factor. DOUBLE DERINGER failed to menace.

Footnotes
TOMMYTOM dueled inside to turn, shook free into the stretch and held sway to the wire. BREZNO raced an inside trip, lost position into turn, angled out,
very wide and was running on late while no real threat for the winner. DURRETT LANE bore out and jostled start, far back to stretch, angled out with a late
outside burst in the final furlong. DRAMA STAR bore in start, raced evenly, with no late bid in the drive. DREAM SATURDAY bothered badly start, improved
position only in the stretch. NO LEMON NO LIME dueled from three path to turn, gave way in the final furlong. PROVEN WARRIOR jostled start, rushed up
but was through early and faded. G J BUSTER dueled inside to turn, dug in but came up empty. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FINAL TIME WAS
CALCULATED BY THE EQUIBASE FIELD CREW.
