SORRYABOUTNOTHING stalked the pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and drew clear in the final stages under strong handling. BEN'S MAGIC
STONE pressed the pace from the outside, raced two wide and finished second best. SPRINGTIME MOJO was unhurried early, raced three wide down the
backstretch, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. AWESOME GORDO was slow early, moved up seven wide into the
lane and never was a serious threat. FAR OUT KAILEE stalked the pace and weakened while racing three wide. TREASURY BILL settled off the early
pace, raced towards the inside, angled four wide through the drive and never threatened. INDY PIRATE set all the pace from the outside and faded while
racing along the inside. ZILKER dropped back early and failed to have a response. INTIMIDATING broke in the air and never threatened.

from the outside, made a bid entering the turn and rallied late for the show. BERNARDIAN chased the early pace inside but had no late response. CAT

Footnotes
DONT TELL NOOBODY outrun early, steadily advanced up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive
and was along in time. NATIVE RIVER broke sharp from between foes, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to
show the way through the second turn, remained well clear at the eighth pole but could not last. CONCRETE FINISHER forced the early pace from the
outside, inched closer entering the second turn but could not keep pace. CROWNED LEADER forced the early pace inside. remained in a forward position
but came up empty in the drive. CALICHE RIDGE forced the early pace inside but had nothing left. FAR LEFT was carried seven wide into the first turn and
was no factor. CRUISIN COMET drifted out into the first turn, carried out a rival and was no threat. OIL BRUSHED BRONZE flashed early speed and tired.
T BILL showed little. CRUISIN COMET raced as ELLE'S BAY.
