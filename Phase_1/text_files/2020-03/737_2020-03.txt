Footnotes
MIZZEN BEAU was urged from the break to secure the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch under light rating, was
prompted to extend that margin racing into the far turn, then held sway to the end while being kept to steady pressure. JUDY'S WAY, urged to terms with
the pacesetter angling inwards racing into the first turn, stalked just off that foe outside a rival into the backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with
a rival to challenge racing into the far turn, couldn't gain even terms with the winner late but edged a rival for the place honors. SWEET MIA broke readily,
conceded the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, steadied a bit in close quarters entering the bend, continued to track just off the
pacesetter inside a rival to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening, then was roused to advance entering the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. WE
THE CLOUDS was rated off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but made no impression. SAYYIDA AL HURRA
tracked off the leaders outside foes to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. FASHION RULES tracked off the second flight three, then four wide to
the backstretch and offered no rally. WICKED WITCH broke in the air losing position to the field and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
J P'S DELIGHT broke readily, angled inwards attending a rival's pace under rating racing to the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch, then went clear
under firm handling and a few right handed taps. POINT OF HONOR, off a step behind the leaders, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight into the
turn, was prompted to advance while shifting out three deep nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others.
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. GRAY OWL was
urged to the lead from the break while shifting off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn and gave way into the stretch. BOUJIE
GIRL broke awkwardly, was righted to track off the first flight in the four path racing to the turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
MORNING COLORS angled inwards racing to the first turn to track the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking position, was prompted to advance
three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and held the challenge of YLIKEDIS to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. The latter, angled to the inside tracking the leaders just inside the eventual winner racing to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening, then
altered out three deep splitting foes nearing upper stretch, shifted four wide entering the lane and continued willingly to challenge the winner late while just
outkicked. FIRST COURSE broke inwards bumping TENERIFE MOON, was held up four wide avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn, tracked the
leaders outside foes to the backstretch, advanced five wide nearing the lane and continued with a steady effort to prevail for a share. MORE GOOD TIMES,
caught wide racing into the first turn, angled nearer to the inside racing to the backstretch to track between foes, was urged to advance four wide between
foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. GRIMPANTE settled early while angling inside, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being
urged to advance, angled six wide in upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. TIME FOR FUN sped to the lead while
angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave way. WE FIVE settled last early and passed between tiring rivals.
HEAVENLY JOY, held up avoiding close quarters along the inside early, offered no rally. HEPZIBAH, urged to gain a forward placing stalking, then
prompting the pacesetter to the far turn gave way between foes into the lane. PIVOTAL WOMAN (FR), pulling in the opening stages while held up just off
the pacesetter, angled to the inside tracking just off that foe to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. TENERIFE MOON, bumped at the start,
settled between foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
COCKTAILS OR CANDY broke sharply, stalked the pacesetter three deep in the opening quarter, shifted inwards while steadily advancing on that foe
nearing upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm encouragement. CULTURAL MANDATE was urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail in the
opening quarter, held sway to upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but yielded late. ANIMAUXSELLE settled between foes, then
angled to the inside in the opening stages, steadily advanced along the rail nearing upper stretch, switched out nearing the furlong marker to race four wide
but continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW was settled last along the inside early, angled out six wide entering the
stretch and made some belated progress. TOLLY HO was settled outside foes early, angled five deep racing into the lane and made a mild gain between
rivals late. MANCORA tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted out nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. MEMORABLE
ANGEL tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted out three wide briefly gaining position nearing upper stretch but flattened out entering the
lane. EXTRA SALSA settled outside foes and never seriously menaced. FLAN, urged between foes in pursuit of the pacesetter racing to the turn, gave way
approaching upper stretch, was quickly outdistanced but walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
MINTD (IRE), restless in the gate before the start, broke slowly, was caught four wide racing through the first turn, made a steady gain outside foes through
the backstretch, advanced outside AGI'S CAIT to challenge that foe leaving midstretch and prevailed in time under firm left handed encouragement. The
latter gained a forward placing stalking just off the pacesetter along the inside, switched outside a rival conceding position to the pacesetter racing through
the backstretch, steadily advanced on the far turn to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner but came up second best. MY
GALINA tracked off the second flight inside foes in the opening half, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, angled back to the inside and continued
to improve position. HERE COMES JACKIE tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted out three wide while being prompted to advance nearing the
lane but finished evenly late. ANYA YLINA (IRE), reserved off the second flight along the inside, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then split
foes to gain some position but lacked the needed late bid. CANTEEN settled three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out last nearing
the far turn, shifted out entering the lane and displayed some belated interest to gain some position between rivals. CHOLLA was settled between foes in
the last flight and offered no rally. EAST COAST SWING, urged to gain a forward placing along the rail, conceded the lead nearing the backstretch to track a
rival as part of the second flight and emptied out racing through the far turn. EVER CHANGING tracked off the second flight outside foes four wide, then
three wide to the backstretch and faded after a half. DANGEROUS CURVES, pulled her way to the lead racing into the first turn, shifted to the rail entering
the backstretch, was prompted to go well clear to the far turn and gave out racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOGO SHOES gained a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, came under pressure nearing the lane to challenge for command,
shifted three deep, then took over nearing midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. NEVER FORGET, pulling against rating stalking just inside
the pacesetter in the opening stages, continued in hand nearing upper stretch while hemmed along the rail, continued in close quarters inside foes entering
the lane and was roused in the closing stages to secure the place honors. RECODED tracked off the second flight while angling inside, conceded some
position under patient handling nearing the lane, was eased out five wide near midstretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. RED VENUS
tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn, then continued with a steady effort between foes in that path to late stages
while just outkicked for a share. BOURBON REBELLION tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly three deep
between foes in the closing stages. LILY CHASER, urged to a forward placing three deep in second flight tracking just off the pacesetter, faded into upper
stretch. BITE THE STARS, urged to gain the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave way between foes.
SAXON BRAID, caught wide early, proved no threat. EVER SMART broke inwards bumping AKSARBEN SUMMER, shifted out five wide racing into the turn
and lacked rally. AKSARBEN SUMMER, bumped at the start, settled near the inside and never seriously menaced. LOUIE'S BACKYARD, restless in the
gate before the start, was slow into stride and never seriously menaced. DRAMATONE broke slowly, then was steadied out of close quarters just after the
break and soon trailed.

Footnotes
DOC BOY was firmly rated along the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued unhurried to the far turn, was prompted to
advance while swinging out four wide racing into upper stretch, then rallied smartly to the front and went clear under right handed pressure. MR. KRINGLE
settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, advanced four wide leaving the far turn, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and
continued with a steady late bid to prevail for the place honors. SUMMER ASSAULT angled to the rail in the opening stages to gain a position stalking just
off the pacesetter under light rating, saved ground through the far turn, was urged to bid inside foes when presented an opening entering the stretch and
continued with interest to narrowly prevail for a share. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated
the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and yielded late. CHAPALU, pulling against firm rating gaining a position just
off the leaders, was switched out of close quarters to track just off the first flight under light reserve racing into the backstretch, was prompted to challenge
three deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. ME AND MR. C tracked off the second flight between foes, then steadily gained position
between rivals after a half, was prompted to advance racing into the stretch but had no closing bid. VALIANT VIRTUE angled inwards while being urged to
terms prompting a rival's pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn into upper stretch and gave out. KING THEO, reserved
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE settled near the inside as part of the last flight and
dropped out of contention early. COMMENCE, caught four wide racing to the backstretch gaining a position just off the second flight, steadily retreated
racing into the far turn.

out nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance three deep between foes, moved to terms with the pacesetter nearing midstretch, exchanged
some light contact with that foe while challenging for command and edged forward nearing the wire under brisk right handed encouragement. KING FOR A

under light reserve, moved to wrest the advantage racing into the far turn, held sway to upper stretch, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's
challenge exchanging contact with that foe to late stages and continued grudgingly to the end while just outfinished. PROMPT tracked off the second flight
between foes in the opening stages, came under pressure after a half to maintain contention, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with
interest to edge rivals for a share. BIG DOLLAR BILL, reserved inside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out on the far turn while being prompted to
advance, was fanned five wide into the lane but had no final kick. DEBBIE'S PASSION switched outside foes early tracking off the first flight, was prompted
to lodge a brief bid four wide midway through the far turn and soon faded. NOBLE DRAMA tracked off the second flight racing three deep between foes to
the backstretch and retreated early. ADMIRALTY PIER, urged to gain the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow

Footnotes
STARSHIP JUBILEE was rated between rivals in second flight in the opening half, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to
advance, disputed the issue inside BEAUTIFUL LOVER while shifting inwards entering the lane and kicked away under firm right handed encouragement.
The latter angled inwards to gain a position between foes just off the second flight under rating racing to the backstretch, shifted nearer to the inside after a
half, was switched out on the far turn, then prompted to advance five wide in tandem with the eventual winner racing into upper stretch, pressed the issue to
late stages but proved only second best. KELSEY'S CROSS, reserved last just off the inside for the opening five furlongs, split foes racing through the far
turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. MAGIC STAR tracked the leaders inside foes, then
between rivals in second flight racing to the far turn, angled out five wide entering the lane and improved position in the closing stages. GET EXPLICIT
tracked off the second flight inside rivals racing to the first turn, steadily gained position to track just off the pacesetter racing into the far turn, came through
close quarters to bid along the rail in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. WISH UPON, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages, shifted in
on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and passed outside some tiring rivals late. JEHOZACAT gained terms attending a rival's pace under
rating racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the far turn and came up empty entering the lane. LADY OXBOW tracked off the
second flight outside foes in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far turn. HANALEI MOON tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight,
advanced three deep entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid but emptied out into the lane. DYNATAIL moved to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on
a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. JULIANA (PER) settled between foes in the last flight and never gained contention.

Footnotes
OUTBURST (GB) broke readily, moved to the lead on her own courage racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin under light reserve
through the backstretch, shifted out racing into the stretch while being prompted to maintain a clear advantage and just held the challenge of WALK IN
MARRAKESH (IRE) to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter was prompted to gain a forward placing along the inside while conceding the
lead to the pacesetter, tracked just off that foe inside rivals racing into the far turn, switched out entering upper stretch while being roused to challenge and
continued willingly to dispute the issue to the wire. SECRET STASH (IRE), reserved out of striking distance while angling to the rail racing to the first turn,
steadily gained position inside foes into the second bend, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and continued willingly between foes to prevail for a
share. HOW IRONIC, reserved outside foes dropping well off the second flight, was prompted to advance while shifting five wide leaving the midway point of
the far turn, exchanged contact with IVYETSU racing through the stretch but continued to gain position to the end while edging that rival for a placing.
IVYETSU, reserved last to the backstretch dropping well off the leaders, swung out six wide leaving the far turn while being roused to advance, exchanged
contact with HOW IRONIC racing through the stretch but continued with an effort to gain some position. CORRECTNESS tracked the pacesetter between
foes in second flight, steadily gained position between foes to bid just outside the leader on the far turn and flattened out racing into the stretch.
MICHELINE, caught four wide in the opening half tracking just off the second flight, was urged to advance in that path nearing upper stretch but had no final
kick. MIRABELL MEI, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground gaining some position on the far turn but had no closing response.
SECURE CONNECTION, taken up in early stages avoiding close quarters, settled well off the leaders, switched outside foes racing through the far turn but
offered no rally. GALILEOS BALLERINA dislodged her rider to run loose momentarily before loading in the starting gate, tracked off the second flight
between foes to the backstretch and steadily faded. BLAME DEBBIE tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted
between foes in that path making brief progress nearing the far turn, exchanged solid contact with NEW YORK GROOVE midway through the far turn and
quickly emptied out. NEW YORK GROOVE tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, was urged to advance racing into the far turn,
exchanged bumps with BLAME DEBBIE midway through the far turn and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
KING GUILLERMO ducked out slightly at the start, was quickly righted to gain terms with the pacesetter attending the pace racing to the first turn, conceded
some position to track just off that foe through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command racing through the far turn, wrested
the advantage racing into upper stretch then went clear under strong handling and right handed pressure. SOLE VOLANTE was settled along the inside
racing to the backstretch, shifted out while being prompted to split foes after a half, angled to the inside nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch
and made steady progress inside foes to secure the place honors late. TEXAS SWING tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, shifted out
entering the lane while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed late bid. RELENTLESS DANCER broke readily, was urged to gain a narrow
advantage racing just off the inside to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge but gave
way leaving midstretch. CHANCE IT shifted out at the break, was rated between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out on
the far turn while being prompted to advance, drifted out markedly nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards entering the lane and quickly came up empty.
MARKET ANALYSIS, shuffled a bit at the start, angled to the inside racing into the first turn, was prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes into the
far turn, then faded between foes into the lane. SPA CITY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, steadied a bit nearing the
backstretch, shifted out while being urged to make a brief bid nearing the far turn but quickly emptied out. UNRIGHTEOUS settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch and never gained contention. LETMENO tracked off the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch and dropped out early. BYE BYE
MELVIN tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight, was fanned four wide after a half and gave way racing into the far turn. TONS OF
GOLD shied outwards at the start, was settled outside foes and never mounted a serious challenge. MO MOSA angled to the inside racing to the first turn
and dropped out early.

Footnotes
STOP WAR broke readily to gain the lead between calls racing to the first turn, lost the advantage while switching off the inside racing to the backstretch,
pulled her way between foes to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that foe after a half, took over racing through the far turn and kicked clear under
firm encouragement. UNFORESEEN tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane and edged foes for the place
honors. PECHANGA (IRE) tracked off the second flight inside foes, saved ground to upper stretch and continued to improve position. DIVINE MARTHA
broke inwards bumping late TOURIST LIKE ME, was righted to track just outside the leaders to the backstretch, was urged to challenge three deep nearing
the lane but flattened. MORE MANGO, reserved between foes to the backstretch, shifted out four wide in the lane and continued evenly. WEST BURKE
tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. TOURIST LIKE ME hopped while being bumped at
the start and never gained contention. DESERT LEGACY, reserved near the inside, offered no rally. PRINCESS PAO reserved last along the inside, proved
no factor. AMERIEL broke awkwardly, was rank under restraint pulling her way to the lead outside foes to the first turn, dictated the pace to the far turn and
emptied out.
