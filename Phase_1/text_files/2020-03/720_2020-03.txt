Footnotes
DONNER PASS rated off the pace, was roused from outside on the bend, came widest into the lane and got up in time under steady urging. LINE OF
DENHAMS contested the pace from outside from the beginning, took the bend three wide, moved clear under a drive in the lane but was outfinished in a
game effort. A P FIREBALL disputed the pace between rivals, began to float out some leaving the quarter pole, was then checked hard behind LINE OF
DENHAMS, altered out and lacked the extra needed deep stretch. WYATT'S SOUL displayed early speed from inside but weakened for the drive. HOLD
THE SPENDING contested the pace between horses for three furlongs then gradually yielded. LITTLE GUARD faded from inside on the bend. The rider of
A P FIREBALL lodged an objection alleging interference from LINE OF DENHAMS leaving the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that
objection.

Footnotes
NOT CHOPPED LIVER stalked the early speed from outside, was in path four through the bend, took over when asked and drew away under a drive the
last furlong. GONZO chased from off the rail, split rivals upper stretch to make his bid, angled inside GO VO inside the last furlong and caught that one for
second. GO VO contested the pace off the rail but inside rivals, was no match for NOT CHOPPED LIVER when set down for the drive and slowly wore
down in the waning yards. INGE in contention early, saved ground taking the bend and wore down for the drive. LIL R'SLAST was hustled along from the
early going but failed to menace. EL CAMINANTE displayed early speed between horses, gave way in the lane and was vanned off after the race. Due to a
photo finish malfunction, the beaten lengths for the finish were estimated by the Equibase chartcaller.

MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET rated on the inside, picked up his pace along the rail on the bend, angled out some to make his run at MONTEZUMA EXPRESS
at the top of the lane and gradually moved clear the final sixteenth. MONTEZUMA EXPRESS soon moved clear, was under a drive through the stretch,
lacked the extra in the late going but lasted for second under steady handling. NOTANINJA without early speed, came widest into the stretch and found best
stride too late. KIM MAN urged along from the gate, stayed close just outside MONTEZUMA EXPRESS but wore down for the drive. PAR was hustled along
but showed little.

BELLA CHELITA crowded briefly at the break, advanced between horses to share the lead from outside on the turn, responded to mostly hand urging and
drew clear the final eighth. SCARLET POSITION broke alertly, was soon clear, challenged on the turn, under a steady drive in the stretch, no match for
BELLA CHELITA but proved easily second best. AIR ELLIE chased from outside and could only improve position deep stretch. MACBU forwardly placed
from inside, angled out for the stretch run and faded. CHROME ATTACK atumbled at the start and was never a factore.

Footnotes
TAY TOWN shared the lead from outside from the early going, moved clear upper stretch then held off PRESENT OF HERO under a steady drive.
PRESENT OF HERO without early speed while between rivals, altered out to path five upper stretch, closed strongly but was too late. WARY CARRIE
exchanged bumps with EADS BRIDGE at the start, lost ground widest taking the turn but closed well the last furlong. BARBIELLO forwardly placed between
rivals, was just off the inside on the turn, floated out some for the drive, angled in some trying to gain a clear path nearing the final sixteenth and finished
evenly. JERSEY SCANDAL advanced from outside to threaten with two furlongs left but leveled off the last eighth. EADS BRIDGE exchanged bumps with
WARY CARRIE at the break, had the rail on the bend, also floated out some into the lane, began to wear down inside the furlong marker, was forced in
some with a sixteenth left and continued to yield. AFFIRMANCE displayed early speed from inside, began to wear down in the lane and was steadied in
tight quarters near the sixteenth marker. KEN'S GIRL gave way from inside after three furlongs.

KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF broke on top, shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead and took the rail with three furlongs to go, floated out some
entering the lane, was challenged from outside upper stretch, came back under steady urging and edged ahead the final sixteenth. W W KAN DO vied for
the lead from inside, did not keep up into the turn, moved outside KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF on the bend, challenged that one again upper stretch, fought
gamely but had to settle for second best. FORT RAMSEY in contention early, did not keep up along the rail on the turn, angled out for a clear path
midstretch and showed a willingness to run late. Z U SOON chased from outside, also did not stay close through the bend but rallied belatedly in the lane. B
SALTY forwardly placed early, was three wide through the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and flattened out. CONSPICUOUS BOX was a step slow at
the break and never a factor.

Footnotes
LESLEY'S SONG broke alertly, shared the lead off the rail but inside rivals, floated out some through the turn and gradually drifted out as she drew off under
steady urging the last furlong. RACETOTHEFINISH bobbled then was bumped at the break, quickly recovered to vie for the lead from outside, was carried
out some on the bend, was no match for LESLEY'S SONG in the lane but stayed clear under for second while kept to a drive. LILLET bumped with
RACETOTHEFINISH at the start, raced in contention between horses, did not keep up on the turn, fanned out into the stretch, regained a striking position
upper stretch, moved to the inside, leveled off but was easily best of the others. ON THE MONEY displayed early speed between rivals, did not keep up on
the bend, moved to the inside and steadily yielded. LOGI was a factor from outside on the backstretch but gave way before finishing three furlongs. LITTLE
MOLITTA raced in the second flight from inside through the early going but was also finished midway on the turn.
