Footnotes
VERMEER stalked outside the leader, challenged from the outside and dueled three to four wide around the turn and into the stretch, grabbed a short lead
at the top of the lane and proved best under a drive to the wire. HEAT THINGS UP settled off the rail, two wide on the turn, came in and rallied along the
inside to edge OUR MANEKI cat for second. OUR MANEKI CAT set the pace off the rail up the backstretch, dueled two to three wide around the turn, lost
command near the eighth pole, fought back inside the winner and was edged for second on the line. DIXIE DOO RUN RUN unhurried in the early stages,
traveled along the inside, angled out and split foes on the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and went evenly late. BALLYCASTLE outside a rival in the
early going, went three wide around the turn and four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. LAKE SHOW lacked early speed, raced two to
three wide around the turn, angled to the inside in the stretch and never threatened. BRAVE COURT chased a bit off the rail, saved ground into the lane and
faded through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MADAME JEANETTE stalked the top pair off the inside, angled into the two path entering the turn, angled back to the outside and bid four deep into the
lane, vied for the lead three deep in the final sixteenth and inched away. AVO stumbled leaving the gate, recoved quickly and raced outside a rival then
angled to the inside of that runner, cut the corner into the turn, angled out and bid three deep entering the stretch, battled between runners through the lane
but was outkicked by the winner. TWO TIMING LUCY showed speed and bumped early with LIL' A. J., dueled outside that rival through the turn and into the
stretch where she also received challengers to the outside, fought back in the late stages but faltered late. MERGIE TROID traveled along the inside to the
turn, raced a bit off the inside into the stretch, angled over the inside near the sixteenth pole and found her best stride too late. LIL' A. J. sped to the front
and bumped with outside rival early, dueled with that foe to the stretch and gave way in the late stages.
