Footnotes
HEROS REWARD dueled early along the inside, continued to alternate for the advantage through the turn, shook off the other speed when straightened for
home,, not threatened to the wire while being kept to task. COLD SMOKE in the second flight along the inside, boxed in briefly while continuing to save
ground through the turn, set down while remaining on the rail for the drive, long drive for the place, gained that position in game fashion late, no threat to the
winner. BOBBY AXELROD also in the second group, challenged three wide midway on the turn, could not match the winner in the drive, outkicked for the
second spot. JOHNNY TIZNOW dueled up front outside the winner up the backstretch and through the first half of the turn, weakened from between rivals
entering the stretch. VAYA CON DIOS within striking distance, crept a bit closer four wide late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. TIME HEIST was never
a threat. LITANY broke through the gate prior to the start, off slowly, trailed throughout while off the inside.

Footnotes
COWORKER close from the start, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear in the far turn, larger lead into the lane, enough left to last.
KNOWYOUROPTIONS broke back, lagged well back into the first turn outside, four wide onto the backstretch, advanced with a four wide middle move into
the far turn to reach contention, fell back off the winner into the lane, coming again late toward the inside. MICA BAY in the second group, pulled in the run
up the backstretch, asked along for some run between rivals far turn, not enough for the place. MAJORS VINDICATION within striking distance early off the
inside, fell back a bit after a quarter, saved ground through the second turn, went evenly in the drive. CHAPEL BARN four wide in the first turn when off the
pace, advanced to chase the winner through the second bend, had little left for the drive. BOOKIE'S BLUES settled in mid pack inside, went one paced
throughout. DEALIN' STELEN broke well, narrowly set the early pace, dueled the middle half then gave way. IT'S BELLAMY TIME broke back, lost outer
iron, regained that iron in the first turn while well out in the strip, failed to menace. STARRING JOHN WAIN four wide in the first turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CARPE VICTORIAM with the pace along the inside, held a narrow advantage through the turn, long drive, narrowly prevailed in game fashion. SCORING
with the early pace three wide, continued to vie on the outside through the bend, extended stretch duel while remaining outside the winner, oufinished in the
waning strides. BENNY CHANG also contested the issue early, between rivals through the turn, could not match the top two in the drive, saved the show.
MY BOY LOLLIPOP settled off the pace while in the three path, called on for run late in the turn, lacked a closing punch to finish up evenly. MAJESTIC
JOHN'S in the second group along the inside, failed to rally. FAST VERDICT off a step slow, trailed most of the way, angled out four wide exiting the turn,
went evenly to the wire. CLOSE ENCOUNTER in the second flight for a half between horses, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PRESLEY broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, continued to be clear through the turn, responded when challenged a furlong out,
dueled to the wire, dug in late to prevail. CHOCTAW CHARLIE closest to the leader, continued to pursue that one around the bend and into the stretch, bid
a furlong out, dueled to the wire, outfinished, clearly second best. LOVELY LOU back off the pace while well wide, five down to four wide advance turn,
along for the show, no threat to the top two. DAIGLE within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a
winning response. MISS CASEY BETH settled off the pace, angled in turn, also went one paced through the stretch. MOONSHINE MISS in the main group
while between horses into the turn, three down to two wide around the bend, also lacked a significant closing response. DAT GIRL four wide into the turn
when lacking speed, failed to menace. FURZY off a step slow, raced back, improved position without posing a threat. GUEST IN MY HEART was finished
early. AUNT SUNSHINE remained always back. MARQUEE COWBOY steadily faded. LADY MONDORO backed up.

HIGH RISK STRATEGY within striking distance, closer in the two path into the far turn, moved out and challenged three wide turning for home, drove clear
under steady handling. HYNDFORD broke on top, got clear early, set the pace inside, vied into the lane, could not match the winner the final furlong, edged
clear for the place. COOL CATOMINE pressed the issue early, fell back after a quarter, two path into the lane, steered out a bit more, up late for the show.
OMEN OF CHANGE forwardly placed off the inside, moved up to duel before a half, put a head in front midway on the far turn, vied into the lane between
rivals then weakened late. SATELLITE void of early foot, trailed after a half inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, improved position with some
belated interest. KENTUCKY ALLSTAR settled off the pace while toward the inside, two path into the lane, lacked a closing kick. SHAKEDOWN made little
impact outside. SWITHERAL devoid of early foot, remained always back. MILLWOOD tired while racing four wide out of the final turn. WICKETS WAY in
mid pack early, crept a bit closer in the three path second turn, faltered in the drive. HONOR MISSION four wide into both turns, gave way before six
furlongs. STUART HALL stopped after a half, jogged in.

CALIENTE CANDY lacked speed off the inside, angled out four wide late in the turn, came up empty for the drive. LADY OF LUXURY within striking
distance while racing three wide, fell back in the turn, went evenly in the drive while remaining out in the strip. HEAVENS WHISPER settled off the pace
toward the inside, moved closer late in the turn, steered out into the lane, challenged outside the leader late, proved best. READY TO RUNAWAY broke
alertly, soon sprinted clear, continued to show the way through the turn, responded when challenged late, gave ground grudgingly. HEADLAND forwardly
placed while racing outside, set down for the drive lacked the needed closing response. STERLING MISS off a step slow, went evenly while racing in the

Footnotes
SLICK SILVER away in good order, set the pace toward the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way into the lane, opened a
larger advantage past the furlong marker, drifted out soon after, headed late, battled back in the final strides to prevail in game fashion. CARLOS SIXES
prompted the pace off the inside, fell back into the stretch, went back after the winner late, put a head in front but was then outfinished in the late going.
DANGERFIELD brushed at the start, settled off the pace inside, proved no match for the top two in the drive, held sway for the show. ROCKO'S WHEEL
squeezed back at the start, lacked early speed, made a four wide middle into contention through the final turn, flattened out in the drive. GHOSTLY WHO
within striking distance while racing in the three path, had little left for the drive. CHICORY BLUE settled off the pace,lacked a response in the drive.
ITALIAN CHARM void of speed, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. DAPPER JACK was finished after half.

Footnotes
GETRIDOFWHATAILESU unhurried for five furlongs, ranged up five wide to challenge on the far outside late in the final turn, strongly clear. COMICAL
broke on top, narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to hold a small advantage through the final turn and into the lane, proved no match for the
winner the final furlong, held the place. FIRST ALTERNATE within striking distance off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide and between horses
late in the final turn, forced the issue past the furlong marker then could not keep up with the top two. GOODBYE EARL lacked speed, swung out widest for
the drive, slowly gaining for the show late. MAGIC DANCE ducked out at the start, mid pack while racing outside, loomed closer four wide and inside the
winner turning for home, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. READY ORB NOT within striking distance while racing toward the
inside, came up empty for the drive. PROFOUND LEGACY, fractious in the gate, pressed the runner up in the two path, vied out of the final turn then gave
way. EVA'S CANDY last away, trailed throughout, well beaten in showing little.

Footnotes
K J'S NOBILITY patiently handled toward the inside behind the first flight, continued to track through the turn, switched out when straightened up for the
drive, challenged a furlong out, kicked clear. BANDIT POINT fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag into the turn, asked for some run soon after,
swung out six wide turning for home, accelerated past the furlong marker to be clearly second best while remaining well out in the strip. GLACKEN'S
GHOST with the pace three wide and between horses, proved no match for the top two the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. J. E.'S
HANDMEDOWN broke with the field, fell back to race with the second flight into the turn, three wide into the stretch, steered out, improved position with
some late interest. ROCK CITY ROADHOG back off the early pace, moved slightly closer while saving some ground into the stretch, shifted out a bit for the
run to the wire and finished up evenly. HOONANI ROAD lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing punch in the drive. RACER with
the pace outside, continued to vie four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. HERITAGE PARK broke sharp, narrowly set the pace four a half along the
inside, gave way the final furlong. DESTINY WAY contested the pace three wide and between rivals for four furlongs, also faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS broke well, set the pace along the inside, long drive, dug in to find more late closest to the inside to narrowly prevail.
SCRUTINIZER never far back off the inside, advanced to challenge on the outside turning for home, put a head in front past the furlong marker, was
outfinished late. DRC ALL INCLUSIVE away in good order, pressed early off the inside, vied between foes into the lane, long drive, not enough while
remaining between the top two to the wire. CHIEF OF STAFF within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, asked to run late in the bend, had
little for the top three in the drive while angling in. TALE OF FAME went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. BAJAN CASH broke back,
lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, improved a bit after moving off the inside for the drive. AIR POWER failed to menace while racing four wide.
KAPELLMEISTER in mid pack, had nothing for the drve. ENDER off slow, raced far back for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. ROARING RULE was never involved. BIG SPORT in mid pack early, steadily faded.
