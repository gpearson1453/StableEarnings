Footnotes
SENATOR CON went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, shook off the challenge of TIME TO ROME when asked inside the
five-sixteenths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed whip approaching the furlong marker and drew off under strong urging.
LAST NITE OUT went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was given his cue while four wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the
stretch then drifted further out under a left-handed whip while still on his inside lead, switched to a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, swapped to
the proper lead outside the furlong marker and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. DON GUILLERMO was last to commence then
climbed into the first turn, saved ground while rank under tight restraint on that bend then was rated off the pace on the backstretch, was let out near the
seven-sixteenths then came under urging while inside on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TIME TO
ROME broke out then was hustled, went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the winner on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn,
made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, was turned back by the winner outside the quarter-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
MR. AL'S GAL stalked the pace on the outside, was carried five wide into the turn and steadied, continued five wide on that bend, dropped in while gaining
into upper stretch, bumped with SILVER SQUALL while making a bid at the three-sixteenths then took the advantage shortly thereafter, battled outside of
the runner-up while continuing on her inside lead in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. TENPINS TEMPO was well placed just off the pace,
took the lead when the pacesetter lugged out early on the turn, raced inside on that bend, spun into the two path entering the stretch, was headed by the
winner just inside the three-sixteenths, fought on with that foe in the final sixteenth but was outfinished while clear for the place. FAME FEATHER had her
head-turned at the break and was off slow, spotted the front a couple of lengths, was rated on the outside then carried out six wide leaving the backstretch,
continued six wide through the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. FORT POLK was off
slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, angled to the rail at the rear of the field, moved out at the half-mile pole, advanced into the turn, went around
that bend in the two path, dropped to the rail while asked for her best in upper stretch and came up empty. SILVER SQUALL broke a half-step slow then
was hustled to the lead, was taken up some while lugging out four wide leaving the backstretch, vied in the four path under urging through that bend,
bumped with the winner at the three-sixteenths and tired.

pole, advanced four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, brushed with BELMAR BEAUTY in upper stretch, dueled outside of that foe in the
final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. BELMAR BEAUTY broke out at the start, settled towards the front on the outside, moved closer leaving the
backstretch, tracked in the three path on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, drifted out under a left-handed whip at the three-sixteenths then
brushed with HEART RIVER, dueled inside that opponent in the final furlong and missed while well clear for the place. SILENT TRICK was urged along on
the outside then carried out near the half-mile pole, moved in leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide under urging on the turn, was driven five
wide into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. CALLHERMRSGELNER was coaxed along off the pace, chased
inside on the turn, was driven into the stretch in the two path and came up empty. STOP THE FRIEND broke very alertly from the outside post, moved in
while going clear under a very tight hold, raced inside to the two path while still under restraint on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the
lead outside the three-sixteenths and gave way. FIVE O'CLOCK was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, moved in near the
half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the turn and was no factor. MAJOR GLADY'S TEAM broke out and bumped with a rival, moved out inside the
five-eighths then continued to move out, dropped in leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. HERO OF LOVE

CANDIZAR brushed with a foe at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch,
advanced quickly leaving the backstretch, gained fast on the pacesetter in the three path on the far turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, moved clear
while floating five wide into the stretch and drew away under strong urging. HE'S THE SOUPERWON went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path,
set the clear pace, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner at the five-sixteenths, lost touch with that foe into upper stretch, drifted out inside
the three-sixteenths and proved no match while able to secure the place. ROSSLARE HARBOUR raced off heels briefly nearing the first turn, went around
that bend inside to the two path, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while inside to the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. ONE HITTER was off slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, saved
ground on the turns, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. LITTLE WISE GUY brushed with a rival at the start, went three wide on the
first turn, settled well off the pace on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, drifted in inside the furlong marker and was no factor.
EXPECT ICE climbed while taking back early, went around the first turn in the two path, followed the solo leader down the backstretch, moved closer near
the seven-sixteenths, dropped back under urging while three wide on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

THERE AND BACK came outward at the start while hustled then settled off the pace, moved in outside the half-mile pole, started the turn in the two path
then moved to the three path, shifted four wide about the five-sixteenths then came under coaxing, rallied outside to take the lead in upper stretch then
moved clear, drifted in while still clear near the sixteenth-pole, drifted out late and bothered UNDERCOVER LOVER and just held on the wire. GROVE
DADDY settled off the pace, was urged along while three then two wide on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied outside while still on her
inside lead in the final furlong, closed well into the final sixteenth, drifted out late and just missed. UNDERCOVER LOVER settled well off the pace, went
three wide early on the turn then dropped to the inside, saved ground from that point into the stretch then came under the whip, moved to the two path while
rallying approaching the furlong marker, gained fast into the final sixteenth, moved out behind the winner late then steadied when that foe drifted out and
was clear for the show. PAPAJUDGY showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. ACE

up empty. COLTONATOR leaned out and broke a step slow, was ridden along on the outside, moved closer while four then five wide on the turn but lacked
the needed response. COOL QUARTET was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out in the vicinity

SOUTHERN LIAISON settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead at the
three-sixteenths, battled with the runner-up until inside the furlong marker, moved clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging.
ORETTA chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, made a bid between horses at the three-sixteenths, drifted in into
the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. SINCERITY settled well off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn
then was roused, moved off the rail while gaining into upper stretch, bumped with foes on both sides outside the three-sixteenths, chased into the final
furlong, dropped to the rail outside the sixteenth-pole, took a couple of awkward strides while crowded against the rail at the sixteenth-pole then flattened
late while clear for the show. SIENNA BREEZE disputed the pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the turn, dropped back some nearing the
quarter-pole then spun four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong then moved out and tired. STORIED TRIP came in at the start then bumped
hard with a rival and dropped back, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. R T'S DUCHESS bumped hard with a
rival at the start while last away, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to rally. ERICKA ROCKS was fractious leaving the
tunnel from the paddock then reluctant to load, came away in good order, moved in while showing good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival,
vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the inside, fell back into upper stretch, bumped with a foe while dropping out of contention nearing the
three-sixteenths and gave way. WILDABOUT AUDREY was urged along off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the
stretch, bumped with foes on both sides outside the three-sixteenths and came up empty. STAR'S DREAM was urged along at the rear, went around the
turn in the two path and showed little. LADY HOPPER bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, moved up on the outside, made a bid while five
then four wide on the turn, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, dropped to the two path while moving clear briefly into the stretch, lost the advantage at
the three-sixteenths and faltered. Following an objection by the rider of SIENNA BREEZE against ORETTA for alleged interference near the furlong marker,
no change was made to the order of finish.
