Footnotes
DRAKKAR disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail under urging while still inside that foe on the turn, shook clear under a right-handed
whip in upper stretch and held under steady urging. LENAPE DRIVE bumped solidly with a foe at the start then had SPARKYS SURPRISE clip his hind left
leg, was taken in hand early then well placed behind the front three, came under urging in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, chased
DRAKKAR while outside in the drive and held the place while unable to make much ground on the aforementioned rival. SPARKYS SURPRISE had his right
foreleg clip the hind left leg of LENAPE DRIVE after the start and bobbled, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch, angled out under a drive near the three-sixteenths and finished fast for the show but was belatedly on the scene for the victory.
CARTER CAT settled on the outside, was urged along while four then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, dropped in near the
furlong marker and gained late but missed the show. CLUB SODA disputed the pace on the outside of the winner while loosely between horses, vied in the
two path while still outside of the winner on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out into the final furlong, drifted out again near the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. WILDCAT SAINT bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, settled in the back half of the field, went
two then three wide early on the turn, was roused while lugging out five wide near the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. ADRENALINE was fractious in the gate, bumped soundly with a foe at the start and was turned sideways, pressed the pace on the outside of the
leading duo, chased three to four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and faltered. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
HURRICANE DANCER showed good speed and set the pace, raced inside on the turn, was asked when confronted by PYSER'S ORB coming to the
five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the runner-up while under a drive in upper stretch, fought back gamely into the final furlong, regained the advantage outside
the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. PYSER'S ORB broke out at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked while
three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage back to the winner inside the
furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place. CONQUISTADOR SHOW was urged along on the outside, chased in the five then six path on
the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and weakened while clear for the show. MAKBULE brushed with a foe early and was taken up briefly, settled
off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. HERO OF THE FUTURE
was hustled from the start, settled on the outside, moved in some near the half-mile pole, was asked while three to four wide on the turn, dropped in under a
drive in upper stretch and came up empty. TORNADO BOY was carried in some early then brushed with foes and was taken up then dropped back, angled
in at the rear midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. F J'S GEM came in early and brushed with a foe, angled quickly to
the outside, went around the turn in the six path, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LIL KYLIE brushed the outer foe lightly at the start, quickly recovered to move clear dictating terms on or just off the rail, faced an outside challenger on the
far turn, put to a drive by upper stretch, dueled with that rival through the lane but maintained the advantage throughout. SUPERSPORT SALLY shifted in
heading to the first turn going in the two path into that bend then racing in behind the leaders on or just off the rail, moved out a bit up the backstretch and
advanced on the leader into the far turn, drew along that one's flank two to three wide through the far turn, got to within half a length turning for home and
dueled late but could not get by while clearly second best. JUANANDORA was lightly brushed on both sides at the start then taken strongly but briefly in
hand off rivals into the first turn, moved out a bit going in the three to four path on that bend, moved back in a bit up the backstretch to enter the far turn
three deep quickly moving out five wide on the turn, ran on to get up for show honors. LADY FITZGERALD exchanged a brush and slightly steadied at the
break, shifted in going on or just off the rail at the rear through the first turn, was off the fence up the backstretch advancing two wide on the far turn,
bumped an inside rival on that bend near the five-sixteenths, came out a bit in the stretch and ran on. MISTY ICE made contact with the inside rival at the
start, was forwardly-placed three to four wide into the first turn, stalked from outside up the backstretch into the far turn going four wide on that bend and
asked for run by the five-sixteenths but could produce no rally and weakened in the stretch. BELLE FORCE brushed with the outside rival at the start, raced
mid-pack in behind rivals in the three path early and up the backstretch, was ridden along by the half-mile marker but had no response and failed to rally.
MEG AND CLAIR raced outside rivals five wide on the first turn, continued to pursue the leader up the backstretch, dropped back four to five wide on the far
turn and faded. GUESTAR raced on or off the rail well back in the early going, continued along the inside on the far turn, was bumped and checked sharply
at the five-sixteenths, was eased thereafter, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
IRRITATOR stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into upper stretch, took the
advantage under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, kicked clear under the whip outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up in the final forty yards
while much the best. MUSTANG CAT settled in third position, chased inside on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the two path, pursued the leaders under
a drive into the final furlong and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. ROGER BROWN broke very fast, crossed over while moving clear,
raced inside on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner entering the final furlong and weakened while just able to get the
show. WHISKEY BRAVO was urged along towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, angled out significantly in upper stretch and improved
position in the center of the course to just miss the show. FLASH ATTACK was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, bumped with SPECTROLITE
while between horses leaving the backstretch then steadied and dropped back, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. V TACH M. D. bumped hard twice with a rival at the start while last away, settled towards the back on the far outside, went five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ALITTLEVODKA broke out but was quickly corrected then hustled, raced on the
outside under some urging, was ridden along in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the whip and came up empty.
SPECTROLITE settled off the pace, bumped with FLASH ATTACK leaving the backstretch then checked and dropped back, saved ground on the turn and
failed to respond. FLEETWAY bumped hard twice with a rival at the start then was taken up, raced at the rear of the field, went three wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 27 Feet)

BYE BYE SHANGHAI was bumped around from both sides and squeezed back while steadying slightly at the start, climbed a bit early, raced last but one in
the two path on the first turn, edged closer up the backstretch having switched out, went five wide on the far turn, gained steadily through the stretch and
just got up over DAD SAID NO, who tracked mid-pack inside on or just off the rail, encouraged along a bit in the two path on the far turn, came into upper
stretch four deep, took a narrow lead nearing the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. HOMEVIEW bumped the inside rival then a further inside foe multiple
times at the start, was forwardly-placed inside B W P EXPRESS but off the fence in the two to three path early on the first turn, switched outside that rival as
that one moved in heading up the backstretch to stalk from outside, moved to challenge on the far turn taking the lead about the five-sixteenths, led past the
furlong marker but had no extra. SUMNER tossed his head and was off a bit slowly while getting bumped at the start, raced inside through the first turn,
moved out early up the backstretch before angling back to the rail heading into the far turn, saved ground on that bend then came out in upper stretch and
ran on. B W P EXPRESS moved forward outside a rival four wide on the first turn shifting in having reach the backstretch, moved to the rail once clear early
up the backstretch dictating terms, was challenged by an outside foe on the far turn, headed by the five-sixteenths, then weakened in the final furlong.
SUPER FACTOR bumped the outer rival at the start, continued to move out into the first turn entering that bend in the five path before gradually moving in
four then three deep late, continued tracking mid-pack outside a rival up the backstretch, went three deep on the far turn and failed to threaten. SMITHWICK
raced between foes three deep into the first turn before easing back and moving out to the five path early on that bend, stalked from off the inside up the
backstretch, went four wide on the far turn while dropping back and came up empty. GET IT TO GEAUX raced outside in the three path on the turns and
was never a threat.

Footnotes
LUCK OF THE DRAW was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, moved off the rail late on that bend, shifted
three wide while still behind horses into the stretch, found room coming to the three-sixteenths then accelerated under one tap of a down-turned whip and
hand urging, took over outside the furlong marker under mild urging, swapped leads back and forth in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and proved best
under a hand ride to win ridden out. BAYOU JAM was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged
along passing the half-mile pole, chased two to three wide early on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch while on
even terms for the lead, battled with the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. LOVE THAT WARRIOR
went four then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch then moved
further out under a drive, chased outside into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. J C'S IN TOWN bumped with a rival at
the start while also bumping lightly with another foe then exchanged bumps, went four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged
up four wide on the far turn, made a bid in the six path into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. PURE BINGO went
five then four wide on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field on the outside, was roused while four then five wide on the far turn, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SHAE'S DAY dropped back after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the
field, was roused while three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. SILENT CRY bumped lightly with a
rival at the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, moved
out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. TUNE MY GUITAR dropped from the two path to the rail under restraint on the first turn, came under urging early
on the backstretch, was ridden along while inside to the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond.
EATORBEEATEN went to the front, raced in the two path for most of the first turn then dropped to the inside, set the pace, was asked under threat from two
foes at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead into the stretch and faded. PANCHO'S LUCKY BOY exchanged multiple bumps with a rival at the start, rounded the
first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, was hard ridden late on the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path and faltered then was eased
but walked off. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
ECHOESOFTIME set the pace with outside pressure, edged clear leaving the turn racing in the two path through that bend, came in a bit having reached
upper stretch under strong hand-urging then drifted out from a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, was corrected at that juncture but drifted out again
with each subsequent strike from the stick while also being corrected after each instance and held sway. ESPERANZA DIAMOND pressed the winner from
outside, went three wide on the turn, altered out near the furlong grounds as the aforementioned came out, kept on gamely late. LOVELY CHARLIE tracked
just in behind the leading pair going on or just off the rail through the turn leaving that bend along the inside, came out a path in upper stretch with the
attempt to bid between rivals but lacked room then altered in near the furlong marker and weakened in late stretch but held show from YALISHA,who was a
bit slow into stride trailing early, entered the turn in the four path beginning to advance and moving in to the three path about midway on that bend, came out
a bit into upper stretch and ran on evenly late. Z PRIDE chased from off the inside going in the three path into the turn, moved to the four path outside
YALISHA late on that bend and further still coming to the quarter pole five deep however failed to rally. SETHAMEE STREET was encouraged along inside
but had no late response and came up empty. FAIRWELL TAX BREAK dumped the rider near the six-and-a-half and got loose in the warm-up running the
wrong way about a quarter mile before being caught by the outrider, showed very brief interest then quickly dropped back going in the six to seven path on
the turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, no action was taken.

Footnotes
WHATELSE IGOT TODO came outward at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader leaving the backstretch, took the advantage
in the three path before the three-eighths, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, tipped into the four path entering the stretch then was asked for his best,
drifted out while extending the advantage inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under strong urging. MAJOR RIDGE broke out but was quickly
corrected by the rider, settled towards the rear on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, angled
out nearing the three-sixteenths then drifted out, drifted out again near the sixteenth-pole and got up for the place. TIN ROOF RUSTED was bumped in the
hindquarters after the start, raced on the outside while coaxed along, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive
near the three-sixteenths and just missed the place. KING BANDIT was urged along towards the front, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven four
wide into the stretch, dropped well behind the winner while still on his inside lead in the drive and weakened then lost the trifecta. FAT CLEMENZA came
outward at the start then bumped with an opponent, was urged along towards the front, chased three to four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the
stretch and tired. MY BUDDY CHUCK bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
STEPPIN' OUTONHER bumped with foes on both sides after the start, settled off the pace, moved in leaving the backstretch, was urged along in the two
path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and faltered then was
wrapped up nearing the wire. MY PROPHET bumped with rivals on both sides after the start, settled off the pace under some urging, chased four to five
wide on the turn, floated six to seven wide into upper stretch and capitulated. GIFTED RICHTER bumped lightly with a foe at the start then was hustled to
the lead, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, lost the advantage while inside early on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.
