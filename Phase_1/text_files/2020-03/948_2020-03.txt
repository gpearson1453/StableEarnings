Footnotes
IN IT FOR LIFE stalked from the inside, shifted out entering the turn then quickly angled back to the inside on the turn, saved ground loomed boldly into the
stretch, collared the leader at the eighth pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under right-handed and left-handed urging. INDIAS LUTE trailed
the field from off the rail early then went outside a rival, angled out on the turn and came four wide into the stretch, rallied and proved second best. HOPE
PARKWAY chased the pace from off the rail, angled in on the turn, continued along the fence into the drive and showed a mild response to earn the show.
IZZY'S INPUT pressed the pace from the inside then chased the leader into the turn, angled outside the pacesetter and entered the stretch three wide, then
weakened in the final furlong. MOTHER SUPREME set the pace and angled in some on the backstretch, cleared inside rival and entered the turn in the two
path, held command through the turn but saw that lead diminish approaching the lane, lost command just past the eighth pole and tired in the late stages.

REAL QUICK sped clear in the early stages, set the pace a bit off the rail, inched away from along the fence around the turn, urged right-handed in the lane
and kept to task to the wire. FANDAREL DANCER away sharply from the start, between runners early then chased a bit off the rail, raced two wide
approaching the quarter pole, moved over to the inside on the turn then back out into the two path entering the stretch and fended off SURFING ANGEL for
the place. SURFING ANGEL bumped from the inside, showed early speed from the outside then chased the leader outside a rival, took the turn two wide
then came three wide into the stretch, continued outside of FANDAREL DANCER through the lane and could not get by for the place. BRAVE ACTION
chased along the inside, lost ground around the turn and failed to rally. AVO broke out and bumped rival at the start, angled to the inside, raced along or a
bit off the rail on the backstretch, continued near the inside on the turn then swung out nearing the stretch but had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CHRISISCOOKIN stalked the pacesetter in the early stages, bid from the outside and gained command midway through the turn, cleared rival nearing the
stretch and held safely in the final sixteenth. EVENING REWARD stalked from the inside, two wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied in the
lane and held the place. IT'S JUST BOB raced between rivals up the backstretch, bumped with rival entering the turn, moved over to the rail and saved
ground to the stretch, came off the inside, rallied and missed the place. SEATTLE ENCOUNTER raced three deep off the pace, went two wide and outside
a rival through the turn, kept on willingly in the final furlong and improved position. OVER EZ chased the pace off the rail then outside a rival, went three
wide into the stretch and never produced a bid. SHADOW OP off alertly from the outside, set the pace and crossed over, carried the lead from the inside to
the turn, challenged around the bend and lost command, chased from the inside into the stretch and weakened. IRISH SKY off a bit slow to begin, crowded
along the inside and steadied soon after the start, continued along the inside and bumped rival entering the turn, moved off the rail and came three wide into
the stretch but came up empty in the final furlong.
