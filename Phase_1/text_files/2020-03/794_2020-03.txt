RISAALAAT moved to the front leaving the chute, was clear before going a furlong, was rated along the rail for a half, ran out entering the stretch then was
put to whip. LITTLEBITALILY ducked out into TRUE UPGRADE and bobbled soon after the break, chased the winner in the two path but lacked the needed
closing. IVANYA broke slowly, stayed inside and outfinished tired ones. TRUE UPGRADE was carried out leaving the gate, raced three wide around the
turn and tired in the lane. BOBBY'S SONG trailed.

Footnotes
THATTA BOY GIRL dueled along the inside of TRAPPS STAR early on, put away that rival into the turn while receiving a challenge from SNEAKY
COWGIRL, shifted to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to meet that foe's bid, dug in and repelled that rival passing the furlong pole, and was geared
down in the late stages. SNEAKY COWGIRL raced in range four wide and outside of rivals down the backstretch, moved forward and bid for the lead into
the turn, vied outside of THATTA BOY GIRL around the turn while being kept in the four path by that rival, but flattened out, was repelled at the furlong pole,
and held place to the wire. VERRAZANO VITTORIA prompted the early duelers from the three path, got outmoved by SNEAKY COWGIRL into the turn,
shifted to the five path at the five sixteenths pole to be outside of that foe, then finished evenly while gaining on that rival for place. SHE'S RUNNING FREE
trailed in the three path around the turn, and made a mild rally without threatening. RAISEDTOBEAWARRIOR stalked along the inside, but failed to keep
pace with the leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, then failed to make a bid through the lane and weakened. TRAPPS STAR dueled outside of THATTA
BOY GIRL through the early stages, but rapidly weakened between horses into the turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
STOLEN LOVE rushed the gate right before it opened, causing the rider to restrain him, then to be off slow once the gates opened, quickly angled to the rail
and advanced inside of rivals around the first turn to an inside stalking position, shifted off of the rail around the far turn to make a two wide bid for the lead
at the quarter pole, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, and prevailed over his inner game rival. BIG CITY BLUES set the pace along the inside, built a
clear advantage passing the half mile pole and held it around the far turn, dug in turning for home when engaged by STOLEN LOVE, got headed by that
rival approaching the furlong pole, battled on to the wire, but was bested. GILGIMESH stalked two wide early on, then chased three wide around the far turn
as STOLEN LOVE shifted off of the fence, but failed to keep pace with that rival and the leader turning for home, lugged in through the lane, but held show.
SCURLIN took the first turn in the three path in midpack before shifting to the four path into the backstretch, but failed to make an impact. TINTO MESA
trailed in the two path around the first turn, then trailed in the three to four path around the far turn, and failed to factor. MAJESTIC CALLING raced in
midpack two to three wide between horses around the first turn, but came under a drive into the far turn, offered no response, and weakened through the
lane.

Footnotes
REVOLUTIONARY MARY was taken well in hand while chasing in the three path outside the early leader, moved to the front early on the far turn, was clear
soon after then was put to whip in the lane. CAROUSEL MARGE was unhurried outside, moved closer under urging in the three path on the final turn but
flattened out in the lane. ARCTICA moved clear in the two path early on the first turn, remained in command into the far turn then stopped. PINK wasn't far
back along the rail to the end of the backstretch then stopped. VANESSA'S SECRET went up in the air leaving the gate, hit the inside door, came in,
bumped BUCKS COUNTY then was outrun. BUCKS COUNTY was bumped leaving the gate, faded after a half and was eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
DR. ANN set the pace in the two path from the onset, rated in hand down the backstretch while holding her margin, drew off in upper stretch after turning for
home in the three path, and held safely to the wire as her margin narrowed. B B'S BUSTED was off slowly and trailed the field to the far turn, ran up
between horses into that bend, but was tentative to squeeze through a narrow gap between those rivals at the five sixteenths pole, finally surged through
them at the three sixteenths pole, offered a strong finish through the late stages, but ran out of ground. ALLISON K advanced along the inside of rivals
through the far turn to forge place turning for home, but proved no match for the leader, was surpassed by the fast closing B B'S BUSTED inside the furlong
pole, and held show. TAKE ME HOME stalked outside of the leader from the three path, came under coaxing to keep pace at the half mile pole, was floated
to the four path by the leader turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch and got outfinished for show. DI tracked from midpack in the four path and
outside of rivals, but came under a drive to keep pace at the five furlong pole, was put to an all out drive into the far turn, but failed to respond, and
weakened. PENNY IN LOVE was forwardly placed along the inside, but drifted off of the rail into the far turn, and weakened between horses at the five
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SMARTY PI wasn't far back while two wide between rivals into the turn, swung wide into the stretch, closed a gap from the outside in the final yards and
was up. RISQUE'S TREASURE moved to a short lead before going a furlong, drew clear into the turn, widened into the stretch, held a clear lead late, drifted
far out and was caught as the rider stood up before the finish. BAYLEAF was never far back, advanced the rail around the turn, came out entering the
stretch while inside the winner but couldn't keep up late with that one. LISA MILA chased the early leader while three wide around the turn then tired in the
lane. UNEMOTIONAL raced the three path and failed to menace. BELLAS EYES was outrun after a slow break. GRETA GRETA BOO was reluctant to
load, wasn't far back in the four path into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
HASHTAG WINNING established a clear lead early on in the two path, widened easily away from the field in the three path into the far turn, and was
confidently handled through the lane with an insurmountable lead. CANT STOP THE RAIN trailed along the inside, rallied three wide around the far turn to
offer a four wide place bid at the furlong pole, reached that position inside the final sixteenth, but was no match for the winner. THE MONEY TRAIN stalked
from outside of the loose leader in the three path early on, but failed to keep pace with that foe into the far turn, dug in between horses for place at the
furlong pole, but got outfinished for that position by an oncharging outer rival. RIDE THIS TRAIN raced far off of the pace two wide, angled in turning for
home and produced a bid for place inside of rivals at the furlong pole, but got outfinished. THE ACCUSER tracked two wide, made a three wide bid for place
turning for home, but weakened. DUNK A DIN saved ground from midpack, but weakened passing the half mile pole. STONE CRAZY raced three wide and
far off of the pace early on, but weakened to trail the field into the far turn, and never got involved.
