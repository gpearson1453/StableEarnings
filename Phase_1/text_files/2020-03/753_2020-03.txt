Footnotes
SURF N SKI was hustled along to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by TATAR nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
vied with that rival, edged away and held off the closing CONQUEST TRIUMPH diminishing margin. CONQUEST TRIUMPH settled off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner late to just miss. CELESTIAL COWBOY was reserved
just off the leaders from the inside, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. EDGE OF ACKWORTH chased the leaders while racing four-wide,
angled in and out through the lane and finished willingly when clear. TATAR pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival but could not match strides and gave way through the final furlong. ZIPTIME showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CORONA BEACH lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace.
EMBELLISHING BOB was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was eased through the lane.
