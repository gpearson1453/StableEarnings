pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, dug in to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. KING OF BLUES settled off the rail through
the opening turn then bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out nearing the head of the lane and dug in to take third the final
yards while outfinished for second. SUAVE JUAN took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, gave up the lead inside the eighth pole and flattened out the final sixteenth.
RATLTRAP raced in the three and four paths the opening turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, drew to

and took the lead mid-stretch then drew away through later yards. CANDY MAN ONE accelerated to the lead and tapered to the inside to rate the pace,
widened the advantage from the half mile pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, raced at the rail through the far turn but was caught
mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. FAPPIANO ROCKET settled off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn but weakened inside the sixteenth pole. BRUTUS BRAE saved ground off the early pace, bid mildly from the three
eighths pole and raced off the rail through the far turn. MINI BOLT raced well back saving early ground then bid leaving the three eighths pole and passed
some rivals. FEAR THE LATI rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. DEPUTY JAMES raced off

the lead past the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear at the five sixteenths, came under pressure into the far turn and dueled gamely to deep stretch before
ceding; reluctantly. CASHTON PEAK settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened
stride later yards. DEPUTY DREW saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn then showed
little more. BAY HILL rounded the opening turn about the three path then raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. BANISHMENT

CALADAN took the lead in the four path entering the first turn then moved to the inside to rate the pace, was urged past the three eighths pole then steadily
handled through the lane. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced well reserved at the back of the pack, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily progressed to
take second mid-stretch. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE saved ground close to the pace then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened
inside the eighth pole. WHISKEY CREEK saved ground early on while racing well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the four path, drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little more. SPECIAL SEASON (GB) stalked the pace from the two and three paths, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. PAT'S SHOES settled off the pace about the three path and showed
little response through the backstretch. KATMAN QUICK mostly saved ground. HOWYAFORMONEY settled off the early pace in the three and four paths,
raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
ALPHASTEST took quick control of the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole and held on well under steady stretch
encouragement. DUM SPIRO SPERO stalked the early pace from the two and three paths and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
range of the winner to the top of the lane but was turned back from the eighth pole. SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was gaining on the runner-up in an even finish. AGENT BOND rounded the opening turn in the four
path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, maintained the four path on the far turn but showed little more.
WISPER FREEDOM raced close to the early pace toward the inside but dropped back through the opening turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened. ODDS R AGAINST US showed little response after saving ground the first turn. EXPLOITATION showed
little response after a half mile. CAPITAL ASSET saved ground racing well back. MY HALO raced in the five path the opening turn and was not a factor.
PLEASANTLY ROYAL rounded the opening turn in the five path and was never a factor.
