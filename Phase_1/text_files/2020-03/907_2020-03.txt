Footnotes
FRIGID was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and finished well to get up under all out pressure. WACCA WACCA WACCA
showed good early speed, raced well off the inside through the lane and finished second best. ONE LITTLE INDY stalked the pace along the inside, led into
the lane and weakened in the latter stages. LEGENDARY SONG was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and showed good
late interest. PRETTY KITTY stalked the pace from the outside, raced three wide and weakened. DREAMINGNDIAMONDS saved ground and never was a
factor. DUBLINTHEMONEY was unhurried early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had no response. TREVOR'S FOREVER pressed the pace
and tired. LADYBUG'S HOLIDAY was off slowly and never was a factor. BLINKERSONLETHERIP failed to sustain a bid.
