Footnotes
LIL' CHIEFTAIN dueled from the rail to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch and held under steady urging. OOPPER WALLAH was
outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, shifted out widest then closed steadily to the line. LU CAT had his head turned at the start and broke a
bit slow, tracked the leaders three wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not save the place. ZIPPY GROOM had no speed, shifted off the rail
mid turn then was closing a bit late. UNION WINE hustled to duel for the lead outside the winner to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
FAST SALE had no speed and was not a factor.

KLAY NATION sped clear, set all the pace to the stretch then was under steady urging to the line. CARTERS BLUE broke half a step slow and was
outsprinted, saved ground to the stretch then finished steadily for the place. BABY YOU GOT IT was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to
the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. HAWTHORNE LANE lagged to the turn, came three wide to the stretch, could not threaten but was closing
the gap. MARINOS LAW was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but was tiring in the late stages. FORT YORK also chased the winner early,
raced three wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. TANNER'S MY NAME saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LUCKY CHRISTIANA was outsprinted to the turn while two wide, swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed determinedly to be
along in time. I LOVE ROMANCE tracked the pace to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then shifted out and
surged between rivals to grab the place. KELLY stalked the leaders from the rail to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch, was caught by the winner
inside the sixteenth marker and nailed on the line for the place. PREMIERE LADY had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch, gamely stayed on to
mid stretch then was outfinished late. NAMORITA was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed response. CROWN
KITTEN had no speed, trailed to the stretch in the two path and also failed to threaten late. IMPECUNIOUS attended the pace three wide to the stretch then
tired in the drive.

MUSKETIER WALTZ was crowded by A WILL AN A WAY and checked back to begin, settled on the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, shifted
out for room in upper stretch, rallied when clear and closed fast to win going away. AUTISM'S QUEST was allowed to settle to the second turn, rallied three
wide to the stretch, was up to engage for the lead in mid stretch, may have put a nose in front a sixteenth out but was outfinished for the win. ANGELIN THE
HARBOR set the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, responded to mid stretch, stayed on then was outfinished in the late stages. PULPIT
SINGER tracked the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, was a factor to mid stretch and kept on in the final sixteenth. FANTASY GOLF
GAL was settled to the half, saved ground on the second turn, rallied to loom boldly a furlong out but lost her punch late. SILVER SCRIPT had no speed,
was fanned four wide on the second turn then lacked a response in the drive. CAPO VINO had no speed and was never a threat. A WILL AND A WAY
pressed the pace for six furlongs then got outrun in upper stretch and tired. SATIN MUSIC was settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then
gave way.

CRAZY SEXY MUNNY was rated patiently off the leader to the second turn, pushed up to engage for the lead at that point, edged away to mid stretch and
held driving. POSH HOLLY (IRE) tracked the pace to the second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch and was making up ground but too late.
LADY PHYLLIS was settled for a half mile, got fanned out to the four path on the second turn, offered a bid to mid stretch then was outfinished. FLASHY
HERO had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch and was also closing belatedly. PURE PERFECTION trailed to the second
turn, raced three wide to the stretch but could not threaten in the drive. SAY IT WITH ROSES hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure from the
winner to the second turn, saved ground but was overtaken into the stretch and tired. NORTHERN ROSE tracked the leader to the second turn then also
saved ground to the stretch but weakened in mid stretch.

AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide to the stretch, took over nearing mid stretch and held off AWESOME
SUMMER determinedly. AWESOME SUMMER chased the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then battled willingly but could not catch
the winner. WINE AND WHISKY never far back to the half, was two wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly and got the
nod for the show. PRINCE DE PRINCE set the pace from the rail for six furlongs, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. FINAL FINAL had no
speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. CAJUN BETTOR trailed to the second turn, was two
then three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. MYSTERIOUS STONES was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, also
raced two then three wide to the stretch but weakened in mid stretch.. CALL ME PEPPY tracked the pace from the rail to the second turn but gave way after
six furlongs.

chased the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then rallied inside to loom boldly to deep stretch but got outkicked by the top two. RESPECT THE
HUSTLE had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out and closed willingly. ITALIANO was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the
stretch then also shifted out and closed ground belatedly. SEQUENTIALLY had no speed, saved ground to the stretch and was showing some interest late.
