LA GUAPA VELOS was unhurried to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch and held driving. SWEET CHAYANE
broke out, crowded FRANK'S FRIEDA at the start, had no speed, settled to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide to the stretch then finished
in rally. BANK OF MANY dueled for the lead outside of DOUBELIEVENMAGIC, responded to pressure to mid stretch then was collared by the winner and
finished evenly. NOBLE GIRL was allowed to settle to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, shifted out widest for the drive but lacked the
needed late response. PLEASE ZIP IT stalked the leaders four wide to the half, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and tired.
FRANK'S FRIEDA was crowded by SWEET CHAYANE and took up at the start, had no speed and was not a factor. DOUBELIEVENMAGIC attended the
pace inside of BANK OF MANY, tired on the second turn then stopped in the stretch.

IRREFUTABLE was quickest, set the pace from the rail, responded when challenged on the second turn, dug in stubbornly and held. IMPERATOR pressed
the winner throughout, came two wide to the stretch, responded late and saved the place. BOYSON tracked the top two to the second turn, saved ground to
the stretch, shifted out and closed steadily but too late. ELECTORAL was four wide into the first turn, eased down to the two path to t he backstretch, was
roused two then three wide on the second turn but could not offer the needed late response. MAD AT MONEY trailed to the second turn, got fanned four
wide to the stretch but also did not threaten in the drive. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE tracked the leader to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, tired
then stopped in the final sixteenth.

FAR WEST had no speed, was fanned four wide to the stretch, shifted out for room then rallied once clear and closed steadily to be along in time. HOW'S
MY HERO pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to collar SMOKIN ENCOUNTER in mid stretch, battled that one through the final furlong but
could not hold off the winner. SMOKIN ENCOUNTER set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared in mid stretch but dug in determinedly in the final
furlong and just missed. POWER TIMES TWO tracked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on willingly to
the line. CASH MONEY had no speed and trailed, was three wide into the turn then swung out five deep into the stretch and finished in a rally. STONE
GROOVE chased the pace three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. HOT'N NOTTY was outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no
avail.
