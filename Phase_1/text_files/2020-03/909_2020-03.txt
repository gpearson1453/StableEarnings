Footnotes
ALEX'S BOURBON disputed the pace two to three wide outside LEIGHTON KENTUCKY, moved to near even terms approaching the stretch, seized
command in mid stretch, kicked clear under right handed rousing then was kept to some hand pressure through the final seventy yards. LEIGHTON
KENTUCKY took over early and set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled into the lane, could not hold off the winner leaving mid stretch, weakened in
the final sixteenth but managed to save the place. HEY ROXY hopped at the break, regrouped and edged up to the outside of a rival, raced between foes
into the stretch, shifted out some and closed steadily. WHEW drafted back off the contested pace while four wide, circled five wide into the lane and finished
with good energy. ZAN CREEK , in the clear early on and in pursuit of the leaders, came four wide for the drive but failed to generate a solid response.
SHE'S GOT FRIENDS broke a step slow, saved ground while off the pace, was under pressure around the turn but could not make an impact. HAVINGAFIT
dropped off the pace while three wide and never got involved.

Footnotes
AGGIEVILLE sped to the front, was headed from the outside approaching the turn, rebid inside the leader nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear clear three
wide soon into the lane, drifted out a bit past the furlong grounds but held firm under right handed encouragement. RACE THE MOON , off the rail giving
chase, split rivals mid turn, bid four wide outside the top pair near the quarter pole, wandered outward some while pursuing past mid stretch and kept on
willingly to the wire. MAVERICK BROWN chased well off the inside, drifted six wide while making a run into the lane, corrected and kept trying to the line.
FLOODED saved ground under pressure but lacked a significant response. TACKSON lacked speed, saved ground into the lane, angled out in the final
furlong and offered a mild bid. VISCOSITY rushed up inside soon after the break, gave hard pursuit into the turn, angled out near the quarter pole, raced
between rivals in upper stretch but came up empty. IMA SOONERS FAN , four wide leaving the far turn, circled seven wide into the lane but failed to
menace. COOK , off the pace and inside foes early on, angled four wide into the stretch but failed to threaten. MUSTANG EDDIE broke outward, dropped
off the pace, raced four to five wide and did not make an impact. LOOK AT IT dropped back after an alert start, raced three wide into the stretch and lacked
a response. FRED C bid outside AGGIEVILLE to take command into the turn, edged away a bit mid turn, ceded commadn approaching the stretch, stopped
in upper stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
MAN U cruised up to take command inside rivals in the opening sixteenths, set a pressured pace towards the rail, was roused clear and guided three wide
soon into the lane, kept on under right handed rousing past the furlong grounds and held sway. KWIK was taken to rate some early on, advanced between
foes mid turn, angled in and finished well to gain. STRONG SIDE stalked the leaders, edged up three wide to have aim past the five sixteenths, came four
wide into the lane, drifted out pursuing past mid stretch and came back in the final seventy yards. DANCE DOCTOR broke awkwardly and was attempting to
get out some early on, recovered and moved up three wide, took closer order between foes near the quarter pole, swung well wide into the lane and gave
effort to the line. BURTNJOE , with the early pace three deep, pressed two wide around the turn, failed to kick on with the winner soon into the stretch and
faded in the final sixteenth. CALL ME lagged off the pace, raced four wide into the lane, dropped in through the final sixteenth and finished with good
energy. ATOMIC CANDY , four to five wide pursuing the pace, gave way through the drive. TWISTED FACTS vied early between foes, rated back near the
half mile marker, chased and dropped back.

Footnotes
HONEST N LUCKY was sent to the front, handled outside pressure, moved clear past the half mile marker, turned away a threat past the five sixteenths,
opened up after being set down entering the lane, widened in mid stretch then held firm under a drive. TICKLE BUNNY dwelt at the break spotting the field
several lengths, was a bit rank soon after and bore out, regrouped into the first turn, commenced a run after being asked past the half mile marker, circled
four wide advancing outside foes past the five sixteenths, altered inside near the three sixteenths, moved up past mid stretch, came back out a bit and
finished well to bridge the gap. ANY OLE THING stalked inside, swung out four wide under a ride entering the lane, chased with aim but flattened out.
SHAKER BAKER lost ground four wide most of the trip, edged up into the far turn, pursued past the five sixteenths then faded. FINAL DESIGN , with the
pace three deep past the three quarter pole, prompted the issue into the far turn, bid to threaten the winner nearing the five sixteenths, failed to keep pace
leaving the quarter pole and gave way. MORO COMPASS , in range three wide to the three eighths, failed to kick on near the quarter pole and gave way.
TOCCETTA was sent up between foes nearing the backstretch and forced the pace, stayed in range to the far turn then faltered.

SORRYABOUTNOTHING stalked inside, was put to a drive nearing the quarter pole, kept on grinding under left handed encouragement, bid inside
STEPHEN'S ANSWER past the sixteenth marker and forged ahead in the final strides. STEPHEN'S ANSWER took over early and was kept in about the
three path, set a pressured pace under a light hold, shook clear leaving the five eighths, widened a bit while still rated past the five sixteenths, responded to
pressure soon into the lane, remained clear under a drive heading to the sixteenth pole, continued gamely but just could not withstand the winner's charge.
GOT MOJO , between foes early, raced in range past the three eighths, saved ground into the stretch, eased out and kept trying while clearly best of the
rest. UNITED PATRIOT , three to four wide, gave way. NOTORIOUS NICK leaned in at the break, was corrected and forced the issue four wide outside
STEPHEN'S ANSWER, was under pressure pursuing past the five sixteenths then faltered heading towards the furlong grounds.

NURSE LIST was sent from the gate and kicked clear early, set the pace in about the two path, dug in when confronted mid turn, briefly lost command in
upper stretch, battled back under strong handling and to inside of D R C'S ARM CANDY, regained command a furlong out, kept on under strong handling
and prevailed. D R C'S ARM CANDY tracked three wide under rating, moved to engage the winner mid turn, dueled and gained a slim lead near the three
sixteenths, relinquished command a furlong out but kept on willingly to save the place. MISS ORATORY drafted back off the early pace and angled in near
the half mile marker, saved ground from there and finished well to gain. SHE'S EARTHBOUND , between foes nearing the turn, took closer order three wide
mid turn, shifted out and ranged up five wide past the furlong grounds, chased the dueling leaders and hung. TOMEY'S LEXUS , in the clear near the half
mile marker, edged up a bit while between runners past the three eighths, chased the top pair into the lane but came up empty. CHITABELLA flashed speed
towards the inside, pursued into the turn then gave way. SILVER SPLASH broke a step slow, steadied soon after, raced four to five wide and failed to
menace.

LONG RIDE HOME forced the pace three wide outside the leader, drew alongside nearing the lane, took over three sixteenths from home, spurted away
and was kept to a drive. LOS SUENOS advanced inside rivals and took the lead after a furlong, set the pace towards the rail, met the winner's bid past the
five sixteenths, dueled into the lane, gave way grudgingly through the final furlong and was able to save the place. LAKESIDE ROMANCE stalked three to
four wide, moved closer mid turn, had aim into the lane but failed to seriously kick on. POSSE GONE WILD , off the pace and under a ride leaving the three
eighths, raced three wide into the lane, angled out near mid stretch and finished with interest. LANDRY KYLE chased two wide, remained in range to upper
stretch and faded. LITTLESASSYSISTER lacked speed, raced three wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. RIVER WILD lagged back, swung four
wide nearing the quarter pole and had belated action. STATE YOUR MIND failed to menace. SEBASTIANNA was outrun.

Footnotes
SWEET MARY M cleared in the opening furlong and was guided to about the three path, set a rated pace around the turn, turned away a threat soon into
the lane, responded when roused and kicked away under a mild hand ride. SHANGHAI SALLY stalked off the rail, moved up four wide heading to the
quarter pole, was turned away leaving the three sixteenths but continued willingly to be second best. BILLIE G edged up inside nearing the half mile marker,
pursued the winner under pressure into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. EUTYCHIA , between foes nearing the five sixteenths, angled out but
failed to generate a solid run. MIGHTY HEIDI , towards the inside, was not a factor. TURF PRIDE , off the pace, circled five wide into the lane and gave
way.

Footnotes
MY MACHO MON checked when in tight between rivals soon after the break, recovered and settled in hand in the trail spot, commenced a run leaving the
far turn, worked between rivals in the drive while under right handed asking, took over a sixteenth from home and went clear under mild encouragement.
ASSAY , five wide early, dropped in and moved up to threaten around the far turn, gained command soon after, vied outside OWEN THE GREAT into the
lane, briefly went clear past the furlong grounds, continued willingly but was no match for the winner. OWEN THE GREAT , fractious behind the gate, broke
a step slow, was sent up five wide and took command into the first turn, dropped in after clearing, set the pace towards the inside, was taken on near the far
turn, rebid inside the leader near the quarter pole, stayed on past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. PROUD MOMENTS
had speed four wide into the first turn, rated off the leader nearing the three quarter pole, mild bid two wide near the far turn, chased and came up empty.
HARD STORY , off the pace, angled five wide for the drive and offered a mild response. PISINERO , four wide to the half mile marker, moved inside rivals
mid way on the turn, then lacked a solid finish. BIZ OPS came out at the break, steadied off heels mid way on the first turn, angled wide nearing the lane but
failed to menace. LUCKY PETE , three to four wide chasing the pace, gave way. KIP SEVEN , in tight soon after the break, angled out early, lost ground six
wide near the five eighths marker then gave way.
