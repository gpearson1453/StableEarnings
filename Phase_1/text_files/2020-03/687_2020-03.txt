Footnotes
BELMONTE took the lead nearing the half mile pole and set a pressured pace most of the backstretch, widened the advantage through the turn and held on
well under steady handling. FASTER THAN CHROME gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn off the rail, then dug in through the stretch
to retain second. A POWERFUL TALE chased the pace through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out toward the head of the lane and
was gaining on the runner-up. QUICKHATCH gave chase and rounded the turn in the five path, though, showed little in the lane. STERLING REBEL gave
chase inside but showed little further leaving the turn. VALADIER chased the leaders toward the outside and raced in the five path of the turn. RUN
BANNER gave chase and raced six wide on the turn. FULGENCIO stumbled at the break, raced outside and never factored.

Footnotes
LIZZIE'S LAST broke in to make light contact with Out Ona Limb then picked up the chase toward the outside, drifted a bit into the stretch but dueled to the
front mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. THUNDEROUS gave chase and raced at the rail through the turn, dug in between horses through the stretch
but was outfinished for the win while dueling for second. OUT ONA LIMB was bumped lightly leaving the gate then pressured the pace, dueled to a slim lead
three wide past the quarter pole, carried out toward the head of the lane then outfinished in the duel for second. TINA'S SONG came away a bit awkwardly
then picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn in the seven path and raced evenly down the lane. COOK THE BOOKS set a pressured pace and
dueled between horses through the turn then weakened the final sixteenth`. LILBITSOFDRAMA gave chase then eased out through the upper stretch and
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. ADORABLEDEPLORABLE gave chase and dueled to the lead at the rail nearing the head of the lane, but was
caught mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth.

the winner. I'M A LAWMAN gave early chase outside, raced three wide on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. THE SON WIND raced
well back from early contention, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced in the five path on the turn then dug in through the lane for a strong finish.

turn at the rail then weakened. CRIMSON SPADE hesitated at the break then angled out to give chase, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little
more. VAULTED SON engaged in close early chase but steadied from between horses in the vicinity of the five sixteenth pole and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE PARADE raced in the three and four paths the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths
pole, drifted outward leaving the far turn but dueled to the lead mid-stretch and was inching further ahead late yards. PAXOS took the lead nearing the three
quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, drifted outward in the upper stretch, was caught
mid-stretch but dug in to best MORNING MUSE while outfinished for the win; the latter of whom saved ground off the pace then eased outward into the
backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and raced close through the upper stretch before flattening later
yards. UPPERVILLE raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn two deep but showed little more. STEPS TO GLORY was not a factor. MIGHTY BOP saved ground off the pace and showed little response
through the backstretch. PRAISE THE MOON was never a factor.

Footnotes
SOPHIA REGINA was hustled to the lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the turn and held on well, while taken in
hand late. BERNIES ROCKETTE chased the pace inside, drifted toward the head of the lane and had to settle for second best. FAIR WINDS broke outward
to make contact with Tar Heel Palace, steadied lacking room leaving the three eighths pole then checked at the rail past the five sixteenths, recovered stride
into the turn and raced at the rail through the turn then finished evenly. WAKES UP HAPPY broke in to make contact with Tar Heel Palace then picked up
the chase outside, drifted to the seven path on the turn then flattened stride. MAGIC PIC gave chase toward the inside and raced at the rail through the turn.
TAR HEEL PALACE was squeezed on the chute then picked up the chase toward mid track, came through the turn in the four path and showed little more.
DOWN WITH BROWN gave chase outside then faded through the turn.

Footnotes
DYNACASTLE settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, and moved to even terms two deep approaching the top
of the lane, then dug in under determined handling to take the nod through the final strides. LIL SWEETHEART rated the pace inside, was pressured toward
the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn then dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding the nod.
CATHERINES WARRIOR settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened out down the lane. SHALL WE DANCE
saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and showed little in the lane. BYEGONE DAYS
raced well back and could only improve her position. GO WILLOW GO raced off the pace in the three and four paths then showed little response through
the backstretch. GO VENEZUELA GO was not a factor. DEREK'S COP E CAT closed to even terms nearing the seven eighths pole and stalked from that
point, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths but faded readily through the backstretch. The stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Dynacastle, lodged by the rider of Lil Sweetheart, but found no actionable offense.

RUSH TO THE CASTLE rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, dueled clear into the far turn and was steadily
encouraged to deep stretch, then taken in hand approaching the wire. YES IT'S ROO settled off the pace in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the five path, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY stalked the pace from
the three path then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back into the far turn and flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. CAYENNE CREEK
stalked the earlier pace inside then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and showed little
further. DR. TUCKER steadied early on and raced well back, left the first turn outside and gave chase through the backstretch then rounded the far turn in
the five path. HECKLER'S VETO was through after a half mile. FUGIWHARA raced well off the pace. CASH AGAIN was not a factor.

Footnotes
CAN HE SHINE took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, widened on the far turn and was steadily
handled to hold on well. RUNABOUT settled off the early pace and off the rail then eased out through the second turn and entered the backstretch toward
the outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced five wide on the far turn and dug in to take second later yards. JEFFERY SCOTT settled off the pace
in the three and four paths, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path but flattened stride leaving the far turn.
BACOLI stalked the pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside
the sixteenth pole. MACANAO settled back saving ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little
more in the lane. ACCESS TO DENIS settled off the pace about the three path then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail then weakened. TARNISHED JUSTICE raced well off the pace, left the second turn toward the outside and showed little response. CLASSY
CROSSING was through after a half mile.
