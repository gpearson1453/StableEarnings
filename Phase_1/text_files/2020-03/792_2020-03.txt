CHASING THE CANDY set the pace along the rail, led to midstretch and weakened. BOAT OVER THE HILL lagged well back inside, made progress at the

NANA'S SHOES was last early, made progress between foes down the backstretch, cruised up four wide around the turn, seized command near the
three-eighths pole and drew off under a drive. HOLA PRINCESS had speed three wide, vied between foes around the turn, was no match for the winner
from the three-eighths but stayed on to be clearly second best. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE was up close inside down the backstretch, dropped back inside
around the turn, re-bid in upper stretch and bested the rest. FRISKY WHISKEY set the pace in the two path and tired in the lane. DAH PHILLY was in range
two wide between rivals an lacked a closing bid. PETION LASS failed to menace while racing three wide. BOOM BOOM GONE bobbled at the start,
advanced four wide under urging around the turn and came up empty in the lane.

LET'S PLAY NINE had early speed inside, rated back midway down the backstretch, angled out and re-bid while still in hand, pressed two wide around the
turn, drew clear nearing the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging through the final sixteenth and lasted. EASY RIVER tracked the pace three and
four wide, rallied outside of foes and just missed. CRUSH IT settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and
was narrowly out finished. TAP THE MARK lagged well back inside early, angled out to advance four wide around the turn, went widest in the lane and
rallied belatedly. PORT LOUIS saved ground in midpack and lacked the needed rally. BROOKS ROBINSON set a rated pace just off the rail and tired
through the stretch.

CAM'S CARTER settled off the pace outside, made progress three wide around the turn, swept to command in upper stretch and quickly drew off under a
drive. KUKULKAN set a clear pace in the two path, offered little resistance to the winner in upper stretch, angled out in midstretch and held clear for the
place. DODGED A BULLET chased the pace two wide between foes, dropped back under urging around the turn, lacked a rally and passed a tired foe to
gain the show. SKY SOLO chased the pace inside and tired in the drive. DIAMOND NIC was outrun inside.

Footnotes
RAGING BLAZE set the pace in the two path, kicked in upper stretch and held sway. SACRED LADY pressed the pace outside of the winner, reached near
even terms around the turn, was repulsed in upper stretch, continued on, switched back to the left lead late and was narrowing the gap in the later yards.
TALKBACK had early speed inside of the winner, tracked inside around the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and had a mild gain. ROCKSTAR
GIRL raced in range four wide and lacked the needed rally. JUDI BLUE EYES saved ground in midpack, angled out in upper stretch, was unable to get to
the far outside as the rider appeared to want to but always had a clear path and lacked a solid rally. ZIG saved ground and played no factor. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING was outrun outside. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE played no factor while racing three wide.

REFLECT set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. WARM was off slowly, advanced between rivals around the turn, bid outside of the
winner in upper stretch but was turned back. THREE HAWK tracked the pace from the rail, angled out in upper stretch then finished evenly while drifting
back in. LE WEEKEND stalked the pace three wide and faded after a half.

Footnotes
SKYJACKED was in tight soon after the start, made progress between foes down the backstretch, stalked inside around the turn, angled out near the
three-sixteenths pole, bid between rivals in midstretch and drove clear through the final sixteenth. DOCTOR MCCOY tracked the pace three wide, bid
outside of the winner in midstretch and was clearly second best late. PALACE CANDY set the pace along the rail, led past the eighth pole and held for the
show. CREATED SPECIAL pressed the pace two wide and weakened through the lane. DAVID'S PROSPEC was bumped at the start, saved ground and
never threatened. SPIDER BITE was reluctant to load, raced three wide and failed to menace. FEATURE ACT was bumped at the start, raced four wide and
made little further impact. IMAGINETHEJOY was outrun while racing two wide. METAL MAGICIAN was outrun inside.
