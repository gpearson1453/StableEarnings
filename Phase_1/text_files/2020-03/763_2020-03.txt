Footnotes
KNOKKE BY THE SEA raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dueled into the lane, gained a short lead
and dug in gamely to prevail. MUNTAHEZ raced off the pace inside, moved up between rivals on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, dug in gamely between
horses in the stretch drive and battled to the end. CURLIN'S KNIGHT raced three wide on the first turn, moved up outside of SILVERZAR to contest the
pace, dueled with that rival, shook free on the far turn, dueled inside entering the stretch and weakened. TALKING POINT was steadied at the start, raced
off the pace, advanced on the far turn and failed to threaten. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE tracked the pace, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane
and tired. SILVERZAR set the pace on the inside, then dueled inside and gave way on the far turn. PROUD AND FURIOUS raced off the rail, three wide on
the backside and did not factor.

Footnotes
CHEVY TO THE LEVY alternated for the lead inside, shook loose leaving the turn, opened a long lead, driving. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT five wide early,
angled wider in early stretch and got second. ANISSA, in the five path while unhurried, raced very wide into and through stretch but was too late. LIVIN A
DREAM, just off the rail, moved out and split rivals in early stretch then finished evenly. INITFORTHELONGHAUL, four wide in second flight, drifted out
badly through stretch and tired. RAPIDEZ dueled for command lapped on winner then stopped. NATALIE LA ROSE saved ground and showed little.

GALILEO'S AFFAIR raced four wide early, cleared off to set the pace, dueled inside of JUMPIN JETT entering the far turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch,
regained command and drew clear under urging. GRANDE BESO stalked three wide, then chased two wide on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch and
got up late for second. JUMPIN JETT tracked along the inside, bid two wide nearing the far turn, dueled with the winner, put a head in front, could not stay
with that rival past midstretch, dug in and lost second at the wire. MIDDAY PRAYER stalked two wide, raced three wide on the far turn, bid three wide at the
quarter pole, then tired. FLEUR DE FORCE raced off the pace, had an inside trip and lacked a rally. PRETTY COOL CAT raced off the pace and failed to
respond when asked. SERIOUS HAPPINESS was outrun.

Footnotes
MICKEY T came in leaving the gate, dueled for the lead inside, shook loose and was clear near stretch, remained clear mid stretch and just held on.
ECLIPSED MOON, squeezed back leaving the gate, raced wide, closed and just missed. VOCAB stalked outside winner, fell back on the final turn but then
was coming back late. LEGACY'S PRINCE, outrun while outside, raced very wide into and through stretch and passed tiring foes. QUENCH MY THIRST,
racing in the four path of second flight, tired. FREE FOR NOTHING, fractious in the gate, saved ground and tired. DON POLO, two wide, showed little.
HONOR AND COURAGE raced wide and stopped. JONES TAXI was never a serious threat.

Footnotes
NOTHING BETTER moved up in the early stages to set the pace, showed the way on the turn, drifted out some passing the quarter pole, responded when
roused and drew clear under urging. HARPER tracked close up along the inside, waited for room on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dug in
gamely and held for second. BRILLIANT CHASE raced four wide early off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, bid four wide nearing the quarter pole
and closed well late. UNCOMMON VALOR raced four wide early, chased outside, bid between rivals at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane.
VIOLENT TURBULENCE was in tight between rivals in the early stages, checked at the four and a half furlong marker, made a five wide run on the turn and
weakened in the lane. BIG RAY chased between rivals, was steadied at the four and a half furlong marker, then chased between foes and tired. ATLANTIC
CHILL vied between rivals for the early lead, then chased and gave way. SKIP THE SMALLTALK raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
PECAN PATTIE, racing in the three path while just off pace, steadied briefly and was angled to the far outside entering the stretch, closed while drifting out
wider and got the nod. DANCE AND DANCE broke slowly but then was well placed while lapped on winner, angle in early stretch and rallied. MIA GIFT,
always well placed between foes, took the lead near mid stretch and held on tenaciously. EVIL WOMAN saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly
mid stretch and was game to the wire. SUGAR STREAK broke slowly, raced wide on the first turn, remained wide, drifted wider through stretch. MIJA
BELLA raced wide and also drifted wider through the stretch. FINISHING SCHOOL saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
TALE OF E DUBAI set the pace on the inside, responded when roused and pulled away under urging. E J'S REVENGE chased two wide, continued two
wide on the turn, rallied between rivals in upper stretch, dug in gamely and held on for second. MACH TRIAL was off a bit slow, raced off the pace,
advanced nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and missed for second. BRIO MAN broke in the air and was off slowly,
outrun early, closed late and got up for fourth. CURIOUS CAL chased inside and lacked a rally. STREET TAIL was bumped after the start, chased three
wide and tired. IRONBOUND raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane, then lacked a rally. RETURN OF A GIANT was

Footnotes
LITTLE NECK was steadied along from the half mile marker to the three eighths lacking racing room, made her way to the outside, rallied six wide into and
through stretch and took the lead in deep stretch. POINT LOCKOUT saved ground and finished with good energy. VALIANT SPIRIT, three wide dueling,
took the lead near mid stretch and held on gamely. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE was outrun to stretch, raced wide and finished full of run. WILLTHISSHIPSAIL,
inside top flight but in the four path, faded through the stretch. DESERTED, between rivals early and then went to the rail, steadied near stretch and gave
way. PASTICHE split rivals on the turn but failed to be a serious threat. IT'S A SHAW THING, outside and just off the pace, took the lead leaving the turn
then faltered. PARLAPIANO, very wide, failed to menace. IZA ONE raced very wide and tired. LUCKY'S RANSOM broke sharply, stalked two wide then
stopped.
