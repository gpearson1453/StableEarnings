Footnotes
TOMARIE, wide and just off the pace, took the lead in early pace and held on. BUCKS SOME set the pace in the four path and held on tenaciously.
BEARING SECRETS raced very wide and rallied. DEAREST ELLA saved ground chasing the pace then tired. REIGNING FIRE, in the four path, was never
a serious threat. FROSTY FRIEND saved ground and showed little. KEENEASABEAN was never a factor.

Footnotes
SMART RAGS dueled outside of KEEPING THE PEACE for the early lead, battled with that rival on the turn, led into the lane, kicked clear and held well
late, driving. A J'S WAY raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside and dug in gamely to the wire.
BROTHER TEZ stalked the leaders, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied and was outkicked. KEEPING THE PEACE dueled inside for
the early lead, battled on the turn and weakened in the final furlong. ALMOST PERFECT broke a bit awkwardly and was checked after the start, raced off
the pace inside and did not factor. QUICK LEARNER chased inside and tired. KRAKOV raced three wide off the pace and was outrun.

WOODBURY broke slowly then was hustled up wide to stalk the pace, took the lead in early stretch, drifted out while under right handed pressure, rider
switch the whip to his left hand, WOODBURY continued to drift out and brushed with MASS APPEAL, lost the lead briefly, fought back while continuing to
drift in and brushed MASS APPEAL again in the final strides. MASS APPEAL broke in tangle and was outrun racing inside, eased out near stretch and split
rivals, drifted in slightly under right handed pressure contributing to the brushing with WOODBUY, stuck his head in front but was unable to last while being
brushed again in the final yards. ALLIUM saved ground early, angled out very wide near stretch, moved in again but was too late. KION, three wide early,
moved out wider near stretch and ten gave way. DUBROVSKY outrun early, split rivals on the final turn and failed to menace. CLOUDY SATURDAY was
never a serious threat. DADDY'S PLACER, between rivals while just off the pace, tired. DIAGONAL set the pace in the three path then stopped. WILKO'S
GOLDENEYE saved ground just off the pace and had nothing left. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MASS APPEAL AGAINST WOODBURY FOR

the turn, angled out at the furlong marker, rallied mildly, was bothered by CARDI G and forced to steady, then continued to rally. TARA'S TALENT chased
two wide, raced between rivals on the turn and had no rally. HEATHERLY bobbled at the break, raced off the pace and failed to threaten. STREGA NONNA

Footnotes
NOT LEAVING, inside second flight but in the four path, drifted out through stretch and won going away. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT came out leaving the
gate and bumped with CHUBOFFTHEOLDBLOCK, set the pace just off rail but then was no match. CORN OFF THE COB, outside second flight, drifted
wider and closed well. ISABELLA SMILE squeezed back leaving the gate, was steered very wide and rallied late. CHUBOFFTHEOLDBLOCK came in
leaving the gate contributing to the bumping with LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT, raced outside and failed to menace. J J LOVES BILLY stumbled leaving the
gate, saved ground and tired. E T'S GYPSY WOMAN between second flight, tired. THE STEWARDS LITE THE INQUIRY SIGN REGARDING THE START
BUT THE RESULT WAS UNCHANGED.
