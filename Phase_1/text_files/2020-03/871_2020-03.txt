Footnotes
VIDALIA stalked the pacesetter a two to three wide off the fence, bid three wide around the turn, collared the leader and kicked clear into the stretch, then
drew off under right-handed urging to the wire. SOPRESCIOUS tracked from the inside, saved ground around the turn, looked to advance but lacked room
and steadied entering the lane, gained a clear path in the upper stretch and finished well to best the rest. LAST DANCE BELLA settled off the pace near the
inside, raced a bit off the rail then angled out just past the eighth pole, showed a mild rally and earned the show. SPACERIKA outside a rival early, went
three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. MISS SWISS off alertly from the far outside, set the pace and angled in to lead three wide, angled in on the
turn and raced along the inside, lost command into the stretch, shifted out just past the eighth pole and weakened. FAMILY TRIPS lacked early speed,
raced off the rail, angled three to four wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.

erratic between, checked late. CLEAN UP MAN off slow, drifted out. ZOOM AND DASH broke in, bumped start, drifted out. The Stewards reviewed the
