Footnotes
INDIAN BELLA broke in good order, prompted the leader off the inside, took over in the far turn off the inside, dropped in soon after, well clear under
pressure, large advantage, geared down late. MOLLY'S GAME broke back, lacked speed, advanced steadily three wide second turn, proved no match for
the winner in the drive, narrowly gained the nod for the place. COOK MEMORIES settled in mid pack while just off the inside, three wide advance into
contention second turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, nipped for the place late, well clear of the others. H. M. S. PINAFORE lacked early foot,
behind some traffic midway on the final turn, steered out to be four wide exiting the bend for room, improved upper stretch while well out in the strip, finished
up evenly. BUTTON MUSHROOM void of early foot, improved position toward the inside, not a serious threat. MOSTLY AWESOME within striking distance
early, had little left for the drive. COWGIRL CALLIE also raced forwardly in the early stages, began a steady fade after a half. ARROWSPHERE broke
sharp, set a quick set of early fractions, stopped far turn. CRITTER last away, trailed throughout in a sluggish effort.

Footnotes
THE DEVIL'S DADDY broke slowly, outrun in the early going off the inside, three wide far turn, tilted out a bit to be four wide into the stretch, closed with
good energy to be up in time. BROKEN TOGETHER within striking distance early, advanced and challenged the leader into the stretch, narrowly showed
the way past the furlong marker, larger lead late, could not contain the winner. DINNER AT CRUMPIES void of early foot after breaking a bit slowly, saved
ground when beginning to advance late in the turn, finished willingly through traffic while too late. GRAHAMSTAN also off a step slow, raced back, improved
position with a three wide trip. EXPLOSIVE SHOES asked to clear after the start, showed the way into the stretch by daylight, responded when the runner
up came alongside entering the stretch, weakened the final furlong. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR chased the leader in the three path for a half and began to give
way. MY LITTLE TIP void of speed, four wide through the turn, also improved position without posing a serious threat. AFRICAN WARRIOR saved ground
to no avail. JEHU made little impact while also racing toward the inside. HUMMEL ONE in mid pack early, traffic midway up the backstretch, steadied then
moved out a bit, failed to muster a rally. EVEN HIGHER dwelt at the start, far back, never a factor. BIG MACINTOSH forwardly placed early in the two path,
began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
DAPHNE MOON behind the early leaders in the two path, moved out a bit then challenged three wide and between horses in the final turn, put a head in
front entering the stretch, held the runner up at bay the final furlong in a determined effort. JILTED BRIDE lacked early foot, moved closer into the far turn, in
some traffic midway on that bend, knifed between foes and three wide to challenge into the stretch, dueled with the winner to the wire only to be outfinished.
QUEEN BRIDGET broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way the middle half, raced on equal terms with the winner into the
stretch, could not match that or the runner up the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. COMPELLING SMILE within striking distance outside, four wide
through the final turn, came up empty for the drive. SOUTHERN CENTS pressed the pace off the inside, vied between foes far turn, gave way in the stretch.
CARIBBEAN SEA was finished after a half.

Footnotes
HEFFINGTON outrun in the early going, split foes when beginning to advance with three furlongs remaining, continued in the two path into the stretch,
challenged outside the leader just inside the furlong marker, proved best under steady handling. AZLYNN'S DREAMER behind the pace toward the inside,
moved out slightly to challenge between horses midway in the turn, showed the way into and through upper stretch, offered brief resistance when the winner
came alongside soon after then proved no match. LIL H lacked early foot despite behind asked into the turn, continued three wide into the lane, improved
position while not a threat to the top pair. FOXY BOX went evenly in lacking a serious closing response. JUST WHAT I NEEDED remained always back.
PEGGIE IN THE WILD dueled up front early closest to the inside, briefly got clear late in the turn, weakened when headed by the runner up soon after.
WITHYOURPERMISSION dueled early off the inside, was giving way when getting out late in the turn, continued to weaken through the stretch. FOOLISH
PRINCESS forwardly placed in racing closest to the early duel, angled out to be four wide turning for home, faded. CLEVER ARCH tired after a three wide
trip.

Footnotes
HIS GIANT with the pace while racing three wide, put a head in front turning for home between horses, larger lead a furlong out, responded and dug in late
to prevail in game fashion. BOTERO in the second flight early while outside, ranged up four wide to challenge late in the turn, fell back off the winner passed
midstretch, rebid late, missed. SUPER TERRIFIC in the second flight off the inside, in some traffic turn, proved no match for the top two, clear of the others.
IN THE DEEP a bit rank in the early going in falling back to trail, moved out, four out to five wide turn, improved position with some belated interest. MOST
AMUSING in the main body early, traffic, steadied late backstretch, shuffled back, two path turn, also improved position in the drive. GOOSE DRANK WINE
steadied just after the start to break back, raced outside, improved five wide turn, flattened out in the drive. SPENDAHOLIC narrowly set the pace between
foes early, continued to vie through the turn, weakened in the drive. DUBNATION went one paced in mid pack, lacked closing response. SEEK N JUSTICE
void of speed,, raced five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. JIMMY AT LAST remained back. PIANTAGRANE with the pace while along the
inside, gave way after a half. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP off a step slow, moved up, was finished before a half.

EXECUTIVE BRANCH behind the first flight inside, continued to save ground turn, came up empty when asked for the drive. GRAFFITO moved out when
outrun early, four wide turning for home, also failed to rally. TOPPING vied up front while between rivals, gave way in the turn. RAILMAN pulled up soon
after the start, vanned off. ROLLIN SEVENS remained always back. DEFLATER with the pace from the start along the inside, dueled into the stretch, shook
clear with a furlong remaining, stayed clear until late, lasted. WICKED INDEED off a step slow, raced back in lacking speed, steered three wide late in the
turn, finished with good energy to be rapidly getting to the winner late, up final strides for the place. BUMP BAILEY with the early pace three wide, dueled
outside the winner the middle quarter, fell back off that rival past the furlong marker, weakened a bit more late to be caught for the second spot while saving
the show. ALEX'S STRIKE settled off the pace, improved three wide into the stretch, was gaining late for the show.

ONE STEP closest to the dueling leaders just off the inside, steered out a bit for the drive, set down, finished with plenty of run to win going awya. DROP
DEAD GORGEOUS dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate up front into and through upper stretch, larger lead with less than a furlong
remaining, could not contain the winner late, remained clear for the place. POLARCENTS set or forced the pace along the inside, dueled through upper
stretch, weakened slightly, saved the show. CHINA CAT one paced, dropped to the inside to save ground through the turn, continued evenly through the
stretch in lacking a closing response. MRS. KIMBERLY K stumbled badly at the start, raced back early, three out to four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild
rally then flattened out a bit late. GYPSY WIFE void of speed, raced in the two path through the turn, steered widest, improved in the drive by finishing best
stride too late . LUSCIOUS went evenly in the three path in lacking a closing bid. RIVER RAIN made little impact while racing three wide, vanned off.
SLOVAK was finished after a half. MISS ANNIE in the second group while racing three wide and between rivals, faded through the stretch.
ALLABOUTAPRINCESS in the second flight while racing four wide through the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MOJO MAN in the second flight in the two path, moved out slightly for the drive, roused for the drive in the three path, kicked down the leader late to finish
up willingly. FIRECROW broke alertly, sprinted clear early,continued to show the way by daylight through the turn and into the stretch, led late, could not
contain the winner, held sway for the place. NERO forwardly placed while racing outside, three wide into the lane, lacked a late punch while between the top
two at the wire. WILBO second group off the inside, remained within striking distance three wide into the lane, lacked a winning response. AWESOME
SATURDAY ducked out at the start, back off the pace and the inside, floated out four wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. MANNY WAH lacked
speed, remained back in failing to respond. AWESOME ANYWHERE was detained by the assistant starter to lose all chance in spotting the field double
digit lengths, jogged around. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, AWESOME ANYWHERE WAS DECLARED A NON
STARTER.

Footnotes
STRIKE THAT close from the start, pressed the leader into the turn, shook clear into the lane, kicked well clear while being kept to task. IMPRESSED broke
slowly, back off the pace while well out in the strip, five down to four wide through the turn, improved into the stretch, no match winner, held sway for the
place late. NEW COLOSSUS lacked speed off the inside, began a steady advance midway on the turn, improved, getting to the runner up. CABOT in the
main group off the inside, 3-4w into the stretch,went evenly in the drive while remaining well out in the strip. BEST OF GREELEY lacked speed off the
inside, came three wide out of the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. TUT'S REVENGE five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, went one
paced through the stretch in lacking a closing response. HERE COMES KYLE in some traffic when with the main group into the turn, asked along late in the
bend, failed to respond. BANO SOLO broke sharp, had speed for three furlongs inside, gave way in the drive. MR. ANKENY prompted the pace while racing
on the outside, three wide into the lane, backed up. NAUGHTY ALFRED remained always back. BEEMIE AWARD faded along the inside. LULLABY BLING
finished early, eased, walked off.
