ODDS ON sprinted clear early, set the pace in the two path and lasted under brisk urging. MR. CHESAPEAKECITY stumbled leaving the starting gate,
raced well placed three deep around the turn, floated to the four path in mid stretch and rallied. BIG BOOTS saved ground on the turn, angled to the two
path in mid stretch and rallied between horses. ACE NINE NINE lacked speed, circled the turn, angled to the five path near the sixteenth pole and had a
mild gain outside rivals. NAUTICAL NATURE had early speed along the rail, rated back near the five eighths pole, chased the pace outside the winner and
weakened. FORT ROYAL , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was outrun.

WHISKEY AND YOU saved ground in range of the leaders, eased out past the three eighths, circled four wide into the lane, forged to command past the
three sixteenths and drew away under a drive. TASTES LIKE PLAID lacked speed, gathered some momentum nearing the quarter pole, came four wide for
the drive and continued willingly to be along for the place. CAREY TIMES away alertly, steadied off of D C FIREMAN as that one crossed over leaving the
five eighths, drifted in briefly and bumped with JUSTWAVEANDSMILE, regrouped to bid outside the leader near the half mile marker, forced the issue into
the lane then faded in the final furlong. D C FIREMAN angled towards the rail when going to command in the opening furlong, took pressure into the turn,
held a clear lead heading towards the quarter pole, was taken on again nearing the three sixteenths then faltered through the final sixteenth.
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE , bumped when between runners near the five eighths, dropped back leaving the far turn, wandered outward in upper stretch and
was eased late.

CANOOCHEE lacked speed, took the turn in the two path, was taken to the inner rail approaching the stretch, closed along the rail and gained the lead in
deep stretch. FLIRTATION WALK saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch, gained the lead while drifting to the six path
approaching the eighth pole and tired late. BARBSGRAY LION sprinted to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail on the turn, drifted to the four path
in upper stretch, bumped with SPLENDOR GAL near the eighth pole and gave way. WILKO LOVESONG hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in
upper stretch, raced between horses in the drive and passed tired ones. GLORIA'S GAL , well placed in the two path on the turn, failed to rally. SPLENDOR
GAL prompted the pace outside BARBSGRAY LION, bumped with that one near the eighth pole and gave way.

EARNED IT tracked inside, steadied back a bit near the far turn, came back and bid to the inside of HAYNE'S FEVER entering the lane, drifted out while
dueling on a slim lead in mid stretch, was corrected with right handed rousing, kept on gamely and got the narrow decision. HAYNE'S FEVER prompted the
pace four wide outside BEST OFFER, cruised clear and dropped in a bit leaving the far turn, drifted out while engaged from the inside entering the lane,
straightened to battle head to head through the final furlong and just missed in a gritty effort. BOB'S MY UNCLE settled off the pace about three wide,
angled four wide and was put to pressure leaving the three eighths, pursued into the lane but could only muster up a mild kick. PUMPKIN STAR stalked the
pace three wide, made a slight run near the three eighths and faded. LINDA'S NEKIA , four wide into the first turn, raced in range while between foes near
the far turn, angled in to give chase and faded. BEST OFFER gained command inside foes into the first turn, set the pace in about three path while taking
outside pressure, failed to kick on with HAYNE'S FEVER leaving the far turn and faltered. MONKEY'S MEDAL saved ground and gave way.

LOOKIN DYNAMIC stalked the pace, eased out three deep approaching the stretch, was floated to the four path in upper stretch, gained the lead near the
sixteenth pole then drove clear. ELIZABETH T hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, kicked clear approaching the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly.
SAVEDBYTHEBELLE lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail until steered to the two path near the sixteenth pole then rallied
between horses. WIN THEN GRIN saved ground around the turn, angled off the rail turning for home, raced between rivals in the drive and failed to rally.
CALYPSO GHOST circled the turn three wide, drifted to the six path in upper stretch, was well positioned in mid stretch then weakened. ULTIMATE
JUSTICE disputed the pace two wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
AMERICAN STAR took command soon after the start, set a rated pace along the rail, was set down soon into the lane, drifted out a bit in the drive, was
corrected with right handed pressure and held sway. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN broke a step slow, quickly gained inside rivals nearing the three quarter pole
then stalked the pace, drifted out while giving hard pursuit past mid stretch, altered inside and steadily gained. CLOSE THE DEAL stalked two to three wide,
switched over to her left lead as the winner drifted then was out finished. QUEEN OF MUSKOKA , three to four wide chasing the winner, lacked a solid
finish. EYE OF THE WILDCAT settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out in the drive, shifted back in through the final sixteenth and churned on
with some interest. THERE GOES MY GIRL lacked speed, lost ground four to five wide and failed to menace though offering a belated kick. PRINCESS
A'GO GO , between foes while in range leaving the three quarter pole, dropped back some leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch but came
up empty. JAH GRACE came in at the break, lost ground four wide, pursued to upper stretch then gave way. CAT CAT'SHORSEPLAY lacked speed, was
under pressure three wide mid turn, shifted in but failed to respond.

PREVAIL UPON hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, eased out to the two path leaving the quarter pole, gained the lead between horses near the
sixteenth pole then drove clear. MARKET MOVER , four wide entering the first turn, angled to the inner rail after sprinting clear leaving the first turn, set the
pace along the rail, lost the lead near the sixteenth pole and dug in gamely to hold the place position. SECURITY BREACH stalked the pace, was well
positioned two wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. BARRISTER , five wide entering the first turn, circled the far turn four deep and failed
to rlly. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME , six deep entering the first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch, raced three wide the far turn and failed to be a late
factor. MINE TO HOLD trailed.

Footnotes
DEAN'S TICKET broke a step slow, recovered and settled off the early pace, picked up steam mid turn, stayed inside for the drive, leveled off under strong
handling past the furlong grounds, sustained and forged ahead of MY CHESA CHARM in the final yards. MY CHESA CHARM rated close up behind rivals
while saving ground, slipped through along the rail and put a head in front with three furlongs to go, handled outside pressure past the five sixteenths,
spurted clear while off the rail soon into the stretch, drifted a bit nearing the furlong grounds, kept on to deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. MISSIN
MAGGIE broke slowly, lagged off the pace, saved ground into and through the lane and had belated action to nab the show. GLORIOUS MYSTERY ,
between rivals early, forced the pace three wide and faded. SARATOGA STYLE , off the pace, angled out in the drive and had a mild run.
GREASEDLIGHTNING , four wide pressing the pace, stayed on to upper stretch then gave way. GIRL DRAMA sped to the early lead, set the pace in the
two path, was taken on from the rail leaving the far turn, forced the pace to the head of the lane then gave way.
