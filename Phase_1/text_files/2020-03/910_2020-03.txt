wide at the eighth marker and had no final bid. CAPTAIN AMANTE settled off the early pace, raced four wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. WILD

Footnotes
LOVE AT NIGHT broke in at the start, bumped with Chub's Charmer, built a clear down the backstretch and held gamely under a steady hand ride. A jockey
objection was filed for interference at the break by Chub's Charmer but stewards rule no change. CHUB'S CHARMER was bumped hard at the break,
dropped back in the early stages, moved up four wide through the lane and made a good late rally. LET'S GO PLACES settled in the early stages, angled to
the inside in the lane and had not enough late. JUDGE ON THE RUN stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no response. LOST
KEY was slow early, raced four deep in the drive and never was a factor. MAYZEE was bumped at the break, pressed the early pace and faded. UBETCHA
IMA BUMPER stalked the pace from the inside and tired. WILD BLUE KISS showed little. CHAMBER DOORS dropped back and failed to have a response.
