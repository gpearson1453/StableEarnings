APOLLITICAL PENCE opened up, shied from lights near finish, prevailed. VF JEDI RETURNS clean trip, good try. EOS A POLITICAL WIN formidable rally
inside. EYE EYE CAPTAIN chased in second group. FLY N TELL away well, out-finished. LYNNDER 16 bit slow start, outrun. UPTOWN DYNASTY went
evenly. SC MONEY MAKER no threat. SUZE RETURNS lacked a response. ADMIRAL STING was fractious before the start triggering others to react,
walked out of the gate, wheeled and unseated the rider, and walked off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start but ruled ADMIRAL STING a
starter because he caused his own problems at the break.
