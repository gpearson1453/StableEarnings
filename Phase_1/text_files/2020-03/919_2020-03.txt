Footnotes
THE ONE FOR FUN away last, chased the early pace from the inside, steadily inched forward up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the
second turn, responded entering the drive and steadily drew clear. WILD PROSPECT stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the
second turn, responded entering the drive but was no match late. DO YOU BILEVE dueled from between foes early, battled up the backstretch, remained
forward but could not keep pace. FUNNY FLOWERS dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch but came up empty in the drive. FAVORITE
SISTER was no real factor. MIA PANDOWDY was never close. LUCKY ROAD dueled from the inside then gave way. Due to a timer malfunction, this race
was hand timed

CANEY'S GHOST tracked close up inside, rallied on the rail passing the quarter pole, took over and edged away, driving. TAVNER stalked outside, moved
up on the turn, went five wide past the quarter pole, rallied outside and was along for second. WORD TO THE WISE set a pressured pace on the inside,
dueled on the turn, drifted out at the quarter pole, then dug in and weakened late. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER raced two wide off the pace and closed
belatedly outside. VALENTINE GUY chased inside and had no rally. EUROBADGUY chased outside, came three wide into the lane and tired. KENT'S BET
raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE broke outward, pressed the pace, dueled three wide on the
turn and faded.
