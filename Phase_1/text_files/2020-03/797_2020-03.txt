Footnotes
LA GRANGE LADY stalked the pace of DRINK MO HENNESSY while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
drew off with little need of urging. DAWN TERA broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was
up for the place. LEFT TRAIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy.
GOLDEN GEISHA settled off the leaders from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. DRINK MO HENNESSY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while
setting the pace and gave way to the winner into the stretch. RYWALKER lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. POSEIDON
AQUARIUS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. PASSION PRO lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not threaten.
