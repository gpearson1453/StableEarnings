UYEDA, held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, was prompted to gain a position just off the leaders racing four wide into the turn, continued with
a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm handling and some right handed encouragement. UNCLE KEVIN
angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged inside foes to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, gained a brief
advantage but couldn't contain the winner. ALITE, urged to the lead in the opening stages shifting a bit off the rail, dueled between foes through the turn and
gave way into the stretch. PRETTY STORMY, urged to a forward placing tracking the pacesetter three deep between foes, was prompted to lodge a bid on
the turn but soon emptied out. FED XMAN settled in the four path racing through the backstretch and failed to seriously menace. PINE STREET ducked out
sharply at the start, raced five wide to the turn tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance and soon faded.

Footnotes
THE GREAT KATH, forwardly placed between rivals in the opening stages, prompted a rival's pace through the backstretch, went well clear racing into the
turn while angling to the inside, then held the late challenge of MY GIRL ANNIE under firm encouragement. The latter tracked just off the leaders between
foes in the opening half, then continued to make steady late progress closing the gap on the winner through the last furlong while proving only second best.
TAKIN IT EASY settled last in early stages, split foes foes racing through the turn and gained some position while no threat to the top pair. DARLINDIVA
tracked the pacesetter inside rivals through the backstretch and faded into the stretch. DON'T SPIN ME tracked the leaders four wide racing to the turn and
gave way into the stretch. SOUTHERN DUDETTE, urged to gain the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled inside the winner racing into the
turn and gave way after a half.

AUTOGRAPH, urged to gain a forward placing along the rail in the opening sixteenth, conceded the lead while switching off the inside to stalk the
pacesetter between foes under light rating to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to prompt that rival after a half, moved clear racing into the far
turn, then turned back a challenge from SILENT MISCHIEF racing through the stretch to regain a clear advantage under some right handed pressure.
THREE OLIVEZ, off a step slowly, then bumped by ARES WARRIOR at the start, tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide
gaining position racing through the far turn and continued willingly to late stages to prevail for second in time. SILENT MISCHIEF tracked the pacesetter
inside rivals as part of the second flight in the opening half, advanced along the rail to challenge inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch and flattened
out in the final sixteenth. FUNNEL CLOUD angled inwards to join the pace outside the eventual winner, was urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail
into the first turn, set the pace for a half, briefly disputed the winner's challenge and gave way racing through the far turn. ROCKY JOHN tracked off the
second flight inside foes and offered no rally. ARES WARRIOR broke inwards bumping THREE OLIVEZ, was settled well off the field racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace. MY LITTLE ADRIAN, restless in the gate, made brief pursuit of the leaders racing three deep to the backstretch and
dropped out early.

Footnotes
TEMPTATION EYES, firmly reserved along the inside dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, saved ground racing into the far turn while
commencing a steady advance, came under some right handed prompting while being urged to bid inside the leaders racing through upper stretch and
wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. R V TREASURE angled to the inside early to track just off the first flight under light rating, was prompted
to bid for command between foes racing into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage leaving midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. IMAGINARY FRIEND (IRE), caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to a position in the second flight, was urged to advance
three deep in tandem with several rival racing into the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. MOMS LOVE tracked
off the second flight between rivals in the opening half, was urged to make brief pursuit of the leaders through the far turn but lacked the needed final kick.
ETTAPLACE angled to the rail in the opening stages to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival racing into the backstretch, edged forward
between calls to gain the lead racing into the far turn but emptied out racing into upper stretch. NAGINI tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the
far turn but offered no rally. RAINBOW RIVER was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight, was caught four wide racing through the far turn and
proved no threat. LILYS FROM PARIS broke slowly losing position to the field and failed to menace. TAKEN, restless in the gate, broke readily to gain a
forward placing racing just off the first flight between foes under light rating to the backstretch but steadily faded after a half. LADY JORDAN went readily to
the lead, was getting out a bit racing into the backstretch pressing the issue outside a rival, bore out entering the far turn, was quickly outdistanced but
walked off the course under her own power.

NO CHOICE broke readily to gain a clear advantage, angled inwards setting the pace just off the rail racing through the backstretch, kicked clear on the turn
shifting out nearing upper stretch and held sway through the lane under firm encouragement. KING DADDIO broke outwards bumping EARLY DELIGH, was
collected to track off the second flight between foes through the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady
effort between foes to prevail for second nearing the wire. EARLY DELIGH, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the turn,
was fanned five wide into the lane but continued with interest to gain a share while outkicked for the place honors. DRILL'S LI'L MAN tracked the pacesetter
outside foes four wide in second flight, shifted to the three path racing into the lane and faded between foes late. J'S FLASHY HALO tracked the pacesetter
three deep between rivals as part of the second flight racing to the turn, shifted inwards racing into the stretch and gave way late. ZECHARIAH, angled to
the rail while being urged along prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn, then gave way into the lane. STRIKING HEIR tracked off the second flight
inside foes but faded early. OUTRUN soon dropped out.

BUNSTER broke readily to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace under light rating along the inside to the far turn, shifted about while being roused
through the stretch but maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. WICKED BOY, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing
to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid while shifting out three deep through the stretch but proved only second best. ROUGH NIGHT broke out
brushing ZITMAN, was righted to track just off the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch while
being prompted to advance inside the pacesetter but was outkicked by the top pair. DELTA LEVY, reserved last along the inside to the backstretch, shifted
outside foes racing into the far turn, then steadily advanced four wide to upper stretch making a mild gain. JOSIE'S RIDDLE angled inwards to track
between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and continued evenly into the stretch. ZITMAN, brushed at the start, was rated off the
second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. FRONT LINE PAIGE settled off the second flight outside a rival in the opening
half and never gained contention. GLOBAL ENTRY tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
KING CAUSE gained a forward placing near the inside, then switched outside the pacesetter racing into the first turn to stalk that rival under light rating,
continued unhurried to the second bend, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage racing through the lane under some right
right handed pressure while drifting out late but went clear. COLTRANE, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the drive. CURRENT was settled off the second flight racing outside a rival to the
backstretch, shifted out three deep after a half while coming under some prompting to gain position nearing the far turn, then continued in that path while
making steady progress to late stages prevailing for a share. TELEKINESIS tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, was prompted to advance
while angling to the inside racing into the stretch but finished evenly late. SPEED GRACER tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn and
continued evenly into the stretch. SHENDAM (FR) ducked out at the start, was settled in hand a bit off the inside to the backstretch, shifted out three, then
four wide racing through the far turn but continued to improve position to late stages. RIJEKA (IRE) settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch,
angled out five wide racing into the stretch but made no real impression. OUTRAGEOUS BET was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
backstretch and faded between foes early. LUDINGTON tracked off the leaders along the inside racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MY COTTON CANDY was urged to gain a forward placing between foes, then tracked just off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, was urged
to bid for command three deep between foes leaving the midway point of the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, was roused clear right handed then
was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. LITTLE NICOLE stumbled at the start, was collected to gain a position just off the first flight
tracking those rivals along the inside, came through when presented an opening to bid for command along the rail in upper stretch, couldn't match the
winner's kick and was wrapped nearing the wire after her rider confirmed the place honors. SUNSHINE SMILES, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival
through the backstretch, dueled for command into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BOSS OF THE HOUSE, a bit outpaced early, never gained
contention. WARRIORS SPEAK angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, gave way between foes into the stretch and was
vanned off the course after the race. PLUIE D'AVRIL tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, made brief progress to join the leaders racing
four wide through the turn but flattened out nearing upper stretch.

LIDO KEY, reserved along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far
turn, continued in that path to upper stretch, challenged for command nearing the furlong marker and went clear late under firm right handed pressure.
ROYAL MANDATE tracked just off the second flight three deep racing to the first turn, angled to the inside entering the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while shifting out nearing upper stretch, bid for command between rivals in tandem with the winner midstretch but couldn't match that rival's kick. VI
HAINES pulled her way to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to upper stretch, shifted out while
being roused to resist the top pair but yielded late. EARECKSON (GB) tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, then was urged to split
foes gaining some position through the lane. FACTOR AROUND tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the
needed late bid. COURAGEOUS CAJUN, forwardly placed along the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance, was urged in brief
pursuit of that rival through the far turn and emptied out into the lane. SCREEN IMAGE settled near the inside in early stages and failed to menace. CLEAR
AS DAY, urged to gain a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, emptied out after a half. MIGHTY ELECTRICA
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never seriously menaced. COSMIC LINK, caught three, then four wide in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, dropped out early.
