Footnotes
KING KOA off slowly, split foes to take the early lead, raced two wide, regained the lead on the far turn, opened a clear lead and won with speed to spare.
MACHTREE, wide into and rounding the first turn, remained outside, got to the rail near stretch while taking up chase but was unable to keep pace. THREE
PHASE, in the three path while unhurried, moved out wider and was too late. ASPHALT PAVING, well placed between foes, tired. MIAMI TIGER, in the four
path while just off the pace, gave way. DIAMOND SQUARE was also very wide into and rounding first turn then never threatened. STORMY JUSTIN, inside,
took the lead on the backstretch, stopped after six furlongs. FIST OF THOR, fractious in the gate, raced three wide and didn't threaten.

Footnotes
HIGH FLYING GUY saved ground early, eased off the rail on the backstretch, took the lead in early stretch, was clear with a furlong to run and held on
under strong handling. SIGHT LINE split rivals early then moved to the rail, set the pace inside, fell back mid stretch then was slowly coming back. RINGS
OF JUPITER, wide early, was very wide into and through stretch and made up some ground. SALUTATION moved her head just prior to the start and then
banged her head off the left side of the gate breaking very slowly, was far back early, advanced while wide but was too late. FLYING ROCKET, never far
back, split rivals on the final turn and lacked a rally. GORSUCH, three wide stalking the pace, tired. SUNSHINE WILD steadied when bumped after start
then failed to menace. BELLY DANCER drifted out while far back. YOU TELL ME came in and bumped foe at the start, saved ground and stopped.

Footnotes
BUMPERDOO, two wide while not far back, angled out widest racing into stretch, took the lead in deep stretch and won going away LONG GRAY LINE,
three wide early, eased out four wide when challenging near stretch, fought gamely through the final eighth and gained place. DANCE FOR ORO was
between second flight, went three wide and challenged on the far turn, took the lead then gave way grudgingly. BOSS OF BOURBON ST, just off the rail,
split rivals near stretch but then lacked a strong closing kick. POWERFUL VENEZUELA two wide early, moved to the rail entering backstretch, set the early
pace and then tired. TRUE BLUE angled to the rail on the first turn, raced under a stout hold from the six furlong marker to past the five eighths pole when
behind a wall of horses, eventually eased out and tired. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ stalked the pace two wide, took the lead on the far turn then faltered. FLAT
OUT FLYING, wide, was never a threat.

Footnotes
GETOUTTAMYWAY stalked outside, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed steadily in deep stretch and wore down NIGHTLIFE late for the
win. NIGHTLIFE chased three wide, bid on the turn, quickly took charge at the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded late. NTH
DEGREE raced off the pace, moved up between rivals at the eighth pole, rallied mildly inside and was along for the show spot. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER
raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, closed mildly outside and was outkicked for third. BARLEY JACK tracked
inside in the early stages, dropped back on the turn and failed to threaten. THE CIRCLE GAME chased between rivals and gave way on the turn. CAPTAIN
SAM set the pace on the inside, dueled briefly on the turn and gave way. KRISSYS MANICURE was sluggish and dropped back early, distanced, eased in
the stretch and walked off.
