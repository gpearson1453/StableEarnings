even terms between rivals near the five-sixteenths marker, battled between throughout the stretch run, came out a bit leaving the sixteenth and bumped the
winner and was outfinished. BENANDJOE dueled at the rail, dropped back nearing the lane, kept plugging away inside and re-rallied for the show. MY MAN

near the eighth pole, quickly cleared, angled in and widened. COLONEL SHARP stalked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane, could match

rail to midstretch, weakened and held for the show. DAY THE MUSIC DIED raced off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, loomed five
wide in upper stretch and flattened out. UPLIFTING set a pressured pace two wide to midstretch, could not keep pace with the winner from there, was in
tight when that foe angled in near the sixteenth pole and dropped back. SIR ORINOCO raced off the pace toward the inside, swung six wide in upper stretch
and finished evenly. NO MORE TALK was outrun inside.

JEFAZO was bumped at the start, settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes around the first turn, angled out to advance four wide around the
far turn, steadily gained widest through the lane and was up in deep stretch. BUSTOFF pressed the pace two wide, drew clear in upper stretch, angled in
and led until the final strides. DEGROM broke inward and bumped the winner at the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, moved up
outside down the backstretch, remained three wide in range under a drive around the turn, battled on between foes in the lane but was outfinished. CAN'T
PASS IT UP raced well back two and three wide, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. FEDERAL WALK set a pressured pace along the rail
and tired nearing the lane. AWESOME D J saved ground and failed to menace. SMART AND BROKE was outrun inside. LATE BREAKING NEWS was in
range two wide early then retreated inside around the far turn.

ARRIFANA settled off the early pace, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, bid four wide in upper stretch, reached near even terms
approaching the eighth pole, dueled outside of the HOROLOGIST from there and prevailed. HOROLOGIST stalked the pace three wide, seized command
near the five-sixteenths marker, dug in inside of the winner for a protracted stretch duel and gave way grudgingly. NEEDS SUPERVISION tracked the pace
four wide, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, could not keep with the top two and bested the rest. LADY BANBA saved
ground and never threatened. VICTIM OF LOVE stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and came up empty. BYE BYE BERTIE set the
pace along the rail and tired through the lane. JENNEMILY prompted the pace two wide and faltered nearing the stretch.

FORTUNATE FRIENDS set a clear pace in the two path, held clear past the sixteenth pole and just lasted. TAPPIN CAT tracked the pace two wide
between foes, tipped out in upper stretch, closed willingly and just missed. BOBBY G settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the
three-sixteenths pole and rallied for the show. V. I. P. TICKET lacked early speed, raced two wide between foes throughout and rallied belatedly.
CONFESSOR failed to menace while racing three wide. WORKIN ON A DREAM stalked the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. FEAR THE TURTLE
had early speed, rated inside and came up empty in the lane. CERULEAN SPRINGS was outrun inside. MARCO ISLAND chased the pace three wide and
tired in the drive. FOLLOW THE DOG stumbled badly at the start causing the rider to lose the irons for nearly a quarter mile, raced wide and played no
further factor. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and found no reason to take action.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CADEY tracked the pace inside, made a rail bid approaching the three-eighths pole, quickly burst clear, widened under a drive, switched back
to her left lead near the eighth pole and continued to widen under milder urging. NAUGHTY THOUGHTS rated up close while a bit rank early, pressed the
pace three wide, had a brief lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, chased the winner outside from there and was second best. BELLA AURORA was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. SHE'SMYSUNSHINE lagged well back inside, angled out in upper
stretch and improved position. ANKLE MONITOR was bumped at the start, raced five wide and never threatened. MAMA'S GREY GHOST was in range
three wide, dropped back around the turn and went evenly through the lane. MISS TAP DANCE set the pace off the rail and faltered nearing the lane.

LEBDA settled off the runaway pacesetter in about the two path, cruised up in hand two wide around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole
and drew off readily while ridden out. MY FRIENDS BEER settled well back along the inside, made some progress inside around the far turn, tipped out in
upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. MINE NOT MINE broke a step slow, raced off the pace two wide, made some progress under urging
three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied for the show. TOOK CHARGE sped right to the front, set a clear pace well off the rail,
angled to the rail entering the far turn, led to the quarter pole then tired in the lane. BIG CITY BOB was perched just outside of the winner three wide, tried to
go with that foe around the far turn but could not keep pace while under a drive and faded through the lane. AWESOME PARTY bobbled at the break and
was outrun inside.

Footnotes
GALERIO settled off the early pace outside, made progress four wide around the turn, slowly gained widest through the lane and was up in deep stretch.
TEAM EFFORT stalked the pace two wide, bid between rivals near the three-eighths marker, led through most of the stretch and yielded late. GARRISON'S
CHARGE raced off the pace inside, made a bid along a wide open rail in upper stretch, flattened out late and lasted for the show. TOE CURLIN' KISS trailed
near the inside, swung widest approaching the lane and rallied belatedly. DADDY'S ON STRIKE set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home and
tired. MOTI failed to menace while racing three wide. THE MAGICAL ONE was in tight at the start and played no factor while racing two wide. START WITH
YES tracked the pace three wide, bid nearing the three-eighths pole then faltered in the drive.
