SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE set all the pace from the inside and drew away to be clear under steady handling. KURIOUS KENNEDY was allowed to settle
early, moved up three wide to challenge into the upper stretch but couldn't match strides with to finish second best. MEAN ERIKA was unhurried early,
raced three deep and had no final winning bid. ONE LITTLE INDY pressed the pace and weakened in the drive. VIOLENT FIT raced four wide and failed to
have a response. DARLING GIRL failed to sustain a bid.

HOLY MARIE stalked the pace, moved up four wide in the lane and just got up under all out pressure. OUR ANABELLE dueled for the early lead along the
inside and finished gamely to the wire. EUROSADY dueled for the early lead and weakened a bit late. SUDDENLY A GHOST was allowed to settle early,
saved ground and had no late response. FIANNA HILLS was slow early and never was a factor. JIANNA'S PAL stalked the pace and faded. NIGHTLY
OBSESSION dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
