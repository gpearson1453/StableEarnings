BUSTIN THE BANK was bumped leaving the gate, moved to a short lead soon after, stayed out from the inside, ran out into CHIRPING entering the stretch,
was bumped by that one soon after, bore out into that one nearing the final sixteenth and was narrowly best. CHIRPING ran out into the four path while
moving to press outside the winner on the first turn, was carried wide and bumped while on near even terms entering the stretch, came in, bumped that one
soon after, was bumped and carried out through the drive and wasn't enough. An objection by Hernandez against the winner was not allowed. LOOKIN AT
BLESSING chased the top two while not far back along the rail, came out into the three path on the final turn and weakened. BEST CHOICE broke in the air
then bobbled while slow leaving the gate, wasn't far back for over a half then tired. FINAL RITUAL wasn't far back outside to the far turn, stopped and was
eased up through late stretch.

IMPACTFUL set the pace along the inside while rating in hand, was let out a notch into the far turn drew clear while shifting to the three path, came into the
widening his margin in hand, the was shooken up inside the final three sixteenths, and finished strongly. CARGO SHIP advanced three wide around the far
turn to edge place turning for home, but hung on his left lead, failed to make late headway, and proved second best. SPEED SYNDROME broke outwards
and was off poorly, angled in to save ground while trailing into the far turn, advanced position inside of rivals around the far turn, but darted outwards when
asked to shift ground in upper stretch, carried out FEDERAL DOMINANCE, and failed to threaten the leaders thereafter. FEDERAL DOMINANCE vied two
wide and between horses into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart into the far turn, weakened between horses turning for
home, then was forced outwards about four paths by SPEED SYNDROME in upper stretch, and failed to make a rerally. RUMORS OF VIOLENCE was
outrun in three path through the first turn, then trailed in the five path around the far turn, and proved no factor. SPARE KEY stalked three to four wide, but
weakened into the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

GOLDEN CHANCE trailed along the inside early on, reserved to the far turn, split foes two wide at the five sixteenths pole to make a three wide bid for the
lead turning for home, dueled with her inner foe, KATE CARMACK, in upper stretch, before putting her away passing the furlong pole and drawing away to
the wire. KATE CARMACK broke in and shied outwards at the start, raced off of the pace from the three to two path around the first turn, advanced position
along the rail through the far turn, shifted off of the fence to bid between horses turning for home, but was bested by her outer foe through the lane.
LUXURY ITEM saved ground in midpack before shifting three wide at the half mile pole, got outmoved by inner rivals around the far turn while drifting four to
five path, then passed a tired rival through the lane without threatening. INSPIRED GEM pulled keenly in the three path to set the pace into the first turn,
built a clear margin into the far turn, but met multiple challenges at the quarter pole, offered little resistance, and weakened. R CHERRY prompted the pace
setter from the four path, but failed to keep pace into the far turn, weakened around that bend, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LOVE THAT JAZZ broke slowly, advanced along the rail early, steadied in tight into the turn, got clear midway on the bend, rallied to the front nearing the
quarter pole, dueled through the lane and prevailed. FLORIDA BOYS showed speed outside, moved three wide to a short lived lead midway on the turn,
continued with good courage once displaced before a half but wasn't quite enough, went lame while returning to the unsaddling area and was vanned off.
CONQUEST PRANKSTER steadied behind the leaders while not far back two wide into the turn then tired. MR. SKITTLES was no factor. MANAHAWKIN
was outrun. LOCO LOBO moved to command soon after the break, stayed just out from the rail while making the pace into the turn, stopped in the lane and
appeared sore upon return.

Footnotes
IRISH RIVIERA stalked inside early on, shifted off of the rail to the four path into the far turn, swept past a pair of inner rivals, at the five sxiteenths pole,
drew off turning for home, and was hand ridden from the furlong pole to the wire. O K GAME ON advanced between horses while pulling keenly in the two to
three path into the backstretch, split the leaders at the half mile pole and held a lead into the far turn, but was headed by multiple foes at the five sixteenths
pole, dug in for place while proving no match for the leader in upper stretch, and held that position to the wire. JOHNNY CAB raced off of the pace in the
four to five paths around both turns, came under coaxing at the half mile pole, then kept on late with a mild rally for show. RUNNINGFORHOME prompted
the pace three wide, then vied between horses around the far turn, proved no match for the eventual winner at the quarter pole, then was repelled for place
in deep stretch and weakened late. OCTORARO ORPHIE stalked two wide between horses before being restrained to race further back at the five furlong
pole, trailed in the two path around the far turn, then passed tired rivals in upper stretch. BABY BULL was a bit antsy in the gate, raced four wide through the
first turn, bore to the five path around the far turn, then to the seven path turning for home, and weakened while continuing to drift outwards. SACRED
MOUNTAIN set the pace along the inside through the first turn, but weakened passing the seven sixteenths pole, and faded around the far turn.

INALIENABLE RIGHTS moved to stalk in the two path outside the early leader, took over entering the far turn, was clear before three-quarters then held
under urging. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was content to lag inside early, began a run after a half, came out two wide on the final turn, moved closer in early
stretch then lacked a further response. INDIGESTION wasn't far back behind the winner early, made a two wide run around the final turn, moved closer in
early stretch then flattened out. HARPY EAGLE passed tired ones while outrun. BLAZE A TRAIL moved to a clear lead into the first turn, made the pace
along the inside to the far turn then stopped. I'SE DUBAI was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the break, wasn't far back along the rail to the far turn,
stopped and was eased up late.

Footnotes
CULLINAN pulled to a clear lead in the two path early on, stayed keen around the far turn, held her margin to the far turn, shifted to the four path to float
WONDER CITY wider as that foe made a bid at the quarter pole, but was shaken up in upper stretch, and safely held sway through the lane under driving
pressure. WONDER CITY stalked in the two path while inside of rivals, shifted to the three path into the far turn to engage the leader from the outside,
inched closer while being floated to the five path by the leader at the quarter pole, but proved no match for that rival in upper stretch, and kept on to secure
place. OMNI DIVA trailed in the four, then three, path around the first turns, advanced in the four path around the far turn, angled inwards as the leaders
shifted outwards at the quarter pole and produced a rail bid, but did not have enough, and got outfinished for place. GUATAVITA was bumped at the start by
an inner bobbling rival, raced off the pace in the two path, got a bit rank when pulling between horses into the backstretch, came under coaxing to hold
position while far off of the pace into the far turn, and failed to threaten. PRINCESS ANNE saved ground from midpack, but retreated to trail the field into the
far turn, and failed to factor thereafter. DISCO DEJA VU bobbled at the start and bumped an outer for, stalked in the three path, but weakened into the far
turn and was eased through the stretch.
