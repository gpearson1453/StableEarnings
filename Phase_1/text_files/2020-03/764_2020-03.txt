unhurried early then raced three wide on the backstretch, rallied but clipped heels with CAPTIVE KITTEN and stumbled while nearly unseating his rider then
recovered and came again to be second best. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, rallied and was in a long drive
but was outfinished for the place. DIVINE FAVOR set a pressured pace while inside, was in a long drive then faltered in late stretch. SATURDAYS
HANGOVER was unhurried early then made a mild rally while two wide and was no threat. MILLER MAN was in tight and checked off heels on the first turn
then settled and was no menace. RUSSELL CAVE was allowed to settled then was no threat. CAPTIVE KITTEN was stalking the pace while four wide on
the backstretch, had his heels clipped nearing the quarter pole then faltered in the drive. GRAND ARGUMENT was allowed to settled then failed to menace.
