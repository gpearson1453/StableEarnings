Footnotes
JUULSTONE was allowed to settle early, took closer order after a half-mile, rallied between horses in the three-path turning for home, quickly overhauled
the leaders and drew off. SEIZE THE HAY was unhurried for six furlongs, shifted out three, then four, then five wide by the end of the far turn, could not kick
with the winner but finished well to go clear of the others. HOLY EMPEROR set the pace inside, got collared nearing the stretch, had no answer for the top
two but dug in to salvage third. ABRUPT prompted the pace outside HOLY EMPEROR, came alongside to challenge around the far turn, but lacked a final
response and was edged for the show. MECHA CORTA stayed in touch three wide for six furlongs, shifted out a bit further with a bid at the top of the
stretch, but faded outside the eighth-pole. STONECASTLE had good early position covered up behind the leaders inside, and came up empty when roused.
QUEEN'SPLATE NOLAN was no factor two wide. MAGICAL COURT raced three wide to the far turn in the second flight, and tired into the stretch.

Footnotes
CREATIVE AWARD was off to a good start and briefly matched strides before clearing on top, angled to the inside leaving the backstretch then remained
well clear around the turn, roused for more at head of the lane, responded for more and kept clear under steady urging. SIZZLING ROMA settled along the
inside through early stages then angled out and launched a bid late turn, was no match for clear winner but continued a steady effort and edged foe for the
runner up spot. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA raced in range then moved up to engage second flight near three eighths pole, hustled along three deep around
the turn then remained in steady pursuit through the lane and cleared show. BLUE CHICORY was forwardly placed in opening stages, roused two wide
between foes around the turn then failed to keep pace top stretch and gave way. LAPIS STORM raced in contention while tracking the leader along the rail
through early going, mildly prompted around the turn, had no response and retreated through the lane. PRINCESS ROBBI stumbled awkwardly for a slow
getaway at the start, trailed in the back and never got untracked during any portion of the race.

Footnotes
POSEIDEN was prominent early outside, reached a short lead four wide late on the turn, and withstood a long drive outside THREE DEEP and SPEEDY
HANS to prevail. THREE DEEP bumped with EXPRESS BOY at the start, eyed the leaders heading into the turn, moved through between horses joining
the fray three wide past the three-eighths, ran on through a long drive and was edged between horses. SPEEDY HANS vied early between horses,
continued without a breather moving to the rail late on the turn, and stayed on to deep stretch before yielding. CHINOMADITO contested the early pace
inside, steadied unable to maintain position approaching the quarter-pole, moved out in the stretch and ran on for a share while drifting out steadily.
EXPRESS BOY bobbled and bumped with THREE DEEP at the start, and was outrun two wide. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER was slow from the gate, saved
ground outrun into the turn, angled wide for the drive and made no headway. SEIFERT was outrun to the stretch in the three-path, and dropped far behind
despite urging.

Footnotes
TAPALOOF got bumped strides out of the gate then continued in the back racing three to four wide, roused to pick up the pace near three eighths pole,
showed response near the inside on the far turn then came out wider entering top of the lane, got in gear and began gaining on the frontend, shifted to the
inside of SCANNO in final stages and got up in time, was pulled up after the race and vanned off. EXPRESS PHAROAH tracked the pace while saving
ground down the backstretch, prompted on the far turn then drifted out very wide in stretch run while gaining on the leader, edged by SCANNO in final stride
but got nailed by TAPALOOF. SCANNO stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch then took a slim lead at the quarter pole, stayed on determinedly with
a narrow lead in late stages and got edged in final strides. AMANO secured inside position on the first turn and remained near the rear while saving ground,
urged to pick up the pace around the far turn, drifted out wide under left handed pressure and had a mild improve. SPIRITUAL KING quickly cleared on top
and crossed over to the inside, set the pace down the backstretch, got collared for the lead by SCANNO near the quarter pole then gave way. SKYRAY
raced four wide not too far off the early pace, failed to advance when prompted around the far turn then faded in the lane. PORT HUNTER tracked the pace
through early stages, raced in contention while coaxed three wide bid on the far turn then came up empty out of the turn. PRINCE IGOR steadied nearing
the first turn, raced near mid-range then quickly retreated upon entering the far turn.

Footnotes
KRAMMY BOY was solidly bumped into SHIDOSHI by SILENT TIGER at the start, lagged well back early, advanced with a four-wide run around the turn,
rallied determinedly to reach the front past the furlong marker and drew clear late. SILENT TIGER delayed the start difficult to load, broke inward knocking
KRAMMY BOY into SHIDOSHI, tracked outside the early leaders, bid three wide into the stretch, gained a short lead outside COLORMEPOMPOM in upper
stretch, and was bested by the top one through the last eighth of a mile. COLORMEPOMPOM rushed up inside after the start, held a short advantage over
GEMOLOGISTER through most of the opening half-mile, came into the stretch in the two-path under heavy pressure, and yielded to challengers through the
furlong grounds. KARMA KING saved ground in range for a half, and lacked the needed closing response. GEMOLOGISTER vied outside
COLORMEPOMPOM for a half, and gave way approaching the stretch. PARTICULARITY saved ground early in the second flight, had the two-path turning
for home and could not gain. SHIDOSHI got slammed by KRAMMY BOY at the start, and was never close. CABRE broke out brushing the right side of the
gate, took a bad step midway on the turn and pulled up soon afterward, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CIGAR BOX broke on top then pressed the leader in the two path, shook by rival midway around the turn while BOURBON STREET was looming up along
the outside, repelled bid top of the lane then kept sharp under steady pressure and finished going away. BOURBON STREET tracked the top two leaders in
opening quarter then moved up to challenge CIGAR BOX near the quarter pole, could not get by sharp winner but stayed on with steady response and
finished clearly second best. BRIDOLOGIST moved up the inside and took a slim lead over CIGAR BOX in opening stages, vied along inside of rival then
failed to move on with winner midway around the turn, steadily weakened and raced along for a share. METCALF raced in contention positioned two wide in
opening stages, slightly brushed with rail runner mid-backstretch then failed to advance under pressure and offered no late rally. THREE HOMBRES raced
in range along the rail in early going, brushed slightly with METCALF mid-backstretch then failed to gain on the turn and had no late response. PUTIN
ONLINE raced five wide in the rear early on, stayed outside into stretch run and failed to move into close contention. BYCHANCE tugged up close near the
lead in opening stages, appeared hard to handle racing under restraint then steadied back mid-way down the backstretch and dropped back.

Footnotes
OBLIO'S WISH led early before relinquishing command to STARSHIP GUSSIE leaving the first turn, was content to go along in striking range through the
middle stages, came three wide off the far turn being given her cue, rallied determinedly and overtook CHARGE IT JENN in deep stretch to win going away.
CHARGE IT JENN went around the first turn four wide, put in an early move outside to take over the lead up the backstretch, moved inside drawing clear,
remained well in front past the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner. LA INCONDICIONAL raced two wide on the turns, and could not gain
appreciably with an even finish. RUN BLONDIE RUN was well back to the far turn, came three wide for the drive and improved without threatening.
STARSHIP GUSSIE took over from OBLIO'S WISH soon after completing the first quarter-mile, moved inside and was briefly clear before CHARGE IT
JENN took over, stayed prominent inside to the end of the far turn and faded. LIBERALE (FR) lagged in the second flight early, moved in from the four-path
after entering the far turn, and lacked a serious response. IMPERIAL CUT was never prominent, and passed tired horses. CALAIS COVE brushed with
CURIOUS ZELDA at the start, and tired after six furlongs. CURIOUS ZELDA brushed with CALAIS COVE at the start, got floated out by CHARGE IT JENN
heading into the first turn, could not reach contention and dropped far back late. SAMIS CAR was forwardly placed early three wide, checked sharply while
weakening midway on the far turn, and faltered.

Footnotes
GIOCARE took the rail position around the first turn then settled nicely while tracking the early leader, prompted to pick up the pace going by the half mile
marker then coaxed along the outside around the far turn, kept on determinedly for the leader in the stretch run, collared foe in late stages and finished clear
under a driving finish. BEAR ALLEY took the lead and angled inside heading into the first turn, set the pace and pulled on top while racing under slight
restraint, held firm over challengers around the far turn then dug in for more near inside in stretch run, kept on with effort but could not hold off GIOCARE in
final stages. DON BOURBON raced in range positioned just off the second flight early on, headed in pursuit for the leader around the far turn, raced in close
range near the quarter pole then failed to advance with the top pair but pushed on and finished well clear over the rest. OBIWAN raced along the rail and
steadied upon entering the first turn, raced off the pace two to three wide and ridden along to pick up the tempo entering the turn, failed to advance then
dropped to the inside near the quarter pole and offered no late bid. SILVER MAKER was reserved four wide down the backstretch and had no response
when called upon. RIVER STONES stalked the pace racing a path outside eventual winner the came up empty entering the far turn.

Footnotes
CAROTARI hustled to the early lead inside, kicked clear from SHEKKY SHEBAZ coming off the turn, drifted out a bit late but held off FIG JELLY to preserve
the decision. FIG JELLY tracked outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, had a clear shot outside and was inching closer to the wire. ARCHIDUST
saved ground behind the pacesetters for three furlongs, was boxed in through most of the stretch run, got a late opening on the rail, finished willingly when
finally set down in the closing yards but ran out of time. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF broke out at the start nudging FIELDER, had the two-path in the second flight
to the lane, and gained mildly. STURGEON saved ground for three furlongs, moved out in the stretch and posed no threat. SHEKKY SHEBAZ pressed the
pace outside CAROTARI to the stretch, and gave way between horses approaching the eighth-pole. FIELDER was nudged out by ELUSIVE MISCHIEF at
the start, raced three wide to the stretch, and had no late bids outside.

Footnotes
GIRLS KNOW BEST broke alertly and set the pace a bit off the rail, shook off KNARSDALE turning for home in the two-path, drifted out steadily while clear
into the last furlong and was all out to hang on. KEOTA idled in the middle of the pack through the turn, began to close in between horses a sixteenth out,
shifted out from behind GIRLS KNOW BEST very late and was surging outside the winner. VIOLENT TIMES bumped with BOHEMIAN BOURBON at the
start, saved ground behind the leaders for three furlongs, was inside KNARSDALE coming off the turn and had no alternative but to remain on the rail,
rallied willingly but did not have enough. HIDDEN FACTS stayed in range three wide to the stretch, had the four-path after straightening away, and steadied
outside KEOTA very late. KNARSDALE pressed the pace outside GIRLS KNOW BEST, got shaken off in upper stretch and weakened late.
I'LLHANDALTHECASH was a step slow at the start, recovered to midpack three wide, moved to the far outside for the drive and steadied outside HIDDEN
FACTS in the closing stages. NIKEE KAN was three wide into the stretch, and could not gain. LOVESICK was outrun to the stretch, and had no final
response inside. BOHEMIAN BOURBON bumped with VIOLENT TIMES at the start, came four wide off the turn and made no impact. CHARMAINE'S MIA
steadied slightly on the rail approaching the turn, and gave way inside.

furlong marker, dug in gamely with ears pinned back and held on. CARIBA was allowed to settle in early stages, coaxed two to three wide around the far
turn, shifted wide top stretch then rallied strongly along the far outside and just missed. DARK MISSION was unhurried and saved ground down the
backstretch, continued along the rail around the far turn, split foes upper stretch then steadied along inside past the sixteenth pole and yielded. BERING
STRAIT rated three wide off the early pace, picked up the tempo late far turn then raced six wide at head of the lane, roused forward into close contention
then lacked a closing kick. SCAT MOMMY got squeezed and steadied after the start then checked sharply nearing the first turn, checked again entering the
turn then was keen, tugged and steadied along into the backstretch, saved ground and advanced to race in strong contention in the final furlong then
yielded in late stages, was pulled up on the backside after the race and vanned off. ALL QUALITY was away last then floated out wide entering the first turn
then continued unhurried in the back, shifted out wider for clear path upper stretch, went to make move but lacked a clear path and steadied late. NO WAY
JOSE (IRE) raced five wide entering the first turn, was reserved down the backstretch, prompted racing wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.

leader down the backstretch, moved up to race in aim for the lead late far turn then tired upper stretch and dropped back. CONCERNED raced off the pace
then coaxed along three to four wide around the far turn and failed to move into close range. DESIGNING set the pace down the backstretch, challenged for
