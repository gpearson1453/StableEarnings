Footnotes
TRAIPSING tugged a bit under a snug hold around the first turn then sat back two to three wide off the moderate pace tempo, raced near the inside leaving
the far turn then put to a drive and shifted out wide in upper stretch, kicked in gear and got up late. DEVIOUS CHARM was well placed and settled nicely
tracking in close range, raced three wide off the top pair late on the far turn, came under a drive five to six wide in upper stretch, steadily edged up closer
and captured place. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN was off to good start and moved in from the outside to race in aim for the lead entering the first turn, stalked
behind the leader to the far turn, dueled for command racing outside of SCATNAP into stretch run, battled back into late stages then got outkicked by late
gainers. SCATNAP led the way into the first turn and set the pace to the far turn, dueled inside of ENJOYITWHILEWECAN into stretch run, battled on into
late stages then got outfinished. NIKO'S DREAM rated near midrange through early stages then continued in range between foes on the far turn, was put to
a drive two wide in upper stretch, raced in close range near the furlong marker then evened out. TAKE CHARGE TINA secured inside position on the first
turn, stalked down the backstretch, stayed inside and waited for a clear path late on the far turn, got clear top of the lane, raced in range near a furlong out
then flattened. CODRINGTON rated near mid-range to the far turn then picked up the pace on the far turn, shifted out wide for the drive and failed to kick
on. TEMPLE CITY TERROR was unhurried, saved ground to the far turn, roused for response entering the lane stretch run and lacked a needed rally.
WOODFIN got bumped at the start then pinched back just after, raced in the back then swung wide into stretch run and failed to pose a threat. ZABAVA
raced off the pace and three wide on the far turn then came out wider for the drive and lacked a rally. SECOND COMING raced near the rear and had no
response when called upon. COMIC KITTEN saved ground along the inside while not too far back then gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
TRAVELLING MIDAS was prominent from the outset, took over outside BERNIN' THRU GOLD turning for home, and moved away under a steady drive.
OVERDELIVER was wide and outrun early, advanced through the turn while shifting in to the two-path, rallied through the stretch and finished well to best
the others. GUMP was brushed by TOP SEED at the start, pressed the pace three wide, could not muster the needed late kick but ran on for the show.
ALLURSTRA swung four wide late on the turn, and offered a mild response outside to pick up a share. STEALTH broke slowly and lacked speed early three
wide, shifted in a path for the drive and finished evenly on the wrong lead. BE GONE DADDY was devoid of early speed, came five wide off the turn and
went by tired horses. BERNIN' THRU GOLD crossed over to the lead after an alert break, clicked off a sharp half-mile pressed by the eventual winner and
third finisher, and faltered through the last eighth of a mile. ZOE'S DELIGHT was no factor three then four wide. BEAU LUMINARIE stayed in range two
wide for a half, moved to the rail in the stretch and tired. JAKE ROCKS settled in the middle of the field saving ground early, had the two-path approaching
the stretch and retreated. TOP SEED became agitated in the gate prior to the start, broke in brushing with GUMP, and was finished early. BRUTUS hustled
through between horses after breaking near the back, tucked in behind the leaders up the backstretch, but dropped back under pressure around the turn.

Footnotes
LARGENT held a slim lead entering the first turn then quickly challenged by RY'S THE GUY and dueled for the lead down the backstretch, battled on
around the turn then shook free at the head of the lane, cleared on top then put to pressure when TEMPLE began to loom a threat, dug in gamely and held
firm. TEMPLE secured inside position and settled nicely to the far turn, angled out and picked up the pace leaving the final turn, dug in four to five wide at
the furlong marker, surged up to race in striking of the winner but could not get by. TRIBHUVAN (FR) was unhurried and raced two wide to the far turn,
shifted out and raced very wide losing ground entering the lane, rallied along the far outside and captured a share. THE GREEN MO'STER saved ground
and settled off the early pace, raced two wide around the far turn then given cue top of the lane, gained position along the inside then got edged out late for
share. EMPIRE OF WAR stalked the top pair to the far turn, urged along the inside then shifted two to three wide in upper stretch, raced in range a furlong
out then lacked a closing kick. UNLEVERAGED raced two to three wide off the early, prompted along the far outside at the head of the lane, produced a
mild bid but needed more for impact. RY'S THE GUY broke from the widest position and moved in closer while forwardly placed, advanced to challenge
LARGENT for the early lead, dueled outside of rival down the backstretch, battled back on the far turn, could not match with winner top of the lane then
faded in the final furlong. PLUS QUE PARFAIT raced in good position and tracked the pace down the backstretch, roused two wide at the quarter pole,
stayed on near the furlong marker then flattened out. AWARD WINNER raced near midpack through early stages, picked up the pace racing four wide late
on the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. KRAMPUS sat off the pace and saved ground, shifted out and roused on the far turn but failed to move
on. PROLIFERATE raced near the rear then five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. LATEST VERSION raced in the back throughout and offered no
bid.

Footnotes
DECORATED INVADER hit the left side of the gate at the start and was well off a sharp early pace, began picking off rivals around the far turn shifting out
five wide, sustained the rally under a heavy drive through deep stretch and pulled clear in the final yards. SOUTH BEND was unhurried early three wide,
advanced four wide after six furlongs, and finished willingly just inside the winner. GET SMOKIN vied early inside INTER MIAMI, deferred to that rival and
moved outside entering the backstretch, rebid midway on the far turn and took over as INTER MIAMI took a bad step, went clear into the stretch, weakened
a sixteenth out and saved the show. SUMMER TO REMEMBER gained to striking range around the far turn three wide, shifted in a path with aim outside
GET SMOKIN into the lane, and was outfinished. VITALOGY (GB) moved up into the far turn three wide, cut the corner into the stretch, and lacked room
behind GET SMOKIN through the late stages. FENWICK STATION was outrun early inside, took closer order three wide after six furlongs, and improved
late outside without threatening. STREET READY raced four wide much of the initial six furlongs, loomed a threat edging closer near the top of the stretch,
but flattened out. MOON OVER MIAMI raced in the second flight throughout and never menaced. PLEASECALLMEBACK trailed early inside, moved out
four wide on the far turn and made no impact. MR. HUSTLE worked over to the two-path early, and failed to become a factor. CAPTAIN D chased after the
early leaders inside, and faltered after six furlongs. INTER MIAMI vied outside GET SMOKIN through most of the first quarter, cleared off moving inside
maintaining a fast pace, took an awkward step midway on the far turn as GET SMOKIN ranged alongside, and had nothing left after six furlongs.

Footnotes
WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) bumped with foe at the start then quickly shot to the frontend, held a clear advantage and saved ground then prompted for more
late turn, was fully extended under strong handling in late stages and had enough left in reserve to hold on. NETWORK EFFECT clipped heels behind
UNCLE MOJO and stumbled a couple strides after the start, rated through early stages then was ridden along to pick up the pace entering the turn, gained
closer contention then shifted out wider in upper stretch, kept on determinedly in pursuit for the leader, continued to edge up closer but could not get by in
time. CHEWING GUM moved head and got off a step slow at the start, quickly angled to the inside and remained reserved down the backstretch, angled out
and picked up the pace on the turn, gained closer contention, raced wide in late stages, moved up in striking distance then yielded in final strides.
SQUEEZADIOS bumped with foe at the start then angled inside to save ground, tracked the clear pacesetter to the far turn, hustled along into stretch then
gave way near the furlong marker. UNCLE MOJO got clipped behind by NETWORK EFFECT just after the start, then remained reserved near the back, got
hung out wide leaving the backstretch and into upper stretch and passed tiring foes. BOURBON WAR raced off the early pace, hustled along four to five
wide late turn and moved by tiring foes. INTREPID HEART raced between foes in the flight off the clear leader, was ridden along to maintain tempo down
the backstretch then gave way on the turn. OLYMPIC VILLAGE raced off the pace and failed to respond when called upon. MUSICAL HEART was off a
step awkward then bumped with foe at the start, raced between foes and chased after the clear leader then steadied while weakening on the turn.
KINGSVILLE raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. ALMASHRIQ raced along the outside in the flight off the clear leader, chase the pace
into the turn then faded.

Footnotes
IDENTIFIER settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, moved out advancing off the far turn, rallied steadily outside the leaders and was along in the
last 70 yards. JUST WHISTLE advanced around the far turn getting closest to BODEXPRESS, responded willingly through a long drive drifting out and in
under heavy pressure, got past the leader late but could not withstand the top one. BODEXPRESS vied early inside RARE FORM, let that one go midway
on the first turn and moved outside into the backstretch, regained command going past the three-eighths and went clear, drifted out weakening into the final
furlong and gave way in the closing stages. EYE OF A JEDI dwelt at the start spotting the field five to six lengths, got out of last after six furlongs four wide,
and ran by tired horses on the far outside. PROMPT raced well back for six furlongs, improved position three to four paths wide coming off the far turn, and
finished evenly. YOU'RE TO BLAME saved ground outrun early, raced three wide into the far turn, and improved without factoring. SIR ANTHONY was two
wide early and far back, moved inside and never became involved. HARVEY WALLBANGER was outrun throughout. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) stayed in
range early three wide, and gave way after six furlongs. REALM eyed the leaders four wide early, and was through approaching the stretch in the
three-path. RARE FORM vied outside BODEXPRESS before clearing off up the backstretch, lost the advantage to the latter midway on the far turn and
retreated steadily.

HIGHLAND GLORY settled while rated four wide never too far off the early pace, picked up the pace along the outside around the far turn, roused five wide
and advanced into strong contention with a furlong left to run, came under left handed pressure, drifted out wider, kicked in and got up in time.
CHEERMEISTER quickly cleared on top and angled inside, set the pace down the backstretch and kept clear around the far turn, held gamely over the
challenge from SHE'S MY TYPE in late stages then got nailed when HIGHLAND GLORY surged by in final stride. SHE'S MY TYPE (FR) tracked the pace
two wide to the far turn, edged closer then roused three to four wide into the lane, raced in striking range for the lead in the final furlong but lacked the
needed surge to get by. STUNNING SKY was unhurried and saved ground, angled out and hustled on the far turn, raced wide into the lane, gathered
momentum under strong handling and gained late. WALK IN MARRAKESH (IRE) settled in early stages then got in tight between and steadied mid-way
around the far turn, was under a drive five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. HOW IRONIC was reserved two to three wide in the back, continued
in the rear and saved ground on the far turn, swung out five wide and put to a drive, had a mild improve but needed more for serious impact. LUCKY POLLY
rated along the inside then moved around the far turn two to three wide, angled inside near the furlong marker, raced in range then flattened out. HEIR OF
LIGHT was keen while forwardly placed moving into the first turn, stalked the leader to the far turn, continued in close range then gave way in the lane.
SEDUCER was reserved and saved ground, angled out on the turn and failed to rally. FUJAIRAH stalked along the inside, remained in close contention
then prompted near the quarter pole, got in tight and checked late on the far turn, lost all momentum and lacked further response. ONYX raced off the pace
then widest into the lane and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
VEKOMA broke alertly and went along covered up inside to the turn, came under a ride after a half-mile, gradually gained momentum shifting out four wide
approaching the stretch, rallied past YORKTON and HE HATE ME from outside under a drive coming to the sixteenth-pole, and moved away hand ridden.
YORKTON grabbed the lead after the start, rated along in the two-path clear to the turn, responded when hooked by HE HATE ME into the stretch, and dug
in to hold the place. HE HATE ME tracked YORKTON from outside for a half-mile, amped up the pressure challenging in earnest a quarter-mile out, fought
on to the furlong grounds and weakened a sixteenth out. BOURBON RESOLUTION trailed well back for a half, came four wide off the turn and improved on
the far outside while not a factor. HOME BASE posed no threat four wide. BOURBON CALLING lagged well back inside early, and never reached
contention. GARTER AND TIE raced well back early, and could not gain three then four wide on the turn. LAST JUDGMENT was no factor in the two-path.
HY RIVERSIDE faded after a half-mile inside. JACKSON was forwardly placed three wide for a half, dropped back approaching the stretch and was eased
up late.

Footnotes
LA SIGNARE (FR) was taken back off the early pace and raced two to three to the far turn, picked up the pace three wide then guided out wider leaving the
turn, kicked in gamely, rallied along the far outside, cleared command and held firm. ZOFELLE (IRE) settled inside through early stages then waited for a
clear path upon entering the far turn, prompted briefly near the quarter pole then waited late turn into upper stretch, got clear and gained along the rail then
angled out and around VALEDICTORIAN, advanced on the winner but could not get by. VALEDICTORIAN sped to the lead and cleared on top around the
first turn, set the pace down the backstretch and continued clear into around the far turn, roused for more near the furlong marker but could not hold off the
late gainers. PICARA broke on top then conceded position to VALEDICTORIAN, stalked the pace to the far turn, launched a bid for command on the rail,
chased to the furlong marker then flattened out. SMART SHOT trailed in the back, prompted along the outside leaving the far turn, shifted out wider top of
the lane and passed tiring foes. GETMOTHERAROSE steadied entering the first turn then settled while rated near mid-range, hustled up at then quarter
pole then fanned out five wide into the lane and needed more. ANGEL OF MISCHIEF was well placed and raced in range to the far turn, was under a drive
racing three deep at the quarter pole, fanned out wider into the lane then gave way. HIGH REGARD was unhurried along the outside, raced wide into the
lane and lacked a needed rally. ANOTHER TIME stalked the pacesetter through early stages, roused two wide between foes on the far turn then weakened
in the lane. EAST MOON raced midpack near the inside and faded two wide late on the far turn.

Footnotes
MEAN MARY took command at once and moved inside, ducked out in front of BEAU BELLE briefly first time through the stretch and got clipped behind by
that one, scattered some surprised waterfowl continuing to lead the way into the second turn, picked up the pace after a mile going comfortably despite it all,
settled into the stretch with the rider taking a peek back at GENTLE RULER outside the eighth-pole, and held that foe safe under a mild drive. GENTLE
RULER followed along right behind the pacesetter tucked inside for a mile, eased out to the two-path taking aim late on the final turn, responded willingly
when set down but did not have enough to seriously threaten the winner. ELIZABETH WAY (IRE) had the two-path early before moving inside and settling
in midpack for a mile, stayed on the rail offering a mild response turning for home, and finished evenly to best the others. CAP DE CREUS spent
considerable time in or around the three-path on the turns, and posed no threat in an even effort. BEALE STREET saved ground throughout and did not
factor. GET EXPLICIT dropped back to trail early inside, and improved position after a mile without becoming involved. BEAU BELLE prompted the pace
outside MEAN MARY, clipped heels behind that one and stumbled nearing completion of the first half-mile, stayed on the chase to the third turn and gave
way. IRISA (ARG) stayed in range for a mile, and tired inside. KELSEY'S CROSS was always far back. LA AUSTRALIANA raced two wide for the first mile,
shifted out a bit wider and dropped back to the stretch. OVER THINKING showed little two wide through the turns at the back. QUICK WITTED moved out
three then four wide on the final bend, and dropped back.

Footnotes
SWISS SKYDIVER sprinted to the lead out of the gate and kept clear near the inside to the far turn, turned back the bid from LUCREZIA past the quarter
pole, widened to a clear advantage upper stretch, stayed sharp under a steady encouragement and finished going away. LUCREZIA was forwardly placed
around the first turn then stalked behind the leader down the backstretch, crept up two wide to challenge SWISS SKYDIVER for the lead near the quarter
pole, could not get by the game winner but stayed on with response through the lane and nipped foe for place. LAKE AVENUE was a bit tight two wide
around the first turn then raced under a snug hold into the backstretch, tracked in range to the far turn, moved up closer along the outside near the quarter
pole, chased on five wide under firm handling in the lane and got nipped for place. BAJAN GIRL stalked along the inside through early stages, was ridden
along nearing the half mile marker to maintain a position, was even in response on the far turn then stayed on with interest through the lane and bested the
rest. SPICE IS NICE got brushed between foes on the first turn then settled five to six paths wide off the early pace, prompted near the half mile marker,
chased between foes on the far turn and failed to muster a rally. DREAM MARIE settled in early stages not too far off the early pace, launched a bid
entering the far turn, raced two to three wide entering the lane and had no late response. TONALIST'S SHAPE raced five wide entering the first turn, rated
along the outside while never too far off the early pace then failed to respond when given cue. SPARTANKA brushed with SPICE IS NICE and steadied on
the first turn, raced near the rear and saved ground into stretch to no avail. MRS. S steadied at the start then angled inside to save ground on the first turn,
was reserved four to five wide and offered no bid. INVETERATE tugged a bit racing along the inside under a snug hold into the backstretch, was not too far
back early on then had no response when called upon and dropped back. SUNSET PROMISE hustled up at the start and fanned wide into the first turn,
raced in range to the far turn then came up empty. ADDILYN swerved out a path and slightly steadied at the start, raced wide into the first turn and never
reached contention.

Footnotes
BEMMA'S BOY went along covered up behind the leaders to the third turn, came off the rail roused at the top of the stretch, altered course to the four-path
into the final furlong and surged outside CURRENT and ZULU ALPHA to get up in time. ZULU ALPHA was unhurried first time through the stretch, got taken
out widest coming off the second turn, swept up to the leaders with a quick move just past the half-mile pole, battled for command outside SPOOKY
CHANNEL and CURRENT turning for home, put a head in front of the latter in deep stretch but was overhauled from outside in the last strides. CURRENT
bumped with GO POKE THE BEAR at the start, prompted the pace outside SPOOKY CHANNEL for a mile, challenged for command approaching the
stretch between horses, and fought bravely inside the top two to the wire. CHANNEL CAT threw his head briefly at the start coming out slowly, hugged the
rail around all three turns near the back of a tightly-knit group, moved off the inside leaving the furlong grounds, paused for a fleeting instant behind the
battling leaders 50 yards out and maintained his hold on fourth position. SPOOKY CHANNEL set a pressured pace inside, dug in when challenged around
the final turn, was outdueled through mid stretch and weakened on the rail. GO POKE THE BEAR bumped with CURRENT at the start, tugged along in tight
between horses through the first half-mile in the two-path, and had no punch when called on. FOCUS GROUP got nudged out to the four-path by
MANICOMIO toward the end of the first turn, stayed closer than usual for 10 furlongs, and made no late headway on the far outside. GALLEON MAST
tossed his head at the break striking it on the right side of the gate, advanced out of last with a three-wide middle move after a mile, but could not sustain the
rally. MANICOMIO pushed out FOCUS GROUP keyed up under a firm hold late on the first turn, got shuffled back and checked sharply early on the third
turn, and was eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SOCIAL PARANOIA was unhurried out of the gate and angled inside to saved ground, remained well reserved in the back while saving ground, began to
pick up the pace late on the far turn, guided to the far outside, given cue turning for home, kicked in gamely, rallied along the far outside and finished clear.
SOMBEYAY was well placed and tracked the top trio to the far turn, launched bid entering top stretch, roused forward to race in aim for the lead at the
furlong marker, edged by inside duo then got outkicked when the winner swept by. MARCH TO THE ARCH settled nicely while rated along the inside
through early stages, was patiently handled awaiting a clear path on the far turn, lacked room upper stretch, tipped out wider, briefly got clear then steadied
behind SOMBEYAY in deep stretch. HEMBREE was unhurried along the inside, gained ground along the rail on the far turn, lacked a clear path top of the
lane, switched out a couple paths and edged closer while piloted through traffic . DR. EDGAR held a slim lead around the first turn, raced under pressure
from MARAUD then took on the added challenge of keen running EL TORMENTA in early backstretch, continued up close then edged back briefly near the
three eighths pole, came back again for more, dug in gamely to race in aim between foes at the furlong marker then had no closing kick left in reserve.
MARAUD was forwardly placed on the first turn then vied for the lead to the far turn, shook free near the furlong marker, kept clear into upper stretch, fought
back at the furlong marker then got swallowed up late. ENGLISH BEE rated off the pace, prompted in three path near the quarter pole, showed interest then
lacked a clear path top of the lane, shifted wider, continued in crowded quarters and never really got going. MR DUMAS rated along the outside to the far
turn, prompted four wide, continued a bid in contention with a furlong left to run then lacked closing response. BALLAGH ROCKS raced in the second flight,
hustled up between foes on the far turn, raced in tight quarters then steadied at the furlong marker and gave way. LOUDER THAN BOMBS raced off the
pace, launched a bid six to seven wide at the head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. SMART REMARK lost some footing and brushed with rival at the
start then steadied sharply entering the first turn, rated off the pace and failed to response when called upon. EL TORMENTA was away last then keen and
wide around the first turn, tugged up to challenge for the lead in early backstretch, vied into the far turn then came up empty.

TIZ THE LAW came away in good order, edged up outside the leaders around the first turn, stalked under a relaxed hold up the backstretch, moved after
ETE INDIEN and SHIVAREE getting roused past the three-eighths, took over from outside into the stretch, felt two left-handed reminders leaving the
eighth-pole and was geared down the last 70 yards. SHIVAREE contested the pace inside ETE INDIEN from the start, was under a drive from midway on
the far turn, and battled back gamely for second while no match for the winner. ETE INDIEN was a bit washy going to the gate, broke alertly and hooked up
outside SHIVAREE, edged away from that one midway on the far turn as TIZ THE LAW ranged up to his outside, was no match for the latter into the lane
and was outfinished for second. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS stayed in range early in the two-path, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and lacked a
solid response. INDEPENDENCE HALL broke a step slow, bumped lightly with CANDY TYCOON five wide into the first turn, moved in a bit staying in touch
for six furlongs, but had nothing to offer after that. CANDY TYCOON was jostled around exchanging light bumps between INDEPENDENCE HALL and
ROGUE ELEMENT six wide into the first turn, and never became a factor. MY FIRST GRAMMY moved in from the four-path around the first turn, and failed
to threaten. AS SEEN ON TV was close up early between horses, drifted wide tiring approaching the stretch and was eased up late. ROGUE ELEMENT
bumped lightly with CANDY TYCOON strung out seven wide into the first turn, dropped far back and was eased up in the stretch.
