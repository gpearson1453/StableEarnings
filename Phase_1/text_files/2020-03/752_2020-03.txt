early lead and set the pace a bit off the rail, angled in on the first turn and continued along the fence, fought back past midstretch then weakened late.

into the second turn, gained the advantage into the stretch, kicked clear under a steady hand ride then a hold nearing the wire. SPEECH dueled between
horses then outside a rival on the backstretch, took a short lead between foes on the second turn, fought back off the rail into the stretch, could not match

the show. PAIGE ANNE stalked off the inside, angled in some on the second turn and weakened. GIDGETTA had good early speed and dueled inside,

Footnotes
ODYSSEUS stalked three deep then outside a rival leaving the backstretch and on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, took the lead three
deep under left handed urging in midstretch and gamely prevailed. COAST OF ROAN between horses early, angled in and stalked inside, came out into the
stretch, bid between rivals in the drive, fought back inside the winner in deep stretch and could not quite match that one late. SUCCEEDANDSURPASS
(IRE) went four wide into the first turn then stalked three deep, angled in outside a rival leaving the second turn, split horses in midstretch and finished with
interest toward the inside. AVALANCHE also a step slow to begin, angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out leaving the second turn and four wide
into the stretch and was edged for the show. LINCOLN CITY pulled between horses then inside and steadied into the firs turn, saved ground chasing the
pace, came out into the stretch, was between foes in midstretch and was edged for a minor share. SOUTHERN KING also pulled inside and steadied when
shuffled back passing the wire the first time, stalked inside, came out a bit in the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. THE STREET
FIGHTER a step slow to begin, swung five wide into the first turn then angled in and chased outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, angled in some
past midstretch and was outfinished. DARK PRINCE had speed outside then angled in and set the pace inside, fought back along the rail in the stretch and
weakened late. CONTAGION stalked three deep then outside a rival on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the necessary
response. TAKE THE ONE O ONE pulled between horses and steadied passing the wire and again into the first turn when in tight, chased between foes
then inside on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened. ASARO also pulled between horses and steadied passing the wire the first time and
again into the first turn, chased between foes, dropped back outside a rival on the second turn, was pulled up past midstretch but walked off.
