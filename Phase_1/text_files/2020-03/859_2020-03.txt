Footnotes
CAT GONE QUICK broke alertly to grab the lead, put some daylight on JACK BEANSTALK around the turn, and maintained a clear advantage well off the
rail under pressure. JACK BEANSTALK chased after the winner from outside, made no real impression under a full drive before completing a half-mile, and
ran on much best of the others. PUMP ROOM broke in hitting the left side of the gate and steadied having to be pulled off ENANO ASTRAY, advanced two
wide around the turn, and outfinished CAPTAIN FOFO for the show. CAPITAN FOFO raced three to four wide to the stretch, and faded. CHARLY JESUS'
TEAM was slow into stride, and passed tired horses. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST was finished after a half inside. ENANO ASTRAY was always outrun.
MONETIZED showed brief speed outside the leaders, and dropped back on the turn. OPTIMISTIC banged hard into the right side of the gate and was off
slow, and was through early three wide.

Footnotes
DILLON ROCKS held a slim lead entering the first turn then cleared on top, set the uncontested pace while saving ground down the backstretch, remained
clear still unleashed around the far turn, roused for more at head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and finished clear under a mild drive. WINNING
FACTOR raced under a snug hold early on to rate off the clear top pair, saved ground down the backstretch then picked up the pace and loomed closer
along the rail at three eighths pole, sustained a solid two to three wide bid through the lane but failed to be a match for the winner. JOE BENJAMIN raced
just off the lead entering the first turn then settled more off the clear leader, tracked DILLON ROCKS while holding a clear advantage over the next pursuer
to the far turn, picked up the pace racing between foes at three eighths pole then kept along in steady pursuit through the lane and cleared the rest. RAGS
FOR BRITCHES settled two to three wide through early stages, launched a three wide bid entering the far turn, raced in range around the turn then gave
way entering the lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN raced three to four wide in the back, briefly moved up closer upon entering the far turn but failed to sustain bid
and dropped back.

Footnotes
PUT IT ON DETTI was slow early, advanced late on the turn shifting out three wide, and rallied determinedly to wear down CANDY COMA from outside
late. CANDY COMA bumped with EL GRAN PICHON at the start, pressed the pace outside YOUREOUTOFCONTROL, wrested command through mid
stretch and edged clear, but could not hold off the top one. FIFTY CENTS was boxed in behind the pacesetter and inside CANDY COMA leaving the
backstretch, checked midway on the turn, stayed inside rallying through tight quarters on the fence in midstretch and was gamely up for third. FRANCO'S
TEAM paused briefly eyeing the difficulties of FIFTY CENTS on the turn, came three wide with aim into the stretch, moved into third a sixteenth out but
stayed on his left lead and gave up that spot near the finish. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL sprinted clear early, dueled inside CANDY COMA late on the turn
and through upper stretch, and gave way in the two-path. NINTH OF APRIL raced three to four wide to the top of the stretch, and made no headway on the
far outside. EL GRAN PICHON stutter-stepped and bumped with CANDY COMA to get away last, got taken outside soon afterward, and dropped far back
after three furlongs.

Footnotes
COWBOY BOB raced three wide and tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved up to challenge I STAND CORRECTED entering the far turn,
cleared command near the quarter pole, hustled along two to three wide entering the lane and held firm under a driving finish. MATURIN settled along the
outside early on then prompted to pick up the pace nearing the half mile marker, chased along the outside around the turn, continued a steady outside bid
through the lane and captured place. STEADILY rated two to three wide through early stages, hustled up between foes on the far turn then stayed on with
response in stretch run and got edged out late for place. CONGRATS THIS was unprepared at the start, trailed to the upper stretch then gained some
ground. EL ZEUS tracked the pace on the inside, launched a two wide bid on the far turn, failed to keep pace upper stretch and gave way. I STAND
CORRECTED set the pace to the far turn, got headed by the winner near three eighths pole then tired in the drive. STUCK WITH YOU trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GRAN HOMBRE made little headway three wide and under a drive late on the turn, ran on making little if any progress to mid stretch, then kicked in
suddenly and surged outside WEEKEND DREAMER to get up near the wire. WEEKEND DREAMER sped to the front at the start, was clear in the two-path
through deep stretch but could not hang on. WORDMAN was outsprinted to the stretch three wide, and rallied belatedly on the far outside. NEXTSTOP
POKIPC broke slowly, moved up heading to the turn, cut the corner with a rail bid through upper stretch but flattened out. BYCHANCE moved off the inside
late on the turn, lodged a mild bid in the three-path but weakened past the eighth-pole. PALACE KID pressed the pace outside WEEKEND DREAMER to
mid stretch, and weakened. SUPER EDGAR lagged at the back to the stretch, and showed little. CHANELIN tired inside.

Footnotes
KIMURA took the lead in opening stages and crossed over to the inside, set a pressured pace with REITERATE racing in aim along the outside, kept clear
around the turn then hustled up two wide entering top stretch, held a slim advantage over REITERATE in the final furlong, dug in determinedly and refused
to let rival get by. REITERATE applied pace pressure to KIMURA through the backstretch and remained forwardly positioned around the turn, raced two
wide in aim through the stretch run but could not get by the game winner. PRINCESS ULELE was well placed tracking the top two leaders through the
backstretch, roused along the inside entering the top stretch then shifted out three wide and churned on for a share. WORDS OF DEVINE saved ground
early, switched out a couple paths and hustled up mid-way around the turn but lacked a needed rally for impact. QUEEN ABARRIO was off a step slow at
the start, continued reserved through the backstretch, raced three to four wide under pressure entering the lane and failed to threaten. NAPA RULES veered
out and steadied at the start, raced in range at half mile marker then steadily faded. DOMINEER raced along the outside not far off the early pace then had
no response when roused on the turn.

Footnotes
MYFRANCESCA raced in close attendance to the early pace inside, moved out and collared SHANGHAISWEETHEART late on the turn, drew off steadily
under a drive and was hand ridden the last 70 yards. SHANGHAISWEETHEART set a moderate early pace removed from the rail, moved inside entering
the turn, proved no match for the winner before completing six furlongs, and ran on well enough to save the place. A SONG FOR SUE saved ground
throughout, lacked a solid bid and could not reach the runner-up late. BLUE CHICORY was strung out five wide around the turn, and posed no threat with
an even finish. HILLTOP HARMONY leaned in after the break bumping with SAMIS CAR and taking the worst of that exchange, got steered to the far
outside after that, and could not keep pace with the leaders by midway on the turn four wide. KEILANI was making no headway between horses when the
rider lost the whip outside the quarter-pole, and dropped back. PASSING MOMENTS steadied behind SAMIS CAR near the six-furlong pole, and never
menaced. SAMIS CAR shifted in suddenly and had to be steadied behind SHANGHAISWEETHEART going by the seven-eighths, remained erratic shifting
outward in front of PASSING MOMENTS shortly after that, and retired around the turn three wide.

Footnotes
SIR SEAMUS broke on top and led the way around the first turn, settled nicely and saved ground while setting the pace to the far turn, remained clear still
unleashed at the quarter pole, roused two wide entering top stretch then stayed sharp under steady pressure and held firm. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY
secured inside position around the first turn then settled nicely while rated off the early speed, edged closer along the rail past the quarter pole then cut the
corner and launched a bid for SIR SEAMUS top of the lane, hustled along near the inside through the lane, was solid in response but could not get to the
winner. BIG HAMBONE stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, stayed on with response along the outside
through the lane and cleared the rest. SPINNING KITTEN was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, hustled up and raced three wide late on
the far turn then came out wider for the drive and failed to threaten. UNCLE CURLY raced four to five wide entering the first turn then raced off the pace
along the outside, coaxed around the far turn then raced five wide under pressure in the final furlong and lacked the needed response for impact. BYE BYE
MAN tracked the top two leaders two to three wide down the backstretch and had no response when called upon in the far turn. LOOKIN FOREVER was
reserved and saved ground, had no response and was allowed to gallop home under no late exertion from the rider. TIZ LUNA race three to four wide
around the first turn, had no response, dropped back after the half and allowed to ease up in the lane.

Footnotes
FLORA FANTASY began to take closer order while shifting out four wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and was along in time. HOW SWEEP IT IS
pressed the pace outside ONE HOT DRAMA from the outset, got past that rival outside the 70-yard marker but could not hold off the winner. SHES ALL
WOMAN moved up four then three wide around the turn, loomed a threat past the eighth-pole but was outfinished. ONE HOT DRAMA set the pace inside,
fought on when challenged turning for home, and yielded a sixteenth out. GIOIELLI broke a step slow, saved ground for a half-mile, moved out for the drive
and faded. SUSIE'S MEMORY stayed close early three wide, and weakened late on the turn.

Footnotes
MYSTICAL MOON was well placed and tracked the pace near the inside to the far turn, switched out and picked up the pace late in the far turn, set sights
on the leader at head of the lane, roused forward three wide, took over the lead from BODIE CODIE in the final sixteenth and finished clear. PREACHER
MARSEE raced off the pace, circled up three to four wide into contention on the far turn, kept on five wide under a drive in stretch run and gained place.
BODIE CODY held a slim lead around the first turn then set a pressured pace with GOOD SOLUTION applying pressure along the outside, turned away
bids near near the quarter pole, stayed on with game response at the furlong marker then got wore down and weakened late. NINJA DUST rated near
mid-range, promoted two wide around the far turn, shifted out wider entering top stretch, continued a steady bid but needed more for serious impact.
MONMOUTH DR steadied at the start, was reserved in the back, was set down driving seven wide upper stretch and had a mild improve. SON OF
GREATNESS raced under a snug hold to take back off the early pace, prompted around the far turn then coaxed two to three wide upper stretch and lacked
a needed rally for impact. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) raced near midpack and saved ground, briefly gained closer contention along the rail into stretch run
then gave way near the furlong marker. RED FOG was well placed and stalked the top two leaders, roused three wide around the far turn but failed to move
on and steadily faded. A I INITIATIVE was off near the back and quickly angled, saved ground near the rear then raced widest in the stretch run and failed
to threaten. GOOD SOLUTION was forwardly placed racing just off the leader around the first turn, applied pace pressure to BODIE CODIE to the far turn,
launched a bid for rival but could not gain equal terms then tired in the drive.
