at the start, raced back to the stretch and closed the gap in the final furlong. QUEEN OF CHILL was bothered at the start, raced back while along evenly
throughout with no late response. MISS GETTY UP chased winner to the half and gave in readily in the stretch. TRANSLATE inside run to the stretch with
