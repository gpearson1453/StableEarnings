Footnotes
NEOLITHICA sprinted clear early, set the pace near the inner rail and pulled away through the stretch under a hand ride. TRUE SUNSHINE saved ground
around the turn and failed to rally. MOMMA'S LINO , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. LISA'S PALACE , a forward factor
in the two path, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. BOOTSY'S MERLOT , outrun, raced near the inner rail on the turn then swung to the four
path at the head of the stretch. FACE IT ALONE bore out leaving the starting gate, was kept wide around the turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
ADDY'S LADDY T N T broke sharply and cleared early while two wide, took some inside pressure near the half then secured the rail leaving the far turn,
dug in when confronted from the outside by COMMANDING GENERAL, dueled with that one to mid stretch then kicked away under a drive. COMMANDING
GENERAL broke outward, corrected and prompted the pace three wide, moved to near even terms near the five sixteenths, battled past mid stretch, gave
way grudgingly through the final sixteenth and held down the place. RAHMER , taken to rate while saving ground, cut the corner with run into the lane,
eased out near mid stretch and finished willingly. GRAND MANNER , sluggish from the gate, lagged off the pace, swung five wide for the drive and finished
with interest. REMEMBERING WILBUR was hustled up between foes early, chased three deep mid turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then failed to kick
on through the final eighth of a mile. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , urged pursuing the pace, raced between rivals mid turn, shifted in and came up empty.
WILD BEHAVIOR steadied back out of a tight spot when attempting to bid along the rail near half, eased out to stalk three wide, lacked a punch in upper
stretch and weakened.

SULLIVAN STREET , three wide around the turn, bid for the lead outside horses in upper stretch and prevailed under urging. GWYNEDD saved ground
around the turn, eased off the rail turning for home, lacked room in upper stretch, altered course to the five path and rallied outside the winner. SANSA
ARIEL , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. ELLIE VICTORINA , never a factor, raced along the inner rail around the turn.
FANCEE GRACE C stumbled soon after the break, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way. EARLEY ROSE , wide
around the turn, was outrun. HAZELMOOR BEACH raced in the four path on the turn, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
ONE WAY TRAFFIC cleared early then angled in towards the rail, set a rate pace around the turn, was put to a ride entering the lane, kept on under solid
handling through the final furlong and held sway. NANCY MADE MY DAY saved ground off the early pace, crept up into the lane, stayed glued to the inside
and finished gamely to edge BLAME THE TUX for second. BLAME THE TUX came out a bit at the break and made contact with FORCE OF JUSTICE,
straightened and rated close up in the two path and to the inside of a rival, kept on with good energy and just missed second to the rival to his inside.
BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH was rated back from between runners early, raced outside a rival around the turn, swung four to five wide for the drive but lacked
a serious finish. FORCE OF JUSTICE broke a step slow and was bumped, recovered and moved up to stalk three wide, chased outside a rival into the lane,
failed to go on in mid stretch and weakened. FULL PROOF lagged back off the pace, raced to to three wide in upper stretch and had some very late
interest.

Footnotes
FULL IRISH accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR hugged the
inner rail on the turn, angled to the three path at the head of the stretch and closed. JOHN HALL lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and
rallied. FIND FAITH lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. ST. JUDE , in the two path chasing the winner around the
turn, gave way in upper stretch. AMITY ROAD , steadied on a rival's heels leaving the backstretch, swung to the six path in mid stretch and was no factor.
TAKE CHARGE TOO chased the winner while along the inner rail on the turn and faltered in upper stretch. PRESSING CONCERN , four deep on the turn,
chased the pace and faltered.

Footnotes
BLUE TRILLION pulled her way forward early and dropped in to save some ground, eased out near the three eighths while stalking the leader, bid three
wide to command in upper stretch, spurted clear under coaxing, responded to left handed pressure inside the furlong grounds and held sway. DUELA DENT
chased off the rail, shifted four wide with an advance into the lane, ranged up to loom, shifted in through the final furlong and continued gamely to the wire.
CELTIC BOND , forward placed and to the inside of rivals early, gained towards the inner rail mid turn, slipped through along the inside in upper stretch to
take aim, failed to go on with the top pair but stayed on with effort. T C NEIGH broke awkwardly and was away second last, moved up and chased five wide
between runners heading to the turn, came four wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. SHARED AUTHORITY was hard sent to a clear lead, set the
pace towards the inside, was collared while two wide into the lane and weakened in mid stretch. LA MACCHINA ROSSA bore out at the break and was
away last, corrected and lost ground while six deep nearing the half mile marker, remained well wide and failed to make an impact. GHOSTLY ANNA , four
wide between runners early, chased off the inside mid turn and failed to rally. GRACE IN EXCESS drifted in at the break, raced off the pace while saving
ground and failed to menace. CONFLUENCE LASSIE lagged back, swung very wide for the drive but lacked a bid. HEAVENLY CIELLA , three wide
between foes early on, faltered entering the stretch.

MISS HARRIETT sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, eagerly pulled away and was under the whip in mid stretch. STILL GAME lacked
speed, hugged the inner rail throughout, futilely chased the winner through the stretch and was best of the others. YOU CAN'T WIN lacked speed two wide
on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. CHUBLIN , three wide on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and
gave way. BUNNY HOP , in the two path chasing the winner around the turn, gave way and drifted in near the eighth pole. DWELLING LEGACY , rank
leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path around the turn, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
MY FLICKER , patiently rated between rivals, edged up mid turn, dropped in and past the quarter pole, forged through an opening along the rail, spurted
clear near mid stretch, responded to firmer asking soon after and eagerly widened. SUPER RENEE tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes mid turn,
disputed the issue into the lane, failed to kick on with the winner in mid stretch but stayed on with effort to get the place. LADY ZETA sped to the front, set
the pace off the rail, took pressure from outer rivals mid turn, was threatened from both sides entering the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly the final yards. SIMPLY STATED hopped at the break, recovered and rushed up to the inside of rivals near the five eighths, steadied back soon
after then eased back along the rail leaving the far turn, moved off the rail and progressed between runners nearing the stretch, swung out to be about six
wide in upper stretch and came back on with some interest. VIOLENT VIXEN flashed speed then eased back a bit to stalk, raced two wide inside rivals mid
turn, angled to the rail into the lane but needed more late. CONTINENTALCONGRES , four wide outside rivals stalking the pace, moved to apply more
pressure while ridden mid turn, remained wide and outside foes into the stretch and faded. BOURBON WILDCAT broke slowly, edged up three deep into
the turn, lost ground five wide from the five sixteenths into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
EYES ELEVEN stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, gained a short lead in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole,
was adroitly handled when attempting to drift in more during the drive and narrowly prevailed. PHOTO HOP chased the pace down the backstretch, hugged
the inner rail around the far turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, challenged in upper stretch and continued gamely. CHICA CHUCK , rank while
three wide the first turn, chased the pace, advanced in the two path between horses on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and weakened.
JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH set the pace along the inner rail, moved to the two path leaving the far turn and gave way. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN stumbled
when acting up at the break, his rider quickly adjusted his left stirrup, then was forced to be steadied when bothered by the loose horse entering the
backstretch and entering the far turn. SURFBOARD , fractious in the starting gate, unseated his rider when he reared at the break. There was a stewards'
inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.
