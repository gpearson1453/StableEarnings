Footnotes
BINGO WAS HIS NAME set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, and kicked away from the three path down the lane under light
coaxing. CRYPTONYM hit the gate and broke out at the start, trailed in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, and rallied for place.
BUILDER JAK rated inside, was cued passing the three eighths, shifted out to the five path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. DECISIVE
WARRIOR chased from out in the seven path before tipping into the four path going into the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and was one paced.
FEDERAL HIGHWAY brushed the side of the gate leaving, raced off the pace in the two path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and did
not threaten. TIZAFASTBULLET prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, but faded in the four path down
the lane. BOLKIN stalked in the three path but weakened along the inside in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROSCOE VILLAGE broke on top despite bobbling, set the pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. WHO LADY WHO was bumped at the start,
stalked the winner in the three path, could not reach that foe in the lane but kept on to hold the place. SHE TAKES CASH raced in range three and four wide
and had a mild rally outside. TAKE YOUR POINT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. INABLINK
saved ground and failed to menace. THREEDOTS ANDADASH was outrun while racing two and three wide. SHINING SKYE broke awkwardly then was
bumped soon after, chased the pace two and three wide and faded through the stretch. CREATIVPERFORMANCE bumped soon after the start, raced in
range two wide and retreated inside around the far turn.

GENERAL LEDGER stalked in the four path, was cued midway around the turn, bid from the five path going into the stretch, drifted in while dueling with an
inner foe into the final sixteenth, and prevailed. REEF RUNNER chased in the two path, tipped out to the four path leaving the turn to bid entering the
stretch, dueled with an outer foe while being herded inwards into the final furlong, and was edged out late to place. ZIO LORENZO prompted the pace in the
three path, had to steady passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. SABIAN trailed in the four path,
fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the stretch, and made no impact. OUR LEGAL TENDER set the pace in the two path, was cued
passing the quarter, but yielded in the final furlong. PREVENT raced off the pace in the three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, but never
menaced.

Footnotes
SHERIF ALI stalked the pace three wide, took a narrow lead in midstretch, drifted out, drifted in and edged ahead under a drive. FALFURRIAS bobbled at
the break, saved ground in range, angled out in upper stretch and rallied to gain the place in the final strides. BAYTOWN PARFAIT set the pace in the two
path, was collared by the winner near the eighth pole, fought on inside and just missed second. DONTBESOOGROUCHY failed to menace while racing two
and three wide. SUMMER STORM STRIC was outrun inside. SANPIRODU chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.
WHISPERING SEA played no factor while racing two and three wide.

GAMBLING HOLIDAY set the pace in the three path, was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the stretch, and drew clear.
BANDERO bumped with an outer foe at the start, then steadied around the first turn, stalked in the two path, was cued along the inside into the far turn,
floated out to the four path turning into the lane, and kept on for place. PARADISE DRIVE steadied around the first turn, tracked in the four path, was ridden
into the far turn, tipped out to the six path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly on his left lead for show. DECISIVE PRIDE laid up close in the four
path, was coaxed from the three path into the far turn, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, was in tight in upper stretch, and flattened.
AWESOME FIRST steadied along the inside around the first turn, was held up in the three path turning into the backstretch, ridden from the four path into
the far turn, drifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and was no factor. BRAGGADOCIOUS trailed in the two path, was cued midway around the far
turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, and never threatened. ROYAL FOX HILLS got squeezed at the start, was unhurried in the four path
early but could never get involved. GINGERSNAP JACK raced in midpack in the five path, tipped into the two path entering the far turn, but came up empty.
BULLETONTHECHARTS bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path but never menaced. BOOYAH steadied midway around the first turn,
dropped wellback along the inside and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GHOST (GB) stalked the pace two wide around the first turn and from the rail around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, took over near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead late. SIMPLY STRIKING set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. AGRA was
hard held while fighting rating through the opening half, launched a five wide bid around the far turn and flattened out a bit in the lane. PARISH LANE saved
ground and failed to menace. RAINING SUGAR raced off the pace three and four wide and never threatened. ESCAPE ROOM initially settled off the pace
three wide, rushed up late on the first turn, briefly led early on the backstretch, pressed in the three path from to upper stretch, was in slightly tight quarters
and faded. LET'S GO PHILLY saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch and had no rally. GOOD
BRIGHT FLAMES had early speed three wide and steadily faded. ABOVE THE SUN trailed inside.
