Footnotes
JESSEBEAR stalked from inside, tipped out at the five-sixteenths pole to take aim at the leader, drew alongside in upper stretch and took over at the eighth
pole, dueled through the final furlong and maintained a short advantage to the wire. BOUGIE LIKE took control early from inside, set all the pace to the
stretch, dueled with JESSEBEAR in the final furlong and finished gamely in defeat. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE tracked in the two path, moved inside on the
far turn, lacked room along the rail from upper to midstretch, shifted off the fence and held the show. IN HER PRYME reserved four then three wide,
traveled three then two wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and lacked a bid. BLONDZILLA tossed her head at the start to break a bit slow, pulled
early along the inside, lacked room leaving the far turn, altered in midstretch and could not rally. CANDY ON TOP stalked three deep early, ridden along
three then four wide on the far turn and could not rally when called upon. BETSY IS THE CODE tucked inside at the back, angled four wide leaving the far
turn, drifted in to the heels of a rival in upper stretch and was quickly corrected but failed to threaten after. RYDER'S CANDY tossed hear head and got
brushed from outside at the start only losing a step, raced up close outside the pacesetter early, lost some ground on the far turn chasing two then three
wide, got a bit crowded in upper stretch and weakened. ROUND IN CIRCLES broke inward, traveled three then two wide around the first turn, trailed outside
a rival into the second bend, dropped back two wide then moved inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EL REY DORADO broke well then pressed the leader from outside, raced on even terms three wide into the stretch, took over outside the eighth pole and
kicked clear in the final sixteenth. MAN CHILD set the pace inside EL REY DORADO, dueled two wide into the stretch, lost command approaching the
eighth pole, was no match for the winner late but stayed on to secure second. CALIFORNIA TIGER chased the top pair from off the rail, rounded the bend
three then four wide, followed within striking distance in the final furlong and got denied by MAN CHILD for second. TOLEDO ROCKET tossed his head and
hopped at the start, chased outside a rival up the backstretch, dropped back and angled down to the inside on the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

on the turn, challenged from outside leaving the bend, resisted to midstretch but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. BELLA D reserved in the early going,
saved ground trailing through the turn, remained inside down the stretch and needed to find more late. SHE'S GOT A WAY broke a bit slow then stumbled

Footnotes
SAFA pressed the pace between rivals, gained the advantage at the quarter pole, dueled two wide into the lane, shook free in upper stretch under coaxing
and powered away without being asked in the final sixteenth. CHASING KAT was off slow to begin, rushed up outside the top pair, fought three deep around
the bend, could not stay on with the winner in upper stretch but was clearly second best. FIAMINA chased along the rail, two wide past the quarter pole and
weakened. EASTER COMING BACK cleared from outside, steered inward and set the pace inside a pair of rivals, fought through the turn and relinquished
the lead at the quarter pole, chased the new leader into the stretch and faded to fourth. LOVME LIKEAFOOL took up shortly after the start, dropped back
early, passed rivals three then two wide on the turn and failed to menace. WAILEA SUNSET tracked the top trio off the inside, rounded the bend three then
four wide and came up empty. R MARILYN LONHRO shifted in and tossed her head at the start in a poor beginning, ran up on heels and had to steady

BIG CITY LIGHTS pressed the pace from between rivals, fought on even terms at the quarter pole, carried a short lead into the lane, cleared outer rival in
upper stretch and held over the late effort from the runner-up. NEWGATE chased the leading trio into the turn, traveled along the rail then eased out to the
three path, finished willingly from outside and was gaining to the wire. SIR ATTICUS trailed off the inside, ran then three to four wide around the bend,
moved out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally. ESCAPE ROUTE pressed three deep into and around the turn, dueled into the lane, failed to kick on
with the leader entering the furlong grounds and weakened. MOR TEQUILA set the pace inside a pair of rivals to the turn, fought along the rail through the
bend, started to weaken entering the lane and gave way.

LUNAR IMPACT (GB) took control early and set the pace under pressure, maintained command through the turn, shook free in upper stretch and remained
well clear to the wire. MISS LIZZY settled inside, saved ground through the turn, bobbled crossing on the dirt, remained inside, finished well and bested the
rest. REAL FIRE sat off the pace, took the turn three then two wide, got floated out and lost her path across the dirt, altered out into the stretch, finished
determinedly and missed the place. TICKLE MY FANCY stalked off the rail, went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, angled
out and came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. CAST MEMBER stalked from inside, steered out across the dirt and lacked further response.
ARINNITI (FR) was off a bit slow and brushed at the start, traveled along the inside near the back through the turn, tipped two wide approaching the stretch
and was not a factor. DIAMONDS DANZING rank early when reserved, trailed outside a rival into the turn, angled out across the dirt and failed to make an
impact. BOSS BRIDE pressed the pace from outside to the top of the lane and faded.

Footnotes
MUTH raced up close three deep, challenged midway around the bend, fought four wide into the lane, cleared with a furlong remaining and was ridden out
to the wire. PILOT COMMANDER pressed the pace from between rivals, put a head in front at the quarter pole, dueled three wide into the lane, relinquished
the lead to MUTH in upper stretch and stayed on to hold second. SLIDER broke in and brushed MOONLIT SONATA, went up to take control inside rivals,
fought inside a pair of foes while in the two path around the bend, lost command at the quarter pole, chased after the new leader in upper stretch, kept on
willingly in the final sixteenth and missed second. BOLTAGE chased five deep up the backstretch, remained wide through the turn and lacked a response
when called upon. MOONLIT SONATA bothered by SLIDER leaving the gate, trailed in the early going, passed a rival while saving ground through the turn
and failed to menace. FORMIDABLE MAN chased four deep early, dropped back three then two wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
IRISH PROPHET stalked from the rail position, tipped two wide on the far turn, bid four deep with a furlong left to run, dueled outside MALTESE FALCON
(IRE) in deep stretch and got up late. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) unhurried in the early going and moved inside, advanced up the backstretch, continued to
make progress around the far turn while continuing to save ground, challenged from the fence in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole, fought with
IRISH PROPHET late and got outkicked. HULA CANDY sat off the pace in the three path, spun five wide into the stretch and gained the show. TESORO
was closest in pursuit in the two path early on, challenged from outside midway around the far turn, gained the advantage in upper stretch but was soon
overtaken by MALTESE FALCON (IRE) at the eighth pole and flattened to fourth. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) traveled two then three wide near the back
around the clubhouse turn, angled five wide leaving the second bend and improved position. SBAGLIATO lost his footing at the start then stumbled leaving
the gate, traveled three deep at the back into the first turn, trailed into the backstretch, saved ground into the stretch and showed a mild response to improve
position. LEGISLATOR broke a step slow, settled inside, chased between rivals in the two path into the far turn, angled out into the stretch, moved inward in
the lane and could not rally. RECKLESS SPIRIT tracked two wide early, drew closer three deep on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and flattened.
ONE OF THESE DAYS (IRE) stumbled at the start, reserved in the two path off the pace, came three wide into the stretch, ran into minor traffic when losing
his path in midstretch and could not rally after. LAHAINA FLAVOR came away awkwardly to begin, traveled along the inside near the back, saved ground
while ridden along on the far turn, put to right handed urging in upper stretch and failed to make an impact. MARKS HIP established the front and move
inside, tested from outer rival near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled two wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and gave way.
