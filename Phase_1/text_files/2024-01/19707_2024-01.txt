Footnotes
NET WORTH saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in leaving the turn and
dueled from the sixteenth pole, was brushed in later yards but took the nod nearing the wire. A THOUSAND IDOLS was forced out and made light contact
with Rush To Candy leaving the gate then tapered in through the front stretch, took the lead into the opening turn and rated the pace, came under pressure
leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, drifted outward in the stretch, made light contact with Net Worth in later yards and was
outfinished. DOWSING ROD saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and stayed in
range through the upper stretch, but relented in later yards. LEAVENWORTH was bumped at the break and rounded the first turn about the four path, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path the far turn then flattened in the lane. RUSH TO CANDY was jostled at the break and saved
ground well back from early contention, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and could only improve his position.
DREAM OF GOLD was forced out at the break then steadied lightly past the three quarter pole, rounded the opening turn off the rail and gave chase past
the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response. REMASTERED veered out leaving the gate then saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase
from the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. LONG COOL was forced out leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the three
path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and had no response in the lane. The Stewards reviewed,

Footnotes
GIACOMO CASANOVA stalked from the five path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far
turn, dug in for the lead later yards and inched clear nearing the wire. JUST CALL ME AL stalked the early pace from the three path, took the nod
approaching the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was met, and reluctantly ceded later
yards. FUNKLE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened later yards.
JONAS HILL ROAD rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three and four paths on the
far turn then flattened in the lane. MALEKES MAGIC settled off the rail on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. OUTLAW BILLY took over into the first turn and rated the pace, came
under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met near the three eighths, dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn.
DON'T GET CAUGHTUP entered the opening turn about the four path and showed little further response.

Footnotes
GREAT DEVOTION pressured the pace and contested even terms leaving the quarter pole, took the nod entering the stretch, drifted through the lane but
held on well under steady right hand urging. MIDNIGHT PASS pressured the pace between horses through most of the backstretch, dropped back toward
the quarter pole, entered the turn about the four path then drifted outward through the lane and came along to take second the final yards. TRUST THE
NUMBERS chased through the backstretch then moved to the rail through the turn, dug in leaving the turn and came along to take third the final strides.
LUNA WEST accelerated to the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the rail past the quarter, remained a factor
through the turn but weakened in later yards. HANNAHS RED RUBY gave chase through the backstretch, drifted to the six path on the turn and showed
little in the lane. DAPPLESANDDIAMONDS chased toward the outside, raced in the six path on the turn and showed little in the lane. BERNIE'S
DREAMING was shuffled back on the chute then saved ground.

PRINCESS MARGARET stalked from the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path approaching the
head of the lane, then kept alert to draw off the final sixteenth. LIME STAR came away a bit awkwardly then rated close inside, picked up the chase leaving
the three eighths pole, eased to the three path on the far turn and dug in to take second the final stride. COLD CASH took the lead two deep approaching
the nine sixteenths pole then stalked into the backstretch, recovered the advantage approaching the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on
the far turn but was met nearing the head of the lane and flattened toward mid-stretch. VIESTE raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase into the
backstretch then flattened in the three path on the far turn. PALACIO closed to a brief early lead but was met toward the nine sixteenths pole, recovered the
lead nearing the half mile pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths but was caught at the five sixteenths and faded through the far turn.
FANTASY FROST mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
S S CASINO GIRL took an immediate lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was mildly urged leaving the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail,
widened through the final sixteenth then taken in hand late. THETA gave chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn and settled for second best. OUR BREW
exchanged contact with Swipe That Candy leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and cleared third nearing mid-stretch, then
flattened later yards. EVEN SMARTER gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SWIPE THAT CANDY exchanged contact
with Our Brew leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little further. RUMORGOINGAROUND chased the early
pace inside, angled to the six path through the turn and offered little more. MSSNAP veered out leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the three path
on the turn and weakened. PRETTY CASTLE saved ground.
