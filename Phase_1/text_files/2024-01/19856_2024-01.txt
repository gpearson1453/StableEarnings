Footnotes
STASSI was well rated early two wide, shifted out leaving the five sixteenths and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn
and drew clear, then held on late to prove best, driving. CHARM ALARM was reserved early, three wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn and then
was bumped by the furlong marker and then closed full of run but could not get to the winner, second best. MUSKOKA SUMMER was allowed to settle
early, two wide on the turn, came four wide off the turn and then was bumped and in tight by the furlong marker, then got back into stride and finished
willingly to gain the show award. CUT FROM CLASS was settled early, saved ground on the turn and made a mild bid off the turn on the inside but flattened
out late. JACK'S LILLY was settled back early, came three wide into the lane and then was shut off and blocked and had to check hard by the furlong
marker and then shifted out and had a belated rally. MAGIC BEAUTY pressed the early pace and made a inside bid by the quarter pole to duel for
command but weakened in the drive. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE was allowed to settle early, three wide entering the turn and dropped to be two wide off the
turn, angled out and bumped a rival nearing the furlong marker and faded. COULD BE A COUGAR was fractious in the gate, set a pressured pace two wide
and was headed by the quarter pole and then gave way in the drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A TRAINER AND JOCKEY OF THE
NUMBER EIGHT MUSKOKA SUMMER FILED OBJECTION AGAINST THE NUMBER SEVEN CHARM ALARM FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH,
AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE OBJECTIONS AND LEFT THE RACE AS IS, DETERMINING THE NUMBER
SIX CAUSED THE INTERFERENCE..

Footnotes
TERPEYE was slow into stride early, saved ground on the turn, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and closed full of run to get up late to prove best
under a drive. GREEN GABLES stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn and was clear by the furlong marker but was caught late while
saving the place award. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN tracked the early pace on the inside, shifted out and came three wide into the lane and rallied well late.
STORMY SPELL chased the pace on the inside and had no rally. CHLOE ROSE chased the pace three wide and had no rally. SHATTER ME was away
alertly to set the early pace while clear and on the inside, then was headed nearing the quarter pole then came up empty in the final furlong. BILLIEANNE
failed to menace. KASHAN was reserved and three to four wide on the turn and was not a threat. DUE TO FOG NOTES MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY
ACCURATE.

Footnotes
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY tracked the early pace three wide, made a two to three wide bid on the far turn and drew clear nearing the furlong marker and then
remained clear to the wire to prove best under a drive. CAUSALISTIC was allowed to settle early towards the inside, three wide on the turn, swung out five
wide leaving the turn and had a late rally to gain the place award. TEXTPECTATION was void of early speed, four wide on the far turn, swung wide leaving
the turn and rallied on the far outside. JUPI'S LIGHTNING was four wide into the first turn, then settled on the outside, came five wide off the turn and had a
mild late rally but needed more. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE tracked the early pace on the inside, moved out nearing the quarter pole and came three wide off
the turn and made a bid but flattened out late. FORECLOSURE was off slowly, then moved up to chase the pace on the inside, moved out and made a four
wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out in the lane. WENTZ was away alertly to set the pace while clear on the inside, then was headed leaving the
five sixteenths and then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BALI MOON was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane to the outside and closed full of run to draw away late to prove best,
driving. CURLIN'S DOVE prompted the early pace five wide and finished willingly gaining the place award late. BAY AND GOLD vied for the early lead four
wide, made a four wide bid to draw clear by the quarter pole, then faded late and lost the place award late. CELTIC REVIVAL chased the early pace, six
wide by the quarter pole, then shifted in nearing the furlong marker and had a late rally. WAHINE MEANIE vied for the lead in between rivals and weakened.
DIVINE PROMISE tracked the pace four to five wide and weakened. BALI HAI was off slowly, then advanced between rivals and weakened. UPTOWN
SERAPHINA vied for the early lead two wide and then was empty. DISCO DAISY pressed the early pace on the inside and then checked and lost an iron
and stopped by the three eighths marker. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN AROUND THE THREE EIGHTHS MARKER BUT THE RACE WAS LEFT
AS IS. DUE TO PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION THE FINAL MARGINS WERE MADE BY THE WRITER OF THIS CHART.

Footnotes
OUR ANDREW B chased the early pace from between rivals, then was two wide on the turn, made a bid inside the pace setter and edged away late to
prove best under a drive. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY set a pressured pace two wide, then made a bid to shake clear and drifted out leaving the turn to be four
wide off the turn, but was caught in the final sixteenth while being clearly second best. GRUMPY BROOKSIE tracked the early pace on the inside, shuffled
back on the turn, then came again late up the inside to gain the show award. EMPTY MY POUCH stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the
quarter pole but flattened out. OPENING HOURS was settled early, three to four wide on the turn and had no kick. WATCH THE TRAMCAR pressed the
pace on the inside and weakened. TAPACHILL was settled back early and lacked a rally. THERE WAS NEARLY A THIRTY MINUTE DELAY INTO THE
RUNNING OF THIS RACE AFTER THE NUMBER SIX CHUCK ADAMS UNSEATED HIS RIDER AND GOT LOOSE NEARING THE GATE AND
REMAINED LOOSE FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE FINALLY BEING COLLARED AND REMOVED FROM THE TRACK.

Footnotes
LLOYD was hustled along to get to the front and set the pace while clear on the inside, drew out on the turn and then drew off leaving the turn and was kept
to right handed crop to prove much the best. GURT'S WARRIOR was rated along the inside, moved out to make a bid on the turn and was between rivals
by the quarter pole, came three wide off the turn and could not gain on the winner while being clearly second best. WATERMELON CRUSH was settled
back early on the inside, swung wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally to gain the show award. LOUIE'S HEAT tracked the pace three wide and was
ridden along on the turn to keep up and weakened in the drive. HE AROSE was reserved early, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally.
PRACTICALLYMINE was settled early on the inside, then chased the pace four wide and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SUMMER ASH was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn, split rivals by the quarter pole and swung out five wide leaving the turn and made a bid
to draw away in the furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. MILLBANK MAN was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and made a
inside bid off the turn and finished willingly but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. GIUSEPPE was away alertly to set the early
pace while clear, racing in the three path on the turn and was headed off the turn, weakened in the final furlong while saving the show award. ALMOND
CIDER stalked the early pace and made a four wie bid by the quarter pole but flattened out in the final furlong. JACK SLYE chased the pace and was four
wide on the turn and weakened. ONEHANDSOMEDUDE was fractious in the gate, chased the pace on the outside and was five wide on the turn and tired.
CANTANKEROUS CAT was off slowly and failed to menace. MR BOLDACIOUS was through early.
