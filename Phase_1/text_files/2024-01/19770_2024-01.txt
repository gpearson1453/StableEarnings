EL DE CHIREL led the way on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and dueled gamely to the wire to hold the win. FINAL
VERDICT chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, challenged from the three path coming around the bend and dueled gamely to the
finish to narrowly miss. CITY HUMOR hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four
path and improved position in the lane while never threatening the top two. MYSPECIALVALENTINE raced in the middle of the pack between horses early,
navigated the bend from the three path and finished evenly. EL BAILADOR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued
around the bend in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. OUR DARK COURAGE trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and was never a factor. EAST TO BEAST raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, came around the turn in the three and
four path and faded in the stretch.

CAPTURE MY DREAMS raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still
in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held off the late closers at the finish. CROSS ISLAND bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the
gate, raced in the four path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming
around the bend and gained ground late. UNWHIRLED bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace inside, saved ground around the second bend and improved position in the lane. PRETTY FLATTERING raced in
the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch.
BELLA MIURA saved ground early, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to move up coming around the second bend, entered the stretch in the four
path and passed tiring horses in the lane. DISCO QUEEN raced in the five path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. WHAT A KNOCKOUT bumped with the horse to his inside at the
start, angled over to save ground around the first bend, settled in the middle of pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path and showed no kick. LIL ANNIE ROSE saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn and faded in the lane. SHEA ON A MISSION saved ground around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack,
dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there.
