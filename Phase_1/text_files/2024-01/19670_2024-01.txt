VEGAS DREAM sped off and opened up on the field on the backstretch, continued to take no prisoners on the turn and into the lane, took a deep breath
midstretch and walked home to just last. GET MY POINT saved ground throughout, launched bid along the rail, responded well to make it interesting late,
and galloped by crossing the wire. PRINCESS AMANDA settled off the pace on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane three wide
and made mild progress to the wire. ASYLUM quickly trailed on the backstretch, saved ground throughout and failed to threaten. AROUSING LOVER
stalked runaway leader on the backstretch, continued to be in second through the turn and tired entering the lane.

SEIGE THE DAY broke a step slow, hustled through a tight hole to go to the front, continued to dictate terms on the turn, entered lane in the three path and
held safely in the lane. DIVINELY DIVERSE chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued chasing clear leader on the turn, kept to task in the lane
and just lasted for second. MACHO SAM tracked inside on the backstretch, continued on the rail on the turn, launched bid two wide into the lane, kept to
task and won bob for 3rd. CATHEDRAL LIGHT tracked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, launched bid four wide and
kept to task to the wire and just missed third. MONGOLIAN MOON settled off the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn,
launched bid along the inside, and finished up evenly. LAMPY tracked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and
weakened under pressure in upper stretch. ASPHALT ANDY off bit slow, quickly trailed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and never
threatened.
