Footnotes
DISTORTED LIMITS allowed to settle, closed willingly under left handed urging five then four wide through the stretch and got up in the final strides. TUFF
ATTACK broke alertly to set the pace along the inside through the clubhouse turn, gave up a narrow lead, matched strides the balance of the trip and
finished gamely for second. YOUVESAIDITALL stalked the early pace three wide, drew on near even terms for the lead entering the far turn, contested the
lead the balance of the trip and was outfinished. FUEGO CALIENTE stalked the early pace, loomed boldly between horses three wide entering the far turn,
dueled two wide past the sixteenth pole two wide, steadied late and dropped back. FRANCO offered a mild bid two wide nearing the far turn then failed to
sustain that bid. BRODYTHEOXMAN failed to menace. STRIKE THE TOP was no factor. GAMBLER settled inside and was through after a half.
SOLITAIRE GAME pressed the pace two wide through the first turn, made the lead, set the pace to the seven sixteenths pole, remained a sharp threat into
the stretch then gave way. THE RIDER OF FUEGO CALIENTE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF YOUVESAIDITALL FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SEND ME ON stalked the pace through the far turn, rallied three wide under left handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker then finished full of
run under a brisk hand ride to win going away. MANGA MAN trailed into the far turn, swung wide, rallied outside rivals and got up for second. SPEEDY
MOBILE pressed the early pace two wide, angled inside the leader near the half mile marker, made the lead nearing the far turn, set the pace until deep
stretch then was outfinished. DOUGS MORNING PICK moved up two wide on the far turn and into the stretch then leveled off. VISUAL MISSION saved
ground into the stretch, angled out to the four path past the furlong marker then faded. PRIVATE DRIVE set a pressured pace two wide for a little over a half
mile, kept on into thee stretch and weakened late. WEEKENDER was through after a half.

Footnotes
COME SEE ABOUT IT set the pace two wide then along the inside, turned back multiple bids from the runner up, dug in late under left handed urging and
just proved best while fully extended. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR trailed around the clubhouse turn, circled rivals four then three wide with a rapid move to
draw on even terms for the lead entering the far turn, dropped back a bit in upper stretch then came on again later under right handed urging but was
denied. DISCLOSURE unhurried early, improved position inside rivals through the far turn, angled out to the five path near mid stretch and finished
determinedly. AULD LANGE SYNE stalked the pace into the far turn and faded in the stretch. HIGH ROLLING DUDE close up along the inside, was through
after a half. PATIO PARTY pressured the winner along the inside through the first turn, shifted outside that one before a half, remained a sharp threat
through the far turn then gave way.

JUSTA LITTLE MOORE away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path at the top of the lane then widened the balance of the trip
to win as much the best under strong handling. MOMENT IN THE DARK pressured the winner two wide into the stretch, angled inside that one to the four
path past the three sixteenths pole then was no match while clear for second. KENNEDY'S CAMELOT unhurried early, passed tiring rivals through dep
stretch in the five path. RUNAWAY RUSSELL well placed to stalked the pace, failed to respond. ONE STEP ASIDE failed to menace. WHY KENNY WHY
was no factor. MY TICKET reared at the start and was outrun. MY HOMBRE was no threat.

Footnotes
FABRICATE pressed the pace two wide while hung out in the four path, was carried out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, rallied under left then right
handed urging and was along in time. PAMMY'S READY away alertly, set the pace off the rail in the three path through the turn, drifted out to the seven
path entering the stretch, maintained the lead until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner while well clear for second. KINGDOM QUEEN bobbled at
the start and went evenly. QUARANTINA found her best stride late in the six path. AUJARA failed to menace. JEN'S BATTLE was outrun.
SOMUCHSUGAR was no threat. ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch and gave way late.

Footnotes
KELLEHER was bumped at the start, settled near the inside, angled out entering the turn, closed willingly four wide under left handed urging through deep
stretch and got up in the final strides. WEEKEND RETREAT away alertly, battled for the early lead five wide, took over after a quarter, set the balance of the
pace, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch and just missed hanging on. SOL OF VAQUERO forwardly place along the inside, lacked room midway
on the turn, dropped back, shifted out then came on again three wide. REDDEN was forced in bumping the winner at the start, offered a mild bid along the
inside nearing the top of the stretch then leveled off. SWAYBACK MOBIL trailed early, moved up quickly five wide on the turn, angled inside the leader at
the top of the stretch, remained a sharp threat past the furlong marker two wide then came up empty. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA had brief speed. BOLD
NICKY had a brief early lead, matched strides along the inside into the turn then wilted. EQUITY CAT drifted in at the start and was through early.
