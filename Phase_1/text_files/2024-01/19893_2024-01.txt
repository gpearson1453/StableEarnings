Footnotes
TATTERED HEART unhurried early, closed willingly inside rivals on the turn and through upper stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker and drew
clear under right handed urging. CURIOSITY KILLS rushed to the lead inside rivals before a quarter, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the three path
then couldn't handle the winner and just held on for second. SWEEPINJUSTICE trailed through the turn, closed rapidly along the rail into the stretch, altered
course to the five path for racing room near the furlong marker and was steadily gaining ground late. CHARGINA stalked the pace four wide and went
evenly. IRON BERTIE stalked the pace five wide and failed to respond. RIVERVIEW STEVIE made the lead shortly after the start, set the pace for nearly a
quarter, kept pressure into the stretch and was through after a half. DULCE VICTORIA pressed the pace two wide for a half then gave way. LOIS failed to
menace.

lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip under left handed urging to win as much the best. LAKE SHORE DRIVE away alertly, set
the pace two wide into the turn then along the inside to the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner while clearly second best. HE'S THE
SOUPERWON stalked the pace four then four wide into the stretch and finished finished with good courage. ONE MORE RING unhurried early, improved
position late in the five path while two wide. KOSCIUSZKO offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. PARKER failed to menace.

Footnotes
CLEVELAND POWER trailed early, closed rapidly along the rail into the stretch, shifted two wide past the three sixteenths pole, split foes to make the lead
past the furlong marker, was bumped from his outside into RAY'S EMPIRE and proved best under left handed urging while fully extended.
WATCHOUTFORWEAVER chased the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow advantage nearing the furlong marker, drifted in when struck with a
right handed whip bumping the winner at the furlong marker, dug in gamely but finished second best. RAY'S EMPIRE broke alertly and opened a daylight
lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside until mid stretch, was bumped then weakened. RED COMET chased the pace along the inside into
the far turn then weakened. LITTLE RONS ROCKET was no factor. PALACE TEMPTATION failed to menace. HARTSTEIN with the second flight three
wide, was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF RAY'S EMPIRE LODGED A CLAIM AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF

Footnotes
MORETHANREADYEDDIE prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run to win going away
while taken in hand late. HUNTERTOWN stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch, shifted three wide at the three sixteenths poled and finished well
clear for second. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD was in tight at the nine sixteenths pole, stalked the pace two wide and went evenly. HITSVILLE failed to
menace. RED GUN was no threat. SMART COVERAGE away alertly, set a rapid pace to the top of the stretch along the inside then was used up.
