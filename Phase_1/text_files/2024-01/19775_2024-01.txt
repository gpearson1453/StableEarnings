Footnotes
GREY PRINCESS settled off the pace while racing two wide, inched closer three wide between foes around the far turn, angled out for clear sailing in upper
stretch, closed outside and was up near the sixteenth pole. CHERU saved ground in range, bid at the rail in midstretch and was outkicked.
SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth marker and held for the show. PEP RALLY prompted the pace in the three path
and weakened in the lane. WHAT'S GOOD failed to menace while racing three and four wide. STARSHIP SIGRUN broke a step slowly, raced off the pace
four wide around the first turn, made a five wide middle move, reached contention nearing the five-sixteenths pole but failed to sustain the bid in the lane.
BATTLING BUBBLES raced off the early pace four wide, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. HUGE G
was rank early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LOVE MAMI LOVE stalked in the two path, waited along the inside passing the quarter, was cued from the rail into the stretch, and drew past an outer foe in
the final sixteenth. OLYMPIC ARTIST raced up close in the four path, took aim under a drive turning into the lane, tipped out to the six path passing the
eighth pole, and ran on for place. CALL ME PENNY set the pace inside, tipped out to the two path around the turn, was roused at the top of the stretch,
drifted out on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and faded late to show. STREET CHARITY raced off the pace inside, had to steady going into the turn,
was coaxed passing the quarter, swung from the four path into the lane, was herded outward in the final furlong, and stayed on. MISS UPROAR chased in
the three path, was ridden into the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, but flattened. PRIMA RIVIERA raced wellback in the three path,
was roused from the rail midway around the turn, but did not factor from back in the three path down the lane. WEST BANK trailed in the two path early and
never threatened from the five path in the stretch. CORAZONA rated in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
GOODBETTERBEST set the pace in the two path, drew off around the turn and widened through the lane under mild urging. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL chased
the winner three wide and was clearly second best. DREAM TRAP prompted the pace from the rail, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn and
churned on to hold the show. NUMERIC failed to menace while racing two wide. GRANDMA'S PUDDING played no factor while racing two wide. SUBTLE
FAITH was outrun while racing four wide. HIDDEN ROAD had only brief speed four wide.

Footnotes
HAY HAY HARRY bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, bumped with the same inner foe going into the turn, tipped inside
under rousing passing the three-eighths, and kicked away along the inside down the stretch under a drive. CANAVERO prompted the pace in the four path,
bid under coaxing in the three path around the turn, floated back out to the four path in upper stretch, but was second best. BREEZE THE BAYOU bumped
with an outer foe at the start, pressed the pace inside, bumped with the same outer foe and had to steady going into the turn, tipped out to the five path
under a drive turning into the lane, and finished evenly for show. AIR FORCE ROYALTY trailed in the four path, angled to the rail turning into the stretch, but
was no factor. GO GO SANTI raced off the pace in the two path, but never threatened in the five path down the lane. FUJI FIRE had an awkward start,
stalked in the five path, was ridden from the four path into the turn, but weakened from the six path in the stretch. MISS ATHLETIC chased in the four path,
fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was no menace.

Footnotes
GODDESS OF FIRE tracked in the three path, was roused along the inside midway around the turn, swept to the lead while tipping out to the three path at
the top of the stretch, and drew clear while being kept to task. STEEL RACER vied for the lead in the two path, took command passing the half, faced
challengers on both sides passing the quarter, lost the lead at the top of the lane, but dug in to hold place. WRIGHT UP FRONT stalked in the six path,
loomed from the five path rounding the turn, bid in the six path going into the stretch, but evened out for show. ROSE E HOLIDAY trailed in the three path,
tipped to the rail going into the turn, but made no impact. LA RUNA bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the five path, bid between
foes in the four path midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, and weakened. MISS UCRANIA raced wellback along the
inside, tipped out to the four path going into the turn, but was no menace from the five path in the stretch. DEVIL BLUE DRESS bumped with an outer foe at
the start, led in the four path early, but backed up early around the turn, was eased passing the quarter, jogged across the wire, and walked off.

JAM SESSION set a clear pace in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch and just lasted. VOLKERT was bumped at the start, saved ground off the
pace, rallied between foes in the lane and just missed. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) raced in range inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and had a mild
stretch gain. SWAGGISH chased the pace four wide, lost ground in upper stretch then kept on to narrow the gap without threatened. FROSTED FAITH was
bumped at the start, trailed in the three path and had only a mild rally. PAY ZONE chased the winner three wide and tired after a half.

Footnotes
SONIC SPEED bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid while in hand midway around the far turn, took the lead while
being cued from the three path at the top of the lane, and inched clear. STRIDE bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, waited
between foes in the two path rounding the far turn, was roused while tipping out to the five path going into the stretch, and ran on for place. BORN A
GAMBLER stalked in the two path, bumped an inner foe passing the five-eighths to secure an inside position going into the far turn, was roused from the
three path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. MEHLEK trailed in the three path, was cued while fanning out to the eight path turning into the lane,
and stayed on. OPPOSITES ATTRACT laid off the pace in the three path, was coaxed along rounding the far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch,
but had to steady in the closing stages to make no impact. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) was restrained along the inside turning into the backstretch, got bumped by
an outer foe around the five-eighths and had to steady, then had to wait along the rail around the far turn, and could not threaten. SWASHBUCKLE set the
pace in the two path, was roused into the far turn, but yielded from the two path in the stretch. TAPIT BRIO rated in the four path, but failed to menace from
the seven path in the stretch.
