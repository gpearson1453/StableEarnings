Footnotes
DREAMING OF SMARTY ran on inside to the front, kept on determined throughout while clear in the stretch under mild urging to the wire. THIS ILL
DEFEND well placed while never far back to the turn, rallied along under urging for place. CLEARING WAIVERS beat slow from gate, three wide to quarter
pole showed late. AGADOR SPARTACUS inside run to the stretch with no late kick in the lane. MAQAMAT chased top pair from inside to far turn with
nothing left late. CROWLEY'S WAR sharp break from outside, lagged back with no late response. CHRISTMAS PRESENT had no speed from the start and
never menaced throughout. RAF tried to keep up for a half with nothing left, faded back.
