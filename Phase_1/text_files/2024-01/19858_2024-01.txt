Footnotes
LAMPORGHINI dueled for command from outside, failed to shake free from LADY MONCLOAIRE on the backstretch, battled two wide through the far turn,
finally put away inner rival in upper stretch and held well under urging. SNEAKER stalked two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, took aim at the top
pair entering the lane, moved out in upper stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong but lacked the needed late punch to reach the winner. LADY
MONCLAIRE dueled for the inside LAMPORGHINI while in the two path on the clubhouse turn, lost a bit of ground early on the backstretch then moved
back on even terms past the half-mile pole, fought along the rail through the far turn, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong
while able to retain third. WHERE IS ZIZI hesitated at the start to come away very slow, started to pull and became rank when trying to rate off the inside,
chased two wide then along the rail on the far turn and lacked a response in the lane. STRIKEFLASH brushed with inner rival at the start, settled inside,
trailed under coaxing up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two wide, tipped out in the lane and failed to menace. FIAMINA brushed with STRIKEFLASH
at the start, stalked along the fence, lost ground and was asked left handed on the backstretch, dropped back further on the far turn and tired.

continuing to save ground on the far turn, rallied to the front in the final sixteenth but got nailed at the wire. ANTIBES bumped with outer rival then ran up on
heels and became rank prior to the first turn, chased the top pair two to three wide, came four wide into the stretch, launched a bid in the final furlong and
missed in a blanket finish. BERT'S PROSPECT stalked from inside into the first turn then duel with outer rival briefly when the leader was pulled up, inched
ahead to take control and showed the way under pressure in the middle stages, lost command approaching the quarter pole, lost touch with the leader
leaving the far turn, inherited the lead from a lugging out BE PUNCTUAL midstretch and got outkicked in the final fifty yards. BE PUNCTUAL bumped with
ANTIBES early, chased two wide into the first turn then dueled from outside, pressed the pace up the backstretch, inched ahead with a quarter mile
remaining, kicked clear while starting to drift out leaving the far turn, began to lug out badly through the lane, could not be corrected and dropped back in the
late stages. MORE TRY sped clear quickly, pulled up and taken out wide on the clubhouse turn and walked off.

FLYER in the final sixteenth. MYSTIC FLYER stalked briefly in the two path then moved up to apply pressure from outside while in hand, lost touch for a
moment at the half-mile pole then drew alongside the leader once again, took a briefly lead leaving the far turn but was soon overtaken by GHOST OF
MIDNIGHT In upper stretch, stayed alongside that rival into the final sixteenth and yielded late. LAMBEAU cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the
pace under pressure early, cleared again briefly at the half-mile pole before being pressure again by MYSTIC FLYER, held a short lead inside a pair of rivals
through the far turn, lost command approaching the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ZIMBA WARRIOR settled off the pace four wide into the first
turn then moved into the three path, continued at the back while outside a rival into the far turn, rounded that bend four then three wide also and never
threatened. DEPARTURE stalked along the inside and became rank on the first turn, chased behind the leader on the second bend and weakened in the
stretch run. MONGOLIAN GOLD was off a bit slow in the beginning, traveled in the two path at the back into the clubhouse turn, went three then two wide

Footnotes
ON THE WHIM took control from the fence early, overtaken early on the backstretch then moved up to regain command inside a pair of rivals, maintained a
short lead through the far turn and into the lane, dueled with MOOGIE SON in the final sixteenth and dug in gamely to prevail. MOOGIE SON traveled three
deep early near the back, gained ground through the middle stages, chased in range from the three path on the far turn, bid four deep into the lane, dueled
with ON THE WHIM in deep stretch and could not get by. RED CROSS KNIGHT stalked five wide or four deep on the clubhouse turn then tugged the rider
forward to vie for command three deep, fought continued to battle three deep on the far turn and into the lane but got outkicked by the top pair in the furlong
grounds. BARELY FUNTIONAL got bumped and steadied at the start, moved inside while unhurried, went outside a rival in the middle stages, rounded the
far turn two then three wide, tipped out into the stretch and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. DICK BEST raced up close in the three path
early, vied between briefly into the backstretch then dropped back a bit to chase outside a rival, moved over to the rail near the seven-sixteenths pole, cut
the corner into the stretch and flattened in the late stages. HEAT N REHEAT rated in the two path, three deep at the half-mile pole, went two then three wide
around the far turn, lacked room in traffic behind the leaders in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and flattened. MOGOLLON RIM coaxed along
outside a rival off the pace, moved inside on the backstretch then went between rivals into the far turn, traveled two wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
DRUIDIC made contact with inner rival at the start, rated on the inside early behind the leaders, dropped back a bit on the backstretch, got crowded along
the fence past the half-mile pole, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a rally. EREBUS bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed three deep on
the first turn then pulled to the front and vied between rivals, fought two wide through the far turn still between foes and faded in the stretch run. HAPI HAPI
got bumped and put in tight at the start, settled along the inside in mid-pack, raced towards the rear on the backstretch, had to pause when running into
traffic at the quarter pole and failed to menace after. BRAVESTONE took a bump and got pinched back at the start, trailed on the fence then shifted to the
two path quickly on the clubhouse turn, ran four then three wide on the far turn and failed to make an impact.
