backstretch outside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and dug in to take second under the wire.
BOSS E BOOGS stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested even terms in the three path on the far turn and dug in
leaving the turn, but was outfinished for the win and nipped from second under the wire. BON BUENO settled off the rail the first turn then moved to the
outside into the backstretch, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and passed rivals widest in the lane. HOT

Footnotes
WINDSOR'S MEMORY tapered in with a slim early lead then contested the pace leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at even terms two deep on the
turn and dug in determinedly to edge clear late yards. LIVANA gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path, dug in under steady
handling and finished well to take second under the wire. PLAYING FOR TWO contested the pace from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at even terms
nearest the rail on the turn and dug in gamely to late stretch before reluctantly ceding and was nipped from second under the wire. IMINCHARGENOW gave
chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. LAURA'S GRAND chased, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane.
TAPTAP gave chase outside, raced in the six path on the turn and showed little in the stretch. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE gave chase and raced near the rail
on the turn. JUJU ON DA BEAT gave chase to no avail. AWESOME MOON saved ground.

Footnotes
HONEY BELLA took over while tapering in nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace, was met leaving the first turn and dueled from that point,
edged clear past the quarter and was steadily handled in the lane. JUBA'S PARADE stalked from the three path the opening turn, gave chase approaching
the three eighths pole, raced close in the four path on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. YOLO CHARLOTTE 's rider lost his iron after
the start but quickly recovered, rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced through the far turn in the
three path and came along to take third the final strides. VOLNAY stalked off the rail the first turn then moved to even terms into the backstretch and dueled
from that point, but dropped back leaving the quarter pole and flattened stride leaving the far turn. EMBERLY settled inside on the first turn, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. MARINA GRANDE left the first turn outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
SOMESUGARNSPICE pressured the pace and took the nod at the rail passing the five sixteenths pole, dug in determinedly through the stretch and just
lasted to hold off BULL'S LEGACY, who took a brief early lead then gave chase from the half mile pole, raced close in the four path on the turn, dug in
gamely leaving the turn and just missed. MY LUCKY DEIA chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. CANDY
TRICKS set a pressured early pace but was met leaving the five sixteenths pole, remained a factor off the rail on the turn but flattened stride inside the
eighth pole. GRUMPY N U KNOW IT chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. DREAM STREET ROSE was shuffled back
early then gave chase while racing well off the rail. SHEWONTTALKTOME gave chase then flattened in the four path on the turn. SPECIAL KAYLEE
engaged in close chase to the five sixteenths pole, was steadied off the inside flank of Bull's Legacy at that point and faded through the turn.
