Footnotes
PAMZ PALACE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the bend, kicked clear in the lane and
held that margin to the wire. TURBO MILLIE raced off the pace early, began a bid from the three and four path coming around the turn and gained ground
late to the finish. RITZ ON BROADWAY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend, could not go with
the winner in the stretch and kept on from there. JERSEY FACTOR was squeezed back leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and finished evenly while never threatening. GULF COAST GIRL veered in and bumped with the horses
to her inside at the start, settled at the back of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and showed no kick.
MISTYMORNINGSGIRL dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch. FUTURE FORTUNE chased the
leaders between horses through the early going, continued around the turn in the three path and tired in the lane. HOLY KINGDOM bumped with the horse
to her outside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch.

chased the winner home late. FABULOUS CANDY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in
the two path and gained ground late. NEW WAYS TO DREAM was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
came around the turn in the two path and kept on in the stretch. DIVISIBILITY chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the four
path coming around the bend and was outkicked from there. MOON ROSE trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no

turn and dueled in the stretch to get up for the win late. SPECTACULAR LUCK bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the two path early,
dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the far bend, dug in gamely in the lane and was caught near the wire. EHSAAN hit the gate leaving it,
raced wide into the first turn, coming around that bend in the four path, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began
a bid from the four path around the second turn and improved position in the lane. LATE NIGHT LIVING raced in the three path early, stalked the leader on
the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the far turn and kept on to the wire. LIFE IS PRECIOUS raced in the three path
around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the four path and finished evenly.
ZEN AIR bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, raced in the five path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace, came around the far bend
in the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane. PURPLE AURA flipped her head up leaving the gate, recovered to track the leader on the inside
through the opening half mile, continued around the second turn still in the two path and weakened from there. BAHAMIAN NATIVE saved ground around
the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far bend and tired in the stretch. GRAY MIRAGE raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. HYDROLOGIST missed the break,
