Footnotes
PUNCHIE pursued from midpack along the inside, launched a rally splitting foes turning for home before taking aim outside of the top pair nearing the lane,
sustained progress to bid in upper stretch, cleared in the final sixteenth and held from an outer belated bidder. QUEENIE'S LEROY stalked along the inside,
chased around the far turn, shifted outside of the leading trio in the final furlong, rallied late while hanging on his lead but ran out of ground. A G'S GEM
stalked two wide, bid around the far turn, vied between horses in upper stretch but was bested late. RENATI laid off of the pace two wide, came under
coaxing four wide around the far turn then ran on willingly. FLASH N CLASS set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer pair in upper stretch
and gave way. BREAKING STAR hopped and spotted the rest multiple lengths at the start, trailed in the four path and improved position. MINE YOUR BIZ
pursued from the three to two path and failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. NATIVE REQUITE hopped and was off a bit slow at the start, lacked
speed in the three to two path and was outrun. RONALDS GATSBY tracked two to three wide but weakened between horses around the far turn.

ALMOST DIALED OUT tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the leading pair and from the four path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch and drove
clear at the furlong grounds. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE stalked two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer challenger nearing
midstretch and was second best. OAK HILL SENIORITA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted off the fence leaving the three sixteenths pole and
edged show from an inner rival late. PURRFECT MOON tracked three wide, got floated to the five path by the eventual winner entering the lane and gave
way while hanging on his left lead. MISSHEARTBREAKER set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer pair in upper stretch and weakened.

POLAR BEAR PLUNGE tracked two wide, bid along with an outer rival in midstretch, dueled with that one through the late stages, but shifted out and
brushed that one while inching ahead at the wire. YO DADDY rated well back three wide, rallied four wide entering the far turn, sustained progress to bid
along with an inner POLAR BEAR PLUNGE in midstretch, sparred with that one through the final furlong, but was brushed and herded outwardly while
failing to maintain even terms in the shadow of the wire. DROBNY sped clear early on, opened up a wide margin around the first turn, but was caught by a
pair of outer bidders at the furlong grounds, gave way yet lasted for show. BRIE'S MISSION pursued from midpack two to three wide, got outmoved by an
outer rallying YO DADDY around the far turn, yet picked up stride entering the lane and ran on willingly to miss reaching show. COMMODORE pursued
from the inside, chased two wide and between horses around the far turn and lacked a bid. ENGLISH BOBBY broke out and bumped a rival at the start,
stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane and faded. THEPLAINS MARSHALL trailed early on, advanced in the five path around the far turn but
failed to menace thereafter. TAYSOM broke slowly but avoided contact from inner rivals by doing so, saved ground off of the pace and failed to factor.
SHARMA'D was bumped by an inner rival leaving the gates, laid off of the pace two wide, pursued between horses down the backstretch, but faded behind
foes around the far turn. THE RIDER OF YO DADDY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF POLAR BEAR PLUNGE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
FINAL FURLNOG, FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, POLAR BEAR PLUNGE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND

Footnotes
GALLANT BUCK set a clear pace in the two path, drew away entering the lane when let out a notch, came under a drive inside the final furlong before being
put to hand with a sixteenth to go. LORD DYLAN trailed along the inside, stayed on with a rail charge to bid for place leaving the furlong grounds, and edged
that position passing the sixteenth pole. OVER CALENDARED broke outwardly, stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, chased while yielding
to that one in upper stretch and lost place to an inner foe at the sixteenth marker. UNCLE NICK tracked in the two path, shfited out to the four path
approaching the three furlong pole, then lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead. HOMELAND MESSA was urged along off of the pace in the four to five
path and got outrun.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW BINGO settled off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path for clear sailing passing the three sixteenths pole, rallied to reel in the
new leader in the final sixteenth and drew clear. LILY'S WOOFY prompted along the inside before stalking the leader into the turn, tipped from the two to
three path to take aim outside of that one turning for home, sustained a bid while hanging on her left lead nearing the furlong grounds, wrestled an
advantage changing over nearing the final sixteenth, but was caught by an outer bidder in the late stages. ZOOM ERIN broke a bit outwardly, showed the
way in the two path, resisted an outer challenge in midstretch, but was bested entering the final sixteenth. SIKUM tracked in the three path and between
horses, then chased evenly. MOVE IT BABY pursued from midpack in the four path, drifted to the five path entering the lane before being floated to the six
path in upper stretch, then lacked a rally. MISS MELODY chased along the inside and lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead. CARSON'S PRINCESS
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TANMANCAN set the pace inside of a vying rival, sparred with that one around the turn, got briefly headed nearing the lane before reclaiming an advantage
in upper stretch, shook free and drove clear entering the final furlong, then lasted from an outer oncharging bidder late. BACKFIRE was floated into an outer
rival soon after the start, tracked from midpack in the three path and between horses, swung to the five path entering the lane, rallied with a steady charge
to take aim on the newly clear leader in the late stages, but ran out of ground to reel him in. ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND was a bit tough to load, then broke
outwardly, vied for the lead two wide, wrestled a narrow margin nearing the lane, but hung on his left lead and relinquished the advantage to his inner
counterpart in upper stretch, then yielded passing the furlong grounds. PURPLE OCTOPUS stalked from the two path, then chased in upper stretch before
getting outkicked for show at the furlong marker. COOKN WIT CATMAN brushed an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack in the four path and lacked
a bid. DROMAS chased along the inside and lacked a rally. MAJESTIC CRAKEN took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides soon after the start,
raced at the rear in the two path around the turn and made little impact. STARTING GUN stalked three wide, entered the lane in the four path and
weakened between horses. VICTOR ALY never got involved from the three path. STRONG DIAMOND was last away before being brushed by an outer rival
into an inner foe at the start, then was outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
MIND BOLT tracked two wide and between horse, tipped to the four path entering the lane, rallied up to the clear leader in midstretch, forged an advantage
in the final furlong while sparring and prevailed. BONZER set the pace, disposed of a pressing foe and drew clear entering the lane, dug in to resist MIND
BOLTs bid in midstretch but was grudgingly bested. DEBT PAID was floated inwardly and bumped an inner rival to crowded quarters early on, steadied
slightly when brushed by an outer rival in the aftermath, pursued from off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, shifted to the six
path entering the lane and ran on well. PATRIARCHAL steadied behind outer troubled rivals early on, raced at the rear in the two to three path, rallied by
splitting foes two wide in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. CARTHAGE CAJUN laid off of the pace four wide, fanned to the eight path entering the lane
and moved up. GIMME THE CANDY tracked three wide, but drifted to the seven path entering the lane and yielded between horses. BIG FIG stalked along
the inside and gave way. SEVEN ANNIVERSARY was bumped by an outer rival and steadied early on, then was outrun along the inside. BALTIMORE
HEART was off slow while breaking awkwardly, shifted outside of rivals and quickly pulled forward in the opening furlong, pressed outside of the leader into
the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. THE RIDER OF PATRIARCHAL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MIND BOLT
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE OPENING STAGES, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MISS NIMBUS sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path, opened up entering the lane and was kept to task. GIGI'S LUV tracked along the
inside, gained place in the two to three path entering the lane and held from an inner bidder. EVE EVE pursued from midpack along the inside, ran on to bid
for place entering the final sixteenth but was denied. SWEET GUITAR lacked speed in the three path and between horses, then improved among foes in
midstretch. COSTA LADY trailed along the inside and improved between horses. LEXI'S FURY brushed an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the
pace in the two path and failed to menace along the inside. STEAL ME OVER lacked speed in the four path and improved. LASSIE'S DUE DATE was
bumped between horses soon after the start laid off of the pace in the four to six path around the turn before floating to the seven path entering the lane and
failed to factor. FLASH IT WIDE OPEN bumped an inner rival at the start, chase in the three to four path while between horses, then faded among foes in
the five path in upper stretch. SOY TU SUERTE stalked in the three path, drifted to the four path entering the lane and weakened between horses.
STORMY COUNTRY DAY tracked in the four to six path and weakened.
