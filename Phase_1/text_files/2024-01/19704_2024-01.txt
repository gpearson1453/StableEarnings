Footnotes
TENSAS LU LU dueled for the early lead, took the advantage around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. LONG SHOT LOUISE lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, split rivals down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. RED WHISTLE raced near the back in the beginning,
made a late bid, racing four wide and was outfinished for second. HIGHLANDER'S EDGE vied for the early advantage, dueling with TENSAS LU LU in the
early going, tired down the home stretch and lacked a finish. TARKINGTON GIRL void of early speed and passed tired ones. KAT'S PRINCESS pressed
the early pace and faded down the home stretch. PRINCESS MOCCASINS raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and dropped
back. GEMMY raced within contention, retreated to the rear and was outrun.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE SUMMER unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, split rivals down the stretch and got up late. SASSY SAGEY pressed
the pace, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground and was outfinished for the win. INDY LOVER raced within striking distance, made a late bid and was
outfinished by the top two. CAYMAN QUEEN raced in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was no real factor. EAGLEOVERTHEMOON dueled
on the front end in the early part, drove clear down the backside, saved ground around the final turn and faded. MAGNA COLORS lacked early speed and
was never a threat. I'M ALL MIXED UP pressed the early pace and dropped back. PIPPA'S PROSPECT raced near the back, came around the first turn on
the outside and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #1 SASSY SAGEY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 CHEROKEE SUMMER FOR
INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

PIP SQUEEK pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear around the final turn, pulled away and proved the best. ISLAND GOLD raced near
the middle of the field, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
CIRCLE UP raced within striking distance, was close throughout and proved no match for the top two. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY lacked early speed,
showed late interest, but was no factor. RULED BY SPIRIT went to the front, drove clear and faded. TIFFANY'S FERRARI raced in the middle of the field
and put forth an even effort. LIGHT FACE raced evenly near the back and showed little. C C LLAM always raced near the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TAPPIN FORA DANCE unhurried in the beginning, racing in the middle of the pack, came around the second turn on the outside, made a bid, racing three
wide and proved the best late. INCORRIGIBLE dueled on the front end, drove clear, led until deep in the home stretch, couldn't match strides with the
winner late. TAPIT'S SPIRIT pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. HONOR MY SPEED was an early
factor, racing near the front throughout and lacked a late kick. GOTTA GO raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a rally.
APPLEWOOD lacked early speed and was never a factor. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST always raced near the back and showed little. PAYDAY TOO void of
early speed and was never a threat. VERRAZANO FIRST dueled briefly on the front end and stopped.

Footnotes
SAUCY ARGUMENT unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, made a rail bid and got up late. BELLAMY BROTHER vied for the early
lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner late. MY UNCLE BILLY lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, rallied wide down the home stretch and finished willingly. MUSTBELIEVE raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, showed late
interest, but was no real factor. ZAPAWAY raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, made a bid at the head of the stretch and weakened. MR.
NUMERO UNO challenged for the early lead, saved ground and faded. FLYING IN HOT raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn
and weakened. DOCE DE LA NOCHE raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn six wide and faded. FLATTERSOLUTION pressed the
early pace, dropped back and was eased to the wire.
