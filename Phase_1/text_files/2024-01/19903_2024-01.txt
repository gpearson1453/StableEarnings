Footnotes
JEWEL AZUL , forwardly placed while saving ground into the backstretch, steadied back to the inside of rivals heading to the half mile marker, regrouped
and responded to pressure leaving the far turn, advanced to the inside of rivals near the five sixteenths, angled out entering the lane, closed determinedly
under solid asking, forged clear nearing the sixteenth pole and eagerly drew out while kept to task. WILLOWMYGIRL , four wide into the first turn, dropped
in a couple paths and stalked the leader, was under a ride past the five sixteenths, kept on with effort and was able to get past a fading rival for the place.
ROPERS N WRANGLERS took over between rivals into the first turn then cleared, set a rated pace towards the inner rail, moved away without much asking
leaving the three eighths, was under pressure two wide soon into the lane, failed to contain the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and weakened late.
CAIRO MOON eased back off rivals soon after the break, edged up between runners through the backstretch run, was under a ride three wide past the five
sixteenths, shifted out some for the drive but lacked a solid finish. LUNAR UNIT stumbled badly at the break and was away last, regrouped and settled,
gained four wide outside foes past the four and a half furlong marker, failed to kick on under asking heading to the lane, faltered and was eased through the
final furlong.

CLASSICAL stalked three wide and to the outside of ADMIRAL HALSEY, was nudged along past the five sixteenths, kept on doggedly through the lane and
just got up under strong handling. ADMIRAL HALSEY broke sharply then sped clear into the first turn, set the pace in about the two path, held a clear
advantage into the lane, wandered out under pressure near mid stretch, grimly maintained the advantage while drifting in past the sixteenth marker, kept on
valiantly but just failed to contain the winner's charge. SOUTH COAST ROUTE , in range two wide, moved up to the inside of rivals, had aim behind the top
pair into the lane, shifted in towards the rail past the three sixteenths, gave hard chase but failed to make a late impact. WITHOUT EQUAL , urged from the
gate, was outrun through the backstretch run, saved ground leaving the far turn but failed to generate a serious rally. BARON'S SONG exchanged a bump
with ICE STORM soon after the break, raced three wide between foes nearing the backstretch and gave way. ICE STORM broke a step slow, bumped with
BARON'S SONG in the opening furlong, was used four wide to contention, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered.

FEEL FREE moved up to the outside of SHILSHOLE BAY heading to the turn, wrested command without much effort soon after, cleared off under rating,
responded when asked two wide in upper stretch and eagerly drew away under a steady hand ride. SHILSHOLE BAY was sent clear early, ceded command
nearing the three eighths, stayed on to pursue three wide into the stretch, kept on with effort and remained clear for the place. SNOOZY SUZY was sent up
between runners soon after the break, chased three to four wide past the five sixteenths, faded through the final sixteenth but managed to save the show.
KAMIKAZE BLUE , carried well wide leaving the far turn, raced five into the lane but needed more between foes. SHE'D RATHER DANCE close early while
inside, lugged out near the three eighths pole bothering KAMIKAZE BLUE, corrected to circled six wide into the stretch but failed to make an impact.
HAUGHTY KITTY , bumped at the break, raced removed from the rail while off the pace and failed to menace. ADORABLE WISH , bumped at the break
and was away slowly, dropped in toward the rail nearing the turn, had the rider lose the whip around the turn, stayed inside into the stretch and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
PUSH THROUGH settled off of a contested pace while saving ground, angled off heels near the quarter pole, swung out six wide with momentum into the
stretch, closed rapidly outside rivals, switched over to his correct lead near the sixteenth pole and surged away while ridden out. EAST RAND chased the
pace two wide, worked his way between runners in mid stretch, kept on willingly and earned the place. SIGNOFTHECROSS , away well, rated back off the
leaders in the opening furlong, raced three deep into the turn, came five wide for the drive and churned on. MAD LUTHER , between runners nearing the
half mile pole, angled out and pursued four wide into the lane, edged up in mid stretch but was out finished. OUR VALLEY vied inside a rival while under
rating, took command leaving the far turn, spurted away and was guided three wide into the stretch, kept on under a drive to mid stretch then weakened
late. SMOOTH PAPA dueled outside OUR VALLEY, could not quite keep pace with that one near the quarter pole, shifted out a bit with pursuit in upper
stretch, was put in a bit tight while still trying in mid stretch then faded. HOLY EMPEROR saved ground, moved up slightly near mid stretch, failed to sustain
and weakened through the final seventy yards.

RUBY RAY vied to the inside of DUKE GIRLS early on, stayed on to prompt the pace of STARDUST DREAMS past the five sixteenths, came back in the
two path and to the inside of that rival to re engage a furlong out, dueled under solid handling, edged away slightly in deep stretch then was fully extended to
narrowly prevail. GODDESS OF WAR chased the leaders three to four wide and outside a rival mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch, leveled off to her
best stride leaving the sixteenth marker, surged outside and just missed. STARDUST DREAMS , off a bit slow then floated outward, angled out and rushed
up five wide outside rivals to take over into the turn, moved clear under some rating past the five sixteenths, dug in when taken back on in mid stretch,
sparred to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. BITCOIN BURGLAR , under a hustling wide while pursuing and saving ground near the five sixteenths,
shifted out briefly in upper stretch, altered back down towards the rail and continued on with effort. DUKE GIRLS broke outward, dueled outside the winner
early on, was caught between foes into the turn, gave chase three wide and to the inside of rival mid turn, entered the lane three wide but failed to drum up
the needed kick. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY , off the pace and off the inside, shifted in past mid stretch but lacked a solid rally. ENGLISH MEADOW , off the
pace, saved some ground past the quarter pole but failed to menace. DADS DIVA steadied shortly after the break, lagged back while well wide and lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
IMPASSIONED CLAIM had speed then was rated back off the embattled leaders into the turn, chased to the inside of a rival mid turn, shifted out four wide
into the stretch, leveled off under a drive leaving mid stretch, forged to command inside the sixteenth pole, edged away a bit then held firm. YOU'RE MY
BOY KAT chased to the outside of the winner around the turn, was fanned six wide as that one angled out into the stretch, straightened away and closed
willingly. WESTERN CHARM , urged three wide outside a rival leaving the three eighths, angled four wide for the drive and rallied mildly. THIRSTY , four
wide early, moved up and bid three deep, dueled around the turn and into the lane, shook clear under pressure past the furlong grounds, was overtaken
inside the sixteenth pole and weakened. FULL BORE , well wide and off the contested pace, came four wide into the stretch, shifted out near the sixteenth
marker and finished well. JOHN GREY rushed up in the opening furlong, sparred between rivals around the turn, failed to keep pace with the leading pair in
upper stretch and faded. PIRATE MISCHIEF lagged back while well off the rail and failed to make an impact. FAST AS FAST CAN B disputed the pace
inside a pair of rivals leaving the far turn, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way. OUR HY ROLLER , inside with pursuit, was under a ride into the
lane, shifted out and faded under some hand urging.
