Footnotes
STAGGER LEE broke a step slow from outside, chased three deep then outside a rival into the turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside
WESTERN GRIT in the final sixteenth and wore down the runner-up. WESTERN GRIT took control early then cleared inner rival and moved inside, showed
the way along the rail to the stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly late. OOBUBBAKAKAYO broke inward, settled off the
pace and got floated in by outer rival early, chased along the rail then tipped three wide on the turn, moved out further in the stretch and came with a mild
late bid to earn the show. DON'T HIT ME BASH chased between rivals then two wide on the turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, lugged in and had to
steady to avoid making contact with rival in upper stretch and finished evenly in deep stretch. TRAVELIN' SHOW broke in a bit to lose a step, raced in range
three deep entering the turn, exited the bend four wide and lacked a rally. NO SHOW JONES brushed the gate and broke in a bit, traveled along the inside
into the turn, moved out around the bend and came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. JETFIRE broke well then chased from inside, got
shuffled behind trouble rival on the turn, tipped two wide at the five-sixteenths pole and could not rally in the lane. GOT MY PRANCE ON raced up close
inside the leader early then chased to the turn, lugged out and had to steady at the three-eighths pole, remained along the rail into the stretch and
weakened. CLUBHOUSE CHARLIE got crowded leaving the gate and dropped back early, raced outside rivals then two wide into the turn, angled to the rail
around the bend and was no factor in the stretch. A WALK ON THE MOON bothered by outer rival early, dropped back while racing greenly up the
backstretch, trailed two wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
DIVINE FEMININE rated on the inside early, tipped three wide around the far turn and put to right handed urging, reached the front with a furlong left to run
and drew away in the final sixteenth. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) raced up close in the two path, applied pressure from outside in the middle stages,
gained the advantage past the quarter pole, relinquished the lead while between runners at the eighth pole and stayed on to secure the place. TOP OF MY
GAME grabbed the early lead from inside, took pressure from NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, was overtaken
late on that bend, fought to midstretch and faltered late. ONCOMING broke cleanly but was outkicked early, trailed a bit off the rail through the first turn,
chased two wide into the drive and lacked a rally. OH GREAT (IRE) brushed the gate, stalked two to three wide outside a rival, rounded the far turn three
then four wide and weakened.

good not fend off the winner. DANCING DANA raced up close early then applied pressure from outside, headed ON PURPOSE around the turn, fought to
midstretch and weakened. MAJESTIC OOPS chased off the rail early then suffered a mild shuffle at the five-eighths pole, raced along the rail into the turn,

Footnotes
MICI'S EXPRESS stalked on the inside then angled to the three path around the clubhouse turn, chased two wide into the far turn, bid three deep
approaching the stretch, dueled outside STOLEN TREASURE into the final sixteenth and drove clear. STOLEN TREASURE prominent early in the two
path, applied light pressure from outside in the middle stages, dueled with LAST CALL LONDON on the far turn, inched ahead in upper stretch, carried a
short lead into deep stretch while fighting inside MICI'S EXPRESS and yielded late. LAST CALL LONDON stepped to the front from inside, showed the way
up the backstretch with STOLEN TREASURE to the outside, fought with that rival through the far turn, held a short lead over outer rivals into the lane, lost
command in upper stretch and faltered in the late stages. GENTLEMEN'S CLUB broke a step slow, trailed three wide around the clubhouse turn, went
outside rivals in the middle stages, dropped back again four wide on the far turn, kept on through the lane and earned a minor award. WILD JEWELS also
lost a step in the beginning, chased three then four wide around both turns and weakened.

Footnotes
GRAND SLAM SMILE dueled outside RECALCITRANT, gained the advantage approaching the halfway point, relinquished the lead back to inner rival
midway around the far turn, fought between foes into the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch, shook free midstretch and drew away. ASADA FRIES stalked
four wide outside a pair of rivals on the clubhouse turn, chased the top pair three wide into the far turn, bid outside the dueling leaders at the quarter pole,
fought to the eighth pole, could not kick on with GRAND SLAM SMILE in the furlong grounds and stayed on to secure second. SUSHI STICKS lacked early
speed and trailed on the inside in the early going, tipped off the fence on the far turn, steered out further in the lane, summoned a mild rally and got up for
third. PRANCINGTHRUPARIS stalked inside rivals into the clubhouse turn then went two wide around the bend, remained two wide through the far turn,
finished willingly down the lane but was outkicked for third. MADISON RAE brushed the gate and bobbled shortly after, chased four deep and got caught
five wide into the first turn, quickly cut back inside and settled in the two path outside a rival, rounded the second bend two then three wide, kept on through
the lane and got edged for the show honors. RECALCITRANT took a short lead dueling from inside early, lost command nearing the half-mile pole, took
control again on the far turn, fought inside a pair of rivals into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. R SWEET
CANDY chased between rivals three wide on the clubhouse turn, navigated the second bend three then two wide outside a rival and weakened. PETIT
FILET chased from inside off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JAMMING EDDY stalked briefly then went up to challenge EL REY DORADO from inside, carried a short lead inside a pair of rivals through the turn, inched
ahead from BAG'S GOLD in upper stretch and drew away in the late stages. BAG'S GOLD pressed from outside up the backstretch, three deep around the
turn, fought outside JAMMING EDDY in upper stretch and was turned away in the final sixteenth. MINISTER SHANE showed brief speed then chased the
top trio two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path on the turn, kept on through the lane and gained the show. EL REY DORADO vied between
runners then inched ahead to take control early, dueled outside JAMMING EDDY past the half-mile pole, vied between rivals on the turn, could not kick on
with the top pair in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch. BUCK OWENS off slow to begin, chased outside a rival at the back early, went three wide
into the turn, angled in around the bend and proved no menace. FLY THE SKY was also away slowly, trailed inside BUCK OWENS up the backstretch,
raced two wide into the turn, moved to the rail then back to the two path approaching the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROSE MADDOX settled off the pace early, moved into range approaching the turn from inside, challenged CHANCERY WAY leaving the dirt, gained a slim
advantage in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. CHANCERY WAY grabbed the early lead outside UNWRITTEN CODE
then crossed over once clear, pressured by that rival from outside around the bend, shook free again past the quarter pole, drifted out into the stretch and
relinquished the lead to ROSE MADDOX, fought back gamely in the furlong grounds but could not get by. STAY AND SCAM chased four deep into the turn,
came five wide into the lane, moved out further at the top of the stretch, battled with ROSE MADDOX AND CHANCERY WAY and finished gamely to the
wire. CHISMOSA broke a bit slow and dropped back to last, rounded the bend two then three wide, came in to bother TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL at the top of
the lane then bumped on both sides when splitting rivals in upper stretch and finished well between the leaders late. ROSE DAWSON broke a bit slow,
saved ground around the turn at the back inside rivals, chased within range entering the final furlong but flattened in deep stretch. MADIHA got put in tight
chasing between rivals early, went three deep into the turn, entered the lane in the two path, got bumped by CHISMOSA in upper stretch and could not rally.
TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL chased off the pace outside a rival then between foes, steadied in upper stretch when CHISMOSA came over and failed to threaten
after. UNWRITTEN CODE showed keen early foot then ceded command to CHANCERY WAY, drew alongside again to apply pressure around the turn from
outside, could not keep up with that rival past the quarter pole, got bumped in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON stalked the lone leader up the backstretch inside a rival, saved ground along the fence on the turn, tipped out into the lane, headed
BRICKYARD RIDE at the eight pole, took over quickly and drew away under mild urging. BRICKYARD RIDE sped clear and set the pace up the
backstretch, showed the way two wide then along the rail on the turn, collared by THE CHOSEN VRON in upper stretch and clung to a slim lead at the eight
pole, lost command shortly after and stayed on to prove second best. GEEZER chased from inside into the turn, lacked room from the three-eighths pole to
the five-sixteenths marker, remained inside and cut the corner into the stretch and was along for the show honors. PRINCIPE CARLO chased off the rail up
the backstretch, navigated the turn three wide and could not produce a bid when called upon. MOOSE MITCHELL stalked BRICKYARD RIDE while outside
THE CHOSEN VRON to the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT showed the way early inside a pair of rivals first time through the stretch, moved clear around the clubhouse turn, controlled the
pace up the backstretch, challenged by PASSARANDO around the far turn but kicked clear of that rival entering the lane, stayed clear until late under left
and right handed urging, then held off the late charge from CARMELITA'S MAN and ALIGATO approaching the wire. CARMELITA'S MAN go bumped
between rivals leaving the gate, got crowded and steadied early, traveled along the inside off the pace, moved into range outside rivals on the backstretch,
chased three deep through the far turn, tipped out further in the drive, closed well and edged ALIGATO for second. ALIGATO brushed with inner rival in the
beginning, steered to the inside racing towards the rear, swung out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, moved out further and unleashed a rally
but could not get by CARMELITA'S MAN for the place honors. PASSARANDO prominent early between rivals first time through the stretch, closest in
pursuit from the two path around the clubhouse turn, flanked the leader from outside in the middle stages, put in a mild bid two wide on the far turn, could
not kick on with KINGS RIVER KNIGHT entering the stretch and churned on to earn a minor award. NONE ABOVE THE LAW made contact with outer rival
at the start, traveled on the inside in mid-pack, had to wait behind a rival from the five-sixteenths pole to the top of the stretch, remained along the fence in
the drive but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. BALLY'S CHARM brushed with inner rival in the beginning, rated along the inside, saved ground
through the far turn, tipped out and roused in upper stretch but failed to produce a bid. SILENT HEAT bumped with the winner at the start, chased outside a
rival or two wide, between foes on the second bend and weakened. CATALINA EDDY had early speed three deep then chased three wide around the
clubhouse turn, remained three wide to the stretch and weakened. MOGOLLON RIM bumped the winner leaving the gate, sat off the pace in the two path,
traveled between rivals around the far turn and got crowded a bit at the quarter pole, then failed to threaten after. ROYAL 'N RANDO unhurried in the early
going and steered to the inside, trailed two wide around the first turn, went three deep into the second bend, angled out into the stretch and failed to
menace.
