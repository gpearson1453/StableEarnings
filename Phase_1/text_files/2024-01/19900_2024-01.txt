Footnotes
SAVE YOUR TEARS settled near midpack, advanced inside, on the turn angled out in the stretch, rallied and was up in the late stages. VALIANT MAJESTY
broke awkwardly, rushed to the front inside, was collared in midstrech and finished gamely. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS lacked speed, moved inside then raced
evenly in the stretch. SHELL BELLE chased wide off the leaders and lacked a solid rally. AKNA raced close up in the two path, raced inside through the
stretch and was no threat. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE earned a narrow advantage in the opening quarte then was finished after half a mile. ISTRIA lagged far
behind then caught tiring opponents. KISSES FOR EMILY dropped back outside and was never in contention. NO MORE DIAMONDS saved ground within
range for half a mile and gave way. FOREST MAIDEN raced far back and extremely wide throughout. LOOKINATLIGHTENING prompted the pace outside
for half a mile and faltered. DUNE JUMPER dropped back wide and was always outrun.

Footnotes
PEARLS AND HEELS stalked close up outside, bid four wide nearing the quarter pole, swept by the leaders, took charge and drew off under urging.
JULIET'S MUSIC moved up early on the inside to set the pace, briefly shook free, dug in gamely in the lane and earned the place spot. REITERATE raced
close up on the inside, tracked the leaders, then rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch run for third. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE raced off the pace inside, came
two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MS MERRABEL raced off the pace between rivals, then three wide on the turn and had no rally. PONTIFFANY
away alertly showing good speed, then chased two wide, chased on the turn and faded. AWESOME PAL raced three wide off the pace, went four wide past
the quarter pole and failed to threaten. MISS CASEY was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and gave way.

FAR TOO FOXY stalked pacesetters outside, bid on the turn, hooked the leader then drew clear late. BONNIE PARKER pursued the loose pacesetter, took
over midway on the turn and continued willingly. A PHILLY THING swung wide advancing on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. SARATOGA
SWEETS dropped back early then rallied mildly outside. GYPSY WANDERER was urged within range early, moved inside and faded. LA BELLA
BOROBETA lacked speed and weakened steadily. LADY SHEBOYGAN trailed early and was always far behind. SHE'SABULLETSTEPH sprinted clear in
the opening quarter, stopped and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
MEGA CHARLIE showed good early speed to set the pace, opened up on the backside, responded when roused turning for home and remained clear while
being kept to the task in the final furlong. LOOK OUT LAMBO raced five wide early, settled off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch
and closed for second. HURRICANE HIGHWAY was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly on the rail for third. SENSIBLE JIM raced
four wide early, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and gained mildly outside in the lane. SUIGU STAR was outrun early and closed
belatedly outside. ANGELUS WARRIOR tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. ICY STORM did not factor. HIDDEN PROMISE raced
three wide off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and gave way. LORD MIO was reluctant loading, chased the winner and gave way.

MACH TRIAL settled inside, bid into the the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and was up in the final stages. LAZARETTO dueled down the backstretch,
shook loose on the turn, tired slightly and was nailed nearing the wire. MARISA'S MISSION dueled inside opening quarter then weakened slightly on the
turn and faltered. DOCTOR DOOM far behind early, advanced extremely wide and narrowed the gap. CRAFTY DON trailed early then closed gap without
menacing. AWESOME LAUNCH raced four wide down the backstretch, six wide into the lane and was no factor. BUCKS ARE MOVING lacked speed
outside and always outrun. NICK THE CARDSHARK stalked the dueling leaders outside then proved empty in the stretch. LUCKY AS A SEVEN outrun
early, angled inside on the turn and was no menace. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM was put to urging early then never involved. HENRYTHETHIRD raced four
wide between rivals to the far turn and gave way. CATCH MY VIBE chased outside and was finished after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
POWER AGENDA set a pressured pace inside, led narrowly through the stretch then determinedly held rival safe in a game score. TRADERS LUCK broke
awkwardly, rushed to contention, loomed an inside stretch threat but could not get by the winner. GEEBERT dropped far behind then closed with a rush too
late. CAPT. CANDY prompted the pace between foes then just outside the winner and tired. SEA TRIDENT settled off the pace, moved very wide into
stretch and finished willingly. HAPPY FARM dropped back along the inside and was never involved. HONORARY DEGREE chased six wide down the
backstretch, remained wide then flattened out. BAAFEED broke poorly, chased extremely wide on the turn while outrun. CHATEAU prompted the pace
three wide between foes and faded. POWERFULLY BUILT was hustled close up in the opening quarter then began tiring on the turn. VIOLENT
TURBULENCE raced wide and stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

CAUSES TROUBLE set the pace on the inside, dueled with MASROUR on the turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival entering the stretch, edged away past
the furlong marker and held well late to prevail. MR. ROUNDTREE raced off the pace inside, moved up at the quarter pole, rallied on the rail in the stretch
run and closed gamely in the final sixteenth. SPEARGUN tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, bid outside rivals and
was outkicked. MASROUR stalked close up outside, bid two wide on the turn, briefly put a head in front, dueled to the eighth pole, then weakened. JOHNNY
RITT raced off the pace, chased three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SPEEDY BOLT raced off the rail, off the pace, chased four wide on the turn and
gave way. CHARLIE FIVE O stalked the leaders, chased on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
WINDSOR GOLD controlled the pace, widened nearing the quarter pole then stayed safe driving while weakening late. RICH'S WAY trailed far behind,
advanced on the final turn and closed strongly too late. LOOKIN AT ROSES angled near inside after the opening quarter, pursued the winner and continued
willingly. TOPS THE CHART prompted the pace outside then began weakening on the final turn. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE wide into the first turn,
remained wide throughout and lacked a rally. TIME TO CRUISE was urged four wide down the backstretch and weakened. HOLDTHEFLIGHT was fanned
extremely wide into the first turn then never a factor. YOUR ANALYSIS moved briefly closer inside before half a mile then gave way. CONCEALED CARRY
moved closer up near the inside for half a mile and stopped.
