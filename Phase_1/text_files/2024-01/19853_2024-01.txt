Footnotes
CHEROKEE CASTLE accelerated to the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, was urged clear at the quarter pole then vigorously hand ridden to
widen. LIL BOUGIE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn then dug in under steady handling to preserve second. SHEWEARSSTILETTOS broke in and
made contact with WINDSOR'S MEMORY then picked up the chase, rounded the turn in the four path and came along to take second the final stride. The
latter was bumped at the break then set a pressured early pace, gave up the lead toward the five sixteenths pole, dropped back and raced off the rail on the
turn then weakened in the lane. XTRAORDINARYMOTION gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the
lane. BLUE MOUNTAIN was unprepared for the break then came away awkwardly and lost all chance.

Footnotes
SPYDYLEGS came in on the chute then lugged in further in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, all while setting a pressured pace, drew clear at the
quarter pole and was steadily handled in the lane. METALLIC CAT bore out at the break then exchanged contact with Shiny Ghost in the vicinity of the
seven sixteenths pole, gave chase after that incident, raced off the rail on the turn then drifted through the lane and just lasted for second. GOOD BUZZ
steadied off the heels of Spydylegs in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole then gave chase, raced in the seven path on the turn, lugged in mid-stretch
and just missed second. JUBA'S MOCHA was pinched back at the break then angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the eight path
and passed rivals in the lane. NOVEMBER IMPERIUM gave chase outside, raced in the six path on the turn then lugged in through the upper stretch and
flattened stride. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE was forced in at the break then pinched back and made contact with Shiney Ghost in the vicinity of the seven
sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane. GAMBLING FEVER gave chase toward the
outside then weakened in the five path on the turn. SHINEY GHOST came away a step slow then forced out on the chute, exchanged contact with Metallic
Cat in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole then pressured the early pace, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the turn.
The Stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of Spydylegs for interference in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, lodged by the riders of Good
Buzz and Juba's Mocha, and as a result, Spydylegs was disqualified to sixth place for that incident.

KILMALEY rated close off the rail the first turn, started her bid nearing the three eighths pole and took over toward the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on
the far turn and was kept sharp in the stretch. TRAVEL SMART settled in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn about the four path, then dueled for second approaching mid-stretch. LINDA'S TAJ took the lead toward the three quarter pole and
rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, was met toward the five sixteenths then dropped back into the far turn and flattened in the
lane. PUSH saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then eased out entering
the stretch but showed little further. SKY BUY raced off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the far
turn. KENTUCKY REIGN raced with the early pace inside then stalked on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the
far turn.

Footnotes
ESPRESSO raced in the five path the first turn then challenged into the backstretch, dueled at even terms nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two
deep toward the quarter and dug in determinedly to edge clear of RIVER MALBUMOONRVF in later yards. The latter was bumped and bobbled after the
start but took over and rated the pace inside, met the challenge of Espresso leaving the first turn and dueled at even terms toward the five sixteenths pole,
gave up the nod approaching the quarter pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn and remained a factor through the upper stretch before relenting the
final sixteenth. TREASURER saved ground close to the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and
ran evenly in the lane. LUCKY ONE was pinched back leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced at
the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride mid-stretch. GRANDY ducked in and made contact with River Malbumoonrvf leaving the gate then stalked off the
rail, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. AIM FOR THE CORK rounded the
opening turn about the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. CANDY FOR JUBA raced in the five path the first
turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
EXPRESS LADY settled off the rail the first turn, started her bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, raced in the five path on the far
turn, dug in from the head of the land and got up the final yards. BONNIE BLUETOOTH stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and took a brief lead in late stretch, but was outfinished the final yards. REVEIRS
MINUTE took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and was
caught while flattening stride late stretch. JAMESTOWN ROAD saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail then flattened stride. GOLD TIME VIXEN came in and made contact with ELEGANT TASTE shortly after the break, rounded the first
turn about the four path and picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little more. The latter ducked
out leaving the gate and was bumped and pinched back early, raced in the three path the opening turn and never factored. SO RED THE ROSE mostly
saved ground. DROPKICK QUEEN raced in the three path the first turn and faded through the backstretch. CONNOISSEUR was reluctant to load and
never factored.
