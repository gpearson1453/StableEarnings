Footnotes
GRAND AGAIN bobbled a bit while breaking in front, contested the pace on the inside of the runner-up, dueled with that foe in the stretch, fought on gamely
to get the advantage in the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. VAUNTED disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn,
led under urging into the stretch, battled outside the winner under a drive into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth then was headed and missed while
clear for the place. CITIZEN MACK was urged along off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven
four wide into the stretch then angled out and finished willingly to just get the show. CREATION OF ADAM was urged along behind the leading duo, moved
out near the five-eighths pole, went three wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths,
switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed the show. SONDSLIKSOMDINIDDO broke a bit slow then dropped back, was
urged along at the rear, angled in near the nine-sixteenths, raced inside to the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and gained late but
failed to threaten. PINE ALLEY broke through the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, was urged along off the pace, dropped
from the three path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DOROTHY'S DREAMS broke through the gate prior to the start when inspired by MITOLE MAGIC who broke open her stall door seconds before, lunged at
the start getting away last and conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside
into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong
seizing command seventy yards from the finish and inched away in the late stages to prevail. TIARELLA reluctant to load prior to the start, broke in at the
start and was corrected, raced four wide latched on a duel to her inside before advancing tucked three wide into the turn to vie for command midway on the
bend when placed to coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch on near even terms, took over with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under threat and was
collared seventy yards from the finish, ran on clear for the place honors. DAUGHTER OF TIME broke in at the start and was corrected, dueled from the two
path with MONARCH to her inside, got joined outside by the aforementioned foe and vied between rivals through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened in the late stages while well clear of
the rest. MITOLE MAGIC broke open the stall door prior to the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn,
got coaxed along with seven-sixteenths to go, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. MONARCH dueled inside of DAUGHTER OF TIME
soon after the start, then vied inside a pair of rivals through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got shaken off just outside the quarter
pole and went three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PRETTI XTREME was well placed just off the pace, chased while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, gained to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling to
prevail. FONTANAFREDDA stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, took the lead at
the quarter-pole, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was caught while clear for the place. DREAMAWAYSEVEN dropped back early then settled
under some urging, was ridden along while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide in to the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and
lacked the needed response while able to safely secure the show. RUN DEVIL was hustled from the gate, moved up to contest the pace on the inside of a
foe, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back inside the three-eighths pole and tired. SISTER LINDA contested the pace on the outside,
vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN was void of speed, dropped well behind under
urging, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
NIGHT EFFECT was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when put
to the crop in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. STEADY PROGRESS tracked the pace on the outside, chased four then three wide on the
turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. UNCLE WATER FLOW dropped back while
urged along, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and just got up for the show.
BOLD LOOKER was void of speed while ridden along, went around the turn in the three path, came six wide into the stretch and just missed the show.
SORPRESO was void of speed under urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. MUDVILLE NINE was well placed just off the pace, raced
under urging late on the backstretch, chased inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. HAPPY BOB stalked the pace on
the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn and capitulated. PAPI ON ICE broke a bit awkwardly and was last
to commence, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was eased but walked off. MAMA BANNED ME dropped well behind, saved
ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and showed little.

runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND inherited the lead when a foe lost action badly early, showed the way down
the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, fought on with that
foe to the finish but missed while able to get the place. KUNSHAN BRIDGE settled towards the front, chased inside on the turn, pursued the top two in the
stretch and willingly earned the show. NARCISO DALI lost action slightly while going over a mark on the track early, moved out near the five-eighths, was
well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came five wide into the stretch then moved to the six path, held a reasonable striking
position in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. RESERVE CURRENCY broke a step slow, settled towards the back, was urged three wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. LUNI SIMA settled between horses, was urged three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper
stretch and failed to rally. SAVINGS RATE moved in early while settling off the pace, was carried out near the five-eighths pole, was urged four wide on the
turn and failed to respond. CRITICAL THREAT settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. KUPP came
away well and went to the front, lost action and stumbled badly going over a mark on the track early, checked severely and was taken up abruptly by the
rider, dropped to the rear while moving well out in the track and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
MY MANE SQUEEZE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over command narrowly swinging five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive head to head with the runner up and gamely shook off that rival in the late stages kept to task to prevail.
BERNIETAKESCHARGE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper stretch getting on near even
terms for command, dug in under a drive fighting on head to head through to the final seventy yards before being shaken off in the late stages while well
clear of the rest and along second best. TRICKY TEMPER chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, weakened. FLIGHT CONTROL dueled from the two path with CARA'S TIME early on before shaking clear of that rival tucked to the inside into the
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SWEET BROWN SUGAR
brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. CARA'S TIME dueled inside of FLIGHT CONTROL through to the half mile pole when shaken off, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

FINANCIAL DISTRICT was ridden along at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final
furlong and closed fast to win going away. ARCO AUGUSTA was urged along well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, remained on his inside
lead in the stretch and finished with good energy to garner the place. THE DELAWARE BOYZ settled off the pace, was taken in hand while gaining near the
nine-sixteenths, shifted from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied to make an outside bid in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop
near the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but held the show. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE pressed the
pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path outside the three-eighths pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final
sixteenth then tired while overtaken. DRINKING SOLO chased the pace, went four to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. GO GRAD moved in
while urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. SPICY
TUNA set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the three-eighths pole, dropped back into the stretch
and tired. REEDY FALLS was ridden along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response.
