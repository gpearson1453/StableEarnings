Footnotes
MARSHMALLOW QUEEN raced prominently along the outer hip of the pacesetter in the two path, bid in the three path midway around the turn, swept to
the lead while being cued in the three path at the top of the stretch opened up passing the eighth pole, and held sway. FONTINA stalked in the two path,
was put to a ride going into the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. CASTELLANA set the pace inside, was coaxed
approaching the three-eighths, but brushed the rail while losing the lead at the top of the stretch, and faded to show. MISS ATHLETIC tracked in the three
path, was cued passing the three-eighths, but was no factor from the five path down the lane. REGAL MISS chased in the four path, was driven into the
turn, but never threatened. RAGAZZA raced off the pace inside but never menaced. MAELSTROM SPIRIT trailed throughout from the four to five paths.

Footnotes
PHILEAS FOGG popped the gate prior to the start but stood quietly in the stall, bumped CARTOGRAPHER at the start, stalked that foe in the two path
around both turns, split rivals in upper stretch, gained outside and was up late. CARTOGRAPHER was bumped at the start, set the pace in the two and led
until deep stretch. CLASSIC MO TOWN settled off the pace while saving ground, tipped out in upper stretch, couldn't find a clear path until midstretch then
rallied between foes late to gain a share of the show. MISTER ABARRIO prompted the pace in the three path, could not match strides with the top two in the
lane but hell well enough for a share of third. ITALIAN SYMPHONY raced off the pace three and four wide and had a mild belated rally. SUNSHINE FROLIC
failed to menace while racing two wide. SEAVER chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. ADMIRAL'S WAVE was outrun inside.

the lead approaching the quarter, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, and chased on for place. CURLIN'S GIRL tracked in the three path, was

RACE CRAFT stalked the pace inside, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. TIZ ROMANTIC
set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. VALENTINE BUG bumped with GLIDING AFLEET nearing the first turn,
raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, went two wide around the far turn and was along for the show. THE BEST DISTANCE prompted the pace
in three path and tired in the drive. PEOPLE FORCE raced in range two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. GLIDING AFLEET was bumped
entering the first turn, trailed four wide around that bend and made no bids while racing at the rail around the far turn. TOMMY BEE broke slowly and trailed
in the two path.

Footnotes
PASAJERA tracked in the four path, tipped out to the five path under rousing midway around the far turn, swept to the lead while in the four path turning into
the stretch, drew away on her left lead into the final furlong, switched leads before the sixteenth, and was driven out. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) bumped
with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, was roused into the far turn, shifted out to the six path turning into the lane, and ran on for
place. SHE'S SO BEARRISH stalked in the three path, but was stymied inside of foes in the two path passing the quarter, angled out to the five path in
upper stretch, and kept on for show. SWEET SENSATION was unhurried out in the five path early, put to ride in the six path early into the far turn, fanned
out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. GENERAL ROBINSON settled in range from the five path, was roused into the far turn,
bumped with an inner foe while making a bid in the four path midway around the far turn, and faded from the five path in the stretch. R AWESOME SAUCE
prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path into the far turn, bumped with an outer foe midway around the far turn, and yielded between
foes at the top of the lane. BULLET VALENTINA bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside and never threatened in the four path down
the lane. KRABI moved up around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, but yielded along the inside in upper stretch.
FUNTASTICA rated in the two path but never menaced.

CHAMPAGNE JUAN settled in range two wide, swung five wide turning for home, closed outside and was up late. WAR OFFICER raced in range three
wide, bid in midstretch, reached even terms outside of the pacesetter near the sixteenth pole, inched ahead of that foe but could not withstand the winner
late. BREES moved two wide to the lead, drew clear and angled in down the backstretch, led at the rail to deep stretch and was narrowly outfinished. BEE
WELL saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch gain inside. SCAT TU TAP prompted the pace two wide and
weakened in the lane. HAZON led early, chased inside and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
WOW LUCKY tracked in the five path, was nudged along from the four path into the far turn, bid in the five path turning into the stretch, took the lead before
the final sixteenth, and drew clear. SKINNY COSMO got rank around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backside, was coaxed nearing
the quarter, drifted out to the four path in upper stretch causing an outer rival to steady, lost the lead before the sixteenth, but held place. LOOKS LUCKY
TO ME bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid up close while under a hold in the four path, bid under coaxing between foes in the three path midway
around the far turn, swung from the four path into the lane, was in tight and had to steady just before the eighth pole, but kept on for show. SPIRIT OF
VICTORY bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the far turn, bid from the two path into
the stretch, but flattened. ROYAL UPSTART rated in the four path, was coaxed in the three path early around the far turn, but did not threaten. SHINKA
trailed throughout around the two path. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF LOOKS LUCKY TO ME
AGAINST THE RIDERS OF SKINNY COSMO AND WOW LUCKY FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE EIGHTH POLE, SKINNY COSMO WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR DRIFTING OUT INTO THE PATH OF LOOKS LUCKY TO ME AROUND THE EIGHTH POLE,
THE CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST WOW LUCKY WAS DISALLOWED
