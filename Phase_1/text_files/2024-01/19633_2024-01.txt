Footnotes
ELEGANT closest in pursuit from the two path, challenged from outside in upper stretch, took over shortly after and drove clear in the final sixteenth. GIRL
OF MY DREAMS cleared quickly from outside and crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, headed by ELEGANT at the eight pole, yielded to the that
rival and stayed on to secure second. RUNAWAY KITTEN got bumped and put in tight in the beginning, trailed early then passed a rival saving ground on
the turn, continued to along the fence through the lane and got up for third. ASHLEY brushed outer rival at the start, stalked from inside and hugged the rail
to the stretch, moved out in the lane and failed to summon the needed late kick. ELLIE MOORE (IRE) got bumped leaving the gate, ran up on heels early
between rivals early, moved into striking range three deep on the turn, drifted in to bump rival in upper stretch, bumped with that rival a few more times in
the final furlong and flattened late. HAMBLE got brushed by ASHLEY at the start, settled off the pace, coaxed along the rail the two wide on the turn, tipped
out at the top of the stretch and could not rally. SHOP TILL YOU DROP stalked outside a rival or two wide, bumped with outer rival repeatedly then got put
in tight at the sixteenth pole and could not recover. SWEET VOYAGE raced outside rivals off the pace then two wide into the turn, moved out in the lane and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE BRIDE showed the way up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide, roused in upper stretch and put to right handed urging, challenged
from outside with a furlong remaining, maintained a short lead in deep stretch and held on at the wire. PRANCINGTHRUPARIS raced up close from outside,
coaxed three wide around the turn, drew alongside CLUBHOUSE BRIDE with a furlong left to run, dug in late and got denied. BACK ON TRACK broke
through the gate and was a bit stubborn when reloading, broke a bit slow and dropped back early, gained up the backstretch then moved into striking
distance from inside on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. COCKTAIL CUTIE stalked two then three wide on the turn and weakened.
BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY stalked the speed outside a rival, took the turn four wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER tracked two wide outside a rival in hand, drew alongside the top pair at the quarter pole, surged clear entering the lane and was
ridden out to the wire. WITH LOVE (GB) settled in the two path, angled four wide on the far turn, drifted inward in the lane and finished willingly to best the
rest. MAHINA unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, ran into some traffic on the far turn and tipped off the rail, got floated to the inside in the lane
while finishing determinedly but needed to find more late. STAY IN LINE set the pace from inside under pressure, maintained command to the quarter pole,
relinquished the lead leaving the far turn and weakened in the drive. ROPERS N WRANGLERS threw her head and hopped at the start and fought the rider
early, trailed on the inside, angled out on the far turn and failed to menace. JORDAN was a bit keen when rating along the rail, saved ground through the far
turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked further response. ONE SMOKIN MOON pressed from outside, between rivals past the quarter pole, got
crowded twice in upper stretch and faded. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
IMAGINATION shifted out and bumped rival at the start, set the pace in the two path then along the inside while under pressure, cleared MAXIMUM
CAPACITY at the seven-sixteenths pole, lightly coaxed along on the far turn, asked right handed past the eighth pole and held well under steady handling in
deep stretch. INDISPENSABLE chased in the two path then moved inside, saved ground on the far turn then tipped out to take aim in the two path leaving
the bend, loomed from outside with a furlong remaining but could not summon the needed late kick to reach the winner while clearly second best.
CORNELL tracked in the four path to the far turn, moved in and was driven two wide into the stretch, could not rally in the lane but churned on to best the
rest. LEADING broke slow and took up behind IMAGINATION at the start, trailed two wide into the first turn then drifted out to the fourth path, steered back
in a few paths around the bend, went two wide into the far turn, angled out four wide then chased three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.
MAXIMUM CAPACITY took a bump from inside at the start, pressed from outside, lost touch with the winner entering the far turn, lost ground and angled to
the inside around that bend and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MARGOT'S BOY chased two wide then along the inside, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, challenged from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, took over
with a quarter mile remaining, remained clear into deep stretch and held gamely over the runner-up. COMRADERY (IRE) bobbled shortly after the start,
chased in the two path through both turns, loomed boldly in upper stretch, drew alongside the winner late but could not go by. TAISHAN settled outside a
rival at the back, driven three wide into the lane and was along for the show. MASTERMIND stepped to the front and set the pace along the rail, pressured
from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command at the quarter pole, chased the new leader into the lane and weakened. HEIR (FR) raced at the back
on the inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole and failed to menace. JACKS OUTLAW raced in mid-pack two wide then along the rail, moved into range
in the middle stages, saved ground around the far turn and faded. MIKE OPERATOR showed early speed outside rivals then became a bit rank around the
first turn to lose ground, dropped back and raced three deep into the far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SHE'S MY NIECE hustled clear early, showed the way on the inside through the turn, opened up when roused in upper stretch, widened in the final furlong
and coasted in late. WE'LL DO IT LIVE got bumped around at the start then bumped again shortly after, chased inside rivals then was closest in pursuit two
wide into and around the bend, could not make any headway on the winner in the drive and bested the rest. ELEVEN OUT OF TEN chased five wide into
the turn outside rivals, came four wide into the lane and held the show. JAZZY EMPRESS broke well then chased up the backstretch, went four wide into
the turn, angled in and was driven two wide into the lane, found the rail in the stretch and lacked a rally. LIGHTING AND REIGN bumped with outer rivals a
few times then got pinched back, raced along the rail into the turn, got blocked behind a rival and had to take up, tipped out three wide into the clear and
kept on to improve position in the lane. MUMBLES BROCKMAN dropped back early, went four deep into the turn, three wide into the lane and could not
threaten. EVA'S PARTY got brushed in the hind-quarters shortly after the start but was still away quickly, chased three wide into the turn, angled over to the
inside around the bend, had the rider lose his whip at the top of the lane and weakened. LOVE HONOR AND PAY brushed outer rival at the start, chased
along the rail but climbed on the backstretch, got shuffled back and bumped at the five-sixteenths pole, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. HIGH
FLYING GRACIE chased off the inside and climbed at separate points on the backstretch, got bumped two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the rail
around the bend, tipped out in the lane and was not a factor. COCONUT GIRL got bumped at the start then crowded shortly after, chased three deep then
two wide on the turn and was not a factor.

ZOFFARELLI (IRE) sped clear and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, kicked away when asked right handed and held over the late run from the
runner-up. LOVESICK BLUES brushed with inner rival in the beginning, lagged behind early and moved inside, swung out into the lane, drifted in a bit in the
final furlong and gained the place. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) tracked three deep into the turn, remained three wide into the stretch, finished evenly and
held the show. SILVER SURFER (GB) was closest in pursuit early then chased inside rivals, had to take hold a bit when running up on the heels of the
leader at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch, remained inside through the lane, finished evenly and got edged for third. REDLINE
chased outside a rival into the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, bumped with DON'T SWEAR DAVE repeatedly in deep stretch and could not rally. MAS
RAPIDO (GB) chased outside a rival then between leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend in the two path and weakened. DON'T SWEAR DAVE chased
off the pace then moved into range early, rounded the bend two wide, chased within striking distance in the final furlong but bumped with REDLINE
repeatedly late. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT THE CONTACT BETWEEN DON'T SWEAR
DAVE AND REDLINE WAS MUTUEL AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CHISMOSA stalked the top pair up the backstretch, raced along the rail into the turn, eased out two then three wide before cutting back to the two path late
on the bend, took over between rivals outside the eighth pole, fought with HOT PEPPERS in deep stretch and edged away. HOT PEPPERS pressed the
pace from inside early, chased SWEET AZTECA past the three-eighths pole, continued to save ground to the lane, re-bid inside outer rivals in upper stretch
and got outkicked by CHISMOSA in the final sixteenth. SWEET AZTECA took control early and set the pace outside HOT PEPPERS, shook free from that
rival on the turn, drifted out into the lane, challenged by inner rivals in upper stretch and lost command, kept on through deep stretch and held the show.
LADY T lagged behind early, trailed three then two wide on the turn, moved out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally. VIOLENT RUNNER chased off
the inside then outside a rival, raced three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane, moved to the inside and lacked further response.
