Footnotes
SWEET HEIDELBERG , three wide the first turn, chased the pace, circled the far turn three wide, drifted out entering the stretch, closed outside horses,
gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole, switched to her left lead late and edged clear. NEVER DONE , a forward factor in the two path around both turns,
gained a short lead in mid stretch and continued willingly. PLEASE MARRY ME , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gradually
weakened the final furlong. SHE SO COOL lacked speed along the inner rail, moved to the two path on the far turn, failed to be a factor and passed tired
foes. PROPER STORM , outrun, raced along the inner rail the far turn. SIX THE HARD WAY , rated entering the backstretch, drifted wide turning for home
and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
ROAN BURGUNDY broke outward and bumped with a rival, corrected and went clear, set the pace two wide and under a light hold, turned away a
challenge from STORMING CHROME leaving the five sixteenths, wandered outward despite right hand attempts through the lane and widened.
STORMING CHROME , four wide early, stalked three wide outside a rival past the five eighths, ranged up under pressure to briefly threaten the winner near
the five sixteenths, could not kick on with that one through the lane but kept on with effort to be well clear of the rest. MY MAMBA lagged far back while
saving ground, was under a ride around the final turn, cut the corner into the stretch and churned on to gain the show. HIPPODROME stalked the winner,
saved ground into the far turn, was put to a serious ride soon after, failed to respond and dropped back through the final furlong. GAMBLING TZAR broke a
step slow then steadied when in close soon after, raced off the pace, saved ground into the far turn, angled three wide past the five sixteenths and
weakened. HACHURE , bumped at the break, chased off the rail while in the clear, faltered leaving the five sixteenths and was eased through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
FAINOR'S FILETS got engaged in a duel to the inside of HONEY B B leaving the chute, carried that battle into and around the turn, shook clear under a
drive leaving the three sixteenths, widened a bit past the eighth pole then was fully extended to last. HONEY B B held a slim lead outside the winner into
and around the turn, ceded command into the stretch, dug back in after the winner cleared nearing mid stretch, came back valiantly through the final
seventy yards and just missed. MADE BIRDIE , urged inside chasing the embattled leaders, dropped back some in upper stretch, came off the inside
leaving the three sixteenths, swung extremely wide past mid stretch and closed willingly. BROWN SUGA BABE , between rivals into the turn, stalked the
duelers three wide past the three eighths, ranged up with aim soon after, gave hard chase through the final furlong but lacked the needed finish. FLOGE ,
off a bit slow when rank, regrouped and edged up off the rail past the three quarter pole, stalked three deep into the turn, circled four wide into the stretch,
drifted in a bit while pursuing on her left lead past mid stretch then churned on between foes. VICTORIA'S DEVINE , off the pace while saving ground,
wandered outward into the lane but came up empty. ELOPER , urged off the rail, dropped back around the turn.

Footnotes
SPEAK YOUR MIND got involved in a pace scrum to the inside of LADY SERENITY soon after the start, held a slim lead battling around the turn, ceded
command in upper stretch, battled back to re take the lead inside the sixteenth marker, drifted a bit late and edge clear under a drive. LADY SERENITY
drifted in a touch at the break, corrected and sparred outside the winner, wrested command and edged away a bit inside the three sixteenths, dueled on her
left lead past the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. CANOODLE chased while saving ground, dropped back leaving the far turn, remained towards
the inside into the stretch, drifted out some in mid stretch, was straightened and finished with interest to nab the show. MATTITUDE broke a step slow,
moved up between foes early to gain a forward spot, chased in the clear mid turn, angled three wide into the lane, loomed but came up empty in the final
furlong. BREEZY CONNECTION , between runners leaving the far turn, was under pressure outside a foe mid turn, shifted out some in the drive but lacked
a solid run. BANDITS WARRIOR broke a step slow, rushed up soon after and tracked the leaders three wide into the turn, was under pressure while shifting
four wide in upper stretch then faded. I HAVE COURAGE lagged back while saving ground, was under a ride mid turn, swung wide for the drive and lacked
a bid. ALAS AND ALACK , three wide off the early pace, angled in and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SPEEDYNESS took over early and set a rated pace in the two path, turned away UNCLE CAT leaving the three eighths and confidently moved away into
the lane, was given a few right handed asks between the three sixteenths and furlong marker then drew away in dominant fashion while mildly asked
through the final sixteenth. CAP COM , nudged up early, chased the winner while off the rail, pursued under strong asks and to the inside of a rival past the
three eighths, kept on with effort and managed to save the place. THEDINGOATEYOBABY , bumped at the break, drafted well off the early pace while
removed from the inside, swung seven wide in upper stretch and churned on. MASAKADO , towards the inside chasing the pace, angled three to four wide
past the three eighths, shifted a bit wider for the drive but came up empty. KING'S RIVER stalked under pressure while three wide, angled five wide for the
drive and failed to rally. DUNE ROAD was steadied back from between rivals near the three quarter pole, dropped in towards the rail, was under pressure
inside into the lane but failed to drum up a response. UNCLE CAT stalked outside the winner, ranged up three wide under asking mid turn, failed to kick on
past the quarter pole and weakened. BRYSONS OPTION drifted out at the break and bumped a rival, tracked early on while three to four wide, raced
between runners nearing the lane and tired.
