Footnotes
AMY THE BUTCHER tracked from out in the center in the seven path, was cued to bid in the four path midway around the turn, floated out to the six path in
upper stretch, kept on her left lead, and was up in the final sixteenth. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS prompted the pace in the four path, was driven in the three
path around the turn, angled to the rail turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. CASTELLANA set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside
midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, stayed on her left lead, but lost the whip nearing the final sixteenth, and evened
out late to show. SPREAD THE RISK chased in the three path, was roused from the rail midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of
the stretch, and stayed on. MOCHI GIRL stalked in the six path, tipped into the three path around the turn, but was one paced from the five path down the
lane. SHE CAN SCAT rated in the five path, was cued while tipping to the rail passing the three-eighths, but did not factor from around the five path in the
stretch. IN AMERICAN raced off the pace inside, floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the lane, but was no menace. FROSTED QUEEN
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CREVALLE D'ORO pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, dueled outside of PACIFIC FRONT through much of the lane and edged
ahead under left-handed urging. PACIFIC FRONT set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of the winner through much of the lane but was outfinished late.
GRAYOSH stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch and rallied. LORRAINE (FR) raced up close three wide and was one-paced
through the lane. ST. SUSAN steadied along inside through the opening half and never threatened. PRISCILLA'S COVE chased the pace two wide between
foes, angled four wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally. RABDAH failed to menace while racing three and four wide. KATHERINE THOMAS
steadied along two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. SEGESTA broke slowly, raced three wide and played no factor. PALMETTO FURY steadied at
the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
OYA THUNDER was bumped at the start, saved ground off the early pace, circled six wide around the far turn, took over near the sixteenth pole and
powered clear. HOUSE OF MELODY set the pace in the two path, kicked clear around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest.
LUNETTA JAK prompted the pace from the rail, could not match strides with the top two in the final furlong and held for the show. SHINKA was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. MY LITTLE SECRET raced off
the early pace two wide, was rank down the backstretch, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. WONDERFULVENEZUELA raced in
range three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. JESS'S MOMENT saved ground and failed to menace. NEW BABY was bumped after the start,
pressed the pace three wide and faltered nearing the lane. DREAMY had only brief speed two wide. SPANISH GIRL was outrun while racing two and three
wide. RAGAZZA bumped multiple foes at the start, had early speed four wide and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
EMBOITE (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, was roused between foes passing the quarter, swung out to the seven path at
the top of the stretch, and rallied past an inner trio in the final furlong. JUST FOR LUCK was unhurried in the four path, cued midway around the far turn,
fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, and rallied for place. BASKETBALL JONES pulled around the first turn to stalk the pace in the three path
going into the backstretch, bid around the far turn, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. LESLIE CHOW trailed in the three
path, tipped out to the five path under a ride passing the eighth pole, and stayed on. WIDERIGHT bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace
in the five path, floated out to the eight path under a drive turning into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and made no impact.
TRUTH AND HONESTY tracked in the two path, bid rounding the far turn, but flattened. KING SILVIO was held up in the three path early, roused while
swinging out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but got bumped between foes passing the eighth pole, and was eased. BEGANINGREENPOINT
bumped with an outer foe at the start, showed the way around the first turn before taking back to race up close along the inside down the backstretch, was
cued while tipping out to the five path turning into the lane, but bumped with an outer foe around the eighth pole, and weakened. MIDNIGHT ONYX bumped
with an inner foe at the start, took control of the pace and tipped inside turning into the backstretch, was driven from the rail into the lane, but yielded in the
final furlong. FRISSON chased in the four path, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was empty. CHRISTENSEN raced wellback in the
two path and was no menace.

turn, and kept on from the three path down the lane for place. MCMONEY raced wellback in the three path, was coaxed along in the five path around the far
turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, and ran on for show. MR CROWLEY set the pace inside, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the four
path turning into the stretch, but faded late. CALL MY BANKER stalked in the four path, was cued three wide passing the three-eighths, but flattened from
the five path in the stretch. PEOPLE FORCE rated in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, but did not threaten from the six path in

FOREVER SOUPER stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a
drive. SOUPER BLESSING stalked the pace three wide, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted in in midstretch and then drifted out and just lasted for the
place. SPACE RUNNER saved ground off the pace and rallied along the rail to gain the show. ROARING FORTIES set the pace along the rail and
weakened in the final furlong. BOPPY O prompted he pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and was outkicked. ME AND MR. C raced off the
pace two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.

along the inside, was cued from the rail midway around the far turn, and kept on along the inside for show. SARA'S SHAMAN prompted the pace in the
three path, bid around the far turn, led from the four path into the stretch, but faded late. UNO TIGER laid in midpack in the two path, was cued midway
around the far turn, but finished evenly between foes from the four path in the stretch. WHISTLER'S HONOR raced wellback in the three path, fanned out to
the nine path under a drive turning into the lane, and made no impact. SWORE hopped at the start, rated in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, but
flattened from the five path down the lane. STANDARD OF PROOF tracked in the four path, was coaxed along while three wide around the far turn, floated
out to the six path turning into the stretch, but weakened. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND chased in the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the
stretch, but was empty. FLAWLESS BOURBON set the pace just off the rail inside of foes, was roused passing the three-eighths, but gaveway turning into
the lane.

JOYFUL LASS set a clear pace along the rail and held firm. HIDDEN PRESENCE was in tight at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide, angled
five wide near the quarter pole and rallied through the lane. TIME STONE raced in range inside, tipped two wide midway around he far turn and ran on while
outkicked late. LAURISTON (IRE) broke inwardly, raced off the pace two wide while pulling, swung six wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. OUR
FINEST HOUR (FR) saved ground off the pace and never threatened. STREET VIEW chased the pace two wide around the first turn and four wide around
the far turn and faded in upper stretch. LUNA LOVE was outrun inside. JUST MARYANN prompted the winner two wide, steadied near the quarter pole pole
and retreated while appearing to try to get in. INVESTMENT PROCESS saved ground in midpack, steadied near the quarter pole and lacked the needed
rally. BIG BEAUTIFUL (IRE) was outrun while racing two wide. PROCRASTINATE played no factor while racing three and four wide.
