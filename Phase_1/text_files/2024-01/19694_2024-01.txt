Footnotes
BREAKING BULLET stalked in the four path, ranged up to bid in the six path at the top of the lane, swept to the lead while drifting inwards passing the
eighth pole, and drew clear. TRUE MARTINI prompted the pace in the four path, bid three wide around the turn, was cued from the four path into the
stretch, and kept on for place. MY ROYAL VOW bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path, waited for room passing the quarter, angled
out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and chased on for show. NEVER PERSONAL got pinched and had to check early, trailed along the inside, was
ridden in the four path around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, but failed to bid. RITAMARLEY had to steady early, was hustled
from off the pace in the four path, driven from the six path into the lane, and made no impact. MRS. CASH MAN bumped with an inner foe early, raced
wellback in the three path, swung from the five path under a ride into the stretch, but did not threaten. BREATH OF HEAVEN bumped with an outer foe at
the start, dueled for the lead in the two path, was nudged along the inside around the turn, but yielded in the two path in upper stretch. KINDNESS IS FREE
vied for the lead in the three path but weakened between foes turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
PALACE FLIRT set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. MADAKET'S ARROW stalked the winner from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch,
had aim, was no match but kept on well enough to save the place. NAA DUDETTE trailed inside, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show.
CERCHI tracked the pace two wide and lacked the needed stretch kick. STARLIT SOFI saved ground in range and never threatened. DIGITAL TRADE
played no factor while racing four wide. BRITISH EMPRESS broke out and bumped BOLTORO at the start, raced off the pace three wide, made progress
three wide around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. GOOD VALUE chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. BOLTORO was bumped
at the start, steadied nearing the first turn, raced three wide and and was never a threat.

Footnotes
THETHRILLOFVICTORY broke out at the start, pulled while up close in the four path turning into the backstretch, bid under confident handling around the
far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, inched to the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under coaxing in the final sixteenth.
HUSBAND MATERIAL rated in the four path, waited between foes in the two path early around the far turn, was cued while tipping out to the six path at the
top of the stretch, and ran on for place. SPETTRO set the pace in the two path, was nudged along into the far turn, coaxed passing the quarter, lost the lead
just before the eighth pole, and evened out in the final furlong for show. ENDLESS SUNSET tracked in the three path, was ridden along the inside into the
far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but faded. FLATTER ME raced wellback in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path
around the far turn, but flattened from the six path in the stretch. IMPULSIVENESS trailed inside but never menaced. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR stalked in
the five path but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
KHOPESH was bumped at the start, trailed inside, edged closer while still a clear last in the three path rounding the far turn, swung widest in upper stretch,
kicked in and was up and clear late. DIXIE PREACH was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter
pole, bid between foes near the sixteenth marker but was no match for the winner late. EL MATADOR settled off the pace while racing two wide around the
first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, rallied outside, led near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. GO GO GE rated inside early, angled out
down the backstretch, prompted in the three path around the far turn, bid nearing the eighth pole, exchanged bumps with ALWAYS DIALED and weakened.
SUGAR IT'S ELI failed to menace while racing two wide. ALWAYS DIALED came in and bumped foes at the start, sprinted clear while racing well off the rail
for a half, set the pace in the two path around the far turn, led to midstretch, exchanged bumps leaving the eighth pole and faltered. HAY HAY HARRY
raced in range in the two path early, chased at the rail around the far turn and lacked a closing bid while racing in slightly tight quarters at the rail in the
stretch.

Footnotes
SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE raced in midpack in the two path, was nudged along around the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane,
brushed with an outer foe, but kicked on to draw past an inner foe in the closing stages. A ROSE FOR RAVEN raced up close in the three path, bid around
the far turn, took the lead passing the quarter, was roused from the two path into the stretch, and ran on, but was caught in the closing stages by an outer
foe to finish with place. WIND NINETY NINE was unhurried in the three path early, driven in the five path around the far turn, swung from the six path into
the stretch, and kept on for show. OFFICER COUNTRY rated inside, was under coaxing in the three path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path in
upper stretch, and made no impact. ARTEMUS BRIDGE raced off the pace in the five path, ranged up in the four path entering the far turn, swung from said
position into the stretch, brushed with an inner foe in upper stretch, and flattened. BUSTIN UP set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside
passing the three-eighths, but yielded in upper stretch. TIZ A PRINCE steadied around the first turn, raced wellback along the inside and never threatened.
DANVILLE tracked in the four path, was ridden along in the three path into the far turn, but weakened from the five path in the stretch. DAZZLING TRUTHS
stalked inside but backed up turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
SANDPIPER MEMORIES stalked in the five path, was coaxed from the four path into the far turn, bid passing the quarter, took the lead while in the five path
approaching the eighth pole, and drew clear. PEACE SEEKER laid off the pace in the four path early, was driven into the far turn, tipped out to the six path
turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. BIG BAND LUZZIANN set the pace in the four path, was roused in the three path midway around the far turn,
but faded from the four path in the stretch to show. KHOSEA laid up close under hold in the two path turning into the backstretch, but lost ground under a
ride around the far turn, and flattened. TAPPLE CIDER bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path, was driven in the four path around the
far turn, but made no impact from the five path down the lane. LA RUSIA bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path early but never
menaced.

Footnotes
FIELD LASS set the pace in the two path and dug in between foes to hold safe. MADNESS prompted the winner in the three path and kept on through the
stretch to hold second. FAIRHOPECURLY tracked the pace inside, bid inside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. QUIMICHIS was
bumped soon after the start, raced well back two wide, steadied near the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and finished well. DOT raced off the pace
four wide and rallied belatedly on the far outside. READY TO JAM came in and bumped QUIMICHIS soon after the start, saved ground off the pace and was
one-paced through the lane. GOLDEN CANARY raced in range four wide and finished evenly. HAPPY WORLD was forced to check sharply not long after
the start, saved ground well back and never threatened. JAYANA had only brief speed three wide.

LOVE PARADOX stalked in the four path, was roused in the three path passing the three-eighths, took aim in the five path at the top of the lane, and stayed
on to draw past an inner foe in the final strides. CHLOE'S TOY set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, opened slightly in upper stretch,
but was caught by an outer foe late to place. SPLURGE chased in the four path, was coaxed in the two path midway around the turn, floated out to the
seven path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. TALKING WONDERS trailed in the two path early and made no impact. ONE SMOKIN' RITA tracked
in the five path, was under right handed urging while between foes in the four path midway around the turn, and did not factor from the six path in the
stretch. ROBYN AND ELI rated in the six path, floated out to the eight path under a drive turning into the lane, and did not threaten. VINGATIVA laid in
range around the two path but backed up along the inside around the turn.
