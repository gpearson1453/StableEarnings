Footnotes
PHABULOUS PHOEBE was well placed along the inside, made a inside bid nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner leaving the turn and gained a short
advantage by the furlong marker and then was clear by the sixteenth marker and remained clear to prove best, driving. DAKOTA SPRINGS set a pressured
pace and was in the two path on the turn, then was headed leaving the quarter pole and then proved to be no match late for the winner while being second
best. PAULA'S SURPRISE pressed the early pace in between rivals and was three wide on the turn and weakened, held show award. LADY AHAVA
tracked the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide off the turn and lacked the needed winning bid, missed show award. FAYTASTIC was
reserved early, three wide by the quarter pole, swung wide for the drive and had no rally. MARIA SAYS SO was settled back early, saved ground on the turn
and had no rally. NORMANDY LIFE pressed the pace four wide and weakened the final quarter of a mile. DUE TO FOG NOTES WERE DONE WITH THE
PAN SHOT.

gained a short lead nearing the furlong marker but could not go with the winner late, second best. LA LIMA set the early pace and then dueled for the lead
on the inside by the quarter pole and faded in the final furlong, held show award. HELLO GRACIE chased the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing
the quarter pole, came four wide off the turn but flattened out. ROSES FROM HEAVEN was reserved early, dropped to the inside and saved ground on the
turn, then angled out in the lane and had a belated rally on the far outside. KIRBY was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out in the lane and had no
