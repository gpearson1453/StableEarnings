prevail. HEARD ON THESTREET chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild kick to tussle head to head with the top one inside the final sixteenth but was ultimately repelled on the wire. ROCK STAR BOY lunged at the break

came under coaxing at the three-eighths, came under threat to the outside and swung three wide into upper stretch, yielded command straightened away
and weakened in the late stages. MY MAN WOODY chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under

Footnotes
COMMERCE COMET pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead passing the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three then two path on the turn, was
asked under threat outside the five-sixteenths, shook off the runner-up under a drive in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. BIG SAVE veered
in at the start, was rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the turn, gained to make a bid inside of the winner inside the three-eighths pole,
dropped to the rail late on the bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, lost touch with the winner near the furlong marker and proved no match while
clear for the place. MOVING PICTURES was urged just off the pace, bumped lightly with a rival leaving the backstretch, chased in the three path on the
turn, was put to the crop approaching the five-sixteenths pole, dropped to the two path coming to the quarter-pole, moved out in the stretch and was along
for the show. UNION LIGHTS broke a step slow, moved up on the outside under urging, bumped lightly with a foe leaving the backstretch, chased four wide
on the turn and tired. CHARGER was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back
along the rail on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT WORKER was restless in the gate, broke awkwardly and was off slow,
spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear under some urging, went four wide under stronger encouragement on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CONCERTO three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily
gaining on the once clear leader and nailed her on the wire. CALLING AN AUDIBLE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside safely
in front before being confronted by SENDERA into the turn, dueled with that rival to the outside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, shook off that
foe swinging three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat, the rider peering inwards at the
video board twice a sixteenth out, directed his charge outwards in the final forty yards to the finish to look her main danger in the eye and was nailed on the
wire. SENDERA four wide in aim down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to duel with the aforementioned foe to her inside,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. HOLDER CLOSE chased four to five wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch, tired. LUCKY SPIN stumbled at the start, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
ALTERNATE REALITY settled off the pace, shifted from the two to three path early on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, gained four wide to
make a bid into upper stretch, took a short lead in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. GENTLEMAN JOE stalked the pace
on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took a short lead coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch, led
until near the sixteenth-pole then was headed by the winner and missed while narrowly able to hold the place. MYSTIC NIGHT pressed the pace on the
outside, took the lead in the two path outside the three-eighths pole, was headed nearing the quarter-pole, fought on with good courage in the stretch and
just missed the place while clear for the show. KEYSTONE FIELD was hustled from the gate, settled between horses early then dropped back near the
three-quarter pole, settled at the back, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the
needed response. BOURBON CALLING was taken under a tight hold then reserved on the outside, went three then four wide while roused on the turn,
came five wide into upper stretch then moved further out and failed to respond. THUNDERIAN was hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure to his
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the three-eighths pole, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired.

CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) came away in front, opened up a sizable advantage, went around the turn in the three path, had the lead diminish into upper stretch,
drifted in near the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. BIG ENGINE was restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at
the start, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch, pursued the winner to to the finish and displayed good
courage but missed while well clear for the place. BRONX BOMBER was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the
needed response while just able to get the show. CAJUN CASANOVA moved out while chasing the runaway leader, dropped in late on the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn and just missed the show. AIR SHOW was restless in the gate then slow into stride, angled from the two path to the four path on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. BOURBON'S HOPE settled off the pace, dropped back under urging
late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond. IKIGAI broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged
along off the pace, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn and came up empty. BRACIOLE was off a step slow, dropped well behind

stretch, weakened. FLUID SITUATION showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing when under challenge at
the five-sixteenths, yielded the front just inside that station, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. FACTOR IT IN bobbled at the start
recovering outwards and bumping NOVA RAGS into SPUN AND WON, chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went seven wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RUNGIUS bumped with a rival early, was keen while two to three wide on the first turn then rated just off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn,
was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the leading duo into the final furlong, made a bid inside those foes in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and got
up under strong handling to prevail. CLOUD FOREST was bumped at the start, went around most of the first turn in the four path then dropped to the three
path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth, was bumped shortly
thereafter then outfinished while able to get the place. APOLLO RISING went three to four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace between foes, was
asked while three then four wide on the far turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, battled outside of foes under a drive in upper stretch, led
into the final furlong, drifted in into the final sixteenth then bumped with a foe and was out-kicked while clear for the show. MASTERWORK bumped with a
rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up very briefly, raced off heels into the first turn, was rank under stout restraint in the two to three path going
around that bend, continue to tug at the bit under strong restraint, went three then four wide on the far turn, waited behind horses at the quarter-pole, came
five wide into the stretch then moved out looking for room, altered in behind the leaders near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. SEEKING
UNITY broke out and bumped with a foe, raced in the three path for most of the first turn then dropped closer to the two path, stalked the pace on the inside
of an opponent, made a bid between horses on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. STJAMES
was off a step slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path under urging on the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch then moved further out and was no factor. GUT FEELING brushed with a foe early, went five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside,
chased four then five wide on the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. BLU GROTTO broke a step slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back on the outside, was urged three then four
wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WHAT A BLAST went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on
the far turn, lost the lead just inside the three-eighths pole and faded. CENTAVO bumped with a rival early then steadied briefly, had the rider fall back in the
saddle while saving ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back while inside on the far turn and retreated.
