Footnotes
AMOR Y CONTROL set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. GIRL BYE tracked the pace in the two path,
tipped out in upper stretch and rallied outside of the winner. VAL'S GAL pressed the winner in the three path, could not keep pace in upper stretch but held
well enough for the show. BULLOCK chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. WHATCHAMACALL prompted the pace in the four path and
weakened in the drive. INTO TOURING failed to menace while racing two wide. LOVE MY JOB broke slowly, brushed the rail not long after the start, saved
ground and never threatened. DOWNTON TABBY played no factor while racing five wide.

Footnotes
ANTILLEAN had a slow start and trailed in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch,
angled into the five path while rallying just after the eighth pole, and was up on the wire. SIR GOOSA set the pace in the three path, opened up slightly while
being cued in the two path midway around the turn, drifted out to the eight path while staying on his left lead in upper stretch, and was caught in the final
strides by an inner foe to place. GINGERSNAP JACK prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed along rounding the turn, floated out to the nine path in
upper stretch, and kept on for show. BATTALION BOUND chased in the four path, was cued while tipping to the rail going into the turn, but flattened from
the three path in the stretch. WILD FLIGHT tracked in the two path, was put to ride midway around the turn, but weakened from the four path in the stretch.
PRIX DE WEST rated in the five path, was cued from the two path early around the turn, but was no menace. HANDSOME RUNNER stalked in the five
path but gaveway around the turn.

Footnotes
PRINCIPIA set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled around the turn, cued from the two path at the top of the stretch, kicked away into final
furlong, and held sway. SILVIA V'S HEROES trailed in the three path, cut the corner under a drive turning into the lane, and rallied for place. MILES OF
SMILES chased in the three path, was driven from the rail around the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show.
KAREN'S HONOR prompted the pace along the inside, swung out to the four path turning into the stretch, but faded on her left lead. BAHA SECRET
stalked in the four path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened. JELLICLE KATZ
got fractious in the gate, raced off the pace in the four path, floated out to the eight path turning into the lane, but came up empty. ZOSTEROP was hustled
from off the pace in the five path but never menaced.

Footnotes
SHEA D WORLD set the pace inside, was confidently handled around the turn, coaxed lightly while kicking away in the two path passing the eighth pole,
and geared down thru the final sixteenth. FOR SOME REASON prompted the winning pacesetter from the three path, was roused in the two path midway
around the turn, cued from the four path into the stretch, lost touch with the winner, but kept on to be second best. NATURAL STAR chased in the three
path, floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. LACE UP tracked in the four path, was coaxed along in
the three path midway around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, but flattened. JIGGERY POKERY stalked in the three path, was
ridden from just off the rail around the turn, but weakened in the four path down the lane. RYE'S MY GUY raced off the pace in the five path but never
menaced. CRUZIN FOR CHAOS ducked in and was steadied at the start, trailed throughout from the four to five paths.

Footnotes
SERGEANT MOLLY set the pace along the rail, drifted into the three path in upper stretch and held firm between foes late. BODACIOUS BREN raced in
range inside, bid inside of the winner in the two path leaving the eighth pole and could not get by that foe. OMO TEN GIRL prompted the pace in the three
path, could not gain while continuing on the left lead, switched leads near the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. PRETTYKEEN raced off the pace two
wide, waited for room nearing the quarter pole, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. FACE THE MUSIC pressed the winner two wide, had aim in
the four path in upper stretch but was one-paced through the lane. GITANA had her head turned at the stat, trailed in the three path and rallied between
foes late. WALKS LIKE A LADY saved ground and never threatened. STARSHIP SUNRISE failed to menace while racing two wide. CAJUN FANTASY
chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. CHAINA played no factor while racing three and four wide. ANGIE FROM KULM was outrun while
racing four wide.

Footnotes
DESOLATOR rated in the two path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and rallied to get up on
the wire. SAMBURU (GB) stalked in the two path, waited along the inside early around the far turn, was roused passing the quarter, tipped out to the four
path turning into the stretch, swept to the lead just after the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. CADET CORPS tracked in the three
path, was roused passing the three-eighths, angled out to the six path turning into lane, kept on but drifted in slightly late, bumped an inner foe, and finished
with show. THE GREAT OZ bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, shifted out to the five path passing
the eighth pole, and stayed on, but was bumped by an outer foe and had to steady late. GRAND JOURNEY prompted the pace in the three path, bid two
wide around the far turn, took a short lead passing the eighth pole, but faded. SWAN LAKE bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the
inside, was ridden from the rail into the far turn, but yielded in the final furlong.
