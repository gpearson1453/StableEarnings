Footnotes
LADAN had good position to far turn angled out three wide into the stretch to stride clear in the final sixteenth under stout handling to the wire. COCO'S
DREAM off rail run on the backstretch, moved up far out of the turn and ran for place spot late. SASSY WALKER tracked from three path to far turn,
between foes in the stretch but flattened out in the final sixteenth. DREAM FLY inside speed to the front, stayed to deep stretch but weakened late.
FROTHY settled inside with no speed throughout and never a threat. MISS DIAMOND RICH saved ground to far turn and never factored. STAGE BELL just
off leader from two path to the half but gave in the stretch run. PROUD LAURIE had a tardy start with no speed thereafter and widest past the quarter pole.
QUEEN OF ATLANTIS tracked to the half with nothing left and gave in readily.

AWESOME TREAT was slow into stride, split horses past the quarter pole and rallied along through the stretch run to get up in time. UP AND DOWN
dueled from two path to the turn, stayed on gamely to wire but outbid in the final strides. MORE THAN VOWS chased outside, dueled to the half but could
not go on while saving third spot. POLKA POLENTA unhurried to the turn, rallied along in the stretch to just miss show. WILLOW BEND bothered at the
start with no speed to turn, ran up with a bid into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. ATLANTIC STRIKE bore in start, raced between horses to
the turn while giving way readily. LIBERTY BELLE inside speed to the turn and gave way readily in the stretch run.
