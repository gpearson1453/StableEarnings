the five-sixteenths marker, dueled to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. EUPHIMA (ARG) set the pace in the two path, dueled around the far turn and
through midstretch and faded late. BIG BRASS BED was bumped early, saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. ZIPADOO saved ground off the

and three wide and never threatened. STEPHANIE'S CHARM was off a step slowly, raced off the pace two wide, swung ten wide near the quarter pole and

Footnotes
SPEAK EASY pressed the pace in the three path, loomed while heading the inner leader around the turn, was coaxed while floating out to the five path at
the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. VICTORY AVENUE broke in at the start, set the pace in the two path, was nudged along into the far
turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, but was second best. BIG CITY prompted the pace in the five path, was driven into the turn, drifted to
the rail on his left lead down the stretch and finished evenly for show, was pulled up on the gallop out and walked off. CORPORATE POWER broke in and
bumped an inner foe, raced off the pace in the two path, was under right handed encouragement along the inside turning into the stretch, tipped out to the
four path passing the eighth pole, but made no impact. TAPAKENA rated in the six path, angled to the rail and was put to a ride early into the turn, but failed
to bid from the five path in the stretch. BATTEN DOWN tracked inside but flattened from the three path in the stretch. RAPID GREY chased in the three path
but did not factor from the five path in the stretch. UNCLE CAESAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, was wellback in the five path and no factor. MY
TRUE COLORS bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack in the two path but weakened in the stretch. UNSPOKEN REQUEST raced off the
pace in the four path but was no menace. GHOSTLY SPITFIRE was behind in the three path early and never threratened.

Footnotes
PLAY THE MUSIC raced in range three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied outside and was up
late. ANCIENT PEACE broke sharply but was firmly rated at the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was narrowly outkicked.
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES stalked the pace two wide, took the lead late on the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished between the top two.
SPANSIVE came in and bumped foes at the start, raced off the pace three wide and rallied belatedly. SUN BEE saved ground in midpack and had only a
mild stretch rally. MISS CAROL ANN (IRE) raced two wide in midpack and was no threat in the lane. STARSHIP AGENDA was bumped between foes at the
start, raced off the pace two and three wide and finished with late interest. LEAVE NO TRACE set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter
pole, fought on inside through midstretch, steadied near the sixteenth pole and dropped back. DIAMOND HANDS failed to menace while racing two wide.
BATUCADA was bumped at the start, saved ground and made little impact. CINDYLOUWHO was bumped between foes at the start and played no factor
while saving ground. CHORUS GIRL trailed inside early, made some progress four wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally.

Footnotes
CANDY LIGHT had to steady slightly going into the first turn, tracked in the three path, was ridden into the far turn, floated out to the seven path in upper
stretch, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. TIME PASSAGE set the pace inside, was roused passing the three-eighths, tipped out to
the three path turning into the lane, dug in to hold on to the lead going into the final furlong, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. SAND AND SEA
stalked in the two path, tipped out to the four path and was driven into the far turn, angled further out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on
for show. RIDING PRETTY raced off the pace inside, was coaxed along in the two path around the far turn, angled out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, and kept on. JAN'S GIRL prompted the pace in the three path, was roused to bid early around the turn, swung from the four path into the stretch,
but flattened in the final furlong. BEECHNUT TROPHY laid up close along the inside, was coaxed along in the two path around the far turn, floated out to
the six path at the top of the lane, but faded late. INFINITE DIAMOND chased in the five path, fanned widest turning into the stretch, but did not threaten.
MESSIDOR (IRE) rated in the two path early but never menaced. UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) trailed throughout from the four to six paths.

Footnotes
ALPHA BELLA set the pace inside, was ridden into the final turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, dug in while drifting in slightly and bumped
with an inner foe around the final sixteenth, but held on. R CALLI KIM stalked inside, was coaxed along while waiting for an opening around the final turn,
bid along the inside into the stretch, and ran on, but got bumped by an inner foe around the final sixteenth, and had to settle with place. ANATOLIAN rated
in the two path, was cued into the final turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. TASS laid up close in the two path,
was cued to bid early into the final turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch. ROMAGNA MIA (GB) was unhurried along the inside early, tipped out
to the four path turning into the backstretch, was driven into the final turn, angled out to the six path passing the eighth pole but failed to bid. HIGHLAND
GRACE tracked in the two path, tipped out to the three path down the backstretch and was cued into final turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, but
weakened. VIVA LA RED laid off the pace while two wide early but never menaced. AFTER AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF R CALLI KIM AGAINST
THE RIDER OF ALPHA BELLA FOR POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, NO CHANGES WERE MADE AS THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT IT DID NOT EFFECT THE RACE RESULT,

Footnotes
COUNTY FINAL raced off the pace four and five wide, shifted wider in upper stretch, surged outside and was up in the final strides. EXACT ESTIMATE set
the pace in the two path, repelled challenges in upper stretch, went clear in midstretch, led to the final strides and was nailed. SKYRO saved ground off the
pace, was boxed in around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and finished strongly between foes. CASH EQUITY (FR) trailed inside, swung seven
wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside and was narrowly outkicked for the show. PORTFOLIO COMPANY settled off the pace while racing three wide
around both turns and had only a mild gain between foes in the lane. OCEAN VISION (IRE) had his head turned at the start and broke awkwardly, saved
ground in range and was one-paced through the lane. SKY'S NOT FALLING prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn, angled to the rail
entering the far turn, saved ground around that bend, angled three wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. DREAMS OF
TOMORROW saved ground and failed to menace. BORDER TOWN played no factor while racing four and five wide. SARATOGA FLASH chased the pace
five and six wide, bid around the far turn but had little left for the drive. BLUEBIRDS OVER advanced six wide around the first turn, pressed three wide down
the backstretch and around the far turn and faltered in the lane. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE raced in range four wide, steadied near the quarter pole and
retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
TUMBARUMBA stalked the pace three wide, could not quite match strides with HEJAZI in upper stretch, was lightly brushed by CASTLE CHAOS nearing
the eighth pole, kept on gamely between foes and was up late. CASTLE CHAOS was bumped after the start, raced off the pace four wide, made good
progress around the turn, shifted in and lightly brushed the winner approaching the eighth pole, finished strongly and just missed. STEAL SUNSHINE raced
well back two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole, made mild progress on the left lead, switched over near the sixteenth pole and finished well to
gain the show late. HEJAZI was up close inside early, took the lead near the half-mile pole, dueled inside around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch but
weakened late. DREAMING OF KONA was bumped at the start, saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. GREAT NAVIGATOR prompted the pace
three and four wide and faded through the lane. GILMORE was bumped after the start, raced well back three wide and never threatened. ACCRETIVE
chased the pace four and five wide and had no response. SIGNATOR played no factor while racing five wide. EXPRESSMAN set the pace two wide, dueled
around much of the turn and faltered nearing the quarter pole. CYCLONE MISCHIEF was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, steadied midway
around the turn and was eased in the lane. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CASTLE CHAOS AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
WARM HEART (IRE) stalked in the two path, was roused midway around the far turn, cut the corner turning into the stretch, surged to the lead just after the
eighth pole, and kicked on while tipping outward late to hold off a late charging outer pair. I'M VERY BUSY rated in the two path, was stymied along the rail
rounding the far turn, bumped an outer foe while swinging out to the six path at the top of the stretch, rallied while tipping inwards, brushed with an inner foe
late, but got up for place. CATNIP broke in and bumped an inner foe, floated out to the five path going into the first turn, tracked from the three path into the
far turn, was roused from the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on, but was in tight and brushed with an outer foe late to finish with show. ATONE
settled while unhurried in the two path turning into the backstretch, got stuck in traffic along the rail rounding the far turn, was cued from the three path into
the stretch, tipped inside passing the eighth pole, and stayed on. INTEGRATION raced in midpack along the inside, was coaxed along the rail around the far
turn, angled outward through the stretch, but made no impact. WEBSLINGER trailed in the three path, swung out to the eight path turning into the stretch,
had to check hard while trying to angle out in upper stretch, and could not factor. KINGMAX (IRE) raced off the pace in the three path, was driven in the four
path around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but failed to bid. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT bumped with an outer foe at the start,
chased in the four path, got bumped out to the seven path by an inner foe turning into the lane, and flattened. JERRY THE NIPPER prompted the pace in
the three path but weakened between foes in the stretch. ADHAMO (IRE) was held up in the three path early but did not threaten. MAIN EVENT bumped
between foes at the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused turning into the stretch, but gaveway in the final furlong. MASTER PIECE (CHI) raced
wellback in the four path, was driven into the far turn, but failed to menace.

Footnotes
NATIONAL TREASURE pressed the pace in the three path, seized command turning for home, drew off in upper stretch and dug in while drifting out slightly
under left-handed urging to repel SENOR BUSCADOR'S late bid. SENOR BUSCADOR was unhurried while racing three wide around the first turn,
advanced five wide into the far turn, angled down into the two path leaving the three-eighths pole, angled back out in upper stretch, closed outside but could
not quite reach the winner. CRUPI was devoid of speed despite early urging, trailed in the two path, advanced five wide around the far turn, angled to the
rail in upper stretch and rallied for the show. HOIST THE GOLD set the pace in the two path under pressure from the winner, was collared turning for home,
angled out when the winner cleared in upper stretch and tired. O'CONNOR (CHI) bumped with DYNAMIC ONE at the start, raced off the pace two and three
wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. IL MIRACOLO bumped with GRAND ASPEN not long after the start, raced in range four
wide around both turns and came up empty in the lane. DYNAMIC ONE bumped with O'CONNOR at the start, raced three and four wide and never
threatened. NIMITZ CLASS steadied entering the first turn, saved ground and never reached contention. FIRST MISSION raced off the pace three wide and
had no response. TRADEMARK saved ground in midpack and retreated through the lane. GRAND ASPEN bumped with IL MIRACOLO nearing the first
turn, raced off the pace three and four wide, faltered around the far turn and was easing through the lane. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING chased the pace three
wide, stopped nearing the far turn, was pulled up and walked off.
