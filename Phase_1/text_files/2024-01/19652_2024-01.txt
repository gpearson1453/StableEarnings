Footnotes
SKY MAKER rated kindly off of the moderate early pace, tracked between rivals heading to the second turn, was roused two then three wide nearing the
quarter pole, vied for the lead into the stretch and took command nearing the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth and kicked clear in
deep stretch. MOMMA MOCCA took back in the early running, came in a bit tight entering the first turn and steadied off of heels approaching the
seven-furlong pole, saved ground while unhurried through the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the second turn then waited for racing room
nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide for the drive and closed well into the final stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and outfinished
the rest to be second best. LA VIKINA sent leaving a good beginning, dictated terms into the first turn, set a moderate pace through the backstretch run then
was pressed to the quarter marker, shook free of the pressing rival into the stretch and was set down for the drive, battled for the lead to the furlong marker,
was overtaken and was outfinished into deep stretch, while holding safely in the end for third. A CROWN FOR KITTEN allowed to settle away from the start,
raced four wide into the first turn and was unhurried while not far back entering the backstretch run, maintained an outside path to the half-mile marker,
mounted a four wide bid into the far turn, chased four then five wide into the stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and passed tired rivals late.
RIVETING SPIRIT tracked the moderate pace from the inside, maintained an inside path while well placed through the backstretch run, raced within aim into
the far turn, chased from the rail into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and weakened. HOLY ZAGS tracked outside of rivals in the early
stages, raced three wide along the first turn and tracked the moderate pace along the backstretch run, made a steady advance three then four wide into the
far turn, gained ground and came within aim at the quarter pole, chased four wide into the stretch, lacked a response inside of the furlong pole and gave
way. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) asked for early speed, was prominent into the first turn and stalked the modest pace into the backstretch run, advanced two
wide into the far turn and pressed LA VIKINA to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GREATFUL ATTITUDE unhurried to begin, saved ground into the turn, came in a bit tight at the quarter pole and angled four wide for the drive, improved
position at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth and closed with a rush to take command in deep stretch, found more in the final stages and
edged away in the end to prevail in a good debut. PURPLE MOUNTAIN came in a bit tight leaving the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the early pace
from the second flight, raced three wide into the turn and loomed at the quarter marker, mounted a two wide bid into the stretch and battled with HIGH
INFLATION into the final furlong, took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished by GREATFUL ATTITUDE in deep stretch and held in
the end for second. HIGH INFLATION assumed command away from the start, drew to a clear early lead and set decent fractions into the turn, was well
handled along the bend and dictated terms to the quarter pole, showed the way into the stretch, was confronted by PURPLE MOUNTAIN and battled that
rival into the final sixteenth, was overhauled by the winner in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third in a good effort. OOPS (GB) lacked early
speed, raced four wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, chased three wide into the stretch and continued to gain at the furlong
marker, could not make further headway into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. CEE'S THE IMAGE chased the early pace while outside of runners,
made a mild gain three wide at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and lacked a late rally. MISS SCHATZIE tracked the decent early pace while
between runners, came in tight racing into the turn, took up midway through bend and lost position nearing the quarter pole, swung to the four path and
chased into the stretch, could not summon a late response and weakened. SANTALUZ DREAM chased the decent early pace from the inside, could not
keep pace into the stretch and tired. PRINCESS K prominent away from the start, chased the loose pacesetter and raced two wide into the turn, ran in
pursuit two wide to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GEORGE HERMAN RUTH hard to load prior to the start, was unhurried away from the break, tracked two wide to the quarter marker, came in tight at the
top of the stretch and raced in traffic to the furlong marker, split rivals leaving mid-stretch while full of run and vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-marker,
took command into deep stretch and edged away under firm hand urging in the final strides. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS allowed to settle in the early running,
tracked three wide into the turn then waited for racing room at the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and gained ground at the furlong marker,
could not reel in the winner in the final sixteenth but closed well in deep stretch and outfinished the rest to be second best. BIG DON'S SMILING stalked the
decent early pace from the outside, lost a bit of ground along the turn and chased four wide to the quarter pole, re-bid four wide into the stretch, needed
more in the late stages, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish. HOGMANAY (IRE) hustled to establish the early lead,
assumed command and set the pace while pressured into the turn, carved out decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free into the
stretch and led to the furlong marker, was overtaken into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for third. BRONZE ONE close up
to the decent early pace, pressed three wide into the turn, battled for the lead into the stretch and raced within aim to the furlong marker, could not keep
pace into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. ANTHONY'S BEST rated off of the contentious early pace, saved ground into the turn while not
far back, mounted an inside bid into the stretch, raced a bit in traffic into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. DR. FLASH DANCER away in
good order, ceded the early lead and pressed the decent pace into the turn, kept close attendance to HOGMANAY while outside of that runner along the
turn, vied between runners nearing the top of the stretch, could not keep pace into the drive and dropped back approaching the furlong marker, lacked a
response in deep stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ATTENZIONE was unhurried from the break, settled at the back of the field, worked closer down the backstretch but was still last going into the far turn, took
the two path through the second turn turn had had to wait for room approaching the stretch, swung five wide for the stretch run and responded to steady
handling with a strong finish to prevail. WODETON (FR) hesitated at the break, spotted the field a head start, then rushed up and circled the field four to five
wide around the first turn, pulled the rider to the lead past the six furlong marker, dictated the pace to the far turn, opened up in the stretch, had something
left for the run for home but was unable to hold off the winner. CANELITO steadied in traffic going into the first turn, bided time three wide down the
backstretch, moved up some heading into the far turn, then was asked in earnest from the five-sixteenths marker, kept on from there with a grinding finish,
was unable to match strides late with the top pair but was well clear of the next horse. FAR WEST raced in the two path in mid-pack between horses from
the start, was boxed in through the far turn then rallied into traffic at the top of the stretch, got clear in the last sixteenth and rallied for a better placing.
TWIRLING DERBY settled inside mid-pack, bided time on the second turn while still holding to the inside, rallied up the rail in the stretch and made up some
ground but was not good enough. GORDY'S BOY broke best and was with the leaders early on, opted to sit back off the pace while saving ground along the
rail, was then passed by all but one passing the six furlong marker, tried to mount a rally through the far turn but encountered traffic, swung out five wide into
the stretch, finished with some interest and was able to pass a few in the final yards. LIL MIRACLE MAN went three to four wide early, pulled to be up with
the front group, continued to race three deep to the far turn, mounted a rally through the far turn and loomed a big threat at the top of the stretch but did not
run on and was outfinished in the last furlong. JERRY JEFF WALKER hustled from the gate, led the field through the clubhouse turn then ceded the lead to
ATTENZIONE after the six furlong pole, stayed to the inside, attended the pace to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong. DESERT DUDE broke well
and went three deep into the first turn to contest the early pace, settled into a stalking position down the backstretch, a length or two behind the free running
ATTENZIONE, went into a drive after passing the three furlong pole, stopped near the quarter pole and was ridden out behind the field to the wire.

REFI NOW unhurried away from the start, trailed into the turn and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, shifted to the outside and swung four
wide for the drive, tipped five wide at mid-stretch and responded to urging into the final sixteenth, closed determinedly into deep stretch, wore down rivals in
the final strides and got up at the wire to prevail in a blanket finish. DICK BEST forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the solid pace from the inside,
was well positioned into the turn then came in tight and waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, tipped two wide nearing the furlong grounds,
split runners and rallied into the final sixteenth, vied into deep stretch, held a narrow lead in the final strides and was nailed on the wire for the win, while just
holding for the place. BLAZE OF DREAMS rated just off of the solid early pace, tracked two wide and between runners into the turn, came in a bit tight at
the quarter marker and shifted three wide for the drive, battled for the lead between runners at the quarter pole, fought gamely while four wide into the final
sixteenth and just missed for the win and place, while just holding for the show. WINTER FALCON rated away from the start, rushed up in the opening
furlong and stalked the decent early pace heading into the turn, advanced along the bend and pressed the pacesetter three wide at the quarter marker,
battled for the lead into the stretch, vied between runners into the final sixteenth, fought gamely into deep stretch and was bested in a blanket finish for the
top three positions. GRIT AND CURIOSITY took back to track the contentious early pace, was steered three wide into the turn and gained ground at the
quarter marker, came in a bit tight nearing the top of the lane, shifted four then five wide for the drive and loomed at mid-stretch, battled for the lead into the
final sixteenth, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was outfinished. BOSS OF THEMOSS prominent leaving the start, raced close up to
the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and vied for the lead approaching the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the
final sixteenth and weakened. HORSE DOCTOR away in good order, took back to track the solid early pace, was well placed while outside of runners
heading into the turn and gained ground five wide at the quarter marker, swung six wide for the stretch drive, lost position at the furlong marker and gave
way in the final sixteenth. POLACCO asked for early speed and assumed command leaving the start, set solid early fractions and dictated terms into the
turn, set a pressured pace while between runners heading to the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE prominent leaving the start, stalked the early pace and gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, loomed two wide approaching the
quarter pole, took command into the stretch and kicked to a clear lead at the furlong pole, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and maintained a clear
lead to the finish to hold sway. CALI CONQUEST tracked the early pace from the second flight, advanced position along the backstretch run, maintained a
two wide path into the far turn and chased between runners into the stretch,gained ground at the furlong marker, could not make headway on the winner in
the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch, while besting the rest. WALKING BOSS allowed to settle leaving the start, saved ground into the first
turn and was unhurried through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn and was roused approaching the quarter pole, maintained a two wide
path into the stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top pair in deep stretch but stayed on to get up for third in the
final strides. AWESOME DUDE forwardly placed in the early running, saved ground into the first turn and stalked the moderate pace into the backstretch
run, improved position at the half-mile marker and chased the leading pair into the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch,was outfinished in the final
furlong and just missed for third at the wire. POUR ON THE COLE allowed to settle while not far back in the early stages, raced three wide into the
backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, was steered to the outside heading to the far turn and mounted a five wide bid at the
quarter marker, shifted to the four path into the stretch and lost a bit of ground at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and finished
evenly. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the second turn, swung
five wide for the drive, offered a mild rally in the final sixteenth but was unable to threaten. WILL IS CHILL forwardly placed while keen in the early running,
tracked the moderate pace while outside of runners through the backstretch, was well positioned into the second turn and chased four wide to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way. MY SUNSHINE hustled to establish the early lead, assumed command and dictated terms into
the first turn, set moderate fractions while controlling the pace to the half-mile marker and showed the way to the quarter pole, was overtaken into the
stretch, chased BABY FRANKIE to the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. BEL RAGAZZO settled in the second flight, saved all of the ground to the
far turn, lacked a response in the stretch and gave way. SPROSTON hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle, improved position
three wide into the far turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
PROOF HE RIDES broke sharply but opted to sit just behind the developing speed duel in the early stages, was sent bid for the lead near the three furlong
pole but found a stubborn foe in BELLY UP, battled to deep stretch then gained a slight advantage in the final yards. BELLY UP broke sharply and traded
punches with SHARONA'S WILD BOY through the initial furlong, pulled ahead passing the seven-sixteenths pole then faced and met a challenge by
PROOF HE RIDES passing the three furlong marker, held that foe at bay into the stretch as they pulled ahead of the rest, was overtaken in the final
sixteenths but held gamely for second. SHARONA'S WILD BOY broke well and dueled with BELLY UP for the early lead, let that one get away before the
turn and lost the inside path, got clear run three wide into the stretch, finished well under steady handling and was gaining on the top pair at the finish.
TALBOT BAY was allowed to settled into stride well off the early pace, started a forward move approaching the three furlong pole but had to steady, then
tipped to the outside, made a nice move into contention but six wide at the top of the stretch and continued the run to the wire. THE LITTLE H MAN raced
near the head of the tracking group to the turn, was set down after passing the the three furlong pole, came three wide into the stretch, ran on well under
steady handling but came up short of a minor award. TRINIDAD had no early speed and was allowed to settle well behind the pace at the rear of the field,
cruised into contention through the turn racing in the two path, ran on well under intermittent urging but came up short. DOO WOP DON was outrun early,
made a forward move five to six wide through the turn and finished evenly. SLEW'S JOY was away awkwardly and spotted the field a head start, angled
over to the rail when clear and moved into contention, made a little bit of a bid through the turn then got jostled near the quarter pole and did not make much
of an impact down the stretch. LARRY'S LEGEND raced close up to the half-mile marker, struggled to keep pace through the turn then faded down the
stretch.

Footnotes
PONDERGATING came away well and was in the middle of a three horse speed duel with SHADOWED THOUGHTS to the inside and SYGRAYEM to the
ouside through the initial furlong, then had to chase the first named through the turn when that foe slipped away, caught up at the quarter pole, battled to
mid-stretch then had to deal with CHAMAVILLE in the final furlong, went head and head with that rival to the wire and won the photo for the win.
CHAMAVILLE raced inside of the tracking group down the backstretch, was patiently ridden inside through the turn, got a fortunate hole to run through
turning in the stretch and finished up well, had a nose in front through the final jumps but lost the bob at the wire. CROWN OF HOPE was a little slow to get
started then steadied when SHADOWED THOUGHTS came over after the break, raced in the middle of the tracking group through the early stages then
became boxed in through the turn and the top of the stretch, altered course to the outside for clear run at the eighth pole and finished up well to gain the
third spot. FAR FAR AWAY was outrun early but got into good rhythm heading into the turn, became stuck behind a wall of horses to the three-sixteenths
marker, searched desperately for some racing room through the stretch, finished well when clear but was along too late. SHADOWED THOUGHTS broke
well and was inside of a trio contesting the early pace, slipped away from the others to take the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, repelled a challenge at
the quarter pole, responded when set down in the stretch, held to the furlong pole, dug in gamely but was unable to hold on. EYELIGHT broke poorly then
rushed up into contention along the rail, was blocked from making any kind of a bid through the turn, hugged the rail then got some running room in the
stretch, ran on willingly under steady urging but came up short. SYGRAYEM exchanged light bumps with IMA KEEN ICE after the break, was quick into
stride to be the outside horse in the early speed duel, made a three wide bid for the lead from the quarter pole, had every chance approaching the furlong
grounds then weakened. IMA KEEN ICE broke in at the start and exchanged a couple of light bumps with SYGRAYEM, then dropped far off the pace
through the early running, chased the field through the turn, swung six to seven wide into the stretch and tried to run on but could not make an impact.
HANG ON broke well, raced close up but four wide through the early stages, went into a drive after passing the three furlong marker but had nothing to offer
for the stretch run. CAME UP ROSES raced on the outside of the tracking group five off the rail, made a sweeping move into contention for the lead through
the turn but flattened out in the stretch.
