Footnotes
FIELD OF VISION vied along the inside before backing off to stalk his outer pace-counterpart with five furlongs to go, pursued from the pocket under a long
rein around the far turn, smoothly tipped outside of the clear leader while claiming place in midstretch, sustained progress to bid leaving the sixteenth pole
and edged past late. DUVEE vied with an inner rival while taking the opening bend in the three path, gained an advantage with five furlongs to go, showed
the way inside of a pressing foe around the far turn, shook free of that one in upper stretch,, held sway into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer
bidder in the final sixteenth and held place. BIG BOO trailed in the three to four path, swung to the six to seven path entering upper stretch and offered a
belated left lead rally to miss reaching place. PESO PESADO laid off of the pace along the inside, chased two wide and between horses turning for home,
then failed to threaten the leaders. RANCH WATER settled off of the pace two wide, crept closer tracking in the four path around the far turn, vied for place
in midstretch, but flattened out at the furlong grounds and yielded between horses. RANCH BADGE tracked the top pair from the four path early on, moved
forward to press the new leader down the backstretch, sustained pressure in the three path around the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING MO settled off of the pace along the inside, launched a rally splitting rivals three wide entering the lane, bid along with an outer foe at the
furlong grounds, sparred gamely through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. MO DIVA broke a step slow and steadied out of tight quarters between
horses at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, picked up stride in the three path and between horses turning for home, swung five wide entering the
lane, sustained progress to bid along with an inner rival at the furlong grounds, dueled with that one through the late stages but was denied. LAWLESS
TIMES stalked the early leader from the three path, pressed down the backstretch, gained an advantage in the two path into the far turn, showed the way
before being headed by an outer bidding pair at the furlong grounds, then kept on to maintain a minor share. TAP IRON FIST saved ground at the rear,
gained turning for home before swinging six wide and outside of the leaders nearing the final furlong, and ran on willingly. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE tracked
along the inside, was roused outside of the top pair around the far turn, but only managed to chase before yielded four wide and between horses entering
the lane. MOION pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, tracked three wide approaching the far turn, but gave way in the four path around
that bend. EVERYLITTLESINGH set the pace inside of a pressing rival down the backstretch, got headed by that one entering the far turn and faded.
BROADWAY STAR tracked in the five path, weakened around the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
EL PERFECTO broke a step slow and steadied between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, picked up stride between horses around the far turn,
attempted to split foes entering the lane, but was bumped to the five path by an inner rival and jostled between horses straightening for home, recovered
and altered course outwardly at the three sixteenths pole, rallied flopping back to his left lead in the final furlong and drove past the leaders late. RONIC
stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, maintained an advantage as rivals took aim from both
sides in midstretch, but was caught by a wide bidder approaching the wire. UNDER SURVEILLANCE tracked in the three path, tipped out turning for home,
but was bumped to the six path by inner rivals entering the lane, took firm contact from an inner foe once again in upper stretch, recovered and rallied on his
left lead to attempt a bid entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer foe, hung late and failed to gain place. FIRST CLASS HARLOW tracked
from midpack along the inside, took aim inside of foes in midstretch, but only managed to chase and leveled off. HE GOTS TO GO leaned into the outer part
of the gate upon leaving it, laid off of the pace two to three wide, then chased between horses. SIR LIAM set the pace, showed the way inside of a pair of
pressers into the far turn, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and caved between horses. MAURITIUS stalked in the three path and between
horses, yielded between the top pair turning for home, shifted out and bumped a rival entering the lane, came out again and bumped another foe in upper
stretch, then weakened. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE LANE, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

WATRUGONNADOKAREN sped clear in the three path, opened up down the backstretch, tired in midstretch then just lasted from an inner bidder. AVERI
EVER AFTER tracked two wide, rallied to offer a late bid inside of the tiring leader in the closing stages, but missed via a very close photo. J Z'S FIRST
lacked speed along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, rallied between horses leaving upper stretch and gained show from an outer rival in the
final sixteenth. FAT AND FURIOUS laid off of the pace in the four path, gained down the backstretch to claim place entering the far turn, but was outkicked
for that position by an inner rival in upper stretch and lost show to another inner bidder in the late stages. LACIS JEWEL laid off of the pace in the three to
four path and failed to menace. PI YO PRINCESS hopped at the start and broke slowly, lacked speed two wide, took the far turn in the five path and moved
up. NO NANNETTE NO trailed in the five to three path and passed tired rivals. CAVIAR RESOLUTION laid off of the pace in the two path and tired. LAKE
RUNNER tracked along the inside and weakened around the far turn. SUPORB raced forwardly in the four path, tucked to the inside as the clear leader's
closest pursuer down the backstretch, but weakened rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
SMILING ELLIE tracked from midpack along the inside, launched a rally turning for home, gained place and took aim outside of the clear leader in upper
stretch, bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear. JOCASTA broke a step slow, pursued from midpack from the three path around the first turn, shifted out
to the five path entering the backstretch, advanced to offer an early bid for the lead with a half mile remaining, cleared tucking to the two path entering the
far turn, maintained a clear margin entering the lane, but was caught by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and remained well clear of show. GUEST OF
HONOR tracked in the two path, then in the three path and between horses turning for home before being floated to the four path entering the lane, ran on
to gain show at the furlong grounds and held that position thereafter. SCOOP lunged out and bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the
two path under a snug hold behind rivals, then moved up between horses. SMART WITH HEART bumped with an inner rival at the start, set the pace two
wide, got headed between horses at the half mile pole, chased in the four to five path around the far turn and faded. MISS JEOPARDY prompted along the
inside, chased in the two path around the far turn, got outmoved by an inner rival while getting floated to the three path entering the lane and faded. KATIES
FACTOR stalked in the five to four path around the first turn, then faltered between horses at the five sixteenths pole. ESPERE trailed in the three path and
never got involved. SAVED BY GRACE lacked speed in the three to four path, then in the six path around the far turn and made little impact.

SPLASH MASTER pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, gained along the inside around the far turn, reached place before taking aim
outside of the leader entering the lane, sustained progress to bid passing the furlong grounds, sparred with the leader while taking contact from that one
nearing the final sixteenth, then edged past. TEMPTING LADY showed the way via a clear margin and in the two path, met an outer challenge entering the
final furlong, shifted out and brushed that bidder nearing the sixteenth pole, but was still bested late. STERLING LUCK brushed with an inner rival before
steadying behind that one at the start, raced at the rear in the two path, advanced between horses down the backstretch, swung from the three path to the
five path entering upper stretch, then rallied to gain show late. LADY ABERDEEN stalked the leader from the three path, chased in the two path around the
far turn before being outmoved and floated to the four path entering the lane, yielded and lost show late. GALADINI broke a step slow, laid off of the pace
along the inside and failed to factor. FLATHEAD FINALE raced towards the rear in the three to two path and made little impact. BAGEL AND DELI brushed
with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the four path and was done early. SWEET CHARLIZE pursued from midpack in the five path, retreated and
pursued from the rear in the three path and between horses around the far turn, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
ASPENITE tracked along the inside, bid inside of the leaders in upper stretch and drove clear passing the furlong grounds. CLASSIC POWER (IRE)
pressed the leader from the three path, chased while getting floated to the six path entering the lane, got outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch before
bidding for place at the furlong grounds, and edged that position late. GABARRA laid off of the pace in the two path, improved inside of rivals in upper
stretch, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the final furlong and chased evenly to reach show late. COWES showed the way in the two path, shifted
out to the five path entering the lane, got headed by an inner bidder nearing the furlong pole, yielded place to an outer rival in the final sixteenth and lost
show late. SCAT FREE stumbled and spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the start, raced off of the pace hung in the five path around the turn, floated to
the seven path entering the lane and failed to menace. SUMMERTIME PEPPERS stalked in the four path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, but
hung oh his left lead and gave way. PRODIGY PARADISE stumbled at the start, trailed in the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
KAVOD vied with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, forged an advantage turning for home, drove clear in upper stretch and held sway
while hanging on his left lead. SURVEILLANCE pursued from midpack in the four path into the turn, got floated to the five path nearing the lane, sustained a
grinding charge outside of rivals to edge place in the final sixteenth, closed in on the leader late but needed more. PRO OXIDANT popped open the gate
without leaving it pre-race, tracked inside of rivals and in the two path around the turn, brushed an outer foe shifting to the three path passing the three
sixteenths pole, progressed to vie for place along with an outer rival in the final furlong, but was bested by that one late. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR vied inside
of the eventual winner while a bit off the inner rail, yielded to that one entering the lane, yet kept on mildly. MORELLO laid off of the pace in the three path
and between horses, shifted to the four path approaching the lane, but took a brush from an inner rival in upper stretch and yielded. CHASING TIME broke
in the air and was off slow, then saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. STRONG EAGLE was pinched back between horses at the start, trailed in the
two path and made little impact. MIDNIGHT ESCAPE chased in the five path and steadily faded. CORONA BOLT was briefly fractious awaiting the start,
broke outwardly and put an outer rival to crowded quarters, stalked outside of the top pair, chased them coming under urging in the three path with three
furlongs to go, but lacked a response and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

COURT JESTER tracked three wide, ranged up to the new leader in the final furlong, sparred through the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed. GAMER
NATE stalked two wide, bid around the far turn, cleared entering the lane, met an outer challenge in the final sixteenth, dueled through the late stages but
just missed. REGATTA BAY pursued from midpack along the inside, chased the top trio from the two to three path around the far turn before shifting to the
five path in upper stretch, and ran on to claim show. COAL COAL BEER set the pace, met an outer challenge around the far turn and gave way entering
upper stretch. CAPTIVATING STAR pursued four wide, then faded between horses entering the far turn. RAZOR CREST laid off of the pace in the three
path and failed to menace. ACE broke slowly, lagged behind and was outrun. CYPRESS GOLD broke outwardly, laid off off the pace hung five to four wide
and was outrun. BITSY'S STAR broke inwardly, stalked along the inside but wilted around the far turn. THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED
