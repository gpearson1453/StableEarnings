Footnotes
WELL CONNECTED raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole,
gained ground steadily and held off a closer at the wire. WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to chase the
leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the three path and gained ground late to just miss. ASTRONAUT
OSCAR dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and gave way in late stretch. EVEN THUNDER raced
off the pace early, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position in the lane. LEAD OFF trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the three path and never threatened. AWESOMEBROTHERBILL bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, recovered to duel on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and tired in the stretch. SIX WHIPS tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter
of a mile, raced in the four path around the turn and weakened in the lane. ZAMFIR pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued around
the turn in the three path and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
NOBLE STAR raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path
and held clear to the wire. ICONIC ROCK raced in the two path early, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still
in the two path, drifted in in upper stretch, cutting off SKYLANE in the process, and gained ground from there, chasing the winner on to the finish.
PEYTON'S DAY raced in the middle of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the second turn, raced in tight quarters
in upper stretch and improved position from there. SKYLANE saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far
bend, gave way entering the stretch, was forced to take up near the eighth pole when ICONIC ROCK drifted into his lane and kept on to the finish from
there. IRON STREETS raced in the five path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the four path and finished evenly. MAGNUS EFFECT raced in the four path around the first bend, dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
angled in to save ground around the far turn and weakened in the lane. INSPIRING HONOR trailed the field on the inside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and made no bid. MORNING EAGLE raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the
pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and showed no kick. D BUCKAROO raced in the two path
around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the three path and faded in the lane. LEGENDARY
BEAST saved ground around the first bend, raced off the pace on the outside coming up the backstretch, swung out to the four path for the run around the
far turn and was never a factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE ONE, SKYLANE, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE SIX, ICONIC ROCK, CITING
INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH POLE. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE SAME INCIDENT. UPON REVIEW, HORSE SIX, ICONIC
ROCK, WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE.
