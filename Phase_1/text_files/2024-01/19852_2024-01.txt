was no match for top two and held third. DARLING LUNA was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. LOLA LOCA was bumped at the
start and outrun inside. HUGE G played no factor while racing three wide. QUEEN VALENTINA fought rating early, chased two wide and retreated after a

Footnotes
RAINY NIGHT got sent from the gate to set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along from said position around the turn, gradually drifted out on her left
lead thru the stretch, but dug in to hold on. PERILOUS tracked in the three path, angled out to the eight path while being roused turning into the lane, got
bumped by an inner foe passing the sixteenth, but rallied for place. REALLY THIRSTY laid up close along the inside, was cued from the two path turning
into the lane, and kept on for show. CABOODLE stalked in the two path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, swung out to the seven path at the
top of the stretch, but drifted out and bumped an outer foe around the sixteenth while finishing evenly. MARIAN CROSS (GB) rated in the four path, tipped
to the rail going into the turn, was cued midway around the turn, and was gaining from the five path down the lane. BANANA SPLIT broke out at the start,
pressed in the three path, floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. STREETERVILLE trailed along the
inside early and never factored. VANDELLA chased in the five path but never threatened. MY SWEETHEART DANI broke out at the start, raced off the
pace in the six path early and never menaced.

Footnotes
WEMBY vied between foes in the three path, took command under rousing in the two path around the turn, and kicked on from the four path in the stretch to
hold on. PAISAN chased inside, was cued nearing the quarter, tipped out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and ran on while on his left lead for place.
MISTER COOPER raced wellback in the two path, floated out to the six path midway around the turn, and kept on while on his left lead in the stretch for
show. IMAPEPPA bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was nudged along around the turn, tipped out to the four path entering the
stretch, angled back in passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. SIR BANANA BRIAN tracked in the four path, ranged up from the five path turning into
the stretch, but flattened late. T B TWELVE ALWAYS trailed from the two path into the turn and made no impact from the five path in the stretch. ALWAYS
DIALED bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, but faded from the six path in
the stretch. FLASHOVER raced in midpack from the three path, was cued in the four path midway around the turn, but was empty from the six path in the
stretch. UNABATED pressed in the four path, was cued in the three path passing the quarter, but weakened between foes in the stretch. MAX FORWARD
SPEED was hustled from off the pace in the four path but never menaced. AHORSEWITHNONAME was pushed along to lead along the inside early but
gaveway around the turn.

Footnotes
BEACH READY stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide leaving the quarter pole, seized command nearing the eighth pole, drew clear soon after and
held safe over a late bid from the runner-up. FISH MOONEY saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed. PEACE
SEEKER settled off the pace while racing two and three wide, shifted wider in upper stretch and ran on for the show. LUCKY PERIDOT raced off the pace
two and three wide, shifted six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. BEACH PARTY BINGO set the pace along the rail to upper stretch and
weakened. HAY HAY PAULA saved ground and failed to menace. PRINCESS BLAKELY raced in range three wide and came up empty in the lane.
CINDY'S SONG raced four wide in midpack around the first turn, bid two wide around the far turn and faltered in upper stretch. PROVOKE ME prompted the
pace two wide, was eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
RO TOWN laid up close on the outer hip of the pacesetter from the four path, was cued midway around the far turn, took aim while still in the four path at the
top of the lane, and inched past the inner pacesetter in the closing stages. MY LION (GB) showed the way around the first turn to set the pace while under a
hold in the three path down the backside, was coaxed passing the quarter, opened slightly while tipping to the rail entering the stretch, ran on while tipping
back outward into the final furlong, but was caught in the final strides by an outer foe to place. QUEEN MACHA rated in the three path, was coaxed along in
the four path around the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. STRAND OF GOLD trailed in the four path, was
driven in the three path around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, but made no impact. KISS ME HARDY tracked in the four path, but lost
ground while under a ride in the five path around the far turn, and did not threaten. SILKEN DOLLAR stalked in the two path, was driven from the rail around
the far turn, but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
OROZIMBA set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, widened in upper stretch then just lasted. PARALLEL
raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch, rallied through the lane and just missed. ITS SATISFACTUAL was off slowly, raced in range four wide,
could not match strides in upper stretch then finished well through the final sixteenth. FLORIBUNDA saved ground in range, could not not keep pace with
the winner in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong but lacked a clear path late. STAR PERFORMANCE pressed the pace two wide and was one-paced
through the lane. COOL TRICKS saved ground and failed to menace. SPUNFORFUN chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. REINA MAR
played no factor while racing three wide. OLIVIA'S SPARKLE was outrun inside. MISS CASSIDY chased the pace two wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
IF NOT FOR LUCK stalked in the five path, was coaxed along while ranging up passing the quarter, tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, and
drew past an inner trio before the sixteenth. SEAVER raced off the pace in the three path, was roused midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path
entering the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. TIVY got bumped by an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path, had to wait along the rail
around the turn, was cued while cutting the corner to bid in upper stretch, and kept on, but was out-finished by an outer pair to show. ROLLING ON bumped
an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was ridden along the inside around the turn, floated out to four path entering the stretch, but yielded in
the final sixteenth. CANTARO trailed in the three path and made no impact from the two path in the stretch. VAMOS VIEJO prompted the pace in the four
path, bid while being floated out to the five path turning into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. GRIMES pressed in the three path but backed up
between foes around the turn.

Footnotes
PURE CLASS broke out and bumped an outer foe, chased inside, was ridden from the rail into the turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane,
drew away from an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and kicked on to hold clear. ROAR READY raced wellback in the two path, cut the corner under right
handed encouragement turning into the stretch, angled out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. HOLIDAY PAY prompted the pace
in the five path, was driven between foes in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, stayed on his left lead,
and finished evenly for show. SOUND OF THE BEAST bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off the pace in the four path, was cued in the two path
passing the quarter, angled out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, mildly stayed on, but just missed show honors in a photo. LOUIE THE SUN KING
set the pace in the three path, was cued in the two path midway around the turn, tipped to the rail while losing the lead passing the eighth pole, and
gaveway. MIGHTY MEKONG bumped with foes on both sides at the start, trailed in the four path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the
lane, but was no menace, pulled up shortly after the wire, and was vanned off. LIGHTING CLOUDS stalked in the six path but gaveway turning into the
stretch.
