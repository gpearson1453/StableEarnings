Footnotes
KING BARON tracked the early pace, raced four wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy winner. IMA RASCAL was
unhurried early, advanced five wide out of the turn, passed rivals, was no match and finished second best. BAJA BOOGIE was reserved early from between
rivals and flattened out. STOREY'S FURY was off slow, was void of any early speed, raced between rivals into the turn, angled in mid stretch and passed
tired rivals. MOZART J set a clear early pace from off the rail and faded. EMPERIAL EAGLES was allowed to settle from the inside and gave way. AHEAD
OF TIME KID was outrun early, raced four wide and never fired.
