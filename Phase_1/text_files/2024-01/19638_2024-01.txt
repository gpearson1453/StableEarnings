Footnotes
WILD GIRL settled inside, bid into the stretch, moved clear and stayed safe under pressure. ONLY GIRL far behind early, advanced into the stretch with a
gradual gain. CHANCE OCCURRENCE chased off the pace, rallied into the stretch and finished willingly. SOULFUL TARA raced in closest pursuit of the
pacesetter, led at the quarter pole then proved empty. LADY GABRIELLE dropped back inside and was never a factor. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE
stumbled soon after the start, saved ground and lacked a rally. TREASURE PEACE sprinted clear in the opening quarter then stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
OLD HEAD raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, gained command past the eighth pole, drew clear, then dug in to
hold on. AKNA raced two wide off the pace, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly outside and was gaining at the end. LADY YELLEN stalked
outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in, weakened late and held third. DUNE JUMPER trailed the field, moved up four wide at the
quarter pole and gained mildly outside. MATTY BO stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the turn, took over, dueled into the lane and weakened.
CREATIVE COPY raced off the pace inside and did not factor. FOREST MAIDEN raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the turn and failed
to threaten. RIVERVIEW set the pace on the inside and gave way.

MISQUILLO trailed early, circled her field rallying on the turn then surged clear late. SO SWELL outrun early, advanced very wide, led then was caught in
the late stages. SO SOFTLY alternated for the lead three wide, vied to midstretch and tired. RANDOM LUCK dueled between rivals, earned a narrow lead
before the half and weakened in the stretch. CALIENTE RUM was well placed behind the dueling pacesetters, gave way on turn. BULLET ON TAP angled
inside after opening quarter, angled out on the turn but had no bid. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE prompted the pace along the rail for half a mile and stopped. THE
FURMANATOR chased outside and weakened steadily. TOTAL DISCRETION lagged far behind and was never in contention. AZTEC BAY moved within
striking range early then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
SPLICETHEMAINBRACE showed good early speed racing a bit off the inside, responded when challenged on the turn, put away that bid from PERFECT
SILENT CAT, drew clear and held well under urging. PERFECT SILENT CAT chased three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled, could not stay with the
winner, then dug in gamely in the stretch to the end. SOUPER FLY OVER raced off the pace, chased inside on the turn, angled out and rallied mildly for
third. LIBERTY STAR stumbled and broke awkwardly, raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. CRYPT bobbled at the
break and off a bit slow, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. HE'S INCREDIBLE chased inside, chased on the turn and faded. SEVIER
chased between rivals, steadied at the four and a half furlong marker, then checked between rivals nearing the turn, chased and gave way.

SHERO vied briefly inside, shook loose after the quarter, remained well clear and was never threatened under moderate urging. CONFIRMED GENIUS
dueled outside the winner then pursued that rival remainder of trip to be easily second. PISTOL LIZ ABLAZEN flashed speed three wide, faded on the turn
and continued well. ALWAYS MIA squeezed back early, rushed up inside then flattened out. PEACHY WEACHY dropped back very wide then passed rivals
without menacing. TARA'S TALENT trailed for half mile inside then caught tiring opponents. BUCKS SOME lacked speed in the two path and was never in
contention. POWWA OF LOVE prompted the pace three wide in the opening quarter and retreated.
