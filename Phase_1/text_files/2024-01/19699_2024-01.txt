Footnotes
PRATT pressed the pace two wide, made a bid two wide to latch on to CAERUS on the turn, then poked a head in front off the turn, then had a long drive
and dueled for command through the lane and prevailed late to prove best under a drive. CAERUS set a pressured pace while getting over towards the
inside into the first turn, then dueled for command nearing the quarter pole, then battled gamely to the wire but missed. ONCE A GIANT tracked the pace
three to four wide and weakened, bested the rest. TEXTPECTATION was reserved three wide, came five wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals.
SHANGHAI CANDY was reserved on the inside, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and had no rally. THE METHOD stalked the pace three wide and
then stopped in the final furlong.

NEISSA pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then kicked away in the final furlong to prove
best while drifting out slightly. NORMANDY LIFE moved up to chase the early pace two wide, moved out and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter
pole, loomed boldly by the furlong marker but flattened out while being clearly second best. MAHER stalked the early pace three wide, then was four wide
on the turn and weakened, bested rest. BYRD OF EDEN was reserved early on the inside, two wide on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn
but had no rally while improving position. SWEET MISCHIEF set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and weakened. KAZ' ROSE
was rated early on the outside, dropped to the inside on the turn and was empty. WILD CREATION chased the early pace four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
AMI'S LINK was well rated on the inside, angled out by the quarter pole to make a three wide bid off the turn and drew off to prove much the best under mild
left handed crop urging. LONDONDERRY set the pace from the inside, then was pressured on the backstretch and dueled for the lead nearing the quarter
pole, then proved to be no match for the winner in the final furlong while holding on to the place award gamely. CAR LADY was rated along three wide,
came four wide into the lane but lacked the needed winning bid while just missing the place award. SWITCHRATTLENROLL prompted the early pace and
made a bid two wide to duel for command by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. MIKEY'S JEWEL was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace
from the outside, four to five wide on the far turn and tired. CANOOCHEE had an awkward break and trailed the field early, made a five wide middle move to
be in range by the half mile marker but tired. RIDGELYSREDHOT prompted the early pace three wide, then was between rivals by the half mile marker and
then stopped in the drive.

CHLOE ROSE shifted out entering the first turn to prompt the early pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid in hand on the turn to be clear off the turn,
then was kept to mild urging to maintain a safe margin to the wire. RAINBOW TROUT was allowed to settle early on the inside, saved ground on the turn,
angled out nearing the furlong marker and closed full of run late to gain the place award. MERCY MERCY tracked the pace four to three wide and finished
willingly to the wire losing the place award late. BLIND SIGHT was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside, four wide on the far turn but
had no late kick. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. DANCE A LITTLE
JIG was off a step slow, settled two wide and advanced on the far turn but tired. JUSTIN TIME was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide
and tired.

BROTHER BELEN was away alertly to set the pace while racing off the inside, then was confronted to the inside by GURT'S WARRIOR on the far turn and
dueled with that rivals, then made a bid and drew clear to prove best under right handed crop and then left handed crop urging to prove best. GURT'S
WARRIOR was well placed two wide, made a inside bid on the far turn to duel for command on the inside with the winner, but could not stay with that rival in
the final furlong while staying on for the place award. FAST STUDY was settled early on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and advanced and swung
out three wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally to clearly best the rest. BEJUCO was reserved two wide early, advanced four wide on the far turn but
came up empty in the drive. SILK PRINCE prompted the winner four wide and tired. ROWDY RED GLARE was settled three wide early and tired.
