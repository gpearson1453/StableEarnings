Footnotes
ISTRIA forced the pace outside, faded briefly on the final turn, pulled clear and lasted winning the head bob. BRAVO REGINA settled inside, angled out on
the final turn, steadied between rivals in tight at the top of the lane, rallied and just missed. ALICE KRAMDEN fanned wide on the first turn, bid to clear lead
at the quarter pole then weakened. HOLY BERRIES hustled to the front inside, was collared after half a mile and gave way. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS
lacked speed, moved very wide on the final turn and faded. CAPE NEDDICK lagged far behind and was never in contention. CASH ON FIRST raced within
range for half a mile and stopped.

the two path through the stretch to gain the place. RUMAWAY trailed far behind then advanced inside with late energy. TRY HARDER pursued the dueling
leaders three wide then flattened out in the stretch. SWING OIL hustled off the leaders four wide and lacked a solid rally. EMPTY MY POUCH was pinched

Footnotes
TOMARIE set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside of IPSUM GRATUS past the furlong
marker, regained command and prevailed determinedly. IPSUM GRATUS raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn, angled out at the five
sixteenths marker, rallied outside entering the stretch, put a head in front of TOMARIE near the furlong marker, dueled with that rival and was outfinished.
BEYOND A MILLION raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the stretch, closed belatedly and got up for third. LEAN ON E tracked close up two
wide, then chased, bid on the far turn, weakened in the lane and lost third. CLASSY MISS raced four wide early, stalked outside, chased three wide on the
far turn and tired. MISS LOYALTY raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, then lacked a rally.

bid into the stretch, led but was nailed nearing the wire. TRICOLOUR settled off the pace inside, offered a strong four wide bid on the final turn then
flattened out. COALVILLE alternated for the lead outside, edged to the front at the quarter pole then weakened. THE LAST ARROGATE was firmly rated
close up inside then gave way through the stretch. MARTY'S MAGIC moved just off pace between rivals and proved empty in the stretch. VIRAL VIDEO led
narrowly inside for five furlongs and stopped abruptly.

IN SPADES set a pressured pace, was challenged again at the quarter pole then held on tenaciously following a long drive. BATTER UP BUD settled
outside the dueling leaders, collared the winner in the stretch, battled gamely but could not get by. BEYOND BEST lacked speed outside then made a
steady gain through the stretch. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED settled inside the dueling leaders and finished on the final turn. RHUMJAR vied with the winner
for three quarters and gave way in the stretch. SEVEN IS A BREEZE dropped back along the inside and weakened steadily.
