Footnotes
MIST N SEVEN moved to the lead early setting the pace from off the rail, was pressured by an inside foe heading into the turn, moved clear again taking a
large margin by the top of the stretch, held safe. SHAME ON ZCUINTLE lacked early speed, advanced outside foes three wide early on the turn then inside
rivals later on that bend, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, continued to run on gaining late to get up for place. DESERT PUNK stalked from off the
inside, went about three to four wide on the turn losing ground on the eventual winner, kept on but was no match and lost place late. BULL MOON settled at
the back, advanced past foes outside four to six wide on the turn, improved position. RAPPING RUMOR was encouraged forward, pressed the eventual
winner from inside after the opening quarter, faded. KING BRYCE chased from inside, was off the rail turning for home and never a threat. SMARTY'S
BERTRANDO chased briefly, steadily retreated racing two to three wide on the turn, tired. ITSNOWTROUBLEATALL got away slowly, switched outside
runners and was encouraged forward, began to drop back four to six wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
TIME IS PRECIOUS settled in behind racing off the inside, went about three to four wide through the turn, was encouraged along by the quarter pole,
angled eight deep at the top of the stretch, took aim on the leader, bid at the sixteenth pole and edged past. WILLSHERWONTSHE stalked from outside,
advanced five to six wide on the turn taking a narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, moved clear by upper stretch, was guided out to engage a challenger
inside the furlong grounds but was outfinished. FOR FUN chased from inside, raced off the rail two to three deep in behind the leaders on the turn, came out
further in upper stretch, ran on to get up for show honors. GRAN MANNA attended the pace from between runners, went three to four wide on the turn in
contention till late on that bend, needed more. SHE HIT A HOMER attended the pace from outside four to five wide, had no extra for the drive.
BOISTEROUSLY IRISH broke just a half step slowly, was outpaced early, took a wide route six to seven deep through the turn, failed to menace.
BODIE'SLITTLEGIRL attended the early pace from between runners, shifted nearer the rail on the turn while weakening, continued to fade. ROCKIN MARIE
broke just a step slowly, was coaxed forward inside, pressed the leaders early, dropped back, switched out off the rail on the turn, was not a late threat.

an outside foe, dueled with that one, dug in late to edge away. IM STILL THIRSTY stalked in behind, moved out six wide past the five-sixteenths, took the
lead by a short head in upper stretch, dueled and was outfinshed. JON L settled off the pace racing off the inside, went mostly three to five wide through the
turn and into upper stretch, kept on to get up for show honors late. LET THERE BE PEACE vied three to four wide between foes, had no extra and lost third
late. AQUIMINE vied inside just off the rail, weakened, was not persevered with through the final furlong. PINEY BLUFF was outpaced and never a threat.

Footnotes
GREENBRIER settled off the pace racing outside, swung nine wide into upper stretch commencing an advance, struck the lead by mid-stretch then held off
a challenge from FARMER FRED R F, who lacked early speed and was allowed to settled outside a rival at the rear, was forced to take the outside route
into upper stretch fanning ten deep, loomed a threat in mid-stretch but couldn't get past the leader while clearly second best. MUSICS MY VICE stalked
from outside up close, was forced wide by inside rivals entering upper stretch nine deep and taking a narrow lead about the three-sixteenths, was outkicked.
REIGN OVER ME settled off the pace, went three to four wide into the turn, had to steady on heels slightly near the five-sixteenths, kept on inside rivals in
the lane to improve. GOLDENSPA shifted in racing up close inside just off the rail into the turn, was put to urging outside the quarter pole, angled seven
wide coming to the top of the stretch, ran on. START THEM UP broke a step slowly, brought up the rear inside a foe, shifted seven wide turning for home,
kept on. FULL BORE was within range four wide and encouraged along past the three-eighths, contended for the lead while drifting out leaving the turn,
faded in the lane. BLUE JEAN BOURBON stalked the pacesetter, bid two to three wide at the five-sixteenths with a narrow lead, drifted five wide leaving the
turn, faded. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT raced up close going about four to six wide throughout, failed to rally. SPEND AGAIN was off the leaders, shifted in on
the turn, had no rally. SIMPLY ELEMENTARY moved clear, set the pace inside, came up empty. LITTLE RED RIFLE chased from inside, came out near the
quarter pole, was not a threat.

Footnotes
TEE ROY pressed the early pace from inside, took a narrow lead, drifted out a bit entering upper stretch, dueled with the outside foe, dug in and edged to a
narrow lead late and bumped the dueling partner lightly near the wire. HENNESSY LOOKER RF broke outwardly, had the early lead, was soon overtaken
by an inside foe, dueled with that one, was bumped lightly near the wire while outfinished. SPEED BUMP BOB was up close in behind the leaders, came out
six wide for the drive, gained late between foes and in a bit tight near the wire. ATTILAS TORNADO stalked from just off the leaders going four to five wide
on the turn and drifting out a bit into upper stretch racing six to seven deep thereafter, needed more. DAN WHO was off the pace, fanned eleven wide into
the stretch then soon shifted out a two further paths racing widest of all, gained mildly. DEACON BEACON settled off the leaders, fanned eleven to twelve
deep, ran on mildly. CASH CRUZER pursued from just off the leaders, was forced out from six to nine wide on the turn and another path into upper stretch,
ran on. NOGAL CANYON advanced past a rival two to three wide on the turn, shifted seven deep into upper stretch, ran on but was not a threat. RARE
COIN was ridden along early racing off the inside but failed to menace. I AM THE JUAN was mid-pack early chasing from inside, dropped back and failed to
rally. FORWARD OBSERVER saved ground inside but was outrun. CHA CHING CHARLIE was up close in pursuit of the leaders early facing about five to
six deep, drifted wider into the stretch, tired and was not persevered with in the stretch, walked off. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
HENNESSY LOOKER RF AGAINST TEE ROY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

held safe. MR. BIG RIG stalked from mid-pack, was bumped near the half racing six to seven deep, finished up with solid late interest but was only second
best. MICKEYS GOLD switched out veering into a rival at the half, went five to six wide through the turn, was lightly bumped at the top of the stretch by an
inside foe, had no extra for late but saved show honors. TATAS JOE MARK settled off the pace, was forced four to five wide on the turn, came out a bit
further for the stretch run, finished well but missed third. COMING ABSTRACTION was outpaced in the early going, angled out coming past the quarter
pole, gained too late nine wide in the stretch. GAMBLING COWBOY attended the early pace from outside, went four to five wide, bumped a rival lightly at
the top of the stretch, moved nearer the rail at that point and lacked the needed late kick. SMOOTH BLUES chased from inside foes but off the rail, went two
to three wide through the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, ran on. RYDERS UP shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was in
a bit tight on the rail advancing inside a foe at the top of the stretch, kept on. SHAME ON ROOSTER chased up close racing three to four wide, faded.
QUANTUM BULL was outpaced racing off the inside, floated ten to eleven deep into upper stretch, was not a threat and not persevered with late. SENSE
OF URGENCY pressed from inside, retreated.

Footnotes
CAPITAL JOKE settled mid-pack racing about five wide, began to advance on the far turn still far out from the rail, was forced wider still being floated ten
deep into upper stretch, struck the lead and held sway. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM settled at the rear, began to shift out near the five-sixteenths fanning
eleven deep into upper stretch, was held at bay but second best. FOUND MY BALL moved forward shifting in to be about three wide into the first turn,
dueled outside a foe early up the backstretch, edged clear coming to the half, drifted out badly leaving the far turn and at the top of the stretch then drifted
back in, was outkicked. ZIA ZAPPER was at the rear early, raced off the rail late on the far turn coming into upper stretch three to four deep and went
evenly. MEDIMPACT dueled inside, dropped back and switched out near the half, was within range into the far turn but weakened thereafter. SECRET
POTION was rank and steadied into the first turn, stalked in behind the leading pair three to four wide, floated nine wide turning for home and was in a bit
tight, faded. GREY STORM raced close near the rail, faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

LETTHERAINSETTLEIT stalked five to six wide, was up close racing outside up the backstretch, swept clear leaving the far turn, held safe. DADDY WHAT
IF broke a step slowly, was reserved at the back, swung nine wide into upper stretch, ran on to get up for place. HA HA FOR YOU was forced six to seven
wide through the early going, moved a bid nearer but still off the inside for the second turn, fanned back out seven wide coming to the quarter pole when
asked for more, lost place late. THE LAST FEAT was taken back and shifted in early, settled two to three wide, improved position inside a rival in the
stretch. BURNZ DA BOSS was up close into the first turn three to four wide, needed more in the stretch. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE settled off the pace, came
out turning for home, needed more. MITHQAAL pressed from inside on or off the rail, faded. THIRSTY ECHO moved to the lead heading into the first turn
and shifting in three to four deep, came up empty in the stretch.

WILMAS IRISH ROVER was caught four deep outside foes on the first turn settling off the leader, steadily advanced while wide on the far turn, took over by
the top of the stretch and was shaken up a that juncture, ridden out through mid- to late-stretch. KIRBY DERBY settled off the pace and off the inside,
fanned about six wide into upper stretch, was no match but second best. HOLY EMPEROR was between runners three deep up the backstretch, continued
mostly three wide on the far turn, ran on to improve. PERFECT COME BACK was caught four to five wide in the early going, continued wide on the far turn,
ran on. SEXY DEXY was coaxed to the lead from the start and shifted in, set the pace in the clear, widened into the far turn, came up empty for the stretch
run. VODKA TWIST chased racing near the rail, tired. PALACE PRINCE failed to threaten racing near the inside.
