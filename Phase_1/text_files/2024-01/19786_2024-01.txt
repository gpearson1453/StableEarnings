Footnotes
YOU KIDDING ME allowed to settle while not far back, saved ground into the far turn and raced behind horses into the stretch, was full of run inside of the
furlong marker and split rivals into the final sixteenth, took command and held safely in a drive for the win. STRAIT OF GEORGIA stalked outside of runners
in the early stages, maintained a four wide path through the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, chased four wide to the
quarter marker, raced widest into the stretch and closed well into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch but stayed on in the final
strides to secure second. WARRENS WORLD stalked the early pace three wide, tracked the decent pace between runners into the far turn and raced within
aim to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while holding safely for third.
NUESTRO ENGREIDO forwardly placed in the early running, advanced into the backstretch run and attended to the decent pace heading to the half-mile
pole, pressured DUPLICATION into the second turn, lost ground approaching the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. DUPLICATION sent
leaving the start, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, came under pressure into the second turn, held foes at bay inside of the furlong pole, was
overtaken into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. REGULATION DAZED was fractious prior to the start, unprepared at the break and was off
slowly, lacked early speed and trailed.

Footnotes
SAHARA SUE disputed the early pace three wide, battled outside of a pair of rivals heading into the turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter marker,
kicked clear into the stretch, drew away into the final sixteenth and was ridden out in deep stretch to be much the best. DIVINE PASSAGE vied for the early
lead while between runners, pressed between rivals into the turn and battled for the lead with SAHARA SUE approaching the quarter marker, was outkicked
by that rival into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive and was clear of the rest for second. LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS washy prior to the start,
lacked early speed and trailed into the turn, saved ground while trailing into the stretch, was not able to impact the top pair and ran on in the final sixteenth
to be clear for third. LADY OF THE RIVER hustled away from the break, contested the early pace inside of a pair of rivals, lost position into the turn and
chased to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TURIAF tracked the early pace from the inside, was well positioned through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the far turn, loomed
approaching mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong pole and drew away while kept to task in the late stages. PACIFIC ZIP rated off of the early
lead, tracked three wide along the first turn and maintained an outside path into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile pole,
improved position into the second turn and chased three then four wide to the quarter marker, came widest into the stretch and continued her advance at
the furlong pole, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and ran on to secure second. KITTEN'S KID assumed command away from the
start, established the early lead and set moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, was pressured into the second turn and dug in into upper stretch while
holding a narrow advantage, lost the lead inside of the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in the final strides and
held at the end for third. SHE'S SO SHINY ceded the early lead to KITTEN'S KID and stalked that runner into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the
half-mile pole, advanced into the second turn and pressed the pace to the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch while running on the left
lead, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled
two wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile pole and went two to three wide into second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not
offer a late rally. GEA was unhurried away from the start, settled while saving ground into the far turn, trailed into the stretch and did not factor.

WODETON (FR) raced close up to the lead heading into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide into the backstretch run and attended to the moderate
pace heading to the half-mile pole, advanced into the far turn and pressed the pace to the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and held a
narrow lead at the furlong pole, was kept to firm urging into the final sixteenth, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and held safely in a drive to prove best.
LYING GHOST was prominent leaving the start, took back and stalked the pace into the backstretch run, tracked from the inside at the half-mile marker and
was well placed heading into the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, was outfinished by the determined winner
in the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides to secure second. FAR WEST was hustled in the early going and assumed command into the first turn,
set a decent pace into the backstretch run, rated approaching the half-mile marker and carved out a moderate pace into the second turn, was pressed to the
quarter pole by WODETON, lost the lead to that rival in upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, continued to fight while chasing into the final
sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and held well in the final strides for third. CHIEF JACKSON was allowed to settle, raced two wide and between
runners into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the second turn, crowded a rival and lost
ground nearing the quarter pole, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and re-bid at the furlong grounds, needed more in the late stages but was gaining in
deep stretch and just missed for third. LOOKOUT POINT was allowed to settle and raced widest into the first turn, made a four wide middle move along the
backstretch run and came within aim at the half-mile marker, maintained that four wide path into the second turn and lost ground at the quarter marker,

early on and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, came in tight into the second turn and steadied
approaching the quarter marker, chased into the stretch, offered a late rally but was unable to make an impact in deep stretch. WARRENS CANDY MAN

Footnotes
THIRSTY BABY came in tight at the start, was squeezed leaving the break and was away slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running, improved
position while saving ground into the turn, waited for racing room at the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into the stretch and loomed approaching the
furlong marker, took command and drew clear into the final sixteenth, drew away under hand urging in deep stretch and was much the best. WHAT A
RELIEF broke alertly, took back and tracked the moderate early pace while between rivals, waited behind horses at the quarter marker and shifted four to
five wide for the drive, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and outfinished RIVERMARK in deep stretch to secure second. RIVERMARK allowed
to settle in the early running, chased two wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, shifted to the inside into upper stretch and rallied at the
furlong marker, could not keep pace with THIRSTY BABY into the final sixteenth, was tagged for second at the wire and held safely in the end for third.
DRIVE BY was asked for speed leaving the start, assumed command and set a decent pace into the turn, drew to clear lead along the turn and carved out a
moderate pace approaching the quarter pole, showed the way into the stretch, felt pressure from THIRSTY BABY nearing the furlong pole and was collared
by that runner, gave chase into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. T G I F ALPHA rated off of the early pace, tracked from the outside and
came five wide to the quarter marker, swung six to seven wide for the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and passed a tired rival in the late going. HALLISAR
came in tight soon after the start and steadied off of heels, recovered and tracked the decent early pace from the inside, mounted a two wide bid along the
turn and came within aim at the quarter marker, ran evenly while chasing to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in the
late stages. CRUSHER vied for early lead away from the start, took back and stalked the decent pace while outside of runners approaching the turn, lost
position at the quarter marker and raced four to five wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong pole and gave way. DIGITAL SOLDIER prominent in the
early running, pressed the decent early pace between rivals, lost ground along the turn and chased three wide to the quarter pole, dropped back in upper
stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CANAM GAL broke well but settled in a tracking spot behind the developing pace duel, cruised closer into contention approaching the quarter pole then had
to wait behind a wall of horses turning for home, got clear at the three-sixteenths pole, responded to steady handling, pulled clear at the furlong pole, drifted
out under left handed urging and held off a pair of fast closing challengers. CODE RIBBON was slow to get going but made steady progress on the leaders
down the backstretch run, continued to advance through the turn while remaining in the three path, swung out to the six or seven path for the stretch run,
and produced a strong rally but came up just short. A DIME FOR ME settled mid-pack, saved ground through the turn, launched a bid up the rail from the
five-sixteenths marker, tipped out to the four path at the eighth pole and continued to run on well to the wire. REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke well and was
went for the lead, secured the rail position and was inside of four horses across dueling for the early lead, held a very narrow lead while still battling in hand
through the turn, responded when set down passing the three-sixteenths pole but was overtaken and outfinished in the final sixteenth. PRETTY THIRSTY
was hustled away and dueled between horses early, hung in to deep stretch but was spent from early efforts, weakened and was outfinished late.
GLADRIEL did not break all that well then was sent hard to get forward position, reached the dueling leaders by the half-mile pole, made a four wide bid for
the lead under pressure near the quarter pole then tired, flattened out and finished the race on the wrong lead. MATCHLESS was not asked for speed from
the break, then chased from well behind the field while three to four paths off the rail, stayed wide around the turn and swung out to the six path for the
stretch run then put in late burst to improve position in the late stages. TONI TWO POCKET broke sharply and was on the outside of the quartet contesting
the early pace, continued to duel three wide through the turn, remained prominent to the stretch then gave way. BLACK ZABAT was hustled from the gate
and was three deep in the early speed duel, backed out of the duel at the half-mile marker, dropped to the rail, was able to keep close to the final furlong
then tired. GOLD COAST GIRL was very slow into stride, dropped far behind early and even farther back on the turn and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
VENOM broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a prompted pace into the backstretch run, was well rated through the backstretch run
and set the pace while pressured into the second turn, shook free into the stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, was kept to task while holding
foes at bay into the final sixteenth, was fully extended into deep stretch and lasted for a determined win at the wire. LAURA'S KIDOUGH was squeezed at
the start, shuffled back a bit leaving the break and was away a step slowly, settled three wide into the first turn, raced widest into the backstretch run and
made a four wide middle move to reach contention at the half-mile pole, prompted VENOM into the second turn, lost a bit of ground to that rival in upper
stretch, re-rallied into the stretch, battled while closing into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while just holding for second in a blanket finish.
UPRIGHT vied for the early lead away from the start, prompted VENOM along the first turn then took back to stalk the pace into the backstretch run, was
well positioned while saving ground into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while in a bit tight, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, surged in
the final strides and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for the show. STOUT settled two wide and between runners into the first turn,
tracked the moderate pace three wide to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide along the far turn and swung five wide for the drive, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, closed in the final sixteenth but was not able to impact the top three at the finish. VINNIEBOB came in tight on the run into the first turn and
checked off of heels at the seven furlong marker, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the backstretch run, improved position three wide into the far
turn, maintained that three wide path into the stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY rushed up
leaving the start, drifted out a bit at the seven furlong marker and floated out HOLY SMOKES entering the first turn, went three wide into the backstretch run
and advanced to prompt the moderate pace to the half-mile pole, lost position along the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired. OUR NORTH STAR
was allowed to settle while not far back to begin, saved ground while unhurried through the backstretch run, was outrun into the second turn, swung four
wide into the stretch and did not factor. HOLY SMOKES was forwardly placed leaving the start, got floated a bit wide into the first turn and stalked the pace
three to four wide into the backstretch run, raced close up to the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, lost position into the second turn, trailed
into the stretch and came up empty in the final furlong.
