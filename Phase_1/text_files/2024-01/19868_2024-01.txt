Footnotes
SHENANDOAH CAT angled to the inside and took the nod leaving the three eighths pole, set pressured pace from that point, contested the edge nearest
the rail and dug in determinedly to maintain the advantage over THUNDER PUNCH, who tapered in and raced with the early lead then pressured the winner
leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and remained game to the wire. CLEARLY VISIBLE gave chase
through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly to get third mid-stretch. GRANDIOSELY gave chase inside, rounded the turn off
the rail then flattened nearing mid-stretch. CALYPSO GHOST chased, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little more. CHURCH KEY gave chase
and rounded the turn about the four path. HOP TO A DECISION saved ground.

Footnotes
LITTLEBOURBONGIRL gave early chase toward the outside, raced close at the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch, dug in for the lead later
yards and edged clear toward the wire. JUBA'S PUNCH veered out and made contact with Our Brew leaving the gate then accelerated to the front at the
seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail and dug in under steady handling leaving the turn, but was met in later yards
and reluctantly ceded. FLORIDIFIED was bumped outward and into CREME DE LA QUEEN leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn near the
rail and came along to take third later yards. The latter was bumped at the break then gave chase, raced in range of the lead about the three path on the
turn, but flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. EVEN SMARTER gave chase outside, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane.
RUMORGOINGAROUND gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the lane. PALACIO broke sharply with a brief early lead, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five path on the turn. OUR BREW was bumped outward and into Floridified leaving the gate then
gave chase to no avail.

Footnotes
SISYPHUS rated close inside on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane, widened
from that point and held well with steady handling. DR JACK FLYER rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested
the advantage at the rail on the far turn but was met approaching the head of the lane and had to settle for second best. DYNA POINT raced off the rail the
first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then dueled through the final sixteenth for third. ZONA DE AMIGOS
settled in the three path the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the five path, drifted into the lane and was outfinished in the later duel for third. LANIE'S FIRST DUDE stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the
three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. REBEL WARRIOR stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole but flattened in the three path on the far turn. IT'S SAUL GOODMAN mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
JUBA'S PARADE rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and improved in the five path on the far turn,
dug in the final furlong and took over the closing yards. JUBA BABY stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced close
in the three path on the far turn, then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. EMBERLY took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the
pace, drew clear leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but
gave up the lead while flattening stride later yards. EXTRA CRUNCHY had a brief early lead inside then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, dropped back
passing the seven sixteenths and gave chase from that point, remained a factor at the rail on the far turn but flattened in the lane. THUNDERTURTLE saved
ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. UNCAPTURED
RUBY settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened stride into the far turn. TIMETOGETUP rated close inside on

Footnotes
A THOUSAND IDOLS stalked from the two and three paths, challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod past the three eighths,
dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. MACHISTO was forced outward and into Dowsing Rod into the first turn, gave
chase leaving the half mile pole and circled rivals five wide on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner.
ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS was hesitant to break then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. RUM CUP was reluctant to load and raced in the six path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. DOWSING ROD was bumped outward into the first turn and raced toward
the outside leaving the turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, swung to the outside leaving the turn and
finished evenly to pass rivals widest. J G JETT stalked the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
and weakened. FLOOR IT raced six wide on the opening turn, left the turn outside and showed little response. HOW U DOIN bore outward into the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch. MONEY MAC settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded
toward the far turn. SOUTHERN SAINT took over past the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure toward the
seven sixteenths pole, was met past the three eighths and dueled at even terms from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
gave way in the stretch.
