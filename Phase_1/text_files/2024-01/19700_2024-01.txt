the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the second turn and chased on in late stretch. GUN RIGHT saved ground
around the first bend, settled off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far bend and finished evenly.

the lane. BLACK SHAMAN saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and
