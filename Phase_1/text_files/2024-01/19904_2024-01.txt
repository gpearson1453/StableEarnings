DRAGON DREW quick to the front while well handled to the stretch and slipped away late. SENOR JOBIM had a tardy start outside with no speed to
stretch, ran on late for the place spot. THIS ILL DEFEND off rail run in the stretch, kept on gamely for show spot. MILITARY DRILL unhurried while saving
ground throughout no late response. JARETH inside run to the turn, stayed on to eighth pole wilted stretch. MONKEY ZONE never a factor from inside to
the turn. TOPPING antsy in gate, broke well chased winner to turn, empty stretch. BUZZER off rail run to turn, chased briefly, gave way readily through the
stretch.
