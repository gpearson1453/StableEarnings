JETS' DREAM quickly took control, widened easily on the final turn then was kept to her task while shortening stride late. SNOW LAKE settled off the pace
in the two path then made a steady gradual gain in the stretch. ME SO LUCKY lacked speed then continued willingly to gain the show while no threat.
MAMMA MIA ESTERINA trailed far back early, moved wide then flattened out. WINE GODDESS saved ground off the pace and was never a factor.
JAMAICAN MI HAZEL raced in closest pursuit of the winner for half a mile and stopped. HER TICKET TO RIDE broke alertly, raced within range early then
gave way.

Footnotes
WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside rivals, charged to the front,
drifted in in front of PROFESSOR KOOL past the sixteenth marker and edged away. PROFESSOR KOOL stalked the leaders, moved up on the turn, came
three wide into the stretch, angled in behind CARBONITE, rallied between horses, dug in gamely inside, was no match for the winner and steady slightly
behind that rival past the sixteenth pole. CARBONITE stalked outside the leaders, bid on the turn, drifted out a bit at the top of the lane, dueled and
weakened. SUSTENANCE vied two wide for the early lead, took over nearing the turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in and weakened in the final sixteenth.
KENNER vied inside for the lead, chased on the turn and tired. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA raced four wide off the pace, then saved ground on the turn and
failed to threaten. ACHILLES HEEL raced three wide off the pace, chased on the turn and failed to threaten. RETWEET stumbled at the start and was
outrun. FINANCIAL STRENGTH raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and failed to respond. A Jockey Objection by the rider of PROFESSOR
KOOL against the winner was dismissed.

SEVEN YEARS LATER sprinted clear inside, widened on the turn then stayed safe while tiring late under moderate urging. ASTONISHING ANABEL saved
ground throughout and closed the gap too late in the final furlong. SWEET LILLY FACTUM lacked speed then advanced along rail to gain show.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE chased outside, faded briefly on the turn then came again inside. CUP OF LIFE lacked speed racing wide and was never in
contention. MAZAL EIGHTEEN prompted the winner down the backstretch then proved empty in the stretch. ROAD TO DREAMS offered a brief bid on the
turn then flattened out in the stretch. MISS ALEX lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. SONET'S NAME moved off the leaders three wide and
began fading on the turn.

Footnotes
MASROUR led narrowly in the opening quarter, shook loose on the turn and remained well clear while ridden out. JOHNNY RITT split rivals advancing on
the turn then finished gamely but was no threat to the winner. NEIGH DUDE saved ground early, swung wide in the stretch and finished willingly.
SPEARGUN trailed for half a mile then moved wide with a mild bid. CAUSES TROUBLE steadied just after the start, rallied on the turn then flattened out.
COLONEL VARGO flashed speed along the inside to the far turn and gave way. GENGHIS moved close up wide early, remained wide and faltered.

Footnotes
MIDLANER raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final furlong, surged in deep stretch and ran
down the leader to prevail. WINNING TIME dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, shook free at the quarter pole, drew clear, dug in gamely and
yielded in the final strides. DARK TIMBER raced close up early, then chased inside, chased on the turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch and held for
third. STRUGAR trailed the field, advanced at the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly on the rail. COLD FEET stumbled at the start,
stalked three wide, chased on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside
and failed to threaten. MR. DODA raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn and faded. BURN THE EVIDENCE dueled two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
PORTAL ONE stalked three wide, advanced readily on the turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took charge, drew off and was ridden out. DIESEL
dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, was no match for the winner and remained well clear for place honors. R GOODTIME CHARLIE raced off the
rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, rallied outside and dug in to narrowly save the show spot. RACK GIN was outrun early, advanced at the
quarter pole, angled out entering the stretch, rallied mildly outside and missed for third. REFUND RIGLER chased between rivals, raced three wide on the
turn and lacked a rally. PRIMORDIAL FEAR chased outside and failed to rally. THERISASTORMBREWIN raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and
did not factor. FOREST SURVIVOR steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the rail, steadied lacking room midway on the turn, then
faded. JUMP SHOT was outrun. EXTREME FORCE chased inside, chased on the turn and faded. SHACKLE CAT dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on
the turn and gave way.
