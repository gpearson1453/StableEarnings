Footnotes
NO COST raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from three wide at the three furlong marker, engaged the leader at the top of
the stretch and drew off. MONI DESIGN rushed to an early narrow lead around the first turn then edged away on the backstretch but was headed at the
eighth pole and was tiring in the stretch but held on for the place. PRINCESS FANNY raced off the pace around the first turn, made a mild bid on the
backstretch but lacked a late response and was empty in the stretch. DYLAN'S DREAM chased the leaders and failed to menace. TALL TALE was allowed
to settle near the back down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn but flattened out. JOVIE G raced near the back and was not a
factor. DON'T BE BOSSY prompted the pace around the first turn and faded. EASY BET was off slow then floated out going into the first turn and trailed the
field, distanced, walked off.

HULLINAHURRY raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three furlong marker and engaged the leader at the
quarter pole and took command at the top for the stretch by drawing off to prove best. ANGOLA VACATION was allowed to settle down the backstretch then
made a four wide bid on the final turn for the late rally but was no match for the winner. OUT MAKING TREBLE raced in the middle of the pack from
between horses into the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn, tipped back inside in the stretch for the late run but was outfinished.
PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER was forwardly placed around the first turn then moved up from three wide on the backstretch and engaged the leader near the
quarter pole but lacked the late response. LOVE A FIGHTER sprinted away from the gate to be within striking distance them made a bid at the three furlong
marker to engage the leader and took a brief lead at the quarter pole but was overtaken quickly and weakened. CLEVER PRINCE was allowed to settled
around the first turn the steadily advanced on the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GROSSE TETE IAN
raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground to no avail. SABERMAN was reluctant to load then prompted the pace to midway down the backstretch

showed no early speed and passed tiring rivals. SUMMER IS HOT raced near the back on the backstretch then moved up from four wide on the turn but
failed to menace. DEBBIES PASSAGE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside but was not a threat. STELLA'S SURPRISE was close up to the pace

RING TWICE raced off the pace from the inside to the turn then angled out to three wide on the turn and ran down the leader in the stretch to draw clear
late. LADY DREAMER trailed the field early then moved up from between horses at the three furlong marker, moved out to three wide at the quarter pole to
make a rally and finished strong. SHELLBY shared the command from the two path to the quarter pole then edged away to a clear lead at the top of the
stretch but was collared in the final yards and tired. CORA PEARL raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
made a late run to be the best of others. CANT ATTACK ARCH shared the command on the inside to the quarter pole but kept on to prompt the pace to the
top of the stretch and tired. CAJUN GUMBOW was always back. MISS JAMIE was reluctant to load then raced in the middle of the pack in the two path to
the turn and dropped back.
