Footnotes
RIVERSIDE forced the pace from outside, dueled while exchanging the lead a few times on the turn before taking command past the quarter pole while
drifting out about five to six wide into upper stretch, kicked away and held safe. PRAY FOR ME RAY settled outside rivals off the leading pair, was mostly
four wide through the turn coming out a bit for the drive, shifted inside a rival in upper stretch, ran on to be second best. MUSEUM QUALITY quickly moved
to the lead under mild urging from the start, set the pace racing well off the rail and shadowed by an outside foe, was prompted by that one late up the
backstretch and tussled for the lead exchanging it several times into and on the turn, could not keep pace past the quarter pole, switched out in upper
stretch and was no match for the winner. JR'S CONFIDENCE bumped a rival lightly at the start, chased from between foes but kept wide, went about three
to four wide on the turn, ran on but was not a threat. MICKEYS TRAIL lacked early speed racing off the inside, was never a threat. PASS IT AROUND was a
bit fractious in the gate, lightly bumped then urged from the start, chased from inside rivals, angled to the rail entering the turn, tired.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY EYES moved forward under coaxing from the start caught five then four wide on the first turn but forced out wider leaving that bend,
shadowed a foe up the backstretch racing very wide, drew even near th seven-sixteenths, dueled before moving clear coming to the five-sixteenths, was
challenged past the sixteenth pole, dueled late and dug in to just get the nod. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER exchanged a light bump early, settled off the pace
racing about four wide through the first turn, began to pick it up on the far turn still racing wide, took aim in the stretch and gained steadily under stout
urging, bid and put a short head in front seventy yards from home but was outfinished and lost the nod. KELL'S KISS unhurriedly brought up the rear racing
off the rail, swung ten deep into upper stretch, ran on for show. MIZZEN MILLIONS set the pace racing well off the rail and shadowed by an outside foe,
dueled with that one heading into the far turn, could not keep pace, moved out quite wide leaving the bend, tired in the stretch. CLAY'S OPAL INDY saved
ground on the first turn, switched out wide up the backstretch, failed to menace. RAISE OUR FLAG exchanged a light bump soon after the start, stalked the
leading pair from off the rail early, tired.

PRECIOUS PRIDE settled off the pace, began to pick it up on the turn, swung out about four deep on that bend then seven wide turning for home, took aim,
edged past late under steady handling. BIKINILESS was well-positioned early inside then in behind the pacesetter, stalked that one into the turn, moved
outside while floating five wide into upper stretch and taking the lead at that juncture, moved clear, was worn down and nailed late. THATGIRL'SONFIRE
was ridden along early, raced up close into the turn, was mostly three to five wide, got up for show. SHAME ON CHARLOTTE set the pace from off the rail,
moved nearer but still off the inside heading into the turn, drifted out turning into upper stretch and weakened. ANNIE GET UR GUNS exchanged a light
bump early, was shuffled back near the half, switched out, fanned about six wide needed more. CRYSTAL WHO exchanged a light bump early, chased
inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LA DIAMANT steadied at the start when in tight, settled at the back off the inside, began to pick it up entering the far turn, put to stout urging by the
five-sixteenths, fanned four to five wide into upper stretch, struck the lead and powered clear. ARTFUL ROSE stalked in behind racing mostly four to five
wide, took the lead in upper stretch but bore out badly to the outer rail through the lane, maintained the place. CATTY DOM settled off the pace near inside,
fanned five wide, kept on to get up for show. EVIL TEMPTATION shifted in while easing back off the leaders into the first turn racing in behind three to four
wide, was forced out heading up the backstretch, pursued four deep through the far turn, was outfinished for show honors. DOM PROUD was caught four to
five wide into the first turn but managed to shift in a bit, raced toward the back near inside on the far turn moving out three wide coming to the quarter pole,
was never near enough to threaten. JEDI JENNIE veered out at the start, set the early pace inside, dropped back into and on the far turn, was in tight racing
two wide lacking room behind runners past the quarter pole, altered out in upper stretch and kept on late. BERNICE WHO angled in early, saved ground on
the first turn, was guided out early up the backstretch, edged closer three wide on the far turn, failed to rally. MADDIE POPPE was bumped at the start,
moved forward outside three then two wide pressing through the first turn, took the lead at the three-quarters, moved clear to dictate terms, came up empty.

Footnotes
FARMER FRED R F broke a half-step slowly, settled at the back racing off the inside, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, rallied strongly to the lead a
sixteenth out and drew away. SMOKEN HOUDINI broke a step slowly, moved out on the first turn about four wide settling toward the rear, moved rapidly
four to five wide on the far turn taking the lead at the quarter pole, was overtaken at the sixteenth pole and second best. DAN WHO took back and angled in
early racing at the back near but off the fence, steadily advanced inside foes but off the rail into the far turn going three wide on that bend, continued inside
foes in the stretch and secured show honors. REBEL RYETTE bumped a rival at the start, stalked five to six wide early, moved clear near the
seven-sixteenths and shifted in a bit but still off the rail, was overtaken turning for home, switched outside the new leader in upper stretch and ran on.
QUINTON'S CHARMER settled off the pace, advanced outside five to six wide on the far turn, evened out in the drive. RARE COIN shifted in on the first
turn racing up close in behind the leaders about mid-pack mostly three to four wide, was one-paced. CHA CHING CHARLIE was kept wide setting the early
tempo racing well off the rail, came up empty. WILD FIREWATER was forwardly-positioned inside foes but off the fence, moved nearer the rail into the far
turn, dropped back abruptly about the three-eighths. STORMIN TEXASON was bumped at the start, caught wide entering the first turn before easing back
and shifting in, tracked in behind off the rail and close to the leaders, came up empty.

Footnotes
ONE MARK settled into stride off the pace, switched out heading into the turn, made a rapid advance past the three-eighths moving out from five to seven
wide with aim on the leaders fanning into upper stretch, engaged the leader past the eighth pole, dueled late and got the nod. LONZO WHO stalked from
outside, made a swift move past the seven-sixteenths taking the lead outside the three-eighths racing five to six deep, was engaged nearing late stretch and
outfinished. NO PASA NADA settled off the pace, moved out from four to eight wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch and was best of the rest. RISKY
REVENGE attended the pace three to four wide between foes, kept on but needed more. GO RED RASCAL attended the early pace from outside four to
five wide, had no extra. ANCIENT LAND settled off the pace, moved between foes at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. SWEET MONEY
set the early tempo facing pressure from outside foes racing off the fence, dropped back and came out, ran on. STORM LEADER prompted the pace two to
three wide between foes, weakened. SUNSCREEN steadied about the three-eighths, appeared to be getting out and hard to control through the turn.
