Footnotes
JOOBY DOOBY DOO took a quick lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and dug in under steady handling to hold off the stretch challenge of CURB THAT TIGER, who settled just off the pace and off the rail, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. ASTRAYAL stalked
off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, altered course from the heels of Jooby Dooby Do mid-stretch but
flattened stride later yards. BOP ZAPPER stalked inside through the front stretch and raced boxed in the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride at the rail on the far turn. I SEE NOTHING stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. Meetmarysman became fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
KAALA stalked inside the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and entered the far turn near the rail, was eased to the three path midway
through the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. YES TO LOVE stalked from the three path, challenged for the lead leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. VERY VENUS broke through the
gate prior the start, took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, contested at mostly even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch before relenting. MISS ARGENTINA
saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn outside and showed little more.
SPARKLEINYOUREYE raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, was
carried out leaving the turn and flattened stride. GHOST OF ALCINA saved ground well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
HOPPING HENRY gave chase through the backstretch, raced at a close disadvantage in the three path on the turn, took the nod entering the stretch, ran
clear a sixteenth away and held on. TIMMY gave chase well off the rail through the backstretch, entered the turn off the rail, angled to the five path toward
the top of the lane and dug in under steady handling to take second the final yards while gaining on the winner. GUN FACTOR accelerated to the lead
nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, drifted approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge at the rail on the turn but was met
entering the stretch and relented the final sixteenth. COLT ROCK gave early chase toward mid track, raced in range of the lead two deep on the turn, drifted
leaving the turn and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. JUBAY gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. JUBA
BOUND gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and ran evenly in the lane. SETTLEMENT DATE chased through the
backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. FOREVER TAKES TIME came away awkwardly, angled to the outside to give chase
and rounded the turn about the five path. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY pressured the pace two deep but steadied from tight quarters between horses in the vicinity
of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Hopping
Henry for alleged interference in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Bigz's Cabana Boy.

approaching the head of the lane, drifted leaving the turn and cleared second past the eighth pole. PASS THE CASH ducked out leaving the gate then
picked up the chase, raced in the four path on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. MIDCENTURY MODERN chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on
the turn, eased out entering the stretch and passed some rivals. NOBLE OBSESSION broke a step slow then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail but
showed little in the lane. EMPTY CHAIRS set a pressured pace through the backstretch but was met at the quarter pole, rounded the turn off the rail and
showed little in the lane. BELLAFLEET broke a step slow and saved ground. SHEZA GRITTY BITTY became anxious in the gate then broke a step slow

Footnotes
MARCUS JUNIUS settled off the pace about the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took over two deep entering the stretch, raced clear past
the eighth pole and drew off with only moderate urging. SARGENT KOBE stalked off the rail then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead
two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew briefly clear midway on the far turn but was met entering the stretch and relented leaving the eighth pole.
ONLY GET'N BETTER raced well off the pace about the five path, picked up the chase past the half mile pole and steadily gained, rounded the far turn in
the four path and could only improve his position. SCOTCH NO ROCKS settled well back from early contention while racing off the rail, eased out leaving
the second turn and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly. MOON SIGN rated the pace inside,
came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail toward the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened.
MISS YOU AJAX saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane.
TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS raced in the five and six paths on the first two turns and showed little response from the half mile pole. SEIZE THE BREEZE
raced in the five path the first turn, left the second turn outside and showed little response. OCEAN STORM rated just off the early pace in the three and four
paths, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE raced off the rail, gave chase past
the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn.
