Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONALIST set a well rated pace on a clear lead, widened the advantage in upper stretch and remained unchallenged to the wire as much best.
MISS LINDYSUE stalked the pace through the turn and rallied mildly to gain the place. BELLAVALENCIA prompted the early pace and kept on down the
lane. ONACOUNTA rated in mid-pack and failed to mount a closing rally having never menaced. IMA SURE BET slow early to trail the field and passed
tiring rivals in the stretch. ICEY ANGEL contended early while well placed on the outside and faded coming home. SURPRISED GEM was outrun.

Footnotes
FROSTY PAWS settled early to be near the rear of the field, circled nine wide while steadily advancing on the bend and wore the pacesetters down late in
the drive. MSHINDI stalked the pace into the turn, rallied on the bend to take command nearing the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch and was caught
by the closing winner in the final strides. CASH CUSTOMER broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, responded when challenged midway on the turn,
battled to deep stretch in a game effort that came up short. DOMI well placed tracking the pace to the head of the lane and lacked a closing response for the
drive. PRIVATE CONNIE went one-paced failing to threaten. DR. ROGER was not a factor. RIVER FULL chased the leaders for a half mile and faded in the
stretch.

Footnotes
LUCKY TUESDAY stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to take command at the top of the stretch, opened a clear lead and held well.
POLYESTER BRIDE broke a bit awkwardly to trail early, made a steady advance while angled eight wide turning for home and was gaining late in the
stretch. REMEMBEROLDTYMES set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and weakened through the lane. ROSY APPLE pressed the pace from the inside
to midway on the turn and lacked a response when called upon. ORBALINE went evenly failing to mount a closing rally. BLACK BUTTE unhurried for the
first half mile and made a mild rally in the stretch. O K BABY trailed early and passed tiring rivals down the lane. GRAND PRIZE was not a factor.
CROSSTOWN GIRL chased the leaders through the turn, gave way and was vanned off after crossing the wire

ENCHANTED MELODY bumped start, was unhurried early to be near the rear, circled wide turning for home and closed with a rush from the nine path to be
up in time. MISS SHADY stalked the pace through the turn, rallied four wide to take command in mid-stretch, opened a clear lead and was caught in the
shadow of the wire. BIG BANG BLUE set a pressured pace to the top of the lane and weakened late in the drive. C C'S WORLD tracked the leaders through
the turn from the inside, saved ground throughout and rallied mildly down the lane from the rail. VAVITE rated mid-pack down the backside, rallied on the
turn and failed to sustain the bid. MIMI'S HOLIDAY squeezed back at the start to trail and showed some late interest dwon the lane. CANTHO pressed the
pace to the head of the stretch and tired down the lane. JUMP INTO SANITY was never a threat. FALL CAMPAIGN chased the pace early and faded.
BEING CREATIVE bumped at the start, showed brief pace and dropped back as a non-factor.

LADY LOTTIE set a well rated ,well measured pace, responded when challenged turning for home and drew off through the lane as much best. LA V.
pressed the pace to the quarter pole, mounted a threatening bid at the head of the lane, could not match the winner and kept on willingly to be clearly
second best. RAINBOW SHIP stalked the pacesetters throughout and failed to close the gap. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE failed to menace. CAUSE OF LOVE

CIRO THE BOSS tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied four wide to take control turning for home and drew off as much best. C V JERSEY BEE set a
pressured pace from the inside to the quarter pole and kept on down the lane to hold the place. MR. BALI slow early to be the distant trailer and closed well
in the lane with a strong belated rally to just miss the place. I STRONG contended while chasing the leaders from four wide though the turn and failed to
gain ground in the stretch. YIPPEE KI YAY stalked the pacesetters to upper stretch and weakened. CONSTITUTION COAL well placed in striking distance
to the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. FAST CLIP broke sharply to set the early pace, took a bad step nearing the half mile pole, suffered a
catastrophic injury, was euthanized and vanned off.
