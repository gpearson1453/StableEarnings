Footnotes
ANDERS SMILE prompted three to two wide, bumped an inner rival approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, vied two wide around the far turn, cleared
nearing the lane and held from an outer bidder in the late stages. INFINITESIMAL nudged the gate upon leaving it, pulled two wide and between horses
around the first turn to press between the top pair entering the backstretch, was bumped by his outer counterpart into the inner leader approaching the
eleven sixteenths pole, chased along the inside soon after, shifted to the three to four path around the far turn, yet ran on in pursuit of the clear leader in
upper stretch, ranged up to attempt a late bid but needed more. AMERICAN DOLLARS leaned out and bumped a foe at the start, pursued from midpack in
the three path, shfited to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on. STARPORT set the pace inside of a prompting foe, vied with that one around the far
turn and yielded nearing the lane. DOUBLE ON THE RED saved ground at the rear and moved up. MARVINS' POSSE bobbled a bit at the start, stalked in
the four to three path, but faded in the four to five path around the far turn. COCAL tracked along the inside, took back while getting surpassed by an outer
tugging foe nearing the backstretch, then lacked a response to urging in the three path around the far turn. CROSSING IRIS was off a step slow and took
contact from an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to five path and failed to factor. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT broke a bit outwardly, laid off
of the pace in the four path and tired around the far turn.

Footnotes
G'WILDCAT vied outside early on, cleared crossing over to the two path into the turn, opened up further in upper stretch and was driven home. BINDING
AGREEMENT laid off of the pace along the inside while a bit keen, shifted out while inside of a foe turning for home, brushed that one tipping to the five
path in upper stretch, then stayed on to edge place passing the furlong pole. PINCH ME A PENNY raced at the rear two wide, got floated to the five path by
an inner rival turning for home before being brushed to the six path by that one in upper stretch, yet ran on in the stages to narrowly reach show. EL DEAL
ME ACES vied inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace into the turn, chased before yielding through the lane and missed show. RELENTLESS
DANCER laid off of the pace in the four path, advanced into the turn to gain place passing the three furlong pole, took aim on the clear leader turning for
home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and gave way. HOORAY AUSTIN stalked forwardly in the three path, chased between horses at the three
furlong pole and faded. TWO B stalked in the two path whlie in the bit, but failed to split foes through a narrow seam passing the three furlong pole, was
shuffled to the rear turning for home, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
ARMY DAY showed the way in the two path, kicked away entering the lane and held safely. STEPHANIE'S MARIA bumped with an outer rival at the start,
rated off of the pace along the inside, tipped off the fence entering the lane, shifted outside of rivals approaching midstretch, then offered a belated kick but
ran out of ground to threaten the leader. TENSAS LUCY bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in the two path, tipped to the five path entering the lane,
rallied and gained place while shifting inwardly in midstretch, but flattened out and was caught late. LIL CHILLY took contact from an inner foe at the start,
pressed three wide, then outside of the leader from the three path around the turn, failed to keep pace with that one while hanging on her left lead in the four
path in upper stretch, yet kept on along with an outer bidder into midstretch, but changed leads at the furlong grounds and tired. ABOUT TO SET SAIL
settled off of the pace along the inside, bore slightly losing ground entering the turn before settling in the three path, then sustained stride to improve
between horses. CAIRO CHARM bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack while hung in the five path and failed to factor. SACRED SAINT
tracked in the four path and lacked a bid between horses. CHAPELLETE broke outwardly, lacked speed in the two path around the turn and failed to factor.
IN B. J.'S HONOR broke very slowly then was outrun in the four path. OUR MAGIC PRINCESS chased along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
OFFICER QUIGLEY stalked the top pair from the three path, bid outside of them in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, inched clear
and held sway. CAMP DADDY fidgeted just before the gates opened causing him to be briefly held by his assistant starter once they sprung, broke multiple
lengths behind the rest in the process, trailed along the inside, picked up stride turning for home, swung four wide in upper stretch and sustained a rally to
gain place at the wire. CASH FEVER set the pace inside of a vying rival, sparred with that one around the turn, got headed turning for home, yet fought back
to reclaim an advantage in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer bidder leaving the furlong grounds, yielded grudgingly late and got nailed for place.
SHOWDOWN KING chased in the four path and kept on under mild urging through the final furlong. CAPTIVATED DRAMA broke outwardly, pressed two
wide, vied around the turn, led narrowly turning for home, but weakened between horses in upper stretch while delaying changing leads.
STARTONAHIGHNOTE pursued from the five path and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START, CAMP DADDY WAS
DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
CHARGING set the pace along the inside, inched away from pressing pursuers leaving the quarter pole and held firm with good energy. DOWAGIAC CHIEF
stalked along the inside, then chased well to prove second best. CHISELER stalked two wide, then chased evenly through the lane and held show while
hanging on his left lead. CREW DRAGON hopped leaving the gates, then was bobbled while taking contact from an outer foe at the start, trailed along the
inside, gained entering the lane, shifted four wide in midstretch and ran on to reach fourth at the wire. INTO THE SUNRISE bumped an inner rival at the
start, raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, bid for show in the final furlong, but was turned away and got nailed at
the wire for fourth. B D VALESKI brushed the gate upon leaving it, laid off of the pace in the three to four path and failed to menace. SHIP IT RED pursued
from midpack two wide and between horses and failed to factor. JUST SAY WHEN broke a beat slow, tracked three wide, but floated to the five path
entering the lane and faded.

IMPEL stalked three wide while perched outside of the top pair, ranged up to bid in hand turning for home, led from an inner rival before being set down in
upper stretch, drove clear entering the final furlong and was put to hand with a sixteenth to go. TIPSY TAMMY vied two wide, dueled with an outer bidder
entering the lane, but was headed passing the quarter pole, failed to keep pace entering the final furlong while well clear of the rest and was second best.
CASBY trailed along the inside, then improved position by splitting tiring rivals in the final furlong. SWEET CHARLIZE laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses, shifted out to the four then five path in upper stretch and moved up. MT. MASADA chased in the two to three path, then in the four path in
upper stretch and faded. WHO'S TICKET chased along the inside then gave way around the turn. LUCKY SPEECH broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in
the three to four path, floated to the five then six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. GOLDEN DEGREE vied along the inside, but yielded to an outer
pair turning for home and folded.

Footnotes
SULTRY LASS tracked along the inside before shifting two wide around the first turn, chased the embattled leading pair from the three path around the far
turn, sustained a grinding charge to bid entering the final sixteenth and edged past. THESTRAL stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, vied in
the two path around the far turn, gained an advantage in upper stretch but was caught by an outer bidder passing the sixteenth pole. BELLA PALOMA
settled off of the pace along the inside, pursued in the three to four path around the far turn, shifted inwardly in midstretch and chased evenly. SURELY
SHIRLEY trailed, took the far turn in the three path and rallied between horses. THEROANRUNNER set a clear pace in the two path, vied with an outer
bidder around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong. SOUPER EXPLOSIVE laid off of the pace in the three to four path
and failed to factor. HUNTLEIGH tracked two wide before tucking to the inside around the first turn, chased into the far turn and gave way. LADY
MERCEDES never got involved two wide. DRE ME LESS pursued from the four path and was done early then eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HECKLED steadied behind rivals while settling into a midpack position along the inside into the first turn, tossed her head while a bit keen nearing the
backstretch, tracked in the two path around the far turn, tipped to take aim in the four path entering the lane, loomed boldly while ranging up to bid in hand in
upper stretch, kicked away once set down nearing the final furlong and opened up. SRI LANKA broke a step slow, settled well back in the two path, saved
ground around the far turn, picked up stride tipping to the three path entering the lane, altered course outside of rivals and to the five path in upper stretch,
rallied to gain place passing the furlong pole and held it from an inner pursuer. VIOLET FLAME bobbled a bit leaving the gates, lacked speed along the
inside, gained shifting off the inside in upper stretch, then stayed on between horses to edge show late. NOBLE BERNADETTE laid off of the pace in the
three path, then in the four path and between horses around the far turn, spun to the five path entering the lane and ran on between horses. MS. LILIBET
stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path entering upper stretch, chased among foes while vying for minor placings and lost show late. BAG LADY
stuttered a step at the start, trailed two wide, advanced in the five to six path and outside of rivals turning for home, then leveled off. MON DIEU set the pace
along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch and gave way. UPSWELL pressed two wide, bid entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer
challenger in upper stretch and faded between horses. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) pursued from midpack in the four to three path but faded between
horses turning for home. ART DECO stalked three wide but faltered between horses in upper stretch. IRISH MOLLY made little impact from the four to five
path. YELLOW TOPAZ pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but was through entering the far turn.
