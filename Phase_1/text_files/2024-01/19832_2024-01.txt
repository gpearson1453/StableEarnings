Footnotes
MISTER MOBIL broke alertly, settled to track leaders, rallied three wide on the turn to engage the leader nearing the quarter pole, dueled through the lane
and wore the pacesetter down to be going away late. WEEKEND BUZZ set a well rated pace, responded when engaged midway on the turn, battled down
the stretch and finished second best unable to hold off the winner. MARVIN'S EXPRESS unhurried early to be off the pace, made a steady advance from
between rivals and finished willingly. STONE COLD CAT trailed to the top of the lane and passed weaker rivals in the lane with a mild bid. SURROUNDER
well placed throughout, made a bid in upper stretch and flattened out. PRIMITIVO stalked the pace to the head of the lane and lacked a closing response.
BABA LOOEY chased the early pace to press and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
MAYITO stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, engaged that one from five wide at the top of the lane, dueled through the stretch and prevailed late in the
drive. DIXIE GIANT set a well rated pace through the far turn, responded when challenged turning for home, battled gamely through the lane and was
out-finished in deep stretch while clearly second best. SWELTER reserved off the pace for the first half mile, rallied up the inside saving ground through the
turn and could not gain on the leaders in the stretch. VAIL OF HONOR trailed to head of the stretch and passed weakened rivals. RUBINSTEIN rallied down
the backside with an early bid and flattened out on the far turn. KING SOCIAL rated in mid-pack and lacked a closing response. ALEXIS N NIKO contended
early and dropped back coming up empty.

Footnotes
BISCUITS AND GRITS broke inward crowding rivals to his inside, took command from six wide on a well reserved pace, opened a clear advantage turning
for home and drew off as much best. MUTINY crowded at the start between rivals, raced up to stalk the pace from four wide, angled in entering the turn
causing OHIO PLAYER to steady, chased the winner down the lane and kept on to pick up the place. THE MAN CAN prompted the early pace from the rail,
lost position on the turn and mounted a mild bid in the lane for the show. TIZ A RUSH unhurried early to trail the filed and mounted a belated rally in the
stretch. ATTACK ANGLE crowded between horses leaving the gate, rated in mid-pack just off the leaders into the turn and finished evenly. ACCURATE
crowded at the start, chased the leaders from five wide into the turn and faded coming home. OHIO PLAYER broke outward crowding rivals from the gate,
raced three wide stalking the pace to the turn, steadied between rivals into the bend when squeezed by MUTINY, dropped back briefly, made a bold bid on
the turn to threaten at the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. THE STEWARD POSTED AN INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN ON THE TURN AND
THE RIDER OF ATTACK ANGLE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE, UPON REVIEW THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
NOT TODAY stalked the pace into the turn, rallied four wide on the turn to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and drew away to the wire. MALI BALI
tracked the leaders through the turn and finished willingly with a steady gain to be second best. LUNA PRIMAVERA set the pace on a clear lead to upper
stretch and weakened down the lane. BROADWAY CHARM trailed the field to the head of the quarter pole and passed weaker rivals in the lane with a
belated rally. SISTER CODE went evenly failing to mount a rally. I GOT ANALYZED failed to menace. MY JENNY prompted the pace to midway on the turn
and faded. STRIKING MELODY was never a threat.

Footnotes
HOTROD BOBBY set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and held the closers safe. WHISKEY HELPS slow
early to be at the rear of the field, circled the field turning for home from well wide and closed well with a belated rally. HARSH TRUTH unhurried in the early
going and closed willingly in the stretch to be gaining on the leader and just miss the place. PLAYING BALL pressed the pace throughout and flattened out
in the stretch. NOSEY POWER bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced mid-pack and failed to menace after put to a drive in the turn. KING PATRIOT made
a mild mid-race bid along the fence and failed to sustain the rally. HAPPY TAKEOVER well placed while parked wide on the turn and failed to respond when
called upon for the drive. TAMMY'S TOY showed brief speed to be prominent and was through early.

ROSE'S PEPINO slow early to be at the rear of the field, gained ground on the final turn, circled nine wide and closed well to be going away in deep stretch.
HUNTER SCOTT settled to stalk the pace down the backside, rallied to the lead in upper stretch and kept on well in the lane. BIG TRUCK unhurried for the
first half mile, rallied from the inside cutting the corner and made a late gain to garner the show. CONFESSOR rated in mid-pack to the far turn, rallied
splitting horses turning for home to be prominent and lacked a late bid. TEST PILOT made a bold move from between horses on the turn to threaten at the
quarter pole and flattened out late in the drive. STAR HAWK reserved early in hand, contended from wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. SO
DIALED IN stalked the pace around the first turn, took command from three wide down the backside and gave way turning for home. THRU THE VINE
raced wide being floated out on the first turn, made a four wide bid on the final bend and faded. BREEZY MONEY dueled from the rail on the lead for the
first half mile and was through early.

OUT FOR FUN unhurried in the early going, commenced a five wide sustained rally on the turn to be up in final strides. ANGEL WINGS stalked the pace to
the turn, rallied three wide to engage the leader turning for home, took the lead inside the eighth pole and was caught in deep stretch. MERE BAG OF
SHELLS set a pressured pace throughout, was collared in mid-stretch and weakened late in the lane. TRULY INCLUSIVE chased the leaders from three
wide through the turn and failed to mount a closing rally. LADY FORTUNE mounted an early bid up the rail into the turn and failed to sustain the rally.
WILLIAMSBEACHBABE failed to menace. WEEKENDING was never a threat giving way early.

Footnotes
AURA OF GOLD slow early to trail, swung eight wide turning for home and closed with a rush to be going away at the wire. MEADOW VALUE reserved off
the pace to the turn, made a steady advance under a long drive to take the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was caught in deep stretch. PLAIN OR
PEANUT unhurried early, rallied turning for home from between rivals finding best stride late and gained positions through the lane. POKER PARTNER well
placed tracking the leaders, rallied on the turn to take command leaving the quarter pole and was out-finished in the stretch. GOLDEN ARM flashed speed
from the fence in the early going and dropped back as no threat. SIR MASON tracked the pace through the turn racing six wide, rallied turning for home to
take a lead in mid-stretch and flattened out late in the drive. EL CUERVO FELIS pressed the pace to loom boldly at the quarter pole and gave way through
the stretch.
