start, chased out of range well off the inside, advanced five then four wide on the turn but was outfinished for the place honors. KING ZOG settled off the
pace, went two wide around the bend and looked to rally but lacked room when boxed in from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, moved out into the
clear but could not summon a late response. BLUEGRASS RYDER dropped back when rank and drifted out early, trailed six then five wide on the turn and
passed tired rivals in the stretch. STREETLIGHT PEOPLE chased along the inside, moved out in upper stretch and weakened. UNUSUAL WIN closest in

BANDWAGON had to steady briefly when shuffled behind a rival early, traveled in the two path towards the rear on the first turn, moved into range in the
middle stages, roused three then two wide on the turn, got floated out by the leader in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole and edged away.
BRITISH ISLES reserved in the early stages and moved inside, eased out to the three path on the far turn, steered back inward while unleashing a late run
and got up for second. MESSAGE OF HOPE (IRE) reserved two wide, drew closer up the backstretch, bid three deep at the three eighths pole, cleared at
the quarter pole, drifted out when confronted by BANDWAGON in upper stretch, lost command after crossing the eighth pole and got edged for second.
SHOT OF COURAGE settled along the inside, moved into range on the backstretch, got crowded a bit between rivals at the quarter pole, chased two wide
into the lane and weakened. LAKE SUPERIOR dueled for the lead from outside, fought between rivals briefly on the second bend, could not kick on with the
new leader approaching the quarter pole, tired and eased in the lane and walked off. LEADING dueled inside LAKE SUPERIOR, dropped back on the far

HEY BROTHER brushed with outer rival at the start, chased along the rail into the turn, tipped out and spun three wide into the stretch, challenged the top
pair from outside with a furlong remaining, cleared midstretch and lasted over the late run from the runner-up. VEGAS BURNER stumbled sharply then
climbed a bit when hit with the kickback, trailed two wide into the turn, made progress around the bend, chased three wide into the drive, angled out and
came with a late run in deep stretch but ran out of time. APPRECIATE TODAY stalked the dueling pair up the backstretch, bid three then two wide with a
quarter mile left to run, gain a short advantage in upper stretch, relinquished the lead past the eighth pole and flattened to third. PROSPER dueled outside
DON CORLEONE to the turn, put away that rival past the five-sixteenths marker and moved inside, quickly confronted by APPRECIATE TODAY, lost
command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. DON CORLEONE dueled inside PROSPER, chased after that rival past the five-sixteenths
pole and weakened. SNEAKING CANDY broke in and brushed rival, climbed briefly when DON CORLEONE cut in front, chased four wide into the turn, five
wide exiting the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
SOL DEL SUR raced up close from inside, challenged from the rail at the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole, then kicked
clear in the final sixteenth. HANDR'SDREAM set the pace off the inside while under pressure from MITICO, cleared that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, met
the challenge from SOL DEL SUR at the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch, yielded to the winner midstretch and stayed on to secure second. MITICO
prompted the pace from outside to the turn, lost touch with inner rivals midway around the bend, spun three wide into the drive and kept on for third.
PACO'S PICO forwardly placed up the backstretch, chased four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, tipped back out into the lane
and lacked a rally. AFTERNOON HEAT settled off the pace, moved inward and went three wide into the turn, exited the bend two wide and lacked a rally in
the final furlong. WHOA BUDDY chased along the inside then steered off the fence, rounded the bend five then four wide and failed to respond. HIGH
PRESS reserved in the early going, went four, five, then six wide on the turn and could not make an impact. SUMMER SHANDEE lacked early speed,
chased five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path then entered the lane three wide and proved no menace. ANYOTHERQUESTIONS broke a bit
slow, trailed on the inside through the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LINDA'S GIFT brushed with inner rival at the start, chased three wide into the first turn, moved up outside the top pair then cleared around the bend, steered
to the inside first time through the stretch, showed the way up the backstretch, remained confidently ridden on the far turn, asked right handed three times in
the final furlong and held safely. MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and traveled three deep into the first turn, angled over to the inside
first time through the stretch, tipped out exiting the final turn, finished willingly down the lane but could not reach the winner. DUVET DAY (IRE) brushed with
the winner at the start, raced between rivals at the back into the first turn then chased two wide, spun four wide into the stretch, kept on from the middle
portion of the lane and gained the show. LAKOTA SPIRIT settled off the pace on the inside, continued towards the rear into the far turn, saved ground to the
stretch and got outkicked for third. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) showed early speed then ceded command around the first turn, closest in pursuit from inside in
the early stages, shifted off the fence and took aim in the two path around the final turn but weakened down the lane. ROSE BARTON (IRE) pressed from
outside briefly then stalked from the two path, remained two wide to the far turn, entered the stretch three wide and weakened. YARBOROUGH raced at the
back along the fence, went outside a rival leaving the backstretch, ridden along two wide into the lane and proved no menace.

Footnotes
SIMPLY ENCHANTING stalked off the inside, bid from outside past the seven-sixteenths pole, shifted in and bumped MS BO J in upper stretch, took a
narrow lead at the eighth pole and edged away. BONAQUA sat off the pace early, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the
stretch, finished well and got up for second. MS BO J took control early and set the pace up the backstretch, moved inside for the turn, met the challenge
from SIMPLY ENCHANTING around the bend, carried a short lead into the lane, took a bump in upper stretch, fought gamely into deep stretch and yielded
grudgingly late. MO PEARLS PLEASE raced in range two wide leaving the backstretch, had to check past the seven-sixteenths pole, continued two wide
into the lane and kept on for a minor award. VEGAS CONDO tracked outside a rival then three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and lacked a
bid. TAHINI raced up close on the inside, tipped out with a quarter mile remaining and lacked further response. SHOW CARD threw her head, hopped and
hit the gate in the beginning, lagged behind up the backstretch, trailed two to three wide into the lane and was not a factor. TIANMA brushed the gate and
bobble slightly, hustled early chasing from inside out of range, cut the corner into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
KHINJANI (GB) hit the gate to lose a step at the start, tucked inside at the back, went inside rivals at the half-mile pole, had to wait for room racing on the
fence through the final bend, gained an opening then split foes outside the eighth pole and surged clear under hand urging. VINCERO GRANDE traveled off
the rail into the stretch for the first time then settled outside a rival, drew closer two then three wide on the far turn, moved out and launched a bid in upper
stretch and gained second. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) closest in pursuit in the early going, moved into range leaving the backstretch, drew closer around the
far turn and challenged from outside approaching the lane, took over in upper stretch, failed to offer any resistance to the winner midstretch and flattened to
third. THIRTY CARATS stumbled leaving the gate, chased five wide into the lane for the first time then chased near the back outside a rival, rounded the far
turn two then three wide, moved out in the lane and improved position. MILAGRE DO SOL settled two wide then steered over to the rail, asked around the
far turn, moved out in upper stretch and flattened. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER cleared and opened up a comfortable lead early, carried a diminishing lead
through the far turn and was challenged from outside exiting that bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened. ETHERIC sat off the pace on
the inside, moved out to the two path on the backstretch, trailed into and around the far turn and failed to make an impact.
