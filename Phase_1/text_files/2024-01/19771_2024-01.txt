Footnotes
BOYNE VALLEY had an alert start with good speed to take over while well handled throughout to prove much the best. JUST LIKE YOU had a tardy start
from the gate, raced far back to stretch with a late run for place while match for winner. NEXT DOT had an inside run to chase to pair to the stretch and had
to settle for show spot. TAMBARELLA never far back to turn, scrubbed on into the turn with nothing left into stretch, no response. OUTRAGEOUSLY off rail
run to quarter pole chasing winner faltered in stretch. LIPSTICK N LASHES was antsy in the gate, tried to keep up outside while evenly to turn and empty in
the stretch run. AKARI never factored throughout. TIZ JOSEPHINE had no speed while never a menace throughout. LANDY tried to keep up for a half with
nothing left in the drive and faded back readily in the stretch.

Footnotes
STUPENDOUS had an inside duel to the half while well handled, responded into the far turn to clear off into the stretch under good handling to the wire.
TOP HAT TIGRESS saved ground throughout with a solid run for the place spot while no match in the final furlong. CAPTIVE STAR well placed never far
back to far turn, chased stretch held 3rd. ENGLISH CHARM unhurried to far turn with mild improvement in the stretch run. PINK ROBE good position to far
turn, angled out with little impact stretch. CASINO ANNIE no speed to far turn while never a real menace throughout. ALTER THE STARS always back with
no run from quarter pole to the wire. TEXAS PRINCESS failed to seriously factor throughout. BACK UP GHOST had no speed from gate trailed to the half
and never factored. DELOVELY inside run into first turn, could not keep up, stopped far turn. HONEYTOWN dueled in the two path for a half and gave in
readily from there. LEA ANN'S PRINCESS tracked top pair to the half with nothing left and stopped badly.

CUT GLASS had speed to the front while well handled throughout, stayed well clear into the stretch to hold sway to the wire. JARETH raced three wide to
the turn, took up chase into the stretch to no avail while best of the rest. BOISE raced between horses to the turn, came outside into stretch for the show
spot. HAIG POINT lost best chance at the start, kept on from the turn to improve mildly. MILITARY DRILL had no speed to the stretch with no late kick when
needed. INDEFATIGABLE chased to the turn from inside to the stretch but gave in and faded back readily.
