deep stretch and just lasted under left handed urging. CURIOSITY KILLS close up from the start, moved closer two wide into the stretch, bumped with

two wide, was carried out to the nine path through deep stretch and faded in the final stages. TATTERED HEART drifted out at the start, improved position

late. MY HOMBRE allowed to settle, had a mild rally in the six path through the stretch and finished well clear for second. FORMYBOYS chased the winner
three wide into the stretch then faded. SOL OF VAQUERO saved ground and went evenly. WHY KENNY WHY close up four then three wide, failed to offer
the needed response. DREAMINGABOUTTIME trailed.

Footnotes
CEVICHE always within striking distance, began to rally in upper stretch in the four path, shifted inside to leader as that one drifted inward slightly to the two
path nearing the sixteenth pole, made the lead soon thereafter and finished full of run to win going away under a hand ride. SIERRA DIAMOND away alertly,
set a pressured pace near the inside, drifted to the four path at the top of the stretch, drifted in to the three path nearing the sixteenth marker then was no
match for the winner. JOYFUL NOISE trailed into the stretch, swung outside at the top of the stretch and closed a gap late. JILL BABE pressed the pace two
wide into the turn, dropped back a bit, came on again in upper stretch, shifted inside the leader to the three path before the furlong maker, was shut off near
the sixteenth pole causing her rider to check and lost momentum. NO MORE MASK broke outward bumping VACATION SECRET at the start then failed to
menace. VACATION SECRET was bumped at the start, prompted the pace three wide into the stretch and weakened late. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF JILL BABE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CEVICHE AND PLACED HER FOURTH.

IT'S OFFICIAL stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied three wide to draw on even terms for the lead on the turn, battled the balance of the trip and
proved best in a stretch long drive under left handed urging. DARK VADER never far back, loomed four then three then two wide into the stretch, matched
strides through the final furlong but was denied. VISUAL MISSION unhurried early, had a mild late rally five wide. RUMBLE STRIP RON failed to menace.
LUCKY STREAK close up from the start, offered a mild bid along the inside on the turn then came up empty. OAKS HONEY was no factor. SIMON SAYS
broke in front, battled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch, altered course to the five path at the top of the lane then folded. GIV'EM THE BIZ
contested the lead two wide then along the inside into the stretch then gave way.

right handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker and drew off late under brisk handling. CHANEL SPIRIT stalked the early pace, rallied three
wide to make the lead entering the far turn, dropped inside, battled with the winner until deep stretch and finished second best. BETTER HALF away alertly,
jumped while setting the pace midway on the clubhouse turn, maintained her advantage along the inside for nearly a half and was outfinished. EMERSON
JONES bobbled outward at the start, prompted the early pace two wide, made the lead before a half, kept on into the far turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, was put to left handed urging nearing the furlong marker, rallied to make the lead late
and won under a hand ride. OVER THE HILLS away alertly, set the pace while getting quick fractions until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
FROG TOWN allowed to settle, found his best stride late five wide. MOESTER trailed down the backstretch, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch
then leveled off. RED HURRICANE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and weakened late.
