Footnotes
THIRTEEN RED FLAGS three wide in aim of the leader, advanced on that rival tucked to the two path through the turn to get on near even terms inside the
five-sixteenths, took over command near the quarter pole and floated out four wide into upper stretch carrying CITY BLOCKS five wide, dug in under a left
handed crop and shied out near the three-sixteenths forcing the nearly latched on CITY BLOCKS to alter outwards, edged away under a drive shying once
more midway between the eighth and sixteenth pole when once more placed to a left side crop and held clear kept to task. CITY BLOCKS chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got carried out slightly five wide into upper stretch as THIRTEEN RED FLAGS drifted out slightly, dug
in and was nearly latched on that leader when forced to alter out when that rival shied out at the three-sixteenths, then kept on to chase the winner home
while well clear of the rest. BROOKLYN DANTZ coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair.
FABULOUS FOX coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure to the outside midway on the turn and got placed to
coaxing in response at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. HANNAH GOOD chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. DELL ARTE bobbled at the break,
chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
BAD LARRY angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well
when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging. YOUBETTERBEJOKING showed speed then moved outside of the leader,
chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead when
switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and was second best. FLASHY ALEX dropped back under urging, angled from the three path to
the five path on the turn and lacked the needed response while along for the show. BRENNAN'S WAR tracked the pace on the outside then in the four path
on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and came up empty. SCOTTO dropped back while hard ridden, raced inside
to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and was no factor. ARREBATO was ridden along well off the pace, went around the turn in the
two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TATER AND TOT chased the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn and retreated.

LUCENCY tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the four path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, shook
clear into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead late and proved best under steady handling. HERO'S MEDAL came inward at the start then
bumped soundly with an opponent, moved up to stalk the pace, shifted out outside the five-eighths pole, made a bid at the nine-sixteenths, took a short lead
in the three path early on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and was outfinished while well clear for the place. BOLT D'PLATA

the rail on the turn, responded well when asked nearing the quarter-pole, came out while shaking clear under a right-handed crop outside the furlong
marker, was given one pop of a left-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole then placed under a strong hand-ride to the finish while best. PASCHAL MOON was
well placed just off the pace, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging, chased while shifting from the two path to the four path on the turn, pursued the
winner in the stretch, raced between horses in the final sixteenth and narrowly earned the place. FLYING IN STYLE was coxed along off the pace, came
under stronger encouragement in the four then five path on the turn and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show.
SCHERZANDO bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, moved in near the furlong marker and also finished
willingly but just missed the show. FLIP'S DREAM lost his footing at the start and was off a step slow, angled out then moved up to track the pace on the
outside, made a bid near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn and tired. CAPTAIN PARTY bumped with an opponent at the start, settled
towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE broke out and bumped with a rival, was hustled to show speed on
the inside, dropped back while crowded along the rail near the eleven-sixteenths, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased while moving from
inside to the two path on the turn, had the rider lose his crop inside the five-sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
COMPARATIVE raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead briefly early on the far turn then lost the advantage to
the runner-up, was roused just inside the three-eighths pole, dueled gamely inside of the runner-up in the stretch, gained the advantage in the final sixteenth
and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. SADDLE UP JESSIE traveled around the first turn in the four path, was rated while tracking the pace on the
outside, gained to make a bid leaving the backstretch, took a short lead in the three path outside the three-eighths pole, was asked for her best in upper
stretch, dueled outside of the winner, led until the sixteenth-pole then was headed, fought on to the finish and just missed while well clear for the place.
EVIDENCIAS (BRZ) saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, shifted from the rail to the four path on the far
turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY was hustled from the gate, rounded the opening bend in the two path,
was well placed just off the pace, went two then three wide under urging on the final turn and came up empty. SHE'S MO BUBBLY was hustled to the front,
went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead while inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path
and faded. RAYYA VALENTINE was taken up while tossing her head early on the first turn, moved from the three path to the five path on that bend, settled
near the back, dropped back on the far turn and faltered.

and was collared near the sixteenth marker, kept on to preserve the show honors. HIGH HEAT chased just off the inside under coaxing from the

coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. HEIR PORT chased along the inside coming under coaxing
