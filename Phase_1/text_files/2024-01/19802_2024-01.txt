TRUE SPUN set the pace in the two path, drew off around the turn and held clear under confident handling. DERBY HANGOVER raced off the pace two
wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to narrow the gap. BOOT'S ON THE MOON raced off the pace two wide and was along for
the show. THEFORCEBEWITHYOU saved ground and failed to menace. DARLING DARLEY played no factor while racing three wide. GLITTER BOMB
pressed the winner down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and faltered. LADY OAKRIDGE
trailed inside.

Footnotes
ECHO LANE stalked in the three path, was roused along the inside passing the three-eighths, bid in the three path turning into the stretch, drew past an
outer foe nearing the eighth pole, and drew clear. WHITING FIELD set the pace in the two path, was coaxed early around the far turn, floated out to the six
path turning into the lane, lost the lead before the eighth pole, but held on to place. POLIGLOTA got a bit rank at the start and broke slowly, chased in the
five path, bid from the four path into the far turn, floated out to the eight path entering the stretch, but evened out for show. JOE FROM KIEV tracked in the
two path, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, but flattened from the three path in the stretch. PRAISEWORTHY raced off the pace in the three
path, swung out to the six path while under a drive turning into the lane, but weakened. BAD HOMBRE rated in the four path, was driven three wide around
the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but was tired. PASSAGE was hustled along from in range in the four path, coaxed between
foes into the far turn, had to steady turning into the lane, but was no menace. CARNIVAL DANCER laid up close in the four path down the backstretch, but
gaveway between foes around the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY EMILY KATHRYN set the pace in the two path, lost the lead going into the far turn, was cued midway around the far turn, retook the lead passing the
quarter, and dug in from the two path in the stretch to hold sway. LADY ASTORIA hopped at the start, prompted the pace in the five path, was roused to bid
passing the three-eighths, swung from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. JOHANNY raced off the pace in the two path, was cued along the
rail midway around the far turn, kept on along the inside into the stretch, but was stymied passing the eighth pole, tipped out to the three path, but bumped
with an outer foe late to finish with show. SELF CONFIDENT pressed in the four path, took the lead and was cued from the three path passing the
three-eighths, lost the lead passing the quarter, floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, but bumped with an inner foe around the sixteenth and
steadied late. PEACE CRUISER was unhurried in the five path, cued while three wide into the far turn, angled out to the six path going into the stretch, but
made no impact. LA FANTASMA tracked in the four path, was coaxed between foes from the two path into the far turn, but was empty entering the stretch.
ASTRILA steadied along the inside around the first turn, stalked in the three path, but retreated between foes around the far turn.

Footnotes
DEMURELY settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped three wide turning for home, bid between foes in midstretch, took the lead near the sixteenth
pole and inched ahead under left-handed urging. FEDALIA saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch, angled six wide near the eighth
pole, continued on the left lead, closed widest and just missed. ALA TURKA raced four wide in midpack early, bid outside of the winner in midstretch and
was outfinished between foes. AMERICAN GAMBLE raced off the pace two wide and improved position in the lane. L. E. GRAY checked not long after the
start, raced well back three wide and rallied belatedly. BARBARA was in range inside early, steadied entering the turn, re-bid inside in upper stretch and
steadied off heels in midstretch. RUNAWAY BREEZE was bumped after the start, raced four wide and never threatened. TEMERITY was bumped after the
start, raced three wide and made little impact. WHEELINGNDEALING was bumped between foes after the start, raced five wide and played no factor.
ABOVE PAR set the pace along the rail, led past the eighth pole and tired. SIX FEET APART prompted the pace two wide, steadied while getting in in
midstretch and faltered. TALK MUCH chased the pace three wide and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
TRIPLE ESPRESSO settled off the pace while racing two wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was drew clear under left-handed
urging. ARTEMPUS prompted the pace two wide, took the lead between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole, edged ahead in upper stretch, could not hold
off the winner but held well to save the place. WHITE PALOMINO saved ground in range, launched a three wide bid rounding the far turn, came in in
midstretch and bumped foes and kept on to regain the show. BLACK DIAMOND broke outwardly and slowly, raced off the pace two and three wide, rallied
between foes in upper stretch, was bumped near the eighth pole and just missed third. MODICA rushed up inside nearing the first turn and checked off
heels, saved ground in midpack for a half, angled out to advance three wide around the far turn, shifted wider in upper stretch an lacked the needed rally.
WE LIVE THIS GAME stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, was bumped near the eighth pole and faded. LIVE TO RIDE (GB)
saved ground and failed to menace. OCONEE LIFE set the pace two wide around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn and tired in the lane.
STUD MUFFIN played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
CRUZIN MAN set an open pace in the three path, tipped into the two path around the turn, was cued at the top of the lane, drifted out to the six path
passing the eighth pole, and kicked away in the final furlong. HEALS THE SOUL raced off the pace in the two path, bumped an inner foe just after the half to
secure an inside position going into the turn, was urged from the two path into the lane, and kept on for place. BELLA FUTURE tracked in the three path,
was coaxed along around the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and finished evenly for show. LOYAL LOUIE chased inside, got bumped
by an outer foe and had to steady going into the turn, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but made no impact. PUTIN ONLINE bumped with an
outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path early and never threatened. NO NAME DUDE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path,
was cued from the three path passing the three-eighths, but gaveway on his left lead in the stretch.

LURE HIM IN was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, put a head in front near the quarter pole,
dueled outside of OCTANE from there to wire and narrowly prevailed. OCTANE set the pace in the two path, was headed near the quarter pole, fought back
inside to lead narrowly through much of the stretch but was narrowly outfinished. THE SKIPPER TOO lacked early speed inside, advanced four wide around
the far turn and was along for the show. SLIM SLOW SLIDER chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. CASHIER CHECK was
bumped at the start, raced up close inside and tired in the stretch. KHOZEIRESS was bumped between foes at the start, bumped again entering the first
turn, raced three wide and never threatened. GRANTED SUCCESS pressed the pace three wide and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
TICKING prompted the pace in the four path, was cued to bid from the three path passing the three-eighths, floated out to the six path turning into the
stretch, and inched clear. IMPLEMENTATION rated in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane,
and kept on for place. LOYAL COMPANY raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the
stretch, and ran on for show. SCARAMOUCHE chased in the five path, floated out to the eight path under a drive turning into the lane, but was one-paced.
LET IT RIDE got sent to set the pace in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, floated out to the four path turning into the stretch, but faded.
DEER DISTRICT raced wellback in the six path and never menaced. BABY YODA tracked inside, was roused into the turn, but weakened. CAPTURE THE
LION laid up close in the three path early but backed up around the turn.
