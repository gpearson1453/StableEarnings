Footnotes
FORSAKEN forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground in the second flight through the turn, rail bid inside the furlong marker, drew clear
under steady handling. PARTYINTHESTREETS off a step slow, raced back toward the inside, angled out four wide when beginning to advance into the
stretch, rallied on the outside and was up for the place late. STREET COMMANDER raced in mid pack early, dropped inside late turn, steered back out
when straightened fore home, up in the final strides for the show. BRAHMS IMAGE broke alertly from the outside, dueled up front in the two path, continued
to alternate up front into the stretch, faltered late to lose a couple of positions. SECRET TAVERN dueled up front closest to the inside, allowed the winner
the inside past the furlong marker, also gave way in the late going when headed by that one. CHUPAPI MUNYAYO back off the pace and the inside, four
wide into the turn, three wide exiting. PEPPERONIKID broke back, lacked speed, angled out four wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. WHONEW
fell back to trail after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. MADMARTIGAN tired while racing three wide. WATER TO WINE

Footnotes
GOOD SCOUT away in good order, contested the pace up the backstretch closest to the inside, showed the way through the turn in the two path, shook
clear when straightened for home and drew out steadily while being kept to task. DOUBLE TUFF back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide when
advancing out of the turn, proved no match for the winner through the stretch,held sway late for the place. PRESS SNOOZE broke back, lacked speed
inside, continued to save ground into the stretch,finished willingly up the rail to be gaining for the place. D TWO void of early foot, three wide when well back
midway on the turn, got out late in the bend, was corrected and showed some belated interest out in the strip to improve position. SQUARE DEAL in mid
pack off rail, five wide exiting the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a significant closing response. WELLMAN back off the pace and the inside, four
wide into the stretch, improved slightly while also not making a major impact. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT vied up front while between horses, dropped inside
when beginning to weaken late in the turn, continued to give way through the stretch. UNDER THE GUN with the pace while four wide into the turn, dueled
with the winner outside that one late in the bend then also began to give way. OTIS OTIS OTIS in the second flight toward the inside, traffic then steadied
midway on the bend, failed to muster a rally. BELLA'S PRAYER void of speed well out in the strip, carried out further to be five wide out of the turn, failed to
rally. MYSTERY MAN broke back, moved up to mid pack, angled into the two path out of the turn, backed up down the lane.

Footnotes
AFFABLE MONARCH settled off the pace while saving ground early, continued inside up the backstretch and into the far turn, in some traffic when creeping
closer late in that bend, rallied along the rail nearing the furlong marker and drove clear. LONG CROW void of early foot, came four to five wide out of the
final turn when advancing, bumped with EL FRANCO in upper stretch, was straightened and finished up willingly to be clear for the second spot.
JEWELSTOWN stalked the pace from along the inside, remained in a forward position the middle half, moved out a bit and challenged between horses
entering the stretch, briefly gained the advantage then could not hold the top two, comfortably saved the show. SUPER CONSTITUTION settled in mid pack
while off the inside, bit closer in traffic late in the final bend, three wide into the lane, bumped with EL FRANCO soon after then lacked the needed closing
response. PHANTOM RIDE in the second fight off the inside, three to four wide late in the final turn, gradually weakened through the lane. ZAP MOTION
pressed the pace from the two path, floated out three wide turning for home, gave way in the run to the wire. EL FRANCO off a step slow, raced back, raced
four wide into a contending position through the second turn, in tight, jostled in upper stretch and fell back. DEEP STATE lacked early foot, angled out five
wide late in the final turn, came up empty for the stretch drive. FIGHTERTOWN in mid pack while racing off the inside, traffic, fell back late in the final turn.
CABALLO FELIZ took command soon after the start, set the pace, stopped when headed turning for home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF EL FRANCO FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
I'M WIDE AWAKE broke well, set the pace toward the inside, turned back a mild bid from the outside turning for home, remained clear the final furlong
under steady handling. ST ANDREWS off a step slow, raced back off the pace and the inside as a result, made a four wide middle move through the turn,
continued with good resolve the final furlong to gain the place in the final strides while not a threat to the winner. COLT FICTION closest to the leader while
racing three wide, lodged a brief bid late in the turn, could do little more with the winner, caught late for the runner up position. ALBIZU behind the pace
while toward the inside, waited briefly in some traffic late in the bend, went evenly when clear for the drive. SPEIGHT AND MALICE in mid pack while racing
just off the inside, lacked a closing response. LIGHTNING STRUCK forwardly placed just off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. CIRCLE BACK
JACK off the pace and the inside, two path and between horses into the stretch, also failed to muster a rally. CYCLONE off a step slow, remained back.
ATOMIC TONE was finished early, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
MR. KEATING settled off the pace toward the inside, asked along midway on the turn, three wide advance from between foes into the lane, collared the
leader from the outside with less than a furlong remaining, wore that rival down under firm handling. SIMOVIC pressed the issue early from between foes,
took over into the stretch, briefly clear nearing the furlong marker, responded when challenged by the winner, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, remained
clear of the others. MILLERS RITE lacked early foot, angled out four wide turning into the stretch, up for the show while not a threat to the top pair. SAFE
BET fell back after the start along the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, mild interest to improve position while steadily angling in. FASHION
KING behind the first flight, in some traffic late in the turn, three wide for the drive, went flat late to lose the show. OLIVIER behind the pace, waited behind
horses late in the turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. P R CALL ME MAYBE broke back, trailed for a half, four wide exiting the turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TRABR'S CREED took command after the start, set the pace for a half along the inside, gave way
when headed by the runner up into the stretch. MILLCREEK ROAD prompted the pace, angled four wide into the lane, backed up stretch.
ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT off a step slow, mid pack off the inside, retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
WOODCOURT lacked early foot, advanced in the two path second turn, angled in a bit upper stretch, challenged closest to the inside and gained the nod at
the wire. NEXT LEVEL lacked speed, four to five wide when rallying into the lane, finished willingly while widest to miss. FOOTPRINT jostled to be forced
back at the break, lacked any early speed, steadied midway on the second turn behind traffic, recovered, improved then was in tight again in the final strides
to miss. ANDY'S CANDY in mid pack along the inside, advanced along the inside turn, gained the advantage then faltered in the waning strides. TEJON
PASS vied up front along the inside, fell back the middle half, moved out to be four wide into the stretch, traffic between horses upper stretch, weakened.
GEWURZTRAMINER broke on top, narrowly set the pace off the inside, came out a bit to be in the three path into the lane and faltered. WILLY D'S within
striking distance off the rail, three wide for the drive, came up empty for the stretch drive. MO WINNING back off the pace toward the inside, made a mild
move the third quarter then flattened out. SEARCY tired while racing four wide throughout. LEO SPRINGS fell back early, outrun. OMAR COMIN in the
second flight off the rail, stopped, jogged in.

Footnotes
CONDIMENT GIRL broke alertly, set the pace while just off the inside, kicked steadily clear under pressure. ROYAL MEGHAN back off the pace while
racing toward the inside, angled out sharply to be five wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be up late for the place, not a threat to the winner.
IZEONPOINT off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, rallied in the two path into the lane, improved position, missed the second spot while remaining
on the inside. GHOSTLY NIGHT in the second flight off rail, four wide into the stretch, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. STARSHIP DEFIANT forwardly
placed along the inside, steadied when in a bit tight along the rail into the turn, tracked the winner through the bend after recovering, had little left for the
stretch run. FOREVER HOME in the second group while racing three wide, tired from those early efforts. PENS STREET remained back while saving
ground to no avail. ABBY THE BULL DAWG fell back after the start and failed to threaten. WINYAH BAY was never a factor. Z ZS RED gave way after a
half three wide.

Footnotes
NORTHERN FLAME took command soon after the start, set a pressured pace while in hand up the backstretch, shook off that rival past the furlong marker,
responded when the runner up challenged soon after, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. MENA in the second flight while toward the inside,
stalked the lead pair into the lane, challenged outside the winner a sixteenth out, outkicked in the late going. MARKET STREET dueled up front outside the
winner, continued on equal terms with that one through the second turn, first to blink, saved the show. GETTYSBURG ADDRESS last away, void of speed,
saved ground into the stretch, improved position to be gaining late for the show. CASH ONLY five wide into the first turn, turned in an even effort in lacking a
closing response. GOLD SWEEP was never dangerous while racing off the inside. CHAPERONE remained back in lacking a rally. MAXIMUS MAGIC in the
second flight off rail, dropped to the rail late in the final bend and tired. REDFIELD was finished early, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
BOLZY stalked the pace while racing toward the inside, tipped out three wide late in the final turn, took over, kicked clear under steady handling. SUN
THUNDER last away, moved out to be four wide onto the backstretch, improved while remaining four wide through the final bend, proved no match for the
winner the final furlong, held the place. LIPS SAY BLISS void of speed, steered out four wide late in the final turn when advancing, angled in when
continuing to rally stretch, getting to the runner up late while inside that one. LORD VICENTE (ARG) went evenly while racing inside, lacked closing
response. RIVALRY closest to the leader off the inside, challenged that one in the far turn, led briefly between calls late in the final turn, faltered. READY
SHOES void of speed, three wide through the second turn, improved position a bit, no real threat. MO'S TREASURE broke on top, set the pace toward the
inside, weakened when headed. HOLLYWOOD ENDING raced in mid pack while racing three wide, had nothing for the drive. REWIRE was finished after a
half, trailed home.
