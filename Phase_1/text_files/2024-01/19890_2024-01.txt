for the advantage inside and continued willingly to the finish. BRONX TALE settled off the pace outside then closed well through the stretch. KEEP DEM
TALKING threw his head early, raced far behind then narrowed the gap without menacing. BLUEY trailed for half a mile then offered some late energy. Z'S

Footnotes
PERFECT SILENT CAT chased between rivals, chased on the turn, rallied in upper stretch, closed well, drifted out in deep stretch and dug in gamely to
prevail. BOX OF CHOCOLATES raced off the rail, off the pace, came six wide into the stretch, rallied farthest outside, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth
and ran on willingly to the wire. RUDY ROD raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied between
horses in the final furlong, then was being outkicked when in tight late and steadied nearing the finish. HE'S INCREDIBLE stalked the leader, chased on the
turn, rallied entering the stretch, took over and drew clear, then weakened late. CRYPT raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly near the inside.
SOUPER FLY OVER raced off the pace, chased between rivals on the turn and had no rally. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN chased three wide, chased on the turn
and tired. HEFFNER raced off the pace inside and did not factor. TACO BEAN was off a bit slow, quickly moved up inside to set the pace, showed the way
on the turn and gave way in the lane. A Jockey Objection by the rider of RUDY ROD against the winner was dismissed.

SECRET TEMPTATION dropped back outside, moved very wide into the stretch then edged clear in the late stages. OVERTHEBLUESKY trailed early then
finished willingly to gain the place. ONLY GIRL threw her head while appearing rank early, saved ground and lacked a solid rally. THREE CUPS FULL raced
inside off the dueling leaders then flattened out in the stretch. TREASURE PEACE hustled to a narrow lead early, shook loose on the turn then drifted out
fading in the stretch. YELOMA forced the pace down the backstretch then gave way in stretch. WOKE UP A DIVA chased wide and stopped on the turn.

SOPHOS settled off the pace inside, angled out on the final turn, surged through the stretch and wore down the leader in the final yards. IT'S GAME TIME
alternated for the advantage outside, shook loose in the stretch but was nailed at the wire. PRACTICAL COACH dueled along the inside to the stretch and
weakened. SCREEN SAVER raced off the leaders three wide and flattened out in the stretch. CARTIER CAT stalked the dueling leaders outside and began
fading on the final turn. MAKABIM dropped back in the two path and lacked a rally. AMOUNT lagged far behind and was always outrun. MOLIERE trailed
early and failed to respond. RUNNINGFORHOME was urged off the pace outside and weakened steadily. INDOCTRINATE saved ground and gave way
readily.

YES SIR COLONEL lacked speed outside, bid very wide on the final turn and into the stretch then was up in time with a powerful late surge. MALIBU STAR
dueled inside, shook loose after half a mile, continued gamely but was nailed nearing the wire. KINGSVILLE raced just off pace between foes, bid on the
final turn turn went evenly late. OLYMPIC ROMP saved ground close up, faded on the turn then came again while no threat. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK stalked
the dueling leaders four wide then weakened in the stretch. LITTLE DEMON dueled outside to the final turn and began fading remainder of trip. CORKMAN
raced far behind inside and was never a factor. SUPER JOHN urged close up between rivals for half a mile and stopped.
