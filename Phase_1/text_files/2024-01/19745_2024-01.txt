Footnotes
HELEN'S SUN broke sharply and assumed command away from the start, was well handled while setting moderate fractions through the backstretch run,
mildly pressured into the far turn, shook free into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task while drawing away into the final
sixteenth and was hand urged in the late stages to prevail as much the best. WELL IMAGINE THAT took back off of the early pace and saved ground into
the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and attended to the moderate pace, mildly pressured HELEN'S SUN into the second turn and was outkicked
into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but stayed on into deep stretch to be second best. CLICKING unhurried leaving the start,
tracked the moderate pace while outside of runners through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the second turn, angled out approaching the furlong
marker, was not able to impact the top pair in the final sixteenth but ran on to be clear for third at the finish. STEPHANIE'S CANDY forwardly placed away
from the start, stalked the early pace from the three path, raced close to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, maintained a three wide path into
the far turn and raced within aim to the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened. LONG JACKET slow into stride away from the
start, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run and gained ground at the half-mile marker, was
outrun into the second turn, trailed into the stretch and tired in the final stages. KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE forward placed in the early running, tracked the pace
three then two wide into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile pole, lost ground into the second turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MERRY BLUE settled while not far back in the early running, saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and chased to the furlong
marker, rallied inside of the furlong pole then came in a bit tight approaching the final sixteenth, split rivals into deep stretch, took command and held in a
drive for a determined win. FLY SOUTH tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground while well positioned heading into the turn, tipped two
wide for the drive and advanced heading to the furlong pole, confronted HEAVENLY VIOLET and battled that runner to the sixteenth marker, was
outfinished by the winner in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for second. HEAVENLY VIOLET broke alertly, assumed command away from the start
and showed good early speed, drew to a clear lead heading into the turn, showed the way while clear to the quarter pole, came under pressure leaving the
three-sixteenths marker, was confronted by FLY SOUTH and battled that rival to the sixteenth pole, was outfinished by the top two in deep stretch and was
well clear of the rest for third. VALERIE prominent leaving the start, stalked the decent pace into the turn, chased HEAVENLY VIOLET two then three wide
to the quarter marker, could not keep pace approaching the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. HARBOR'S BEAUTY rated off of the decent early
pace, tracked outside of runners entering the turn and chased three then four wide to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and did not
threaten. DAZZLE ME GINGER pulled on the rider while between runners in the early stages, was hard to place and a bit erratic approaching the turn, was
outrun to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
PLAYBOY STYLE forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run
and was well positioned heading to the second turn, made a mild gain two wide approaching the quarter marker and was asked for run into the stretch,
tipped three wide for the drive and confronted SKY DINSKI nearing the furlong pole, battled the runner-up to the sixteenth marker, shook free into deep
stretch and drew clear in the final stages. SKY DINSKI away in good order, was sent to establish the early lead, drew to a clear lead along the first turn and
dictated terms into the backstretch run, set a decent pace to the half-mile marker, controlled the pace into the second turn and maintained a clear lead to the
quarter pole, came under pressure into upper stretch and met the bid of PLAYBOY STYLE approaching the furlong marker, battled to the sixteenth pole,
could not keep pace with the winner into deep stretch and bested the rest. BALLROOM PRINCE settled two wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace
to the half-mile marker and gained ground three wide into the second turn, shifted two wide into the stretch and raced evenly to the furlong pole, could not
match strides with the top pair into the final sixteenth and was outkicked, while clear of the rest for third. WINTER SOLDIER unhurried leaving the start,
settled two then three wide along the first turn and was content to trail through the backstretch, improved position four wide into the second turn, continued
to make headway three wide into the stretch, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. DRAW SOME rated just off of the early pace
and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while saving ground through the backstretch run, lost position at the half-mile marker, trailed
into the second turn and did not offer a rally in the stretch. JIMMY THE BOOT stumbled sharply at the start and lost the rider, was caught following the race
and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING JIMMY THE BOOT. THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT JIMMY THE BOOT STUMBLED SHARPLY AT THE START, LOST THE RIDER AND CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES LEAVING THE START.
NO ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
MISTICAL SURPRISE broke well but tracked behind and allowed the pace scenario to play out in front through the first quarter mile, went into a drive from
the three eighths pole, found her best stride inside the sixteenth pole, finished strong in the final yards and won the photo by the narrowest of margins.
BACALAR broke a beat slow but took command and opened up a clear lead after passing the half-mile marker, was kept to task in the stretch, ran on well to
deep stretch, began to shorten strides inside the sixteenth pole, held on gamely but came up on the short end of the photo. TRULY FABULOUS raced near
the back of the compact field three wide in the early stages, advanced through the turn, came into the stretch still three wide and finished well under
intermittent urging to gain third. MISS SKI was outrun from the break and tracked mid-pack while keeping to the inside path, began to rally on the turn, got a
clean run up the rail into the stretch and was gaining but came up short. ALL broke sharply, was keen and hard to place going into the turn, contested the
early pace three wide while under some restraint from the rider, allowed BACALAR to slip away on the turn, tried to come back under steady handling but
flattened out mid-stretch and finished evenly. CAT BANDIT broke out and made light contact with MISTICAL SURPRISE after the start, rushed up and was
prominent from the start, vied inside for the early lead through the initial furlong, dropped back a bit on the turn, then steadied slightly between poles after
passing the three-eighths, came back on, tipped out a path for the stretch run, loomed a threat to mid-stretch then weakened inside the last sixteenth.
TEASPOON OF PEPPER was slow to get going, came in tight while between runners entering the turn and steadied at the three furlong marker, chased the
field through the turn then was unable to improve in the stretch.

Footnotes
MELANIE'S TIGER allowed to settle away from the start, gained ground two to three wide along the turn, tipped four wide for the drive and was full of run
nearing the furlong grounds, took command at mid-stretch, kicked clear inside of the sixteenth-pole and drew away in deep stretch to be much the best.
CLEVER CLOVER hustled to be forwardly placed leaving the start, vied for the early lead three wide, took back approaching the half-mile marker and
stalked the solid pace into the turn, re-engaged three wide approaching the quarter marker and vied for the lead into the stretch, took a narrow lead heading
to mid-stretch and was overtaken by MELANIE'S TIGER inside of the furlong marker, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on to be
second best. TIGER IN MY TANK showed good early speed leaving the break, vied for the early lead and was confronted by TOUGHERTHANTHEREST
heading to the half-mile pole, disputed the decent pace outside of that runner heading into the turn, contested solid fractions between rivals approaching the
quarter pole, battled for the lead into the stretch, could not match strides with the top pair into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and just held for
third at the wire. DADS DREAM rated just off of the contentious early pace, tracked from the inside and saved ground into the turn, advanced approaching
the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive and was blocked heading to the furlong grounds, found room into the final sixteenth and just missed for
third in the final strides. TOUGHERTHANTHEREST rushed up to dispute the solid early pace, battled inside of TIGER IN MY TANK heading into the turn
and contested the decent pace to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. SPINNIN
PISTOLS ducked in soon after the start and lost the rider, was caught following the race and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
NOLDE was allowed to settle into stride from the break, then became a bit keen through the first turn and was pulling hard on the rider to the halfway point,
was let loose from there, stayed the inside path through the far turn, slipped through an opening at the five-sixteenth pole when SUPER MAZEL began to
drift out, took over the lead a the quarter pole still in hand, was set down approaching the three-sixteenths marker, pulled away from the field, then held off a
resurgent SUPERMAZEL in the final yards. SUPERMAZEL was hustled to the front and got first run into the turn with WINE AND WHISKY in close pursuit,
slowed the pace down for the backstretch run as the field bunched up behind, held sway through the far turn, began to drift out around the final bend while
beset by challenges from NOLDE to the inside and DULAS (IRE) to the outside, lost the lead to the former but was kept to task, re-bid, continued to drift out
in the stretch but held the place. WINE AND WHISKY broke well but ceded the lead to SUPERMAZEL going into the first turn, moved a little closer down the
backstretch then lost some ground on the turn when SUPERMAZEL and DULAS quickened then became blocked from the three-eighths pole to the head of
the stretch, split horses at the three-sixteenths and angled three wide for the drive, lost ground at mid-stretch, raced behind a drifting SUPERMAZEL into the
final sixteenth, could not muster a final response in deep stretch and was clear for third. DULAS (IRE) was unhurried from the break but was still floated four
wide through the first turn, found the pace too slow and moved up even with the pacesetters near the five furlong marker while still racing wide, moved to
challenge SUPERMAZEL for the lead once past the three furlong pole, loomed a threat on the turn for home but bumped and forced out to the six path by
WINE AND WHISKY at the top of the stretch and was outfinished from there. KINGMEISTER broke well and was three wide with the early leaders, raced
close up for a half mile, did not quicken with the others on the turn, dropped back to last in a very compact field, could not keep pace in the final furlong and
tired. THE RIDER OF WINE AND WHISKY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF SUPERMAZEL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
RAVEN'S QUEST broke sharply, set the early pace then ceded the lead to SING A HAPPY SONG, stalked that runner through quick fractions into the turn,
chased two to three wide to the quarter marker, re-rallied into the stretch, pressured SING A HAPPY SONG at the furlong marker, overtook that rival into the
final sixteenth and kicked clear in deep stretch to prove best. LAURA BRANIGAN pinched at the start and was away slowly, tracked the fast early pace from
the inside, tipped two wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and
outfinished SING A HAPPY SONG to secure second. SING A HAPPY SONG rushed up in the opening furlong, assumed command and set a fast pace into
the turn, drew to a clear lead along the bend and carved out fast fractions approaching the quarter marker, maintained a clear lead into the stretch, felt
pressure from RAVEN'S QUEST at the furlong marker, met that bid then was overtaken into the final sixteenth, could not keep pace with the winner into
deep stretch, was outfinished for second in the final strides and was well clear of the rest for third. BLURSDAY forwardly placed leaving the start, took back
and tracked the fast pace three wide into the turn, lost a bit of ground at the quarter marker and came four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
pole, did not offer a rally into the final sixteenth and tired. YODERANDO chased the fast early pace from the outside, raced two wide into the turn and swung
three wide for the drive, trailed to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the final stages. AIR FORCE WOMAN chased the fast pace from the inside, lost ground
at the quarter marker, lacked a response in the final furlong and gave way.

Footnotes
HARBOR'S ROSE broke well but allowed EXTREME BLAZE to go on and dictate the early fractions, kept in close pursuit to the turn, bid from the quarter
pole and pulled even with that rival as they turned for home, had some trouble changing leads but gradually pulled ahead and won clear. STANDFORGRIT
reserved early, saved ground through the turn, cruised into contention by the top of the stretch, was stuck behind horses, found an opening inside the
sixteenths, surged ahead when asked and gained the place. EXTREME BLAZE broke sharply and was sent for the lead, pulled away from the rest with
HARBOR'S ROSE the only other pressing the issue, met the challenge posed by that foe and battled to the furlong pole, then gave way, tired and was
outfinished for second. DADDY INDEED was a little slow into stride, lagged near the back in the early running, started a forward move going into the turn
then became boxed in near the three eighths pole, was unable to crack the top three but finished willingly. CALIGRAPHY broke a beat slow, got to the
inside before the turn, got a clean, ground saving run through the turn, loomed a threat but flattened out with a furlong to run. FEISTY ELLA stumbled at the
start but recovered quickly, was pushed to get in the early mix, got to the head of the group tracking behind the pair of early pacesetters, bid three wide into
the stretch, came under pressure but did not go on and finished evenly. WEGOTTODRINKING broke well and was up with the tracking group in the early
running, then came under a drive and struggled to keep pace through the turn, swung five wide into the stretch was unable to make an impact. ZOE'S
PRIDE broke well but was caught very wide in the run to the turn, continued to race four to five wide through the turn, tried to muster a late rally but was
unable to overcome the lost ground. SHEZA QUEEN BEE was under pressure from the start but was unable to enjoin the early pace battle, raced in
mid-pack to the turn, struggled to keep up passing the three furlong marker, continued to be ridden down the stretch but finished one-paced and was unable
to improve.
