Footnotes
TRIPULANTE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, lost some ground while racing in the four path around the turn, came on again in upper stretch and
kicked clear late. SARATOGA BANKER dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the three path around the
turn and in upper stretch, was caught late and kept on to the wire. ALABAMA SLAMMER stalked the pace setters up the backstretch, came around the bend
in the four path and chased the top two home in the lane. BORRACHO dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path
around the bend and gave way in the final furlong. GHOST OF KHOZAN bumped lightly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, trailed the field early,
saved ground around the turn and never threatened. MADDY'S DREAM bumped mildly with the horse to her inside at the start, settled off the pace on the
rail through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and was empty from there.

Footnotes
MYA C led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and drew off in the lane,
in command throughout. LITERATI raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,
raced in tight quarters headed into the far turn, saved ground from there and improved position in the lane but was never a match for the winner. GOOD
ENOUGH FOR ME raced in the three path early, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and
chased the winner home in the stretch, no match for that rival. WORTH THE SUM was bumped and squeezed back leaving the gate, saved ground around
the first bend, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the second turn and gained ground mildly from
there. JASSAI raced in the four path around the first turn, swinging wider still coming off it, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, came around the far bend in the three path and finished evenly. BLACK BULLET bumped with the horses to her outside at the break, fought her
rider while racing in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the
far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. LA FRESITA raced in the four path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the second turn in the two path and never threatened. ARCHIVIST raced in the four path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. FORTY MINER bumped with the horses to his inside at the
break, saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced into traffic and was forced to check nearing the half mile pole, dropped
back while saving ground around the second bend and continued to tire from there. BOCCABELLA leapt into the rail leaving the gate, losing his rider in the
process and was later caught and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. ADDITIONALLY, THE RIDER OF HORSE FOUR,
FORTY MINER, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE FIVE, LITERATI, CITING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF MILE POLE. UPON REVIEW, NO
CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINSIH.

evenly. D LOVER raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, angled in to save ground around the turn, improved
position on the rail in the stretch and was vanned off after the wire. TOOMUCHAINTENOUGH led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and gave way in the final furlong. DASH TO FINISH raced off the pace through the early going, continued around the turn in the three path and made no
bid. IMPERIALTY stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and faded from there.

Footnotes
PHANTOM SMOKE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and held clear to the wire. STORM THE COURT flipped his
head and was blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field early, swung out the five path coming around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
gained ground late. MOUNSIEUR COCO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch and improved position from there. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND bumped with the horses to both sides at the
start, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and chased on to the wire. CROCODILEHUNTER bumped mildly
with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to press the pace on the outside through the opening stages, dueled from the two path around the turn
and weakened in the stretch. BAM BAM BLU was fractious in the gate, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the bend in
the two path and faded in the lane. BOHEMIAN BOY raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the
turn from the two and three path, raced into traffic in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. UNCAPTURED STAR stalked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and tired in the stretch. RAINBOW'S PRIDE was fractious in the gate, raced in the middle of the pack
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and was empty in the lane.
