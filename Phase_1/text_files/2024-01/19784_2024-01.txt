Footnotes
MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid down the home stretch, was going away at the end and proved the
best. TRIPLE RED ACES vied for the early lead, drove clear down the home stretch, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was best of others.
GRAPHENE CASSOCK unhurried in the beginning, made a late wide bid, closed ground and got up for show. DRAG MALIBU bumped at the start, raced
within contention and was outfinished for third. FLASHY LOVER bumped at the start, racing near the back, improved position, but was no factor. MEET
KEVIN lacked early speed and was never a factor. THE BOYZ PRIORITY bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the field and faded. CHARLIE'S
PARADE dueled on the front end, saved ground and dropped back. R T'S MIDNIGHT trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
WAR SONG raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied, was going away and won
handily. BAYOU BEAUX vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TRIPPER JOHN
raced near the back in the beginning, came around the turn wide, made a late bid and got up for third. DONNA'S COURT lacked early speed, made a late
wide gain and was outfinished for show. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. B B MOODY showed
early speed and faded. STURGILL dueled on the front end, came around the turn on the outside and dropped back. SHARK HARBOR broke poorly, racing
in the rear, pulled up down the home stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MARDI GRAS ALARM challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage around the final turn, dueled to the wire with A P
HUMOR and prevailed for the win. A P HUMOR raced within contention, was close throughout, dueled to the wire and was outfinished for the win. CAJUN
TWO STEP flashed early speed, eased off the front end down the backside, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. T R'S FIRST lacked early
speed, racing evenly near the middle of the field, made a mild inside bid, but was no factor. VALTESSE dueled for the early advantage, saved ground
around the final turn and faded. OUR AMEN raced within striking distance, near the middle of the pack and lacked a late kick. COME WHAT MAE came
around the first turn on the outside, raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. MYLIES STAR raced in the middle of the field and weakened.
BOSTON LUCILLE always raced near the back and showed little. CHATAIN'S FLYER void of early speed and was never close.
