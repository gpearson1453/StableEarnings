Footnotes
LORD SHELDON rated nicely off of the early pace, was steered to the outside entering the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace to the half-mile
marker, made a middle move and confronted GIANOLA heading into the far turn, took a narrow lead at the quarter marker then kicked clear into the stretch,
was kept to task under hand urging in the final sixteenth and drew away in the end to be much the best. BIG GEORGE was allowed to settle and saved
ground into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker then was guided three wide into the far turn, maintained that three wide
path into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, was no match for the winner in the late stages and bested the rest. DONTIM was crowded by a
neighboring rival at the start and was off slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, tracked from the outside through the backstretch run and went two wide
into the far turn, saved ground into the stretch then navigated traffic approaching the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top pair in the final sixteenth
and got up in the final strides to secure third. RANGER JOE forwardly placed away from the start, stalked two to three wide along the first turn and was well
positioned into the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and chased the leading pair to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not
muster a late response and was outfinished for third in the final strides. GIANOLA vied for the early lead then assumed command along the first turn, drew
to a clear lead into the backstretch run and set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, came under pressure from LORD SHELDON and battled with that
rival into the far turn, lost ground to LORD SHELDON into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. I AM AMADEO away in good order, vied for the
early lead then ceded to GIANOLA along the first turn, stalked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, dropped back along the second turn and lacked a
response in the stretch.

Footnotes
TAMARANDO STAR vied for the early lead leaving the break, ceded to BOLD ENCOUNTER and stalked that rival into the backstretch run, stalked the
moderate pace to the half-mile pole then was given her cue into the far turn and vied for the lead between horses at the quarter pole, took command into the
stretch and extended the lead at the furlong marker, dug in while under pressure into the final sixteenth, determinedly held the runner-up at bay into deep
stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. GROGU was away a bit slowly from the gate and was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved
ground while content to trail through the backstretch run, was steered outside of runners into the far turn and came four to five wide to the quarter marker,
mounted a six wide rally into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, was held at bay by the determined winner
and outfinished the rest to be second best. GOODBYE KAI broke a step slowly leaving the start, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn,
was well placed while saving all of the ground into the second turn, raced a bit in tight at the quarter marker, found room into the stretch and advanced at the
furlong pole, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held clearly in the end for third. GOODBYE DAL settled in the second flight to begin, was floated out
a bit entering the first turn and recovered to race two wide into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, was steered outside
of runners into the far turn and advanced three to four wide at the quarter pole, continued that bid into the stretch, could not sustain his run into the final
sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. MANY SILVER BELLS was away a step slowly leaving the gate, recovered and stalked the early pace three
deep along the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from the outside through the backstretch run, advanced into the far turn and vied for the lead three wide
at the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BOLD ENCOUNTER broke alertly, vied for the early lead with
TAMARANDO STAR then assumed command into the first turn, drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run and set a moderate pace to the half-mile pole,
came under pressure at the quarter marker and was overtaken into the stretch could not keep pace in the final furlong and gave way.

HOT AND SPICY broke alertly, took back off of the contested early pace and raced under a snug hold approaching the half-mile pole, tracked the moderate
pace from the inside into the turn then came in a bit tight at the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the stretch, split rivals and took command approaching the
furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and kicked clear in deep stretch to prevail. PURPLE MOUNTAIN rated off of the contentious early
pace while not far back, stalked outside of runners along the turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker while within
aim, was outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth and bested HIGH INFLATION in deep stretch to earn place honors. HIGH INFLATION showed early
speed and was prominent leaving the break, engaged with LOVELY JOSEPHINE and pressed outside of that rival into the turn, kept close attendance to the
moderate pace approaching the quarter marker, shifted three wide for the drive and took a narrow lead in upper stretch, lost that lead at the furlong marker,
could not keep pace with HOT AND SPICY into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second in deep stretch, while well clear of the rest for third.
LOVELY JOSEPHINE vied for the lead away from the start, assumed a narrow advantage and set a pressured early pace, set moderate fractions while
pressed into the turn, was overtaken into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. MY MOTORHOME lacked early speed and did not factor.

Footnotes
EGOMANIA broke well and was up with the early leaders without being asked, went three wide through the clubhouse turn and settled a two or three
lengths behind the pace racing well in hand and three wide in the clear, responded when given the cue to quicken passing the three furlong marker, went
three wide into the stretch bidding for the lead near the three-sixteenths pole, hooked a stubborn foe in CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS for the length of the
stretch but kept to task and got up by a long neck. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS broke well and was in a position to vie for the early lead but opted to stalk
BUTTONWOOD TREE in the two path, allowed that one to dictate the fractions while traveling well in hand to the far turn, came under pressure from the
five-sixteenths, responded to strong handling and put in a good run down the stretch but came up just short. RICH GOLD turned his head just as the gates
opened and was unprepared for the start, dropped far behind in the early going but was allowed to settle into stride as the rider showed no inclination to
regain contact with the field through the first half-mile, was set down after passing the half-mile marker, advanced quickly into contention racing three to four
wide through the turn came into the stretch in the five path and continued to run on well to gain the third spot. PLAYBOY STYLE settled well off the pace
through the early stages, gradually advanced into contention on the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep up after passing the three furlong pole then
re-rallied under intermittent urging, was gaining some at the finish but unable crack the top three. BUTTONWOOD TREE broke sharply and took command
early when no one else went for the early lead, was allowed to dictate moderate fractions under some restraint to the far turn with limited pressure from
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS along the way, had something left when set down at the head of the stretch, held the lead to the furlong grounds then gave way.

Footnotes
EYELIGHT asked for speed leaving the break, assumed command and drew to a clear early lead while setting decent fractions, was well handled into the
turn and dictated terms while in hand approaching the quarter marker, kicked clear into the stretch and was kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, drew off
under hand urging in deep stretch and prevailed as much the best. SUSIE CRU settled off of the decent early pace and tracked from the second flight,
chased two wide along the turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position at the furlong pole, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and
outfinished MIRAGE CODE to earn place honors. MIRAGE CODE was prominent leaving the start and vied for the early lead with EYELIGHT, ceded to that
rival and stalked the decent pace into the turn, advanced into the turn while two to three wide and chased EYELIGHT into upper stretch, was outkicked at
the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and was just edged for second, while holding clearly for third. ANNA'S GIRL broke alertly, took back off
of the early pace and tracked from the second flight, chased three wide to the quarter marker and ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not muster the
needed late response and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. OOPS (GB) bobbled leaving the start and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early stages,
tracked from the outside into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, swung four to five wide for the drive and continued to advance approaching
mid-stretch, could not sustain that run into the final furlong and flattened out. LOVELY BRIDE forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent early
pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way. HANG ON was allowed to
settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn, was outrun to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE NAUGHTY hustled to be forwardly placed away from the start, ceded the early lead to DIVINE GIFT and stalked that runner through moderate
fractions heading into the turn, chased along the turn and loomed into upper stretch, battled for the lead with DIVINE GIFT then took command approaching
the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady urging into the final sixteenth, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the finish.
CHAMAVILLE prominent leaving the start, rated off of the early pace and tracked from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide
to the quarter pole and gained ground into the stretch, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, closed willingly and put mild pressure on the winner in
deep stretch, could not reel in LITTLE NAUGHTY in the final strides and bested the rest. ALMOST GOT LUCKY tracked the decent early pace from the
inside, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane then found a seam into upper
stretch, mounted an inside rally and came within aim of the lead at the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held clearly at the finish for
third. POKER ALICE a bit slow into stride leaving the start, settled off of the decent early pace, raced between runners into the turn and chased two to three
wide heading to the quarter marker, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong grounds, could not sustain her run into
deep stretch and flattened out. DIVINE GIFT sent to establish the early lead, drew to a clear advantage and dictated terms into the turn, set moderate
fractions while clear to the quarter marker, drifted to the two path into upper stretch and came under pressure nearing the furlong pole, was overtaken past
mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. SPORTY NUGGET rated off of the early pace and tracked from the outside, raced four to five wide into the
turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, maintained a wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, was outkicked in the final sixteenth
and lacked a late response.

CRY ME A RUNNER came away well, stalked DADDY INDEED from the start, cruised up in hand to challenge for the lead passing the three eighths pole,
found no resistance, opened up in the stretch when roused at the three-sixteenths pole, drew off then and fended off a late bid from POINT AND SHOOT to
hold clear under steady handling. POINT AND SHOOT hopped in the air at the start and was slow into stride, made steady progress down the backstretch
then steadied near the seven-sixteenths to avoid the fallen horse and rider, regained momentum, circled the field to get back into contention, swung five
wide into the stretch and finished well under steady handling, was gaining on the winner but came up short while well clear of the next horse. ACHROMATIC
broke well and tracked the early pace while racing three wide down the backstretch and through the turn, responded when set down inside the three eighths
pole, proved no match for the top two but finished willingly to gain third despite drifting out in deep stretch. ZOE'S PRIDE raced up close while holding the
rail position, had to wait for room on the turn to make a move, then got clear run into the stretch and finished evenly. METEOR SHOWER broke well and
was close up between horse in the early going, steadied slightly near the seven-sixteenths and dropped back a bit to avoid getting boxed in, went to the rail
then attempted to rally in the stretch but was stuck behind horses and finished evenly. DADDY INDEED broke sharply and seized the early lead with CRY
ME A RUNNER in close pursuit, tried to open up on the turn but could not shake that foe then came under pressure passing the three-sixteenths pole and
weakened in the final furlong. BOBBY'S GENIE got squeezed a bit and made light contact with horses to the inside and outside, steadied and spotted the
field a head start, advanced to regain contact with the field down the backstretch, then passing the seven-sixteenths pole clipped heels and fell dislodging
the rider, was caught following the race and walked off under her own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING
BOBBY'S GENIE CLIPPING HEELS AND LOSING THE RIDER. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT BOBBY'S GENIE CAUSED HER OWN ISSUES
AND NO ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.
