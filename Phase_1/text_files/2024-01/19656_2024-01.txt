Footnotes
SISTERSOUTTACHROME a bit unruly in the post parade, broke back, back off the pace 3w, angled four wide into the stretch, outside bid, drew clear under
steady handling. NATURAL TOUCH broke well from the inside, set the pace in the two path, clear into the stretch, proved no match for the winner the final
furlong, clearly second best. GRACEFUL MOON within striking distance inside, continued to save ground through the turn, lacked a closing punch in the
drive while comfortably holding the show. CASHMERE BABY broke back, moved well outside, five wide through the turn, angled in steadily midstretch,
improved position while not a serious threat. MISS DOUBLE prompted the runner up for a half in the path then began to tire. PINK CHIMES broke toward
front, fell back, four wide turn, moved a bit closer late in the bend then had little left through the stretch. RED SUNSHINE off a step slow, raced back,
dropped inside for the drive, failed to muster a rally. MISS JET fell back after the start, raced out in the strip, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, trailed
home.

Footnotes
MIRI A COINCIDENCE broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, got out a bit to be four wide entering the stretch, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire under firm handling. FORSAKEN forwardly placed outside, four wide through the turn, crept a bit closer outside the
winner turning for home, saw that progress stall on that same rival past midstretch, held sway late for the place. COLOR ME LEGENDARY lacked early foot
inside, steadied in tight along the rail into the turn, continued inside after recovering, finished up willingly down the lane to annex the show. LAST OUTLAW
void of speed, three wide through the turn, improved position a bit while not posing a serious threat. COMMANDER REX lacked speed just off the inside, in
a bit of traffic into the turn, remained in the two path around the bend, improved position a bit through the stretch while also not a serious threat. IMMORAL
one paced early off the inside, fanned six wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. HEIR TO GREATNESS pushed out at the break to be away a bit
slowly, raced back and outside, four to five wide into the lane, made little impact down the stretch. LOVE SPELL broke out and slowly, moved up to midpack
just off the inside, tired while remaining off the inside. UNBOWED pressed the issue for a half between horses, gave way in the drive. PASSION OF JOE'S
trailed throughout while racing four wide.

Footnotes
DRIFTER off a step slow, moved inside, saved some ground turn, challenged inside the leader past the furlong marker, drew clear. IAN GLASS chased the
leader off the inside, took over from that one turning for home, showed the way past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late. CREME DE LA
CHROME in mid pack well out in the strip, four to five wide turning for home, could do little with the top two late, remained clear of the others. RAYMOND in
the second flight while racing three wide, had little left late. RARE STRIPE lacked speed, five wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while
never a threat. RECKLESS RED was finished early while racing three wide. GOOD HEART sprinted clear soon after the start, stopped when headed
entering the stretch.

Footnotes
BORN FLAWLESS took command soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, garnered a larger advantage entering the stretch, responded when
challenged past the furlong marker, dug in late while between the next two to prevail in game fashion. BEST OF GREELEY in the second flight while toward
the inside, encountered some traffic between horses midway on the turn, clear for the drive, challenged inside the winner with less than a furlong remaining,
denied. JUNIOR BUG off slowly, trailed early, moved out, four to five wide when moving closer late in the turn, challenged on the outside with less than a
furlong remaining, not enough. BLOW TORCH behind the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
bid. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE forwardly placed outside, four wide when prompting the issue through the turn, remained within striking distance a furlong out,
came up empty late. SHACKS WAY off the pace and the inside, lacked a significant response in the drive. OTIS OTIS OTIS broke back and remained back
in failing to menace. DEVOTED TO YOU off the pace well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, appeared to begin to tire entering the stretch when
bothered and put in tight, faded through the lane. GOLDEN LUNA vied up front for a half while three wide, backed up through the stretch.

TENACIOUS LADY popped stall doors prior to the start, broke a step slow, raced back toward the inside, angled four wide when beginning to advance late
in the turn, continued with good resolve past the furlong marker, late bid outside, finished up willingly to prove bet. BALL GOWN back off the pace and the
inside, also steered out to the four path turning for home, bid, could not match the winner late while edging clear for the place. TAKING CHARGE DESI in
mid pack outside, four out to five wide late in the turn, not enough in the late going for the top two, lasted for the show. CHAPARRITA void of speed for a
half, steered in a bit while in some traffic late in the turn, staged a mild late rally to be gaining for the show. NAVAGATIONALBEACON in mid pack and
inside, moved a bit closer into the stretch, flattened out a bit late to finish up evenly. DODGEBALL with the pace for a half between horses, faltered in the
drive. THREE CARATS vied up front while racing three wide, held a narrow advantage nearing the furlong marker, faltered. JERI DAWN fell back to trail,
three wide through the turn, passed a few tiring rivals while not a threat. FUNTIMEGIRL headed up the second flight while racing three wide, tired.
CHARLOTTES WAY set or forced the pace along the inside four four furlongs, gave way. PREACH IT GIRL was finished early, trailed home.

FAVORITE OUTLAW broke alertly to be with the pace from the start, showed the way into and through the turn in the two path, clear into the lane, drifted in
slightly then back out, slowly increased advantage while being kept to task. DISTORTED PRO forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out for the drive,
could do little with the winner late, clear for the place. A LA CARTE back off the pace, steered out to be three wide when beginning to move exiting the turn,
continued willingly to the finish while too late for the top pair. ROCKING ROCKET pressured the winner from the outside for a half and began to fade. TIM
TAL slight bobble just after the start, lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. SHUFFLE DANCE
forced the issue up front in the four path for a half and began to give way. STUCK N SNOW in mid pack and outside, four to five wide turn, failed to muster a
rally. WORK ORDER well back off the pace, dropped to the inside midway on the turn, also failed to make an impact in the stretch run. ALL CHOKED UP
bumped start, remained back in failing to menace. PASS LINE in the second flight early while between horses, continued in traffic early turn, fell back.
RAVEN'S NEST broke out to bump ALL CHOKED UP, steadied, fell back to trail, never close. ASYMMETRIC in the main group outside, four to five wide
turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDBRICK off the early pace inside, moved closer off the inside into the far turn, challenged three wide late in that bend, dueled upper stretch, late surge
to prove best in the waning strides. CRUSHED IT took command soon after the start, set all the pace toward the inside, proved stubborn to the end.
FLASHY FAST in mid pack while racing just off the inside, came three wide for the drive, finished up clear of the others while not a threat to the top three.
RIYADH MOON unruly post parade, forwardly placed out in the strip, three to four wide into the stretch, came up empty for the drive. SPECIAL DISPATCH
lost footing to be away slowly, trailed well back, three wide into the lane, improved position with some mild late interest. MAJOR MACK pressured the runner
up off the inside, dueled into the far turn, gave way from between the top pair turning for home. TORNADO ROAD in the second flight along the inside,
began to weaken. MIRAGE void of speed three wide, passed some tiring rivals. SNOW KING had little for the drive while racing off the inside. NORTHERN
CHILL unruly loading, mid pack and outside, tired after racing four wide through the second turn. SARPEDON off a step slow, was never a threat. GENO'S
MYTH four wide when well off the pace through first turn, came four wide when backing up exiting the second bend, continued to tire.

Footnotes
LET'S BE CLEAR outrun in the early going, continued back while in the two path into the turn, steered four wide exiting the bend, closed with good energy
to win going away. TWIRLED broke on top, set the pace in the two path, shrugged off a rail into the lane, clear again upper, no match for the winner late.
FEE within striking distance, moved a bit closer in the two path behind the runner up late in the turn, flattened out a bit to finish up evenly. DEMI off a step
slow, lagged well back well out in the strip, four to five wide turn, improved position with some late interest. MEGAN'S CLARA in mid pack outside, four to
five wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. TOLONDA chased the runner up from the three path for a half and weakened. VERYLITTLECENTS
broke back, three to four wide turn, failed to threaten. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT forwardly placed outside, moved a bit closer four down to three wide on the
leader late turn, gave way when straightened for home. HEATED ARGUMENT staged a steady retreat along the inside. CHARLEE MAE four wide when
with the main body through the turn, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL RULER broke sharp, quickly sprinted clear, bit of a breather turn while off the inside, extended lead past the furlong marker, enough left to hold
the next two safe in the late going. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL void of early foot, began a steady advance while four down to three wide late in the turn,
continued to show interest through the lane while widest, getting to the winner late while proving game for the place. B SUDD raced in mid pack inside,
steadied when in a bit tight along the rail into the turn, recovered, shifted out for the drive, missed the place spot while between the top two at the wire.
ZAMBEZI in the second flight early outside, four wide through the turn,chased the winner past the furlong grounds, weakened late to lose a couple of
positions. ICING headed up the second flight early while off the inside, weakened in the drive. COLD AS HELL broke back, moved inside late in the turn,
had little left for the stretch run. GUNFLASH void of speed out in the strip, four wide early in the turn, three wide into the stretch, failed to threaten.
HUNTSVILLE fractious in the gate, steadied soon after the start, failed to respond in the drive three wide. EXXEL fell back to trail after the start, two path
turn, failed to rally. DON'T WAIT UP made little impact while racing in the two path. TEE BURNS in the second flight while three wide, stopped through the
stretch.
