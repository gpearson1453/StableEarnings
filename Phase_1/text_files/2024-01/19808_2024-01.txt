Footnotes
MAYMUN veered in and bumped TESSUTO at the start, sprinted to the front and set the pace in the two path, moved over to the rail for the turn, drew off
when roused in upper stretch and coasted in the final sixteenth. MC VAY climbed early while chasing off the rail then went between rivals, angled to the
inside late on the bend, failed to make any headway on the winner into the final furlong and kept on for a clear second. TESSUTO got bumped and forced in
by MAYMUN at the start, rushed up to the front then chased from inside, lost ground when racing greenly inside a pair of rivals on the turn, angled out and
came three wide into the stretch and churned on to best the rest. NORMANDY LANDING broke well then dropped back off the pace, raced outside a rival
into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. ALL THAT GLORY bobbled and broke outward, chased three
deep into the turn, two wide entering the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN MAX climbed early and dropped back to last, went tow wide into the turn,
angled out to the five path around the bend and failed to menace. MARDY'S FISH climbed early chasing off the rail out of range, traveled along the inside
into the turn, moved out to the three path around the bend and could not make an impact. SINFUL KING chased from off the pace up the backstretch, saved
ground through the turn and was not a factor.

the five-sixteenths pole, took over into the lane, shook free midstretch and drew away. HOUNDSTOOTH broke a step slow, chased three deep then four
wide around the turn and gained second. THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) popped the gate open but did not come through the front, was backed out and

bumped with inner rival in the beginning, dueled from inside up the backstretch, failed to kick on with the outer pair midway around the bend and weakened

Footnotes
MO FOX GIVIN reserved in the early stages near the inside, coaxed along still trailing two wide on the far turn, tipped three wide leaving the far turn and
further out in upper stretch, surged to the front midstretch and won going away. SHE IS ROMANTIC stalked the pace along the rail on both turns, tipped out
in the lane and finished willingly for second. SPICE broke well and quickly to control, showed the way under pressure from HATTIE T up the backstretch,
maintained command through the far turn, put away that rival in upper stretch, relinquished the lead to the winner midstretch, grew weary late and lost
second. MS BRIGHTSIDE (IRE) stalked the top pair outside a rival, took aim three wide entering the lane, chased within striking distance with a furlong left
to run but lacked the needed late kick. HATTIE T showed brief speed then raced up close in the two path on the clubhouse turn, drew alongside the leader
once again on the backstretch, fought two wide to the stretch, failed to kick on outside the eighth pole and weakened in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MYSTIC FLYER quickly took control and moved inside, set the pace in hand with DERECHO DANDY applying pressure from outside, cleared that rival
early on the far turn, remained unchallenged into the stretch, put to left then right handed urging and drew away. BENDETTIJOE stalked in the three path
through both turns, was closest in aim entering the final furlong, could not threaten the winner late but stayed on for a clear second. DERECHO DANDY
closest in pursuit from the two path around the clubhouse turn, pressed the leader from outside up the backstretch, failed to keep up on the far turn, driven
two wide into the lane and weakened. MONTANA traveled along the inside off the pace, angled out to the four path on the far turn and lacked a rally.
HOTROD RIDE brushed with outer rival leaving the gate, became rank for a bit entering the first turn in the two path, chased inside to two wide on the far
turn and faded in the drive. SYNTACTIC brushed with HOTROD RIDE at the start, reserved three deep on the first turn, chased outside a rival at the back to
the second bend, trailed four wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM CAPACITY sped clear and took control of the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane and stayed clear under right
handed encouragement. GOLD FOOT reluctant to load into the gate, stalked in the three path on the clubhouse turn, took the second turn two wide, moved
out a bit in the lane and finished willingly to get up for second. WHEN HEROES FLY broke a step slow, chased in the two path to the far turn, took aim at
the leader entering the stretch, lacked the needed late punch in the furlong grounds and got edged for second. BIGREDSANDRIBEYES bumped inner rival
at the start, taken back off the pace and moved inside, tipped out on the far turn, summoned a mild rally but could not threaten for the top of spots.
POTENTIAL SPAM settled outside a rival at the back, moved out and split foes early on the backstretch, navigated the far turn two wide, improved position
but failed to threaten. DADDY JUSTIFY bumped and bobbled leaving the gate, chased along the inside and got put in tight midway around the bend,
continued along the fence on the far turn and proved no menace. RINGTONE chased in the two path then moved over to the rail around the first turn, saved
ground to the stretch and weakened. AUDIBLE SILENCE rated prior to the first turn, chased three then two wide around the bend, dropped back on the far
turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SCARY FAST RIDE got put in tight between rivals briefly early, stalked in hand off the rail, bid four deep at the quarter pole, gained the lead in upper
stretch, cleared in the furlong grounds and was kept to task. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE forwardly placed from outside then vied four deep to the turn, took
over three deep at the quarter pole, overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. DIAMONDS DANZING broke a bit slow,
rushed up to vie for the lead from inside, carried a short lead crossing the three furlong marker, lost command shortly after, chased along the rail into the
lane and kept on to retain third. IRISH WAHINE was off slow to begin, trailed along the rail to the stretch, moved out and earned a minor award while unable
to threaten for the major placings. SHANGHAI SUNRISE pressed briefly then vied three deep between rivals, took over approaching the five-sixteenths
pole, lost command at the quarter pole and gave way. SOUL SWEET away quickly to take control then vied between rivals, started to weaken past the
five-sixteenths pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DESERT DAWN stalked two then three wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled outside a pair of rivals while in hand up the backstretch, challenged three deep
with a quarter mile remaining, fought outside MIDNIGHT MEMORIES into the lane, disposed of that rival in upper stretch and held safely under urging.
COFFEE IN BED stalked near the inside then two wide early, chased between rivals to the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, finished determinedly
through the final furlong but could not reach the winner. MIDNIGHT MEMORIES broke a step slow, pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader past
the three furlong marker, took over at the quarter pole, dueled inside DESERT DAWN into the lane, yielded to that rival in upper stretch and flattened to
third. MUSICAL MISCHIEF set the pace under MIDNIGHT MEMORIES to the outside, raced on even terms past the three-eighths pole, lost command with
a quarter mile remaining and retreated in the stretch run. SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) lost her path briefly approaching the finish line for the first time, stalked
along the rail then inside a pair of rivals, started to weaken midway around the far turn and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
SMOOTH SALUTE unhurried in the two path then moved inside, was on the move while angling out on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, reeled in
the winner midstretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth to win going away. PLAYER B chased three wide near the back into the clubhouse turn then
dove down to the inside, swung four wide leaving the far turn, finished well through the lane and gained the place honors. QUINTECENTS pressed from
outside, dueled on the far turn, lost touch with the leader into the stretch, drifted in slightly in upper stretch, started to be asked again with a sixteenth
remaining and churned on for third. CARIBBEAN KING took up early, chased in the two path into the clubhouse turn, checked midway around bend, drew
closer from inside up the backstretch, waited behind the dueling leaders on the far turn, bid from inside in the lane but lacked the needed late punch.
KHANTARO D'ORO showed the way early from inside under pressure, cleared for a bit on the backstretch before being pressure once again, dueled
around the far turn still holding a slim advantage, shook free from outer rival into the lane, failed to offer any resistance to the winner midstretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. GAELIC NATION (IRE) showed brief speed outside the top pair then angled in to stalk along the rail, traveled outside a rival
into the far turn, took aim three wide into the drive and faded out of contention. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS chased two then three wide on the first turn,
moved into range up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two wide, came up empty in the lane and was not persevered with in the late stages. BALDORO
rank early chasing from inside, checked off heels on the first turn then tipped out to the two path, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked
off.
