Footnotes
MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT set the pace in the two path then along the inside around the first turn, drew clear from chasers entering the lane and held sway.
MARVINS' POSSE stalked along the inside before moving outside of the leader exiting the first turn, chased within range turning for home, but failed to keep
pace entering the lane and held place. IDE LIKE HAWAII tracked along the inside and chased evenly. LACEY'S STAR settled off of the pace along the
inside, shifted out and offered an early five wide advance approaching the half mile pole, chased in the four path around the far turn and tired. LONE STAR
MAX broke slowly, trailed, swung to the six path entering the lane and moved up. WESTERN STAR laid off of the pace in the two path, then in the five path
around the far turn and failed to menace. WAR TOURIST tracked four wide but steadily gave way in the three path around the far turn. SNAKEBIT lacked
speed in the three to two path and failed to factor. CROSSING IRIS made little impact from the three to four path. PERFECT STRIKE was brushed between
horses at the start, tracked three wide and between horses then weakened approaching the far turn. RICKY RIGHT pursued from the five path, but was
through approaching the far turn and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CALIBRACHOAMATTERS sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path and drew off in upper stretch under a drive. NERVY bumped an outer rival
early on, stalked three wide, applied mild pressure to the leader from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and remained
clear of show. ONE MORE SLEEP pursued from the three path, forged show hanging on his left lead in midstretch and held from an inner bidder. SKINNY
BOBBY bumped with an outer foe leaving the gates, saved ground off of the pace, vacated the inside in midstretch, stayed on between horses entering the
final sixteenth, offered a late inside show bid but was denied. OUR HEATSEEKER pursued from midpack in the four path, offered a bid for show in
midstretch but flattened out. LAST OF THE PAST was reluctant to load, then broke slowly whlie leaning inwardly, lacked speed along the inside and
improved past outer rivals. BILLY BOWLEGS tracked along the inside and gave way. LT. TENT failed to factor from the three path. IRON FORTUNE was
bumped between horses early on, lacked speed in the four path and made little impact. STAR READY never got involved from the two path. PARKER NOW
bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased two wide and between horses then weakened. HARD KINGS bumped with an inner rival early on, trailed in the
five path and was outrun.

Footnotes
LAUGHINALLTHEWAY showed the way in the two path, maintained an advantage from a pair of outer bidders coming to midstretch, but shifted outwardly
and hindered the momentum of his outermost challenger passing the furlong grounds, then straightened course and held sway. LUNA VIEJA exchanged
contact with an outer rival while getting keyed up entering the first turn, was smoothly moved out to the four path while tugging in the bit around that bend,
settled into stride before ranging up to the leaders four wide turning for home, bid in upper stretch but shied from an inner rival while getting herded
outwardly multiple paths by that drifting foe leaving the furlong grounds, then recovered and secured place. GILDED CRAKEN stalked outside of the leader
and from the three path, pressed into the far turn, bid along with an outer rival in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with the top pair leaving the furlong
grounds, yielded yet narrowly lasted for show between horses via a tight photo. KOLOMIO tracked in the two path before getting a bit keen entering the
backstretch between foes, awaited racing while while tightly among foes around the the far turn, then ran on late in pursuit to offer a show bid nearing the
wire, but narrowly missed. HAROLD'S CLOUD tracked whlie hemmed in along the inside, then sustained a rail chase to miss reaching show. MIDNIGHT
RAID brushed with an inner rival entering the first turn, shfited down from the four to three path around that bend while off of the pace, then pursued in the
two path around the far turn and failed to factor. RICKY BOBBY raced at the rear in the five to four path and made little impact. THE RIDER AND TRAINER
OF LUNA VEJA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LAUGHINALLTHEWAY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, FOLLOWING THE
OBJECTIONS, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, LAUGHINALLTHEWAY WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED SECOND.

LIKE THIS dueled for the lead along the inside, got headed by his outer counterpart turning for home, yet reclaimed an advantage from that one in upper
stretch and held sway. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE sparred outside of the eventual winner, led narrowly turning for home, but relinquished the advantage to his
inner counterpart in upper stretch and chased that one home. ANGELIC KNIGHT stalked three wide then chased the top pair home well. MALAKI EMPIRE
pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped out while chasing in midstretch and ran on late. SAFARINFAS broke slowly, pursued from midpack in the
three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch but drifted back inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, then lacked a bid. SLICK AND FAST was bumped
between horses at the start, trailed in the two path, shfited out to the five path entering the lane and moved up. SHAWN'S SOLVING stalked behind the
leaders and from the two path, but steadied while hard to handle leaving the half mile pole, chased around the turn and weakened in upper stretch. KING'S
LUTE bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four to six path and failed to menace. LUCAS ZIP IT shifted out and bumped a foe
at the start, raced off of the pace in the five to seven path and faded.

LINZER stalked along the inside, bid up a vacated rail to gain an advantage at the quarter pole, shifted outwardly hanging on his left lead in upper stretch,
met an outer challenge while entering the final furlong in the seven path, sparred with that one into deep stretch, but drifted out and brushed his counterpart
in the closing stages then narrowly held. BEAR RIVER tracked in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, bid in the eight path outside of
the new leader, dueled with that one before being herded outwardly and brushed in the closing stages and missed. SUMMER IN ADRIANE raced off of the
pace in the three path and between horses, bumped an inner rival while splitting foes at the three sixteenths pole and ran on to secure show. SHERIFF JOE
saved ground off of the pace, bumped with an outer rival while chasing in upper stretch and stayed on. STARSTUDDED AFFAIR broke sharply, set the
pace in the two to three path around the turn before drifting to the four path entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch, yet came back to reclaim a minor
share late. GAVEL pursued from the two path, was bumped between horses while chasing at the three sixteenths pole and yielded. LUCKY ROMANCE
pursued from midpack in the five path, shifted to the eight to nine path entering upper stretch, but was brushed by an inner rival in midstretch and failed to
menace. BRENNAN'S HONOR broke slowly, raced at the rear in the four to six path and between horses, but was herded by an inner foe into an outer foe
in midstretch and lacked a bid. CRIMINAL INTENT pressed in the four path, floated to the six path entering the lane, gave way on his left lead before drifting
out in midstretch. HEN HEN raced at the rear in the fie path around the turn and made little impact. EXEMPTION prompted in the three path and between
horses into the turn, but floated to the five path entering the lane and faded between horses. THE RIDER OF BEAR RIVER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF LINZER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, LINZER WAS

Footnotes
LIUZZA prompted outside of the leader, led turning for home and drew off under a drive. MISCHIEVOUSNESS tracked along the inside, shifted out and
chased in the four path in upper stretch, edged place leaving the furlong grounds and held from an inner late bidder. PRETTY ANA broke inwardly and
scraped the inner railing soon after the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, stayed on between horses in
the final furlong, attempted an inside place bid in the late stages but was denied. UNION MIST pursued from midpack in the four to five path around the far
turn, took the far turn in the four path before drifting to the six path entering the lane, and ran on mildly for a minor share. STARINA lacked speed in the two
to five path, then lacked a bid between horses in the late stages. FASTA LAVISTA BABY trailed tucking to the inside around the first turn, then saved
ground to no avail. ANGEL OF FAITH set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that one turning for home and faded in upper stretch.
OSTERVILLE PUBLIC stalked three wide, chased between horses in upper stretch and gave way. VELVET KISSES laid off of the pace in the five to six
path around the first turn and was through early.

Footnotes
CORA'S LEGACY showed speed in the three path before an inside rival moved to vie leaving the first turn, prompted that one before drawing clear with
three furlongs to go, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but flopped back to her left lead while beginning to tire entering the final sixteenth, yet
lasted from an outer late challenge. REMUNZEL veered outwardly at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, crept closer in the four path around
the far turn, sustained grinding progress to take aim on the clear leader in the late stages, but ran out of ground to gain even terms and narrowly missed.
AUNT ALEX tracked from the four path, tucked to the two path with five furlongs to go, chased gaining place around the far turn, but lost that position
entering the lane and gave way yet held show. BEYOND BEAUTY chased tucking from the three path to the rail around the first turn, pursued in the two
path around the far turn then faded. MISS HARMONIC trailed in the two path, swung out to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. MONEY
WORKS rushed to vie for the lead inside of the eventual winner around the first turn, but weakened entering the far turn.

Footnotes
THE DONEGAL CLAN showed the way in the two path, braced for an outer challenge from ALDER entering the lane, gamely clung to an advantage while
sparring through midstretch, exchanged a brush inside the final furlong and tenaciously held before coming out into his rival passing the wire. ALDER
tracked along the inside before smoothly tipping two wide to stalk outside of the leader entering the turn, ranged up to bid entering the lane sparking a duel,
battled while exchanging a brush in the final furlong, then was fended off before taking contact passing the wire. AWESOME RUTA chased two wide and
between horses before tucking to the inside into the turn, moved out to the three path entering the lane and pursued the embattled top pair while clear of the
rest. HONKY TONK HIGHWAY leaned out at the start, stalked three wide, chased the top pair around the turn, floated to the five path entering the lane and
tired. CATS BY FIVE trailed in the three path and failed to factor. TRIPLE TREA pursued from the three to four path and tired.

Footnotes
OUR PRETTY WOMAN tracked two wide and between horses, moved forward to press the leader into the far turn, bid entering the lane, wrestled an
advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear. MARTYNAS' JOY set the pace along the inside while keenly tugging in the bit, settled into stride down
the backstretch, met an outer presser's bid entering the lane, got headed by that one entering the final furlong and remained clear of show. SWEET
SUNSHINE was eased back between horses soon after the start, settled at the rear along the inside, waited behind rivals around the far turn, shifted out to
the four path entering the lane, stayed on to vie for show in midstretch and prevailed. FINLEY'S MAGIC laid off of the pace in the three to four path early on,
improved two wide and between horses around the far turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane, but flattened out while hanging on her left lead and
meeting an outer challenge for show, yet sustained the battle for that position through the final furlong. LOCK IT UP lacked speed in the four to five path
early on, trailed in the three path into the far turn, swung out to the six path entering the lane and moved up. STEPHS COAST stalked in the three path,
chased around the far turn, floated to the five path entering upper stretch and faded between horses. COFFEE CRISP tracked along the inside, chased
around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LIL CHILLY dueled for the lead along the inside, cleared her counterpart entering the lane, held sway before encountering an outer challenge in the final
furlong, yet kept that one at bay. ABOUT TO SET SAIL tracked in the two path, gained inside of rivals passing the quarter pole, tipped out to take aim
outside of the leader entering the final furlong, sustained progress to offer a bid but was denied reaching even terms. SISTER ELLA leaned out a touch at
the start, raced forwardly, stalked in the four path around the turn, entered the lane within striking range but only managed to chase the top pair home.
GRABIQ broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three path and stayed on willingly. BETSY'S ALL IN broke a beat slow and was pinched between horses at
the start, trailed in the two path and moved up. A MISS DEAMEANOR stalked in the four path, chased in the five path around the turn and gave way. BABY
JANE was bumped between horses at the start, then made little impact from the four path. CAIRO CHARM bumped an inner rival at the start, dueled for the
lead outside of the eventual winner while in the three path, then weakened between horses entering the lane. HOLY MOLY SHIPMAN briefly chased along
the inside and folded.
