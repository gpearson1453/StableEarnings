Footnotes
NOAH MY BABY took command away from the gates, set a well rated early pace, widened the advantage in the turn and drew off handily having been
unchallenged. LEWIS AND CLARK slow early to be the distant trailer, circled the field turning for home and closed well to be up for the place. SOMETHING
ON TAP well placed tracking the pace from the inside, saved ground through the turn and rallied mildly in the stretch. PAYMASTER GENERAL tracked the
leaders to the turn, mounted a bid on the bend and flattened out down the lane. RUNAWAY RUSSELL chased the pacesetter from between rivals on the
turn and flattened out in the stretch. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY was never a threat.

Footnotes
RAVEN MOON stalked the pace through the first turn, rallied three wide to press the pace down the backside, took command midway on the final turn,
pulled clear turning for home and held the closer safe down the lane. MY BROTHER CAM unhurried early to trail the field, made a steady advance angling
five wide at the head of the lane and showed good late energy to be gaining through the lane. MUGSY MALONE pressed the pace from between horses
down the backside, took a brief lead into the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. RUNAWAY HARRY set the pace while dueling from the rail, battled
through the far turn responding when called upon and weakened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
MY TWO AUNT JOANS taken in hand early to stalk the pace, tipped out two wide in the first turn, glided up to take command nearing the half mile pole,
opened a clear lead in the turn and drew off in the lane as much best. MANSFIELD TIGER rated off the early pace, was set to a drive into the far turn
mounting an early bid to loom up at the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. RUBINSTEIN set the pace for just short of a half mile along the
rail and steadily faded coming home. PRIVATE LAKE tracked the leaders from four wide in the far turn and finished one-paced failing to mount a rally. GEH
SCHNELL chased the leaders from the fence and lacked a closing rally.

ICE BLAST prompted the pace to the far turn, steadily advanced three wide to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and prevailed in a determined drive.
SMASH set a well rated pace through the far turn on a clear lead, responded when challenged in upper stretch, lugged in leaving the eighth pole interfering
with SUDDEN SHIFT and kept on as second best to the wire. SUDDEN SHIFT tracked the leaders into the far turn, rallied from the inside saving ground
coming home, steadied in the lane when rival came in, was taken up, gathered together and finished evenly. VENETIAN DREAM stalked the pace to the far
turn and weakened coming home. CANDY CRUSHEM was never a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF SUDDEN SHIFT
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SMASH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW SMASH WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THRID.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S GIFT tracked the pace into the far turn, made a steady advance from four wide to engage the leader in mid-stretch and cleared late in the drive.
CITY PLAN pressed the pace to the final bend, assumed command to open an advantage at the quarter pole, responded when engaged in mid-stretch but
was out-kicked in the final sixteenth. GILES unhurried for the first half mile, was set to a long drive on the turn and finished with good late interest. DUEL
FUEL rated in mid-pack for the first five-eighths, angled inside to cut the corner coming home and mounted a mild rally in the stretch. OPEN OUT slow early
to trail for the first half mile and closed in grinding fashion through the lane. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE well placed along the rail within striking distance
through the far turn and lacked a closing response. MAJOR LLOYD showed speed setting the pace for the first five-eighths and tired in the final bend.
GUARD was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUEENIE ROSE unhurried early to be at the rear of the field, made a steady advance leaving the three-eighths pole, circled the field rallying from eight wide
down the lane and was up in the final stride. SEEYOUINMOTOWN rated middle of the pack to the far turn, rallied in upper stretch from six wide to engage
the pacesetter in deep stretch, out-gamed that one to the wire and was caught by the closer in the final jump in a good effort. SWEET UNIQUE sped to lead
under early pressure, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, dug-in down the lane and could not hold on late. BODIL tracked the leaders into the turn, loomed
up on the turn to threaten nearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid. SPICE ICE trailed most of the way and passed tired rivals in the stretch.
MISS BUMBUM contended early and faded. DANCE DRAMA stalked the pace for a half and gave way in the lane.

QUEENOFTHEBUCKEYE pressed the pace for a half mile, assumed command at the head of the lane and drew away as much best. KAT TRAX taken in
hand away from the gate to be unhurried, angled wide at the top of the lane and made a steady advance to be second best. KISS VALENTINA set a
pressured pace to the quarter pole, kept on down the lane while ducking out in mid-stretch and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. ONE RICH KITTEN
rated in mid-pack and rallied mildly in the lane to just miss the show. TWISTED JUSTICE tracked the leaders through the turn and had no closing response.
HAPPYBDAYMRPREZ slow early after ducking in at the start and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. WHYNAUGHTY well placed in the early going and
faded. KERRI'S MIRACLE dropped back into the turn and was not a factor.

LIVING THE DREAM unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field, made up ground steadily advancing in the far turn, cut the corner coming
home to take the lead and drew off down the lane. BLUE NOMORE pressed the pace to the far turn, briefly took command at the quarter pole and finished
well while no match for the winner to be second best. LIAM'S ROCKET MAN raced in mid-pack all the way and finished evenly to gain the show. STORMED
OUT stalked the pace through the first turn, took the lead down the backside, had a clear advantage in the far turn and tired coming home. MOR CRAFTY
was one-paced never posing a threat. SAMURAI WAY showed speed early to lead and was through early. RED HEAD LADY was outrun.
