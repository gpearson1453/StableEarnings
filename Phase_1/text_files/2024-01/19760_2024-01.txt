GIVE ME THE LUTE dueled for command from outside, put away inner rival past the quarter pole and held well under left then right handed urging through
the lane. KANDEREL bumped with inner rival at the start, got bumped between rivals again early, stalked along the rail into turn, tipped out and waited for
room in the two path on the turn, tipped out in the lane and give his cue, finished determinedly through deep stretch and held second. BARRISTAN THE
BOLD (GB) bumped with inner rival early, brushed with outer rival shortly after, chased under coaxing on the inside, saved ground through the turn, ran into
brief traffic in upper stretch before tipped out into the clear, moved back inside and finished well while missing the place. BRUTTO stalked the top pair from
outside, took the turn three wide and lacked a bid. TRUSTY RUSTY drifted in to bump rival early, raced in range three deep into the turn, exited the bend
four wide, tipped out in upper stretch, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late. PERFECTIONISTIC hit the gate and bumped with outer rival,
got bumped and crowded between early, rounded the bend two wide, came three wide into the stretch, paused when drifting into the hind quarters of a rival
and could not regain momentum. DIVINE RASCAL bumped leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside, could not kick on with the winner late on the turn
and weakened down the lane.

was along for second. MONIQUE stalked four then three wide early, bid three deep on the far turn, cleared inner rivals past the five-sixteenths pole,
challenged by the winner at the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch and flattened late to lose second. BOGINSKAYA settled inside, trailed into the far turn,

Footnotes
IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST coaxed from the gate and chased on the inside into the first turn, moved out and drew alongside the leader around the bend, lost
touch with the pacesetter on the backstretch, challenged from outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, battled down the lane and edged the runner-up. AIR
FORCE THUNDER hustled from outside to take control, crossed over once clear of inner rival, pressured around the clubhouse turn, cleared again on the
backstretch, met the bid from IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST into the far turn, maintained a short lead around that bend, battled down the stretch and suffered a
tough loss. ELEVEN OUT OF TEN hopped at the start to lose a few lengths, chased four then five wide around the first turn, remained wide around the
second bend and was along for the show. SIGNORA VITTORIA chased on the inside well off the pace, went around a rival on the far turn and could not
rally. EVA'S PARTY broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, came two wide into the stretch and lacked a response. RAINBOWS ON ICE coaxed from
the gate, drifted out around the first turn, raced greenly well off the pace, spun three wide into the lane and was not a factor. COCONUT GIRL chased three
deep around the first turn, lost ground on the backstretch, dropped back along the inside on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

outside a rival, bid from outside in upper stretch, took over in the furlong grounds and drove clear. HOT BOX vied inside rivals then dueled into the turn,
carried a short lead around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch, could not fend off DISKO TRIBUTE in midstretch and held the place. SILARDI stalked
outside rivals to the turn, chased four deep briefly then angled down to the two path around the bend, steered back out in upper stretch and missed the
place. SAI CON (FR) vied four deep early then dueled outside HOT BOX into the turn, fought to upper stretch and stayed on for a minor award. HAPI HAPI
came away with the field but lacked early speed and dropped back, trailed 3wide around the bend, moved out into the lane and summoned a mild rally.
MAVEN vied between rivals and got put in a bit tight at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two wide through the turn, looked to rally but had his path taken
and steadied in upper stretch and could not regain momentum. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME chased along the rail to the turn, got put in tight from the
three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
CORNELIA FORT bobbled slightly at the start, moved into the two path stalking the pace, steadied between rivals around the first turn then pulled around
the bend, chased two wide through the far turn, stayed within range entering the final furlong, surged in the final sixteenth and overhauled the runner-up.
ISSA COURT raced up close to the outside of the leader then moved up to apply pressure, took over midway around the far turn, cleared past the quarter
pole, put to right handed urging with a furlong remaining, grew weary in the final sixteenth and yielded late. TIZZY TWISTER chased two wide into the first
turn then moved inside, came out into the backstretch, traveled three then two wide on the far turn and bested the rest. SENSIBLE MOVE chased three
deep around the clubhouse turn, remained three wide to the stretch and weakened. RACE JUDICATA stepped to the front and moved inside, pressured
from outside in the middle stages, relinquished the lead approaching the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down the lane. SWEET HELLO pulled along the
rail stalking behind the leader on the first turn, lost ground on the final bend and faded.

THIRSTY THURSDAY broke a step slow, tracked out of range two wide then along the rail, moved out in the stretch and surged between foes late for the
victory. BEER MONEY bumped leaving the gate, showed early speed but was reined in and began to pull up the backstretch, chased along the rail then two
wide into the lane, moved out and rallied in the final sixteenth but was outclosed by the winner. IMMELMANN dueled from outside to the stretch, battled
down the lane and finished gamely in defeat. GOOD LOVIN dueled inside IMMELMANN up the backstretch and around the turn, fought through the lane
while holding a short lead into the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly late. SOMEONE LIKE YOU stalked the dueling leaders outside a rival, spun three
wide into stretch and lacked the needed response. WINNING BIG chased off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground along the rail through the turn,
moved out in the lane and could not rally. SIZE DOES MATTER broke a step slow and bumped inner rival, climbed crossing the dirt, ridden along through
the turn and failed to menace. SALSATION ridden along while rank up the backstretch, trailed outside a rival into the turn, dropped back around the bend,
eased into the stretch and walked off.
