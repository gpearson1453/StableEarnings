Footnotes
TWN MS MIDSHIP brushed at the start, racing in the back, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out down the lane and got up in time. KNIGHTS
SWORD vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage down the home stretch, but was caught late by TWN MS MIDSHIP
for the win. SAY WHAT challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the top two late, but held on for show. SOPHIE'S
PRAYER raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide gain and was outfinished for third. SUMMER IS HOT raced in the
middle of the field and put forth an even effort. HOLY WAR brushed at the start, raced in the back and was never a threat. BRAVE CITY GIRL showed early
speed, raced three wide around the turn and dropped back. LONESHILOHSPECIAL lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside and showed
little.
