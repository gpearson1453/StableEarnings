Footnotes
SMOKEY HARBOR vied with an inner rival while remaining a path away from that foe, led in the three path around the far turn, then drew off in upper
stretch. SUPER WISE tracked in the the two path, chased between horses in midstretch and edged place at the sixteenth pole. ONE TIME GEM stalked in
the four path, but lacked a bid and yielded. HOMEVIEW set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got headed entering the far turn and gave way. MAX
PANDOWDY lacked speed in the two to four path around the first turn, pursued in the five path around the far turn and failed to factor. PHARAOH'S
PROPHECY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, pulled under firm restraint down the backstretch culminating in steadying inside the five
furlong pole, trailed along the inside around the far turn and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
Z Z'S PRINCE bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed, gained in the six path around the far turn, sustained a rally to drive past the leaders at the sixteenth
pole, then held from an outer pursuer. ACTIVE DUTY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, rallied inside of rivals in upper stretch, lacked room to split
foes and bid along with an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, altered outside of that one shortly after and ran on. KNOCK'EM OUT JERRY took light contact
form an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way via a clear margin around the far turn, fended off an outer bidder through
midstretch, but was bested by an outer pair passing the sixteenth pole and stayed game for show. SOLOMON VANDY took contact from an inner foe and
brushed an outer rival at the start, lacked speed two wide early on, yet gained inside of rivals down the backstretch to track the top pair approaching the far
turn, took aim outside of the leader entering the lane, ranged up to offer a bid nearing midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer pair at the sixteenth pole
and was denied show. GEMSTONE WARRIOR transferred light contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, stalked outside of the leader, chased
while losing place turning for home, then tired between horses while hanging on his left lead. WITHOUT EQUAL pursued from the three to four path and
gave way in the five path around the far turn. FREE DROP ROB failed to factor two wide. REGIMENTAL was bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at
the start, lacked speed along the inside while hard to handle, pulled behind foes down the backstretch and was outrun thereafter. SOCIAL SOLUTION broke
out and brushed a foe at the start, raced forwardly in the two to three path around the first turn, but was done early and eased through the lane.

ANITA'S VISION stalked in the two path, ranged up outside of the leader and in the four path around the far turn, bid entering the lane, led from an inner
bidder leaving the quarter pole and drove clear entering the final sixteenth. ENTITLEMENT racked two wide and between horses, shifted out tot he five path
into the far turn and rallied to gain place late. SMART IZZY saved ground off of the pace gained ground into and around the far turn to take aim inside of the
new leader at the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch, but was turned away in the final furlong and lost place late. STARSNMOTION set the pace in the three
path, but was headed by bidders on either side at the quarter pole and gave way. MO SMOKING tracked along the inside, chased between horses around
the far turn and lacked a rally. FITTS N STARTS tracked three wide, chased in the four path around the far turn and faded between horses entering the
lane. TRINITY HOPE was outrun. QUEEN OF THE MOON laid off of the pace in the two to four path and was done early.

Footnotes
MAYCOCKS BAY set the pace traveling well in the bit, met a mild challenge from an outer pursuer turning for home, then kicked away under a drive in
upper stretch and drew off with good energy. BLOWN COVER stalked outside of the eventual winner, was roused to inch closer around the far turn, but
quickly failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and held place. HAWKS CREEK settled off of the pace in the three path, saved ground around the
far turn, then ran on mildly for a minor share. MIGHTY KAI broke a step slow, raced at the rear along the inside, pursued shifting from the four to five path
around the far turn and failed to menace. DUMBSTRUCK pursued from midpack shifting out from the two to five path around the first turn, chased the top
pair from the four path around the far turn then tired. NOT LISTENING tracked three wide, but weakened between horses around the far turn.

MISSED THE BOAT stalked along the inside, bid inside of the top pair at the furlong grounds and edged ahead. TOPPER T broke out and bothered a pair
of rivals at the start, vied for the lead with an outer counterpart while taking the turn in the two path, gamely clung to a margin through upper stretch, but was
bested by an inner bidder in the final furlong. ALL WEST tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and rallied for show. HIGH
CRUISE vied with an inner rival while taking the turn in the four path, then yielded passing the furlong poie. HERD IMMUNITY was bumped by an inner rival
and floated into an outer foe at the start, lacked speed in the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. PALACE KITTEN laid
off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. UPHOLD THE LAW was bumped and bothered by inner rivals at the start, trailed in the four to seven
path and was outrun. WICKED TRICK was never involved. KAELY'S BROTHER raced off of the pace in the five path and tired.

Footnotes
RUE LALA laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer floating to the six path turning for home, rallied while shifting inwardly passing the quarter pole,
bid in midstretch and drove clear. FIRING BULLETS saved ground in midpack, then sustained a rail grind to edge place in the final sixteenth. OCEAN
SPIRIT (GB) stalked in the two path, smoothly took aim outside of the top pair turning for home, but along with an outer rival in midstretch, but was
outkicked and bested by an inner rival for place late. EMPIRE OF MY OWN tracked in the three path, but bore to the five path as an outer rival ranged up
nearing the five sixteenths pole, got outkicked by that one in upper stretch and ran on mildly. CATSKILL HUMOR set the pace along the inside, but was
bested by the eventual winner in midstretch and yielded between horses. NEUTRALIZE prompted two wide but faded between horses in upper stretch.
EMPIRES PRINCESS laid off of the pace in the two to three path and failed to factor between horses. MISS RIVER RAT made little impact from the five
path. RUBY FOO trailed in the six path and was outrun.
