Footnotes
MUMBLES BROCKMAN tracked just over a length behind lone pacesetter SILVER MATY, was content to hold that position into the turn, was set down from
the quarter pole to go after that one, came three wide into the stretch, was not having any luck reeling in that foe but kept to task under steady handling, kep
on and wore down the target in the final strides. SILVER MATY was quick into stride, went straight to the front, opened up on the rest, held the lead to
mid-stretch, still held an open lead with a sixteenth to run but was racing on the wrong lead in the final yards and failed to last. TREE HUGGER broke well
but was not fast enough to contest the early pace, tracked the pace setter up close through the turn, was asked to go on passing the five-sixteenths, came
into the stretch on the inside, was still in contention mid-stretch then was unable to on with the top pair but was able to hold third by a clear margin. NO
BEACHES had to be prompted to keep up early, remained under a hand ride through the turn, made some forward progress, had a little late surge when
asked in the final yards to improve a couple of placings. PARTYATTHEMOONTOWR ducked in sharply at the start, chased the field through the initial
furlong and regained contact at the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the turn then angled out three wide for the stretch run, could not find another
gear when needed and was unable to improve. HARRY'S BIG DREAM was slow into stride and spotted the field a head start, moved over to the rail when
clear, dropped far behind in the early going, was still well beaten on the turn but mustered a bit of a late rally and managed to pass one before the finish.

Footnotes
REGAL PATRIOT broke well, quickly opened up to a big lead, strung the field out while racing well in hand through the turn, drew off when asked through
the stretch and won as much the best. COOLWIND lacked early speed, trailed to the turn, circled five wide around the field on the turn then extended the
run through the stretch to get up for second. DONTIM was very slow into stride, spotted the field a big head start then was hustled to retain contact, made
steady advancement through the turn, stayed inside, came into the stretch in second, but was outfinished for the place. I AM AMADEO broke well but was
left to chase the runaway leader to the quarter pole then tired in the stretch. REEF CITY broke well but was outrun through the initial furlong, dropped back
to last before the turn, saved ground and managed to pass one in the stretch. SARK was in contention to the three furlong marker then was unable to keep
pace in the stretch.

Footnotes
HANNAHAZA HETTY seized the lead before the five furlong pole, then was taken in hand and allowed to dictate the pace with the rest in close pursuit,
rebuffed an early challenge from ROSE OF MOONCOIN near the five-sixteenths pole, turned for home with a short lead then responded to steady handling
and widened the lead in the final furlong. MAGIC WANDERER hard to load prior to the start, was bothered a bit by SMILINGATTHEMOON at the break and
again a few strides out, then was reserved in the rear of the field to the turn, bid three wide through the turn then came four wide into the stretch, finished
with a bold rally, shifted in to the two path inside the sixteenth and was just up for second. ROSE OF MOONCOIN broke well but opted for a stalking
position behind the pacesetter, went to challenge for the lead near the five-sixteenths pole but was rebuffed, then continued to chase down the stretch,
finished willingly but was nosed out for second. SPARKLE SWEETLY broke well but was caught three wide down the backstretch and through the turn,
made a forward move from the three eighths marker, ran on willingly to deep stretch then drifted in late. SMILINGATTHEMOON stumbled at the start, then
broke in and bumped lightly with MAGIC WANDERER, pulled hard against the rider early, was checked slightly near the half mile pole and again when
boxed in near the five-sixteenths, was stuck behind horses as the field turned into the stretch, then found some room along the rail checked again in deep
stretch and did not go on.

CAPO SORELLA took a bump from MISS PERU at the break but was hustled forward to the lead, was joined to the outside by SYGRAYEM, dueled that foe
from the five furlong marker to the wire, tired inside the sixteenth pole, drifted out yards from the the finish and created a traffic jam but won the photo.
SYGRAYEM broke out and went very wide after the break, straightened and hooked up with CAPO SORELLA for the lead, battled that foe all the way to the
wire, was forced out a bit and crowded near the wire and came up on the short end of the photo. MAMARANDO broke well and tracked the early pace from
a couple of lengths behind, was set down from the five-sixteenths pole to go after the dueling leaders, ran on under steady handling to deep stretch, was
forced out a path by OOPS AND DOWNS then surged in the final yards but came up just short. MAX'S MAXINE was hustled into the early mix then raced
between the trio tracking the leaders, backed out approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground, was put into a drive for three furlongs, came four wide
into the stretch, started to gain on the leaders down the lane but was too late. OOPS AND DOWNS came away well but was outrun in the early stages, was
still far behind going into the turn, then started to advance after passing the three furlong marker, saved ground through the turn, began close on the dueling
pacesetters as they began to tire passing the sixteenth pole, tried to squeeze through a narrow opening with about a hundred yards to go, took up sharply
and lost all chance. MISS PERU broke out and bumped CAPO SORELLA at the break, raced on the outside of the trio tracking behind the two pacesetters,
came under pressure passing the five-sixteenths pole then flattened out in the stretch. KLOE'S LADYBUG broke out at the break and took up after making
contact with OOPS AND DOWNS, fell far behind then continued to trail throughout and was not persevered with when hopelessly beaten. THE RIDER OF
OOPS AND DOWNS LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF CAPO SORELLA FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED CAPO SORELLA DRIFTED OUT IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, IMPEDED OOPS AND DOWN AND
COST THAT RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER PLACING. CAPO SORELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER sent to establish the early lead, showed speed while dictating terms into the turn, extended the lead along the bend and was well
handled while carving decent fractions to the quarter marker, kicked clear into the stretch, felt late pressure from oncoming rivals, dug in into deep stretch
and lasted for the win. GABBY HAYES broke slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the rear, raced between rivals into the turn, raced in traffic and
waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch while two wide, found room into upper stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, closed well
into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not catch HONEYMOONZ OVER and was up in the final strides to secure second.
ALEXANDER'S DREAM tracked the decent early pace from the outside, gained ground three wide along the turn, maintained a three wide path into the
drive and moved closer at the furlong pole, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in HONEYMOONZ OVER in deep stretch and just missed for second
at the wire, while holding clearly for third. EL ALTO HOMBRE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to HONEYMOONZ OVER and stalked that runner through
solid fractions into the turn, lost a bit of ground while chasing the pace approaching the quarter pole, raced three wide into the stretch, was outkicked at the
furlong marker and could not muster a final response. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM rated off of the solid early pace, was well positioned while three deep
approaching the turn, shifted out a path along the bend and mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch, lost ground at the
furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD forwardly placed in the early running, chased the decent from the inside heading into
the turn, lost ground at the quarter marker, came in a bit tight while chasing from the rail into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and lacked a
late rally.
