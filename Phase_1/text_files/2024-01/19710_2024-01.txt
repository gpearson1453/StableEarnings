Footnotes
MOM'S OPAL was bumped into the first turn and guided outside to be in the clear, then rated three wide kindly, made a three wide move nearing the quarter
pole, then continued that move off the turn and hit the front nearing the sixteenth marker but seemed to hang once hitting the front but did prevail late to
prove best under a drive. KOKOPELLI GIRL vied for the lead and made a inside bid to shake clear by the quarter pole, then was headed leaving the furlong
marker, dug in and came again in the final sixteenth to just miss. WARRIOR ON THE RUN was in tight into the first turn, then settled on the inside, eased
off the inside on the far turn and came five wide off the turn and was up for the show award. WARRIOR BERNICE prompted the early pace four wide, made
a three to two wide bid nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the drive, lost show award late. ZIFFY BUG broke inward at the start, tracked the pace on
the inside and weakened. HURRICANE BON was in tight into the first turn, then settled on the outside and had no rally. ALLOVERNOW BABYBLU vied for
the lead three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH tracked the early leaders three wide, then was between rivals by the quarter pole and waited for room leaving the turn, split rivals by
the furlong marker and closed late to get up to finish on even terms for the win. MY REDEMPTION was allowed to settle early, advanced two wide on the
turn, came three wide off the turn and angled in for racing room and closed up the inside to get up to finish on even terms. WISH FOR PEACE was reserved
early, made a inside move on the far turn and got through on the inside leaving the turn to gain command off the turn but was caught in deep stretch to just
miss. BESTSUGARDADDYEVER was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the far turn and came six wide off the turn but hung late.
DYNAMITE KARMA tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to vie for command but weakened in the final furlong. FUNKENSTEIN was
settled early between rivals and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT ACT was five wide into the first turn, reserved three wide and had no rally. NOT NORMAL set a
pressured pace on the inside and gave way in the drive. TWO THIRTY FIVE pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for

KEEPING IT COUNTRY was well rated towards the inside, made a bid on the turn and was floated out four wide off the turn and took over and drew off to
prove much the best to prove best while being ridden out. UNCLE DAR set the early pace from the inside, drifted out leaving the quarter pole and was
confronted by the winner and proved to be no match for that rivals while clearly second best. ZAMBONI WARRIOR chased the early pace four to three wide,
angled in and saved ground on the turn and made a mild bid off the turn but could not sustain that bid while saving the show award. TIZ SPEEDY was
reserved early, two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. SHY DA RUNNER stalked the pace three wide and weakened. YO
NESSROUNDONKERN was reserved early, three wide on the turn and was not a threat. BANJO chased the pace on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
TEXAS TANGIE prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn to take over nearing the furlong marker, then kicked clear to prove best
under crop urging. MOONSHINE WARRIOR stalked the early pace four wide and came four wide off the turn, finished willingly coming in leaving the
sixteenth marker and bumped WARRIOR'S MISS with eighty yards left and gained the place award. WARRIOR'S MISS was rated along two wide, then was
in range off the turn but was boxed inside and then was in tight by the sixteenth marker and was bumped late while needing more. SPEEDY BUBBLES set
the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the three sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. MO TOUGH was far back early showing no speed on
the inside, angled out in the lane and improved position. FANCY WARRIOR was settled four wide early, four to three wide on the turn and was not a threat.
AUGIE'S GIRL chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
LIVING WATER was away alertly and crossed over to the inside to press the pace, saved ground on the turn and made a inside bid off the turn and slowly
edged away in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. U U STAR set a pressured pace while racing off the inside, three wide on the turn and shook
clear by the quarter pole but was out-kicked in the final furlong while staying on to be second best. BEYOND THE BEND was settled early on the inside, two
wide on the turn while advancing, came four wide off the turn but had no late kick, bested rest. SANTO was reserved early on the inside, two wide by the
quarter pole and had a belated rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. FEDERAL CASE chased the early pace and was three wide on the turn and had
no rally. SPOOKY ONE tracked the pace three wide and then was empty in the drive. BUCK WILD was off slowly, trailed the field, swung out and came five
wide off the turn and was not a threat. ANNAMATED MOON chased the pace on the inside and tired.

RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the lane and made a outside bid to draw away in the final furlong to prove best
under a drive. MAKE A SPLASH was allowed to settle on the inside, shifted out leaving the turn with run, but was blocked by the furlong marker and had to
check off heels and angle out to the far outside and then was up for the place award. WAHINE MEANIE was well rated while traveling three wide, made a
three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to vie for command off the turn, then exchanged bumps by the furlong marker and flattened out while saving the
show award. INCONTROVERTIBLE set a pressured pace on the inside, then vied for command by the quarter pole and exchanged bumps by the furlong
marker and faded. ELEVENMONTHSLATER pressed the pacesetter two wide, then made a bid to vie for command on the turn and was in between rivals
leaving the quarter pole, then was bumped around by the furlong marker and faded. NANASQUAN was settled early, advanced three to four wide on the
turn but tired in the drive. LADYNESS failed to respond. The rider on number six ELEVENMONTHSLATER claimed two OBJECTIONS concerning the run
around the furlong marker, after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS DISALLOWED both OBJECTIONS and the race was left as is.

Footnotes
ARISTOCAT set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the far turn and widened the margin off the turn and then remained clear to the wire to
prove best, driving. SOUPER CATCH was rated along between rivals early, advanced three to two wide on the turn, then finished willingly but could not get
to the winner while clearly second best. CAPE HEDGE was settled back early, took to the outside on the backstretch while advancing, then was three wide
on the far turn but flattened out in the drive while gaining the show award. SUNNY SAINT stalked the early pace and then went up to press the winner four
wide by the half mile marker, then could not match strides with that rival on the turn and weakened in the drive. HROTHGAR pressed the winner early, then
was between rivals by the half mile marker and weakened on the far turn on the inside. GUSHING OIL was rated early on the outside, four wide on the
backstretch and tired. JUST NOD AND SMILE was reserved early on the inside, two wide on the far turn and was not a threat. ALWAYS FORGIVEN
chased the early pace on the inside under a hard hold and tired. PURPLE SHIRT was reserved early, four wide by the quarter pole and was not a factor.
