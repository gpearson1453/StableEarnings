sixteenth pole and drew clear. MR. AMERICAN raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied to gain the place late. CHEYENNE

three and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
GREAT ANALOGY chased in the two path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and rallied
past inner foes in the final furlong. TOO MUCH VINO laid up close in the five path, bid three wide passing the three-eighths, tipped out to the six path
turning into the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. ESOTERIC prompted the pace in the three
path, bid between foes in the two path around the turn, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. BURNAWAY rated in the four
path, was driven in the six path turning into the lane, but made no impact. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC set the pace inside, was ridden into the turn, but yielded
from the two path in upper stretch. AWESOME ANNMARIE raced off the pace in the five path and never menaced.

Footnotes
CYMBAL COURT had early speed inside, was content to let WHISKEY DIAMOND clear off nearing the far turn, re-bid two wide around the bend, seized
command leaving the quarter pole and drew off under confident handling. BUSY MORNING settled off the pace while racing two wide and ran on to gain the
place. DEFENDED raced in range two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ONE OF ONE chased the pace three wide,
angled six wide in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. YOGA was outrun while racing four wide. WHISKEY DIAMOND set the pace along the rail and
retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
ETNICO broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, was nudged along while just off the rail around the turn, then was coaxed while floating out to
the three path at the top of the lane, tipped back towards the rail, and held sway. ACADEMY CHOICE prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three
path around the turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and ran on for place. DR. PERRY trailed in the four path, tipped to the rail passing the
three-eighths, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and chased on for show. ONE AMERICA steadied at the start, chased in the three path, shifted
inside going into the turn, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, but flattened out on his left lead. SOUPER SUNSHINE tracked in the four path but
was empty in the three path entering the stretch. COOLER KING rated in the five path but was no menace.

JUST TAKE NOTES stalked the pace inside, came through at the rail nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. SAVANAH LADY stalked the
pace three and four wide, was no match for the winner but kept on to gain the place. DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT set the pace in the two path, was collared by the
winner near the quarter pole and held well enough to preserve the show. SURVIVAL ROSE raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter
pole and was one-paced through the lane. DERBY GIFT pressed the pace in the three path and tired nearing the quarter pole. CHEROKEE bobbled at the
start and was outrun inside. BRACCESCA played no factor while racing four wide.

IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) was held up along the inside turning into the backstretch, waited along the rail midway around the far turn, was cued turning
into the stretch, shifted out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and rallied to be up in the closing stages. ALYBAER broke in at the start, set the pace
inside, was cued midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, dug in to hold onto the lead passing the eighth pole, but
was caught late by an outer foe to place. AMUNET settled off the pace around the three path down the backstretch, was coaxed along in the three path
around the far turn, and kicked on from the four path in the stretch for show. JUDGE JUDITH laid up close in the two path, bid around the far turn, was cued
from the four path into the lane, but faded in the final sixteenth. MISCREANT rated between foes in the two path, was coaxed around the far turn, fanned out
to the eight path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. BOSTON PRINCESS stalked inside, swung out to the six path while under a ride turning into
the lane, but flattened. LITTLE GIA tracked in the three path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the
stretch, but weakened. EXCEPT TEMPTATION clipped heels with an outer foe leaving the gate, and trailed throughout from the three to five paths.

Footnotes
CARSOWN laid up close in the four path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, stuck his head in front while in the four path turning into the stretch, and
drew clear in the final furlong. TAPIT'S DIRECTION was prompted along while racing in range from the six path, ridden in the five path around the turn, and
stayed on down the stretch for place. ONE FAST DREAM stalked in the three path, was coaxed in the two path midway around the turn, and kept on from
the three path down the lane for show. JACKSON'S WEBB set the pace in the two path, was nudged along while staying off the rail rounding the turn, lost
the lead while tipping inside at the top of the stretch, and faded in the final furlong. TIZADUKE raced off the pace in the two path but made no impact.
MAKIZAN raced wellback in the four path, was driven in the seven path around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, but was no threat.
LAST SHIFT raced in midpack from out in the seven path and never menaced. BERNARDO'S LEGACY tracked in the five path but backed up around the
turn. WHADDYA MEAN chased in the four path but was empty entering the stretch. EL CHICO MALO trailed throughout around the seven path.
