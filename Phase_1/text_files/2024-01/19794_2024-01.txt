Footnotes
IMA BLING CAT pressed the early pace, raced three wide into the turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. AWESOME BID tracked the early pace,
raced six wide, was no match late and finished second best. MASK OFF set a pressured early pace from the inside and weakened. ARIMONY was allowed
to settle early from between rivals and flattened out. PATRIOT raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the turn and gave way. TAINO HOUSE was
reserved early while racing seven wide and offered no late rally. EMPEROR'S CHOICE was unhurried early, raced eight wide and never fired. LOTTA
GUSTO was void of any early speed, raced between rivals and was no factor. POOF HE'S GONE was unhurried from the inside and was never a threat.
BRICKHOUSE was taken back early, went five wide and was never in contention.

Footnotes
ESPIONAGE tracked the early pace, loomed five wide through the turn, was closing fast, took control late and edged clear for the win. GOOD WITH
PEOPLE set a pressured early pace from the inside, opened up in early stretch, drifted out sharply mid stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished
second best. GO WEST was up close early, advanced four wide through the turn, angled in mid stretch, re-rallied late and finished a game third.
COMPETITIVE IDEA broke awkward at the start, was rushed to be in a better position, found room along the inside and flattened out in the drive. OHHH
DADDY stalked the early pace, raced three wide into the turn and was finished early. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT was reserved early, raced five wide and
offered no late rally. SMOKE STACK was allowed to settle early, raced six wide and was no factor.
