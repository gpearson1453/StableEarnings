LOW SOCIETY was bumped at the start, then went up to set a pressured pace on the inside, then kicked away when straightened and drew off to prove
best under a couple right handed crops and then one left handed on to widen the margin to prove much the best. ANNA'S WISH was bumped at the start,
pressed the winner from between rivals, then proved to be no match for that rival while winning the place battle. PROGENY broke in and bumped a rival at
the start, prompted the pace from the outside and was three wide on the turn, then was outfinished for the place award. TAVIN chased the pace on the
inside, then was two wide on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn but was empty.

into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive kept to task. KUPP cut the pace just off the inside and then
along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, got collared at the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top
one and ran on clear of the rest and second best. WHO HOO THATS ME broke in at the start bumping FULL MOON NADNESS, chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. KOOL

STEADY PROGRESS stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to be clear by the furlong marker, then wandered about but lasted to
prove best under crop urging. PHANTOM JEWEL was well rated early on the inside under a hard hold, shifted out entering the far turn and advanced four
wide, then closed well in the lane to just miss. A LISTER set a pressured pace while in the three to two path, then was headed and passed nearing the
quarter pole, then was bumped by the furlong marker and shifted to the inside and came again late to gain the show award. NO SURRENDER tracked the
early pace from between rivals, then was ridden along and was in tight leaving the seven sixteenths, shifted out nearing the quarter pole and then came in
and bumped A LISTER by the furlong marker and had no late kick while needing more to just miss the show award. COMPROMISER pressed the pace
from the inside, then came off the inside leaving the far turn and faded grudgingly. DUDLEY DICKERSON was settled on the outside, then was ridden along
five wide on the far turn and came seven wide off the turn but had no late rally. I LOVE CARA was allowed to settle early and lacked a rally. COMANCHE
PEAK (GB) showed no speed and was always outrun.

Footnotes
CAPONE coaxed from the gate, vied from the two path inside a pair of rivals, tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and
drew off under a drive to prevail. UNCLE GEORGE vied five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, proved no match for the top one, kept on to secure the place honors. NEUSCHWANSTEIN
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in belatedly for the
show honors. KANT BEAT THE ROCK coaxed from the gate, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the

STARRY MIDNIGHT prompted the early pace two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to be take over off the turn and be clear by the furlong marker and
then maintained that clear advantage to the wire to prove best under crop urging. I FEEL THE NEED was allowed to settle early, moved out and made a
four wide move on the turn, then finished well to the wire to be second best. MISS KRISTY was allowed to settle early on the inside, shifted out on the far
turn and advanced two wide nearing the quarter pole, three wide off the turn and offered a mild late rally but needed more. GHOSTLY GIRL set the pace on
the inside, was headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. DOLCE SERA chased the early pace four wide, shifted in by the nine
sixteenths and saved ground on the far turn bur weakened in the lane. JUST A NYQUIST stalked the early pace three wide, then was ridden along to try to
keep up ny the three eighths marker but tired.

Footnotes
THRILL OF IT chased the early pace on the outside, advanced nicely on the turn four wide, made a bid leaving the turn and drew away in the furlong
grounds to prove much the best under mild crop urging. WHAT'S UP BRO set the early pace while unchallenged, drew off on the turn while in the two path,
then began to shorten stride leaving the three sixteenths marker and was headed nearing the sixteenth marker and proved to be no match for the winner
while staying on for the place award. SCILLY CAY was settled early, two to three wide on the turn, then offered a mild late rally to best the rest. HORN OF
PLENTY was bumped at the start, chased the early pace towards the inside, eased out on the turn and came five wide off the turn but lacked the needed
rally. WRITER'S REGRET was reserved early two wide, swung out wide leaving the turn and offered no significant rally. BRONX BOMBER tracked the early
pace and then chased the front runner three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. WARRIORS REVENGE chased the pace on the inside and
stopped on the turn.
