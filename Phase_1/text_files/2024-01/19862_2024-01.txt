Footnotes
SPEIGHTFUL LILY led briefly before settling four wide in aim of the leader, advanced tucked three wide through the turn to duel with EASTERN STAR, took
over command swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, displayed a bit of greenness straightened away, then went clear under a drive to prevail.
EASTERN STAR coaxed from the gate, established the front after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, got joined by the top one through
the turn and dueled with that rival coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from command, proved
no match for that foe and weakened in the late stages while clear of the rest for the place honors. ECHO IN ETERNITY chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. SHE'S A NATURAL chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. MOONLIT WEEKEND coaxed from the start, chased five then three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. HAPPY'S SMILE coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CENTAVO brushed with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, came under coaxing while in the three path for most of the turn, shifted six
wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. KEYSTONE FIELD brushed with a rival early, was
urged along on the outside, chased in the five path for most of the turn then dropped to the four path, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear
into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while well clear for the place. SIMPLY brushed with a foe early, dropped back
under urging then angled in, saved ground early on the turn then shifted to the three path and lacked the needed response while up for the show then was
vanned off after the race. FORTY TWO ACE showed speed on the inside of a foe, moved clear inside the three-quarter pole, was asked in the two path on
the turn, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and tired then lost the show. DURKIN'S CALL showed
speed then tracked the pace on the outside, was roused while in mostly the four path on the turn, dropped to the three path briefly late on that bend before
shifting out to the five path and came up empty. LORD GATLING brushed with an opponent at the start while hustled, chased the pace, saved ground on
the turn and had nothing left. ALFIO was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and failed to respond. HANG TIGHT was a bit
unsettled in the gate then last to commence, dropped well behind the rest of the field, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came seven
wide into the stretch and was no factor.

BERGEN four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced and swung four to five wide into upper stretch, seized command near the
three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive and was ridden out through to the finish. IRIDESCENT coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with
EL DIVINO NINO to the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and was displaced from command near
the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one while well clear of the rest to be along second best. AIR CAV coaxed from the start, chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch and weakened. EL DIVINO NINO coaxed from the gate, dueled
along the inside of IRIDESCENT coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got shaken off near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch
and tired. STOLEN MAGIC coaxed from the start, chased three wide under a ride from midway on the turn, continued three wide at the top of the stretch,

Footnotes
RIDGEWOOD RUNNER was hustled to the front then moved in while going clear early, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe in the
two path on the turn, shook off that rival approaching the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, remained under
the crop until inside the furlong marker then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the finish while much the best. CUANDO moved out while settling off
the pace, advanced closer late on the backstretch, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved
no match while able to get the place. FIRST TRUMPET was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied
in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired while clear for the show. MUAZARAH settled off the pace, moved out leaving the
backstretch, was roused five wide on the turn and failed to rally. COOL OPERATOR tracked the pace on the inside of an opponent, dropped back under
urging at the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. MIDDLE MARKET was urged along on the inside of a foe, went
around the turn in the three path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. HAVE YOU HEARD was last to commence, raced on the outside while
urged along, went six wide on the turn and failed to respond. SOUNDS LIKE FUN was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BEACH BOY AL chased three then two wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong rolling by the leader just outside the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish to prevail.
LIGHT MAN broke in at the start pinching back DONEGAL SURGES in tandem with MESSI THE MAGICIAN and forcing that middle rival to steady out,
chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors. KAZ SUGAR BANK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to procure the show
honors while along clear of the rest. DONEGAL SURGES got away a half a beat slow and was pinched out by rivals on either side who each broke his way,
got forced to steady as a result and conceded four lengths to the front before settling into stride under brief hustling, chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved
position to the finish. ICY FLAVOR coaxed from the gate, spurted away on the lead along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole, then
got overhauled near the sixteenth pole when stopping weary and backed away through to the finish. BOURBON'S HOPE coaxed from the start, chased two
to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled out five wide into upper stretch, weakened. MESSI THE MAGICIAN broke out at the start
pinching back DONEGAL SURGES in tandem with LIGHT MAN, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. FLOWING RIVER broke in at the start filling the space left vacant by LIGHT MAN
and brushed with that foe, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing midway on the turn, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired.

sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the finish and narrowly prevailed. BEST IMPRESSION was off a step slow, angled out early then moved back in towards
the rear, advanced closer near the nine-sixteenths, came between horses while urged along in the two path on the turn, gained to make a bid inside of the
winner in upper stretch, dueled inside that foe while against the rail in the final furlong and was denied while well clear for the place. GROWTH RATE

wide outside the quarter-pole then came five wide into the stretch and tired but was clear for the show. YOU'RE FOREVER showed speed then disputed the

Footnotes
MAKER'S CANDY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from BOLD ENDEAVOR to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, came out three paths to look his main danger in the eye when that foe shifted out to get
a good look at UN OJO to his outside, dug in brushing at the sixteenth pole before gamely rebuffing the challenge to the wire. BOLD ENDEAVOR coaxed
from the gate, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
tipped out two to three paths when UN OJO ranged up to his outside, dug in fighting on to the finish knocking heads through the stretch but was ultimately
denied at the end. UN OJO broke in a step at the start bumping CHAMPIONS DREAM, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, ran on under a drive outside the top pair but was ultimately repelled to the finish. TRAFALGAR two to three wide in pursuit from
the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ALTERNATE REALITY
chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. STOLEN BASE chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CHAMPIONS DREAM got bumped at the start by UN OJO, who broke in a step,
chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
ROCCO STRONG moved from the two path to the four path on the first turn, settled in third position on the outside, chased in the four path on the far turn,
gained to take the lead at the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. OVERSTEP prompted the pace on the outside
in the three path, tracked the leader starting five furlongs from the finish, chased in the three path on the far turn and narrowly earned the place while no
match for the winner. MACALLAN bumped with a rival shortly after the start, went three wide on the first turn, was urged along at the rear, traveled four then
five wide on the far turn and just missed the place while clear for the show. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER broke out and bumped with a foe, moved out early,
went three then four wide on the first turn, dropped in a bit onto the backstretch, settled off the pace, shifted out inside the half-mile pole, was urged three
then four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SUERTE bumped with foes just after the start, went four then five wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the final turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while under the
crop and came up empty. MAMA'S GOLD was hustled to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead at
the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
REDDINGTON disputed the pace loosely between horses, vied in the four path on the turn, responded well while asked for his best in upper stretch, fought
inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging. MAGICAL WAYS angled in under urging outside the three-quarter pole,
moved closer late on the backstretch, shifted out into the turn, chased three then four wide on that bend, was driven six wide into the stretch, rallied to make
a bid outside the eighth-pole, battled with the winner in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. BARNSTORMING settled on the outside, was
roused five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and improved for the show. NIGHT EFFECT contested the pace on the inside of foes, vied
inside to the two path on the turn and weakened. MANDATORY pressed the pace on the far outside, vied in the five path on the turn, battled under a drive
while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong and tired. MAGIA NERA was urged along off the pace, dropped from the four path to the two path on
the turn, drifted out starting near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. HE'S GOT IT was urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MODERN ERA dropped well off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed
to threaten. VON HOFF contested the pace between horses, vied in the two to three path on the turn and tired. NEUSCHWANSTEIN chased the pace,
dropped back three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. JUNGFRAU was last away, dropped well back under urging, went five then six wide on
the turn and was no factor. ASSUME NOTHING was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. GUARD OF HONOUR
dropped well back, saved ground on the turn and showed little.
