seven sixteenths, was urged away passing the five sixteenths and was steadily handled in the lane. MAKE WAY saved ground on the first turn, gave chase
approaching the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased outward toward the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. NIGHT

settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward approaching the

Footnotes
OREO ANGEL settled in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead in the three path approaching the head of the lane,
then dug in determinedly to take the nod from the game stretch challenge of PASS THE CASH, who took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, was met
into the backstretch and dueled clear of Honey Please toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met nearing the head of the lane
and dueled gamely to the wire, but missed the nod. COLLECTED SUCCESS raced well back from early contention in the four path the first turn, bid nearing
the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed from that point, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished well at the outside withers of the winner.
DEE DEE SIX settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and passed
some rivals in the lane. CAUSETOWIN rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far
turn then flattened stride. SELES rated just off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
TOHONORSTELLE veered out at the break, saved ground racing well back on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. HONEY
PLEASE stalked two deep and dueled at even terms leaving the half mile pole, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far
turn. FOE WHAT ITS WORTH saved ground and was eased the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
AZZURRA settled off the pace in the two and three paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the nod three wide approaching the quarter,
dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to late stretch before being taken in hand. DRY WELL saved ground off the pace, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then dueled to take second mid-stretch. HONEY BELLA stalked off the rail then
challenged toward the three eighths pole, took a brief slim lead between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was met toward the quarter,
dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. BABA took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. COMPLETE SURPRISE rated close to the early pace
inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. BOURBON WILDCAT entered
the first turn about the five path, showed little response through the backstretch then saved ground on the far turn. MISS WAVE rounded the first turn about
the four path, appeared to be off stride in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, was eased from there and walked off post race.

Footnotes
STARSTREET stalked from the three path, steadied between horses past the five sixteenths pole then bid approaching the quarter, raced off the rail on the
far turn, dug in leaving the turn and took over the final yards. GABRIEL'S WING rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead at
the rail past the quarter pole, dug in under steady handling leaving the far turn but was caught in the final yards. ROYAL THUNDER rounded the first turn
about the three path, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and had range on the leader nearest the rail on the far turn, but relented in the
duel through the stretch. HAPPY CHARLIE rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn in the four path and ran evenly down the lane. URBAN BANDIT settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, entered the far turn near the rail, was eased to the three path through the turn and finished evenly. TOP OF THE MINT raced in the three
path the first turn, moved toward the outside leaving the turn and showed little response through the backstretch, then rounded the far turn in the five path.
HAPPY CHAMP rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn.
MYSTIFIED showed little response. STRETCH THE TRUTH rated the pace well off the rail and moved to mid track leaving the first turn, came under
pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met in the five path midway on the far turn then bolted approaching the head of the lane.
