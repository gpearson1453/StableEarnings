Footnotes
CRYSTAL QUEST settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, gained four deep rounding the far turn, closed
outside and was up late. MY LIFE STORY pressed the pace two wide, dueled two wide around the far turn, led to deep stretch but could not quite fend off
the winner. ANNOINTED was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside. HALON chased the pace two and three wide
and was outkicked in the lane. HOMER JONES raced in range inside, tipped out in upper stretch and finished evenly. CAN'T JUMP was hustled to the front,
set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. NO PLEBEIAN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SPEED CONTROL played
no factor while racing two wide. WILL OF A WARRIOR was outrun inside. TIBERIAN SUN saved ground early, went two wide around the far turn and never
threatened. WASAMATTAFOYOU bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
FLOWER MOUND stalked in the four path, bid three wide early around the turn, took command nearing the quarter, kicked away from the three path
passing the eighth pole, and held sway. DO GOODER vied for the lead in the four path before tipping into the two path heading into the turn, was coaxed
passing the three-eighths, but lost the lead to an outer foe approaching the quarter, angled out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place.
VYBES dueled for the lead in the two path before shifting to the rail going into the turn, was cued passing the three-eighths, lost ground while floating out to
the six path at the top of the lane, but held on to show. FLIGHT TO PARIS raced wellback in the three path, was driven along the inside around the turn,
shifted out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. FANTOMAH trailed in the five path early, was driven in the three path around the turn, but
made no impact. TAP MY BELLE was prompted along while in range from the five path early but weakened. EARNED DIVIDEND chased in the three path,
was coaxed in the four path around the turn, but came up empty. URGENCE raced off the pace in the four path and never menaced.

NINETYFOUR EXPOS set the pace just off the rail and held firm in the lane. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) stalked the pace three wide and finished willingly to gain
the place without seriously threatening the winner. ITALIAN SYMPHONY prompted the winner two wide and was one-paced in the lane. CLASSIC MO
TOWN raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied. ASK IN MY NAME went evenly inside. ARUBA was shuffled back at the
start, saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. HARRINGTON raced off the pace two and three wide, swung six wide turning for home and
was no threat.

Footnotes
WINNING AT EASE laid up close in the five path down the backstretch, was coaxed along to bid in the three path around the far turn, tipped out to the six
path at the top of the stretch, inched past the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth, and held off an outer foe. HARLAN'S LEGACY tracked in the four path,
was driven from the two path into the far turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. STREAKING GREY showed the way
in the two path around the first turn before floating out to the four path entering the backstretch, was roused in the two path midway around the far turn,
floated back out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but was caught by an outer pair in the final sixteenth to show. NANA FANNY trailed in the four
path, was roused into the far turn, but got stymied along the inside midway around the far turn, and failed to bid from the two path in the stretch. PRESSLY'S
HOPE rated in the two path, swung out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but flattened. RADIANT GEM raced off the pace in the five path
but made no impact from the seven path down the lane. CAMI RUNNER chased in the three path, but lost position heading into the far turn, and never
threatened. TEMPEREYA raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
ON THE NILE raced off the pace four wide, steadily gained four wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, seized command near the sixteenth
pole and drew clear. LADY O'BRIEN set the pace inside, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and held on for the place. DAY AWAY saved
ground off the pace around the first turn, angled five wide early on the backstretch, remained five deep around the far turn and ran on to gain the show.
TURF ROCKET rated back in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. SHE TAKES CASH pressed the pace two wide and tired in the stretch. TONY
BLUE TAPE tracked the pace from the rail and retreated through the lane. JOYFUL ELIZA (GB) saved ground off the pace, steadied near the five-eighths
pole, went two wide around the far turn and never threatened. COSMIC SYMPHONY was fractious behind and in the gate, was rank early, raced two and
three wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TIDAL FORCES laid prominently outside the pacesetter in the three path, stuck his head in front approaching the quarter, was cued into the lane, and drew
clear. HONESTO raced in midpack in the three path, was under right handed encouragement around the far turn, tipped to the rail in upper stretch, and ran
on for place. BACKWOODS BOOGIE laid up close just behind the pacesetter in the two path, was coaxed in the three path passing the three-eighths, and
kept on between rivals down the stretch for show. EL SOCIO stalked in the five path, loomed while under rousing around the far turn, but was one paced
from the four path down the lane. SAND DANCER broke slowly but was unhurried in the three path turning into the backstretch, got cued in the five path
midway around the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the stretch, but made no impact. KLICKITAT tracked in the four path, was driven in the six
path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. UNIFIED WEEKEND set the pace in the two path but faded
along the inside in the stretch. MOST WANTED MAN had a slow start, raced wellback in the three path and failed to bid. BURNING MAN raced off the pace
in the four path, fanned out to nine path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. SOLAR rated in the two path early but never threatened. WICKED
SUPRISE chased in the five path but was empty turning into the stretch. COACH ABERNATHY bobbled at the start and trailed throughout.

wide in upper stretch, closed outside, took the lead in deep stretch and dug in between foes to just hold off a late surge from the runner-up.
CONGLOMERATE raced well back two wide, swung six wide nearing the quarter pole, closed down the center of the track and just missed. FLY THE W
settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced in the four path around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and gave way
grudgingly. CHANTRY FLATS bumped with the winner at the start, stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. THE BEST
DISTANCE bumped BRYCE CANYON at the start, set the pace in the two path to upper stretch and weakened. BRYCE CANYON was bumped at the start,
saved ground well back and never threatened. RACE CRAFT raced up close inside and faded in the lane. SIX MINUS was outrun inside.

Footnotes
BRING THEBAND HOME set the pace in the three path, was roused midway around the turn, kicked away in upper stretch, and held clear. XY SPEED
chased in the three path, was cued in the six path midway around the turn, and rallied from the seven path down the lane for place. PORTOFINO pressed in
the two path, was coaxed from the three path passing the quarter, and kept on for show. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE prompted the pace in the three path, tipped
out to the four path around the turn, and finished evenly from the five path in the stretch. FAMOUS GENT rated in the two path, was driven in the three path
turning into the stretch, but made no impact. SPY HUNTER tracked inside, tipped out to the five path and was cued into the turn, swung from the six path
into the stretch, but had to steady passing the eight pole, and could not factor. RICHY stalked inside but faded on his left lead in the stretch. SHEKKY
SHEBAZ bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, was roused from the rail passing the quarter, but did not threaten. STERLING
HARMONY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback between foes in the four path but did not factor. BAIE LONGUE raced off the pace in the
five path and never threatened. BALTIC MULE also raced off the pace while between foes in the three path, but had to steady going into the turn, and never
menaced.

Footnotes
SWEET MIMI set a clear pace along the rail, angled off the rail in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. MAMA BELLA saved ground in midpack, was
bumped near the five-eighths marker, continued to race at the rail around the far turn, rallied inside, tipped out late and gained the place. SPEAK UP tracked
the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and kept on to hold the show. KISSING ROCK was reluctant to load, raced off the pace three and four
wide and had a mild rally. CATE'S CHARM broke a bit awkwardly, prompted the winner two wide and weakened in the stretch. HELLO HOLLYWOOD was
bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. TWISTED ROMANCE chased the pace two wide, bumped a foe midway down the
backstretch, continued two wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. REDO was bumped at the start, checked soon after, saved ground and was never a
factor. EASY STREET failed to menace while racing two wide around the first turn, four wide around the far turn and angling seven wide in upper stretch.
CELEBRITY RO was pinched back at the start, raced well back inside early, went three wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch and
lacked the needed rally. AARALYN bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. YES TO CHAMPAGNE chased the pace three
wide and faltered nearing the lane.
