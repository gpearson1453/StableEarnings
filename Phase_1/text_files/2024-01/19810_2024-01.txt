Footnotes
BEER BALI tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, challenged in upper stretch and dueled to the wire to
just get up for the win. SUMMER GOLD led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the bend and dueled
gamely to the finish to narrowly miss. LUNA AMARILLA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the
turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily late. FIRELANE chased the leader between horses up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. THIRSTY DATE raced in the middle of the pack between horses early,
continued around the turn in the four path and showed no kick. AMARULA SUN hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. GATOR TWENTY FIVE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening
stages, came around the bend in the two path and was empty from there.

around the bend and improved position in the stretch. EILAT dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the
bend, and could not go with the top finishers in the stretch but kept on to the wire. SHEZA RAJUN CAJUN bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the

around the second turn in the three path and never threatened. RADIANT QUEEN raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the
pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend still in the two path and showed no kick. COURT STAR raced in the three path
around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and faded
from there. LIME TREE saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the second turn and was
empty in the lane. CAMEO ROSE saved ground early, raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail well behind the
field from the rail coming around the far turn and was not a factor.
