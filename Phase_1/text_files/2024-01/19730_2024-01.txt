stretch four wide, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. CAJUN BLAST raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn,
went to the wire evenly and proved no match for the top two. BRILLIANT SPIN raced within striking distance, faded and was no threat late. KING OF
MISCHIEF trailed throughout and was never a threat.

Footnotes
COMMERCIAL FLASH pressed the pace, drifted in late down the backside, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. SERAPE raced within striking
distance, steadied late down the backside, angled out, made a late bid and finished willingly. SUZY DOLL'S READY vied on the front end, raced close
throughout and was outfinished by the top two. DOLLY'S GUITAR challenged for the early advantage and lacked a late kick. D'WILD MUFFIN lacked early
speed, moved to the outside around the turn and was never a factor. TRACK SMART raced near the middle of the pack, faded and was no threat late.
BRAVE CITY GIRL always raced near the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #4 SERAPE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #5
COMMERICAL FLASH FOR INTERFERNCE LATE DOWN THE BACKSIDE. AFTER VIEWING RELAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #5 FROM 1ST AND
PLACED HER 2ND.

Footnotes
LAGOON raced near the back in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, entered the stretch five wide, rallied and proved the best down the
lane. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. COPTER went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground around the turn and lacked a late kick. BERTIE'S GALAXY pressed the pace, raced close throughout and lacked a finish.
RITHM NIC void of early speed and was never a factor. AHIMAAZ raced within contention, dropped back and was outrun. JANETS JAY JAY raced near the
back, was pulled up entering the home stretch and vanned off.

HEAD raced close throughout and was outfinished, while running a game third. COUNTRY CAT JAKE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and
lacked a late kick. GLORIA'S BOY lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid, but was no factor. WILDCATS'S MEOW void
of early speed and passed tired ones. CRAFTY ONE went to the front, drove clear and faded. A BRAVE RIDE always raced near the back and showed little.
