Footnotes
MY DAD IS THIRSTY broke well, ceded the early lead to EFFECTIVE GIG and was content to alternately stalk and press the slow pace to the far turn,
moved to challenge that foe in earnest from the three furlong pole, pulled even at the three-sixteenths, battled down the lane and gradually wore down that
rival to prevail. DARK MYSTERY kept to the inside, pulled up close through the clubhouse turn, then dropped back a bit, made steady forward progress
down the backstretch, then came under a ride passing the five-sixteenths pole, responded to steady handling down the lane, kept to a drive and was up for
second. EFFECTIVE GIG broke well and got first run into the first turn, went relatively unchallenged and slowed down the pace significantly, held sway to
the far turn, hand plenty in reserve for the stretch run, battled MY DAD IS THIRSTY to deep stretch then gave way grugdingly in the final yards. TITOS
WITH A TWIST broke out and bumped with MY DAD IS THIRSTY at the start, pulled three wide into contention through the first turn then settled mid-pack
down the backstretch while still wide, kept that same path through the far turn, made a good run down the stretch but was not good enough. LOVE OF THE
SPORT was not asked for speed from the start, settled near the rear of the field under a hold, pulled forward down the backstretch while still under a hold,
was let loose with three furlongs to run, got an inside run through the far turn and finished well but could not catch the others. UNUSUAL CODE went three
to four wide through the first turn, pulled up to vie for the lead passing the six furlong pole but opted to drop out of a potential speed duel and was
comfortable tracking several lengths behind the slow pace, came under a ride passing the three furlong pole, swung four wide into the stretch and could not
improve position. SHERM lacked speed while kept to the inside, started to lose ground going into the far turn then was pulled up near the five-sixteenths
marker, walked off under his own power and was reported to have bled following the race.

Footnotes
DR PESCADO broke alertly, ceded the early lead and pressed the decent pace outside of LAUGHING LEGACY, kept pressure on the decent pace into the
turn, was roused three wide into the stretch and took command heading to the furlong pole, kicked to a clear lead into the final sixteenth and drew away in
the late stages for a convincing win. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW chased the decent early pace four wide, gained ground along the turn, was outkicked into the
stretch and was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth, battled for place honors with LAUGHING LEGACY into deep stretch and outfinished that
rival for second. LAUGHING LEGACY hustled leaving the start, assumed early command and set a decent pace while pressured into the turn, carved out
the pace while pressured to the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and chased DR PESCADO to the furlong marker, could not match strides
with the winner and weakened inside of the furlong pole, battled with HOWDOYALIKEMENOW for place honors into deep stretch and was outfinished for
second, while holding safely for third. BRANNIGAN tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was well positioned heading into the turn and saved
ground to the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. JOHNNY
PAYCHECK forwardly placed away from the start, rated just off of the decent early pace and tracked two wide and between runners into the turn, inched
closer while between rivals heading to the quarter pole, slipped to the inside into upper stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, lacked a response
in the final sixteenth and gave way. EL BERRINCHES raced close up to the decent early pace, stalked three wide and between runners heading into the
turn, maintained a three wide path to the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
GONNA GETCHA GOOD unhurried away from the start, tracked the solid early pace from the outside and raced three then two wide into the turn, gained
ground into upper stretch then waited for racing room into the drive, angled four to five wide and loomed at the furlong marker, responded to urging and
rallied into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and edged away to prevail in the final strides. DRIVER'S ED showed good early speed away
from the start, vied for the lead then pressed BOSS NINE through solid fractions heading into the turn, pressed inside of BOSS NINE approaching the
quarter marker, battled with that rival into upper stretch and drifted out under firm left-handed urging approaching the furlong marker, lost the lead to
ELCONDOR inside of the furlong pole then re-rallied into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and outfinished ELCONDOR in the
final strides to secure the place. ELCONDOR sent to establish forward position leaving the start, raced close up to the solid early pace then took back
heading into the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker and gained ground nearing the top of the stretch, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took a
narrow advantage at the furlong pole, was overtaken by the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished for second in the final strides. YOU
ENJOY MYSELF allowed to settle while not far back early on, tracked the solid pace from the inside into the turn, chased the leaders to the quarter pole,
mounted an inside rally into upper stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. BOSS NINE a step slow away from the
start, rushed up in the early going and contested the solid pace three wide, took a narrow lead heading to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker
while off of the rail, battled for the lead into the stretch with DRIVER'S ED then was bumped by that rival approaching the furlong pole, lost position into the
final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. LOADED MUSKET rated off of the solid early pace, tracked between rivals into the turn, chased three wide to
the quarter marker then tipped four wide for the drive, gained ground at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. THE STEWARDS UNANIMOUSLY RULED THAT DRIVER'S ED DRIFTED INTO THE PATH
OF BOSS NINE APPROACHING THE FURLONG MARKER BUT THIS INCIDENT DID NOT COST BOSS NINE THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER
PLACING, AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ADAPTED MEMORY stalked the early pace, raced two wide into the turn then drifted to the four path nearing the quarter marker and carried out APRICOT
BRANDY at that station, recovered and mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and
confronted ALONG CAME JOANN, was floated out by the drifting ALONG CAME JOANN in deep stretch while battling that rival and got up in the final
strides to dead heat for the win. ALONG CAME JOANN away in good order, took back off of the contested early pace and tracked from the outside, raced
two wide into the turn, was roused three wide at the quarter marker and loomed into upper stretch, took command and led to the furlong pole, was kept to
task to the sixteenth-marker, met the bid of ADAPTED MEMORY into deep stretch while drifting out and lasted in the final strides to share for the win.
SELSAE rated off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn then angled three wide nearing the top of the stretch, improved position at the furlong
marker, could not match strides with the top two in the late stages but was gaining in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. TAMARANDO COAST
sent leaving the start, assumed early command then was engaged by BREVILLE and contested the decent pace with that rival, disputed the pace inside of
BREVILLE along the bend, came under pressure into the stretch and was overtaken by ALONG CAME JOANN, chased that runner to the furlong pole and
gave way in the late stages. BREVILLE showed speed leaving the break and engaged with TAMARANDO COAST in the early stages, contested decent
fractions outside of that rival heading into the turn, was overtaken by ALONG CAME JOANN into upper stretch, chased that runner to the furlong marker
and tired in the final sixteenth. APRICOT BRANDY chased the decent early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into the turn then was carried five
wide approaching the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and could not muster a late response. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALONG CAME JOANN CAME OUT INTO THE PATH OF ADAPTED MEMORY IN
THE FINAL SIXTEENTH AND IN DOING SO COST ADAPTED MEMORY THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. ALONG CAME JOANN WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
WESTWARD BREEZE broke a step slowly and was unhurried away from the start, improved position while a bit keen in the early stages and was well
placed heading into the turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker then tipped four wide for the drive, continued her sustained run to mid-stretch,
responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, overtook her stablemate in deep stretch and held safely in a drive to prevail. MORNING ADDICTION
showed good early speed and assumed command leaving the break, dictated terms while setting a fast pace into the turn, showed the way while off of the
rail and was pressed the to the quarter marker by LADY GREGORY, battled with that runner into the stretch and shook free at the furlong pole, met the bid
of WESTWARD BREEZE into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch and held well for second. ROSES R BLUE rated off of the
fast early pace while not far back, maintained an outside path into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung four then five wide for the
drive and made a mild gain at the furlong pole, closed well into the final sixteenth, was gaining into deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. LADY
GREGORY away in good order, vied for the early lead then ceded to MORNING ADDICTION, stalked the fast pace three wide into the turn, pressed
MORNING ADDICTION through quick fractions heading to the quarter pole and battled into the stretch, lost a bit of ground at the furlong pole, was
outkicked into the final sixteenth and was tagged for third in the final strides. DONNE CATTIVE forwardly placed while in a bit tight in the early running,
shifted to the inside and stalked the fast pace into the turn, was well positioned while saving ground into the stretch, re-rallied approaching the furlong
marker, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. BOLD MISTRESS tracked the solid early pace from the inside, lost
position heading to the turn and chased the fast pace approaching the quarter marker, ran in pursuit two wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
grounds and did not offer a late response.

SILENT SUNDAY was content to sit behind the slow pace set by ATKINS racing two deep while always traveling well in hand, moved to challenge
approaching the quarter pole, went head-to-head for a furlong then gained a slight advantage over that foe once inside the furlong grounds and drove clear.
ARTEMUS GORDON broke out and bumped lightly with EL JOY after the start, went forward quickly and tracked three wide behind the pacesetter and just
outside of SILENT SUNDAY, could not quicken with the latter on the turn but was able to muster up a strong finish to gain the place. EL JOY was forced
outward by ARTEMUS GORDON then angled over to the rail after the break once clear, allowed to settle at the rear of the compact field, stayed to the
inside through the far turn responded to steady handling and intermittent urging and finished well but was nosed out for second. ATKINS was quick into
stride and seized the early lead, was able to slow down the pace to a crawl while keeping a measured length or two ahead of the others, was challenged by
SILENT SUNDAY from the quarter pole, had plenty in reserve, battled back with that rival down the lane but weakened in the final furlong.

J T'S WATCH settled two wide into the first turn, tracked the modest pace in traffic and while between rivals through the backstretch run, gained ground at
the half-mile marker and chased two wide into the far turn, was roused three wide into the stretch and loomed heading to the furlong marker, took a narrow
lead at mid-stretch, battled with MADE THE TEAM while holding that one at bay into the final sixteenth, dug in determinedly in deep stretch and held in a
drive for the win. MADE THE TEAM close up to the early pace, attended to the modest fractions into the backstretch run and prompted BRONZE WARRIOR
to the half-mile marker, dueled with that runner into the far turn and battled into upper stretch, was confronted by J T'S WATCH nearing the furlong pole,
fought with that foe into the final sixteenth, could not get by determined winner in deep stretch and held safely for second. GALLANT WARREN tracked the
modest early pace from the second flight, raced outside of runners along the first turn and came four wide into the backstretch run, was well placed heading
to the half-mile pole and was guided two wide into the far turn then waited for racing room at the quarter pole, shifted three wide for the drive and ran evenly
to mid-stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not catch the top pair in deep stretch and held clearly for third at the finish. BRONZE WARRIOR broke
alertly and assumed command away from the start, set the pace while well rated into the backstretch run, set modest fractions while pressed to the quarter
pole, battled into the stretch, could not match keep pace inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the final sixteenth. TEX HANLEY forwardly placed
leaving the start, stalked the modest pace from the inside, saved ground into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while within aim of the lead and
lacked a response in the late stages. KO SAMUI (IRE) settled off of the early pace while not far back, raced widest into the backstretch run and maintained
a four wide path into the far turn, lost a bit of ground into the stretch and could not muster a late rally. WELLSWORT (IRE) unhurried early on, saved all of
the ground to the second turn, improved position into the stretch and finished evenly. BROKEN FINGER stalked the modest pace from the outside, chased
three wide to the quarter marker, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
BOOK EM TAMO broke well then settled mid-pack two deep through the initial furlong, gained ground through the turn but became boxed in from the
five-sixteenths, had a hole to run through at the top of the stretch but was unable to take advantage, then split horse after passing the eighth pole, surged
ahead under steady handling and got up for the win. WE CAN was off a beat slow, raced on the rail in a good tracking position, held the inside through the
turn, slipped through an opening along the rail at the top of the stretch, took command, held sway to deep stretch, got a bit tired and was caught in the final
yards. LIGHT THE BEAM broke well but settled mid-pack while being ridden to keep up, made a forward move through the turn three or four wide, came
into the stretch still wide but produced a nice rally down the lane to gain third. READY TO STORM was rushed into contention from the break, hooked up
with SEEKET SAUCE before running a furlong, dueled with that one around the turn and into the stretch, was still in contention in deep stretch but was out
finished in the last sixteenth. GALLOPING MAJOR raced three wide throughout, was close up early then dropped back some through the turn, finished with
some interest but had trouble changing leads in the stretch. SEEKET SAUCE was hustled to the front from the break and first to the front, then joined by
READY TO STORM from the nine-sixteenths pole, dueled with that one through the turn, drifted out a little at the top of the stretch allowing WE CAN to slip
though on the inside, ran on willingly then was overtaken by several in the late stages. RANDY'SFURRYFRIEND broke outward, was being pushed on from
the break but did not display any early speed, raced extremely wide down the backstretch, moved a little closer to the rail through the turn, chased the field
into the stretch and could not make up any ground or improve position. CREATION broke a step slow, was outrun early, saved ground through the turn but
was never a factor.
