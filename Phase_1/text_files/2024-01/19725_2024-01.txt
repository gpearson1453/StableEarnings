Footnotes
RASPBERRY WINE rated off the top pair down the backstretch, slipped through along the rail into the upper stretch and edged clear under while racing in
hand to be a handily winner. LUPITA stalked the pace, swung five wide into the lane and finished well to get up for the place position. SWAYING LASSIE
tracked the early leader from the outside three wide and weakened a bit through the drive. LINDYSNOTOBNOXIOUS showed good early foot to set the
early pace, raced off the rail into the upper lane and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SNOWBIRD settled off the early pace setters, raced three wide
around the far turn and raced evenly with no closing run. STEPMONSTER dropped back near the back of the pack early, ridden into the far turn, fanned
wide into the upper lane and had no rally. INZAWAY void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened.

WHISPER'S MARK stalked the pace four deep from the outside of foes, took aim near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to edge up under strong
handling. KAYE dueled along the rail, dug in deep stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. ART CURATOR dropped back to race mid pack early on, hard
ridden to make a inside move near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. MI PRINCESA took up at the break, raced at the back of the pack after the
poor start, raced three wide around the far turn and moved up mildly to improve position. MOONLIT FOREST was hustled three wide from the outside of
rivals early and weakened in the stretch run. ZAPPIN void of early speed, saved ground around the far turn into the lane and had no response. KAMMYS
KASH dueled for the early lead two deep from the outside of rival, bore out nearing the quarter pole into the lane and was empty in the drive. CHARLIENE

raced six deep into the upper stretch and just missed in a game effort. STABILITY stalked the pace, raced three wide around the far turn, led narrowly near
the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. GALACTIC CORE was hustled along early, raced four deep near the quarter pole and was even late. FLEET
OF FLAGS tracked the early pace from the inside and weakened in the drive. LEAP DAY was sent to clear early lead and was empty late. HERMISTON
was hustled three wide early and was empty the final three sixteenths of a mile.

the upper stretch and flattened out. ROSES FOR SUZZETT raced mid pack early, was two deep near the quarter pole, angled out to race from the far
outside and raced evenly. SEE YOU AT THE TOP was off slowly, saved ground and never threatened. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES vied for the early lead
near the inside and stopped. BROADWAY DISH vied for the early lead three wide from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
SUPERCENTS rated from the outside down the backstretch, made a three wide through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under strong handling.
MISS LUCKY LADY raced near the back of the pack early, was near the rail near the five sixteenths pole, angled out to race from the far outside in the
stretch run and rallied for the place position. ILOVEHER settled off the pace setters, saved ground around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to
improve position. SPARKLE IN THE SKY vied for the early lead two deep and weakened. FIRST TIME PLAYER was forwardly placed early along the inside
and faded. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE void of early speed, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. SIMPERING SMILE tracked the
pace from the outside of foes and faded. CHARITY WATER stalked the pace, raced four to five wide around the far turn and tired. WHAT A MEMORY
swung wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.

QUITE LOVELY dueled for the early lead near the rail and held well to prove best under strong handling. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL was off slowly, raced
off the early pace after the poor start, circled the rivals seven around the far turn into the upper stretch, aim near the three sixteenths pole but could not get
by in a game effort. ARTFUL ROSE dropped back early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out and finished willingly to the wire. BERNICE
WHO settled off the early pace to race mid pack, made a five wide bid near the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch run. LA DIAMANT stalked the
pace, raced four wide around the far turn and raced evenly with no closing run. CATTY DOM void of early speed, swung wide into the upper stretch and
never threatened. MISS JAX was unhurried early, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, shifted out four wide and never threatened. EVIL TEMPTATION
dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and faded. MADDIE POPPE tracked the early pace along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
ROCKY BAR SIX stalked the dueling pair, made a three wide through the far turn and held well late under strong encouragement. RUNNINGINTHERAIN
broke awkwardly, raced near the back after the poor start, moved up around the far turn, blocked near the quarter pole, angled to race from the far outside
and closed in gamely to the wire. SIGALERT stalked the pace, checked between rivals near the three sixteenths pole, raced five to three wide through the
drive and finished gamely late. BLUEGRASS FAITH was coaxed along from the inside and was outkicked in the final stages. MT. TAYLOR was fanned
seven wide into the upper lane and flattened out. ARIMONY void of early speed, raced wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. RHODIUM
RUNNER dropped back to race mid pack early, saved ground and lacked a bid. SILVERWIND dueled for the early lead from the inside and gave way.
ROSE GIRL dueled two wide from the outside of rival and stopped.

Footnotes
OFFENSIVE was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and finished well to prove best under strong handling.
HESA PROSPECTOR rated between horses early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, shifted in, split rivals near the eighth pole and finished gamely
to the wire. TRUST MANDO was coaxed along from the outside, raced four wide between near the quarter pole and kept on gamely to the wire. JUVAL was
allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and closed in mildly. GATLING GOLD dropped back off the early pace, raced from the far
outside in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. MAJORWAYHOME set a pressured early pace along the inside and gave way. CHUCKIES
CHANCE raced mid pack early, saved ground and had no late rally. LUCK IN MY EYES void of early speed, swung wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
SANTIAGO'S TOWER raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. STRYDER raced mid pack along the inside, checked sharply
near the half mile pole and never threatened. REINING PESOS pressed the early going between rivals and gave way. ZENFULLY ZESTY failed to sustain a
bid.
