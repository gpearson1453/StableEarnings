off the inside, vied in the three path on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and drew off under strong urging. PRINCE
OF JOY bumped with a rival after the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four then five path on the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper
stretch, chased that opponent into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. FLAMINGO HAWK chased the pace on the outside,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. DATESFREEDOM came
outward at the start then brushed with a foe, moved up to race just off the pace, chased the leader late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two

backstretch, dropped back in the five path into the turn then shifted to the three path early on that bend, remained in the three path into the stretch, moved

Footnotes
NOTAH was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while asked for more on the turn, responded well when
given two pops of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under a solid hand-ride from that point to the finish. G MUNNING pressed the
pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch, pursued that foe under a drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while just able to get the place. BAD TO THE BONES was urged along off the pace, gained in the three path on the turn, turned into the
stretch under the crop and just missed the place while well clear for the show. WHAT A BLAST was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two path and came up empty. BATTUTA D'ORO was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced on the outside under
urging, moved in near the five-eighths pole, went three then four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. NEWPORT BRIDGE
stumbled at the start but broke towards the front, moved out near the three-quarter pole then angled further out, chased the pace on the outside, went
around the turn in the four path, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
ROYAL TRYST settled under some urging, moved in on the backstretch, saved ground going around the turn, gained in upper stretch and closed well along
the rail to get up late and prevail. JEMOGRAPHY pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, was asked while taking the lead coming
to the five-sixteenths, inched clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, led while shortening stride into the final sixteenth but was caught while
able to hold the place. BUSINESS MODEL was last away then dropped back under urging while void of speed, went two then three wide on the turn, was
driven four wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF was hustled from the gate, set the
pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the three then two path on the turn, lost the advantage under urging at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the
final furlong and tired. SCILLY CAY settled outside under some urging, traveled in the six path on the turn and was no factor. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN
broke a bit awkwardly, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the five path, dropped to the three path near the quarter-pole and failed to
respond. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN RACED FOR PURSE-MONEY ONLY

times with a foe while kept in behind foes near the nine-sixteenths, was roused while inside to the two path for most of the far turn, shifted three wide late on
that bend, was driven four wide into the stretch, chased the runner-up on the outside into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole,
swapped back to his inside lead late and prevailed under strong urging. NO BURN went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved
from the rail to the three path while roused early on the far turn, chased the leader from that point, took the advantage near the five-sixteenths, drifted out in
the vicinity of the furlong marker, was headed outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the finish and missed while clear for the place. OLYMPIC
DREAMS went three to four wide on the first turn, was urged along on the outside, bumped multiple times with a rival near the nine-sixteenths, chased three
then four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. LAUGHING BOY was hustled to the front,
showed the way while inside to the two path, passed the half-mile pole under urging, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and
tired. QUALITY CHIC brushed with a rival while off a step slow, went four wide early on the first turn, tossed his head and steadied some while carried out a
path about midway through the first turn, dropped to the three path late on that bend, settled at the rear, was urged while inside to the three path on the far
turn and failed to threaten. TABEGUACHE was hustled from the start, tracked the pace in the two to three path, chased on the far turn and came up empty.
WINIT broke a step slow while brushing with an opponent, was keen while three then four wide on the first turn then reserved off the pace, went four wide
under urging on the final turn and failed to respond.
