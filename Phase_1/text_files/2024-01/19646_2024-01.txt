Footnotes
LADY CAIRO dueled on the pace for the first three-eighths, opened a clear advantage to mid-stretch and held on late. NOT TODAY pressed the pace from
the rail to the turn, dropped back on the bend and re-rallied down the lane to be closing late. BROADWAY CHARM stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three
wide to the top of the lane and flattened out. I GOT ANALYZED slow early to trail and finished as no threat. LUNA PRIMAVERA contended early and
steadily faded.

Footnotes
DANES LAST SONG settled in hand to stalk the pace down the backside under patient handling, circled three wide on the turn to take command turning for
home and battled determinedly through the lane to prevail. DANZANITEAWAY reserved off the early pace, mounted a four wide rally on the final turn while
steadily advancing to the leaders, dueled down the lane failing to pass the winner but finishing as a clear second best in a good effort. MOBIL MEMORY set
a pressured pace from the fence down the backside, shook off the presser leaving the quarter pole but could not go with the two circling closers down the
stretch. MY TWO JAKES dueled from two wide through the far turn and tired coming home. GHOSTLY REVIVAL went evenly and never threatened. LATE
DATE trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
STREET MAX slow early to trail through the first turn, circled six wide on the final turn while brushing rival on the bend, took command in upper stretch and
pulled clear in the drive. RESVALON reserved off the pace in mid-pack down the backside, rallied five wide on the turn, was brushed by winner on the turn
having to be held in place waiting for racing room, rallied well in the lane to be up for the place. MR LAOBAN rallied into the far turn with an early bid from
four wide to take a brief lead turning for home and failed to sustain his rally in the lane. MIGHTY FROSTED settled off the leaders down the backside, split
rivals in the turn to loom in upper stretch and finished evenly. KILLER BEE unhurried for the first half mile to race a the rear of the field and made a belated
late rally in the stretch. DOMI was well placed tracking the pace for a half and lacked a closing kick. GRAND GIZMO rallied in the far turn to threaten at the
quarter pole and failed to maintain his rally. PRIVATE CONNIE set a pressured pace to the far turn and gave way. MR. CELLULAR stalked the pace to
contend to the top of the lane and tired in the stretch. STAR DEPUTY chased the pace for a half mile and stopped, was pulled up at the eighth pole and
walked off.

JUST LIKE MAGIC unhurried early to be near the rear of the field for the first half mile, rallied up the rail while still in hand in the turn, cut the corner coming
home and quickly drew away down the lane as much best. SICILIAN STYLE TWO tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied to engage the leaders leaving
the quarter pole and finished well to be second best while no match for the winner. WILDCAT DREAM made a steady advance down the backside to take
the lead on the turn and flattened out in the drive. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN prompted the early pace while well placed, was in striking position at the quarter
pole and finished evenly lacking a late rally. CHICA CHULA trailed and passed tiring rivals. CAPITAL GAL stalked the pace for a half mile and came up
empty. CANTHO sped off to a clear advantage down the backside and stopped going into the far turn.

MALIBU MARLEE reserved in mid-pack early, rallied six wide on the turn to range up in upper stretch and finished best of all to clear late in the lane. O K
BABY rated in mid-pack to the head of the lane and closed well splitting rivals in the stretch to be gaining late. ACT LIKE A LADY slow early to be the trailer
at the quarter pole, angled well wide in upper stretch and closed belatedly. LUCKY TUESDAY pressed the pace from three wide, took command turning for
home and was unable to sustain the rally. GRAND PRIZE dueled from between rivals to upper stretch on the lead and finished evenly. BASTET battled from
the inside on the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. DESIGNATE raced evenly failing to menace. ORBITING THE SKY contended while
caught wide into the turn and lacked a response when called upon. MANHATTAN LADY broke a step slow and never was a threat. CROSSTOWN GIRL
stalked the pacesetters through the turn and faded. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE dropped back through the turn and was not a factor.

AUJARA reserved off the early pace into the turn, rallied five wide to engage the leader in upper stretch and prevailed in a prolonged drive. MISSION GIRL
stalked the pace from four wide to the quarter pole, briefly took command turning for home, battled with the winner through the lane and was denied in the
final yards in a game effort. JETTIN PEGASUS raced at or near the rear of the field to the top of the lane and rallied belatedly to be gaining late. HIGHLY
EXPLOSIVE pressed the pace from between horses to the head o the stretch and lacked a finishing response. BOX STEP set the pace while dueling from
the rail for a half mile and weakened turning for home. CUE THE BAND was never athreat. DIVA POWER chased the early pace, and dropped back into the

Footnotes
THIRTYEIGHT WISHES settled in hand off the early pace, rallied five wide into the turn to engage the leaders at the quarter pole and pulled clear in upper
stretch and was not threatened late. READ THE ROOM tracked leaders to upper stretch and rallied well up the inside to gain the place. SPIRIT OF
SEATTLE stalked the pace through the turn and lacked a closing kick. AXED AVENGER broke a step slow, raced at the back of the main body of the field
and passed tiring rivals in the lane. CUSSIN N FUSSIN pressed the pace from four wide to upper stretch and weakened late in the lane. OVER MY LIMIT
dueled on the lead from the fence, tired nearing the quarter pole, bumped inside rival and tired turning for home. Y'ZIN UP pressed the pace into the turn
from the fence, dropped just off the pace through the turn, was bumped by tiring rival nearing the quarter pole and flattened out. SPYRO fractious in the
gate, broke slowly and trailed as no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN ON THE TURN AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO
CHANGE.
