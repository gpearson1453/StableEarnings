Footnotes
A PALACE FOR MOM bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path, waited while just off the rail around the far turn, split foes from the three
path to take the lead in upper stretch, and kicked away into the final furlong handily. UPTOWN CAT laid off the pace in the four path, was coaxed while
three wide into the far turn, tipped out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for place. MISS ATHLETIC set the pace inside, was cued early into
the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and began to fade into the final furlong, but held on to show. BURY THE LEDE bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked in the three path, bid two wide while under a ride midway around the far turn, but flattened from the three path in the stretch. NIPSEY was held
up in the five path around the first turn, trailed in the four path down the backside and never menaced.

Footnotes
CACIQUE ABARRIO prompted the pace in the three path, seized command turning for home and drew clear under a drive. SOUPER CRUNCHY bumped
with ZAINO at the start, saved ground in range, steadied midway around the first turn, bumped again with ZAINO entering the far turn, remained up close
inside around the bend, angled three wide in upper stretch and ran on for the place. DIXIE PREACH was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide,
angled seven wide in upper stretch and finished well to gain the show. ZAINO was bumped at the start, saved ground up close, bumped again entering the
far turn, chased two wide around that bend, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. GIURO was
bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and gave way in upper stretch. AMAZING JETT failed to menace while racing three wide. WE GOT THIS
broke awkwardly, chased the early pace two wide, faded four wide around the far turn and was no threat. FIGHT TIL DAWN was bumped at the start and
made little impact while racing three and four wide. MAGNETIC APPEAL was bumped at the start, saved ground and played no factor. HE'S A
COMMISIONER trailed inside and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
DOUBLE PLAY KING tracked in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, tipped back out to the five path at the top of the lane, rallied to
lead just after the eighth pole, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. GOLDEN SKULL set the pace in the three path, was roused while just off the rail early
around the turn, floated out to the four path turning into the stretch, lost the lead just after the eighth pole, but held place. MAJOR KING stalked inside, was
roused from the rail into the turn, and finished evenly for show. ONE MORE SCORE pressed in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, but
weakened on his left lead in the four path down the lane. EXALTED CHARM chased in the four path but never threatened. FORT ATTITUDE threw his head
as the gates opened, broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
UMBRAL had the rider briefly lose the right iron at the start, stalked the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
FONTINA tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and churned on to gain the place. CASTELLANA pressed the pace two wide, took
the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied between foes around the turn and weakened in the lane. ANNA AFTER MIDNITE set the pace along the rail
and tired in the drive. PLATINUM ROCKER was outrun inside. CREATIVPERFORMANCE played no factor while racing two wide. FREEWAY FAME pulled
up midway around the turn and walked off.

Footnotes
DELAHAYE set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled while just off the rail rounding the far turn, roused from the two path into the stretch,
kicked away into the final furlong, and held sway. PAWKY stalked in the two path, was cued from inside while waiting for an opening midway around the far
turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. OUR DOTSIE tracked in the five path, was coaxed while three wide around the
far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. TEXAS SHUFFLE laid off the pace along the inside, had to wait to
angle out around the far turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. IMPLOSION bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the
pace in the four path, was cued in the two path midway around the far turn, but faded from the three path in the stretch. PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) was held up
in the three path turning into the backstretch, but got stymied between foes approaching the quarter, angled inside turning into the stretch, and made no
impact. EXCELLENT QUESTION bumped with an outer foe at the start, then had to check midway around the first turn, trailed from out in the seven path
down the backstretch and did not factor from the nine path down the lane. TAMARINDO got rank and had to be steadied between foes around the first turn,
rated in the four path, was coaxed along while being floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but flattened, was pulled up after the gallop out
and vanned off. MILIEU raced wellback in the six path and never menaced.

Footnotes
TUSCAN GOLD raced off the pace while being pushed along in the four path turning into the backstretch, was driven from the three path into the far turn,
swept to the lead turning into the short stretch, and drew clear. SKIP THE LINE bumped with an outer foe at the start, vied for the lead in the four path down
the backstretch, took command passing the five-eighths, was roused from the two path into the far turn, but lost the lead to the outer eventual winner turning
into the stretch, and was second best. BIG RICH showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, but dropped
back approaching the far turn, was under right handed urging while appearing to try to get out around the far turn, and along from the five path in the stretch
for show. PRINCETOWN stalked in the five path but faded turning into the stretch. MODICA broke in an bumped an inner foe, tracked in the six path but
was eased through the stretch, and walked off. TEAM CAPTAIN got bumped on both sides at the start, then had to check going into the first turn, trailed into
the stretch, was pulled up in the final furlong, and walked off.

Footnotes
HENLEY'S JOY settled off the pace inside, edged closer down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, came through inside of the
pacesetter to take over leaving the eighth pole and quickly cleared. SPY NOVEL set the pace in the two path to midstretch and held well for the place.
HARRY HOOD raced up close two wide around the first turn, exchanged bumps with MEYER turning into the homestretch the first time, chased the pace
three wide around the final two turns and was one-paced through the lane to hold the show. CYBER NINJA saved ground off the pace, made some
progress in the two path around the far turn, was held up behind a wall of horses nearing the quarter pole, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
JAMESTOWN steadied entering the first turn, raced off the pace two wide around the first two turns, went four wide around the far turn and never
threatened. MEYER exchanged bumps leaving the first turn, prompted the pace in the three path and had no response when roused around the far turn.

ADIOS NOW set the pace in the three path, was confidently handled around the turn, cued at the top of the lane, and kicked away under a drive. WHITBY
broke in and bumped an inner foe, prompted the pace in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, got bumped out to the six path by an
inner foe at the top of the stretch, but ran on to win a duel with that foe for place. RACING STAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two
path, was ridden around the turn, bumped an outer foe while swinging out to the four path at the top of the lane, and kept on, but lost a minor duel with that
outer foe to show. CLOAK AND DAGGER bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the four path but faded from the two path in the stretch. SUGAR
IT'S ELI got pinched at the start, trailed in the two path, was driven from the rail around the turn, but made no impact. DANELAND got bumped by an outer
foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but did not threaten from the seven path down the lane. GO GO GE chased in the three path, was driven
in the five path around the turn, but was empty entering the stretch.
