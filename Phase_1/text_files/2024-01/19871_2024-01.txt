Footnotes
SOUTHERN SUNSET broke with leaders, tracked the pace from along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, lodged a rail bid late in that
bend, quickly clear in upper stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under token encouragement to win ridden out. BEN FRANKLIN last
away, raced unhurried while toward the inside, called on for some run late in the final turn, rallied off the inside to be clearly second best, no match for the
winner. GAME KEEPER in the second flight early off the inside, came three wide for the drive, along for the show late with a belated rally, not a threat to the
top pair. ARTWELL away in good order, set the pace just off the inside, allowed the winner the inside late in the final turn, offered little resistance to that one
and began to weaken when headed entering the stretch. CROSSING prompted the leader while racing three wide, had nothing left for the drive. DELUCA
fell back to trail soon after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. VIGANO broke toward rail, remained always back.
NYQUICK raced in mid pack while outside, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
HARLEEZY off a step slow, void of any early speed, saved ground through the final turn when beginning to advance, steered out when in rally mode upper
stretch, bothered a bit past the furlong marker by a couple of inner rivals, continued willingly to the end to win going away. AUTO GLIDE outrun in the early
going, advanced into contention in the two to three path second turn, bumped by DANCE SOME MO in midstretch when that one was floated out by DUAL
MONRCHY, proved no match for the winner late while clear for the place. CANAVALL forwardly placed from the start, closest to the leader in the run up the
backstretch, took over from that one midway on the final turn, shook clear nearing the furlong marker while off the inside, proved no match for the top two,
saved the show. DUAL MONARCHY settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground behind the leaders second turn, moved out nearing midstretch
carrying DANCE SOME MO who in turn impacted a pair of outer rivals, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. SEAS OF NORMANDY broke back,
lacked speed while moving out into the four path onto the backstretch, continued outside, four path through the final bend, five wide into the lane, improved
position with some mild interest. DANCE SOME MO forwardly laced early while inside, steered out to be three wide late in the second bend while still within
striking distance, stalled nearing midstretch when floated out, bumped with AUTO GLIDE, continued in traffic while weakening to the wire. DOC HIGGINS
broke in good order, set the pace toward the inside, began to weaken when headed in the second turn. IGNITIS forwardly placed while racing off the inside,
had little left for the stretch drive. BEN DREAMING in mid pack while racing off the inside, stopped late in the final turn. SIR was finished after a half, fell far
back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, THE RESULT
WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

JUST ASK WATTS moved up to contest the issue early along the inside, showed the way through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home,
steadily increased that advantage to the wire while kept to task and lugging out a bit under a left handed crop a furlong out. MIRAGE off a step slow,
continued back while well out in the strip, five to six wide into the lane, rallied and while not threat to the winner, finished up willingly to be in time for the
second spot. NULLIFY lacked speed while also well wide, five path through the turn, rallied, not enough late to gain the place. CORKED back off the pace
and the inside, two path into the lane while improving inside of several rivals, chased the winner past the furlong marker, flattened out to lose the runner up
spot late. TOP OF THE STREET back off the pace three wide, improved a bit the final furlong while not a serious threat. HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE raced
back off the pace and the inside, four to five wide in some traffic exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch drive. EXPRESS CRUISER one paced off
the inside, in some traffic while three wide late in the bend, also failed to muster a rally when clear. PHENOMENAL DREAM off a step slow, trailed for a half,
passed some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. FASTENED vied up front early while three wide and between horses, gave way in the drive. GOLDEN
DIVERSION lacked speed, encountered some traffic then lacked room late in the turn, steadied, remained back after recovering. COMMANDER STORM in
the first flight between horses, chased turn, gave way. HANDSOME RASCAL with the early pace, stopped.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK allowed the pace to go early, raced in hand up the backstretch, continued under patient handling second turn, split foes exiting than bend,
gained the advantage, drew clear. T BONES TRICK void of early foot after breaking back, angled out to be widest for the drive, rallied for the place, not a
serious threat to the winner. SITTIN ON GO back off the pace and the inside, steadied in some traffic late in the first turn, four to five wide through the
second turn, mild interest through the lane to be clear of the others. COACH ADAMS closest to the leader while off the inside, three wide through the
second turn when taking over, weakened when headed by the winner in upper stretch. NOMOREMRNICEGUY last away, trailed in lagging well back, saved
some ground onto the backstretch, continued to save ground second bend, passed tiring rivals with some mild late interest. TRUCULENT broke well, raced
forwardly and just off the inside, roused for the drive, gave way. CHAPEL BARN took control just after the start, set the pace in the two path, gave way when
headed second turn. TOMA TODO in mid pack off the inside, briefly moved closer while three to four wide second turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CODE FOR SUCCESS last away, advanced through the turn along the inside, challenged along the rail entering the stretch, gained command, clear a
furlong out, held the runner up safe late. KEY TO SUCCESS steadied just after the start in traffic, also lacked speed, followed the winner through along the
rail into the lane, finished willingly while remaining up the inside to be clearly second best. CHANISA forwardly placed early outside, moved closer in the four
path late in the turn, lacked further advance to finish up best of the rest. GREEK HEIRESS raced in mid pack while out in the strip, four wide and in some
traffic late in the turn, finished some mild late interest to improve a bit. OH MY GAWD sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, continued to set
the pace turn, allowed the winner the inside into the lane then began to weaken when headed by that one. PIONEER PARADE forwardly placed in the
second flight while toward the inside, raced in traffic late in the turn lacking clear room, had little for the drive. YOU LITTLE VIXEN void of early foot outside,
five to six wide out of the turn, improved a bit down the middle of the strip and widest of all. SO JORDAN chased the leader for a half in the three path, gave
way in the drive. MEAN SUE raced back off the pace in the four path, failed to respond when called on for the drive. TOFFEE was not a factor while racing
three wide. JUBILANT JOANIE was finished early. HARMONICA forwardly placed in the two path early, gave way in the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
INFILTRATOR unhurried early toward toward the inside, saved ground into the stretch, rallied up the rail to be in time. AL'S ROMEO broke alertly, set the
pace in the two path, shook clear past the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner while outside that one at the end. COMMUNICATION MEMO
lacked early foot off the inside, three wide into the lane, coming late for the place. RAM behind the early pace while racing toward the inside, angled out to
be four wide out of the turn, went evenly though the lane in lacking a closing punch. CITY OF CLOUDS forwardly placed for a half along the inside, also
came up empty when the real running began. FIRE BRYAN inn the second flight outside, floated out 5-6w into lane, lacked a closing response as well.
HUSKER BUTCH in mid pack toward the rail, two path into the lane, improved slightly while never dangerous. FOREVER COOL in the main body off the
rail, three wide out of the turn, had nothing left. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY pressed the issue up front for four furlongs in the three path, backed up through the
stretch. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS was never a threat. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE last to leave, was always outrun. GOLD BARON also broke back and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
JUBELLA broke on top, set the pace along the inside, rated kindly the middle half, drew off steadily through the lane while being kept to task. BOW DRAW
in the second flight three wide, remained within striking distance in the three path through the second bend, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner.
MALIBU SMART lacked early foot just off the inside, continued in the two path through the second turn, roused into the lane, staged a mild rally, not enough
late for the place. FLASHY LASS prompted the pace while off the rail early, dropped inside midway on the first bend, went lacking a closing response.
PARIS STYLE (FR) last away, void of speed, staged a mild rally without posing a serious threat. MAGIC BUBBLES pressured the issue up front off the
inside, had little left for the drive. LADY JAE saved ground to no avail. MARINA'S GOLD moved outside, five wide into the far turn, finished far back.
HONEY RUN moved out four wide early, stopped stretch jogged in while also far back.

Footnotes
MAJOR BLUE close from the start, vied between horses through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, clear with a furlong to run, enough left
late to hold the runner up safe. TUT'S REVENGE broke with the field, fell back steadily in the run up the backstretch, three wide out of the turn, steered to
the inside, finished willingly up the rail to be getting to the winner late. EASY ACTION with the lead pack three wide and outside the winner, could not keep
up with that one in the drive nor contain the runner up, lasted for the show. MISTER ICEMAN in mid pack and outside, five wide into the lane, brushed upper
stretch, not enough late for the show. RUGGS behind the first group toward the inside, steered four wide late turn, brush, in tight between horses upper
stretch, finished up evenly when clear. RADICAL RIGHT in the second flight off the inside, three wide turning for home, brushed upper stretch, lacked a
closing kick. STAYED IN FOR HALF broke on top, set the early pace toward the inside, weakened when headed turning for home. SPEND BENJAMINS fell
back to trail after the start, four wide through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. NINJA WARRIOR brushed gate to be off slowly,
lacked speed, five wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. LIFE IS HARD was finished early while racing three wide. COUNT DE MONET hopped
at the start, moved up to mid pack, began a steady fade just before a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
PROMISE KEEPER took command soon after the start, showed the way through the first turn in the two path, continued to show the way backstretch under
light restraint, saved some ground through the second bend, clear when straightened for home, dug in late to hold the next two safe in the waning strides.
SEIZE THE NIGHT off the early pace while five wide into the first turn,angled in a bit onto the backstretch, angled in a bit to be in the two path exiting the
final turn, late bid between horses, outkicked. SILVER PROSPECTOR pressed the issue early from along the inside, moved out, continued to apply
pressure to the winner from the outside through the second turn, three wide into the stretch, hung in the late going while widest of the top flight at the wire.
LOGICAL MYTH within striking distance early, four wide through much of the first bend, four wide again turning into the stretch after falling back the middle
half, lacked a closing kick. KUPUNA five wide into the first turn when off the pace, moved closer the second quarter outside, four wide late in the second
turn, faded down the lane. DURANTE hopped then stumbled to be off poorly, trailed, not a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MAE broke well, fell back while in the two path early turn, dropped to the rail late in the bend in traffic, steered back out in upper stretch, roused,
late surge to win going away at the end. PRESLEYS TURN in mid pack for a half, split foes into the lane, challenged late inside the winner, proved no match
for that one, clear for the place. NGALA moved up after the start to set the pace, clear while in the two path out of the turn, continued to hold a daylight
advantage past the furlong marker, faltered and could not contain the top two, remained clear of the others. SPARKLY hesitated at the break, moved up to
the second flight the opening quarter along the inside, continued to ride the rail into the lane, went evenly the final furlong. MISS ARKANSAS off step slow,
raced back and well wide, five out to six wide through the turn, improved midtrack, no real threat. DELTA MOON steadied while between the two leaders
with a half mile to run, fell back a bit and moved out three wide, continued to chase that pair through the turn, went flat through the lane. HONDURAS
PASSION void of early foot, raced outside the winner through the turn, improved slightly in the drive. AURORA GEE broke in to be away a bit slowly, raced
back and lacked a closing response four wide. MY JULIA settled in mid pack early off the inside, began a gradual fade three wide before a half. PRINCIPAL
ANITA bothered, off slowly, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals, no factor. WILD CHEROKEE tired after racing four wide through the turn. SKY RAVEN
pressed the issue up front while three wide for a half and stopped.
