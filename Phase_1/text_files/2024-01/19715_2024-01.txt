Footnotes
STRAIGHTEN UP went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. GOLDUSTER pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TEXAS TURBINE lacked early speed, made a late wide gain and
was a clear third at the wire. EL JEFE COBB raced within contention, weakened and lacked a late kick. HALO MOON lacked early speed, made a mild gain,
but was no factor. C C'S LEGACY raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. GILDERSLEEVE void of early speed and showed little.
BULLETSREVENGE raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside and dropped back. DUSTY HILL raced near the back, came
around the turn on the inside and was outrun.

the final turn, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. BEYOND THE HYPE dueled for the early advantage, saved ground around the final turn
and weakened. START WELL raced within contention, faded, while finishing wide and was no threat late. ASHLEY'S GIRL always raced near the back and

Footnotes
KOUFAX pressed the pace, racing behind FRENCH COMPOSER in the early going, took command around the final turn and won under steady urging.
BILOXI lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late gain, couldn't catch the winner, but got up for second. WOODS N
WATER raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, made a late inside bid and missed second. FRENCH COMPOSER went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground and faded. NO WHITE FLAGS raced within striking distance, faded and was no threat late. FLEETRIDGE pressed the early pace, dropped
back and was outrun.
