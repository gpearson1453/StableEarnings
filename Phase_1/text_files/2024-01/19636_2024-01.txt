raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. DESTINED TO DANCE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the

Footnotes
MYSTIFIED raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far turn
about the four path, dug in from the head of the lane and took over the final strides. ROYAL THUNDER raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, took the nod entering the stretch, ran briefly clear but was caught the final
strides. TOP OF THE MINT saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn,
angled out toward the head of the lane and dug in to take third the final yards. GABRIEL'S WING accelerated to the lead while tapering to the inside and
rated the pace, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but was met at the head of the lane and flattened stride.
PYEONG CHANG raced two deep the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn at the rail then flattened in
the lane. FOX RED raced in the three path the opening turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and
weakened. PROTA stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. YOU ARE
AWESOME saved early ground and showed little response.
