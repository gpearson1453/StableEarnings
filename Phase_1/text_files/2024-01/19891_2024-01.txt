Footnotes
FRISCO KID set the pace along the inside, got headed while inside of a trio of bidders around the far turn, yet fought back to regain an advantage entering
the lane and held firm. CONRADO stalked two wide and between horses while tugging entering the backstretch, moved to vie along with an outer pair into
the far turn, led narrowly turning for home, but relinquished the advantage back to the early pace-setter entering the lane and was turned away while
hanging on his left lead. TOP OF MY GAME was hustled forward at the start but only managed to achieve an inside tracking position into the first turn, failed
to sustain position approaching the half mile pole, shifted to the five path into the far turn before fanning out to the six path entering the lane and surpassed
tiring rivals. GREENBRIER lagged behind, improved inside of foes entering the lane but failed to factor. ESPE'S GUY pursued two wide, shifted outside of
the leading trio down the backstretch, bid four wide into the far turn, vied turning for home but faded entering the lane. I'M NOBLE stalked three wide, vied
between horses around the far turn but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MEMOLOTSAMISCHIEF quickly opened up in the early stages and held sway safely. YANKEE TEA PARTY bumped an outer rival at the start, chased from
the three to four path as the clear leader's closest pursuer, and ran on to prove second best. READY TO STORM lacked speed in the six to five path into
the turn, tucked to the three path entering the lane and moved up between horses. OFF TO THE RACES was bumped by an inner rival at the start, pursued
from midpack in the four path and between horses, drifted out to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. AS LUCK HAPPENS chased along the
inside and made little impact. GOTHAM'S FINALE laid off of the pace in the five path and tired. MIDGE PASS broke inwardly and was outrun along the
inside.

TWIRLING GINNY took contact from an inner rival early on, stalked the dueling leading pair from the three path, bid outside of them nearing the lane and
drove clear in upper stretch. STORMYLUX steadied between horses at the start, trailed in the five path, launched a rally turning for home, then sustained a
charge to split horses and gain place at the wire. MUSICAL DIVA chased the dueling leading pair from the two path, shifted out to the five path entering the
lane, and kept on to miss place at the wire. PRETTYWITTYANDWISE dueled for the lead two wide, but was bested by an outer bidder entering the lane,
vied for place into deep stretch but was outkicked late. MY QUIET PLACE dueled for the lead along the inside, but was outkicked by an outer bidder
entering the lane, vied for place into deep stretch but yielded late. LUPITA drifted out and bumped a rival soon after the start, lacked speed along the inside
and made little impact. PRAIRIE MOON laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. LINDYSNOTOBNOXIOUS chased from midpack in the four
path and faded.

LOVE MY JIMMY showed the way with a clear margin in the two path and was driven home hanging on his left lead. BUGLER stalked the clear leader from
the four path, proved no match for that one and held place. ITALIANO bumped with an inner rival and was put to crowded quarters between horses, laid off
of the pace in the three path, gained fanning to the five path entering the lane, but was denied place. TOM BOMBADIL was jostled between horses at the
start, lacked speed in the three path and ran on. BLUE SKYE JADE chased from midpack along the inside and faded around the turn. RED HOT CAT
lacked speed in the four path and made little impact. HALF RIGHT broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked from the two path and
weakened. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, FRACTIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PRINCIPE CARLO pressed three wide, bid entering the lane, dueled thereafter and prevailed. TONY'S TAPIT broke slowly, lacked speed in the three to
four path, launched a rally surging between horses in midstretch, tipped out before sustaining stout progress to offer a late bid, but missed. KINGDOM
HEART vied two wide and between horses, dueled with his outer counterpart nearing the lane, fought on through midstretch, but was bested late and got
nailed at the wire for place. PEACEFUL WATERS pursued from midpack in the five path, ranged closer turning for home, but leveled off while drifting out
coming to the final furlong, then hung and was outkicked for a minor placing. DIAMOND RIM laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned out to the eight
path and between horses entering the lane and ran on. SANTOS TO WILSON chased two wide and between horses and lacked a bid. TRUTH SEEKER
leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, trailed around the turn and improved. TULANE TRYST was bumped by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the
pace along the inside moved between horses nearing the lane and failed to menace. EXXEL laid off of the pace in the six to nine path and failed to factor.
PRAYER OF JABEZ broke outwardly, vied inside of a pair of rivals, gave way turning for home and weakened between horses. GOOD BYE CHARLIE
tracked four wide and faded between horses nearing the lane. MINISTER OF SOUL chased along the inside and gave way.
