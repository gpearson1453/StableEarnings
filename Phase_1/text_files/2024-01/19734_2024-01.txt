Footnotes
GLASTONBURY moved to the inside and rated the pace, rounded the turn at the rail and was kept alert in the lane. SMOKIN SMITTY gave chase about the
three path through most of the backstretch, angled in past the five sixteenths pole and finished evenly while settling for second. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS
gave chase toward the inside, steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the three path and came along to take third later
yards. MONEY MAC gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little further. FLOOR IT was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase,
rounded the turn about the four path and flattened in the lane. STOOPS SINE DIE veered in and made contact with Floor It leaving the gate, engaged in
close early chase, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE hesitated at the break then gave chase excessively wide. The
Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Smokin Smitty for alleged interference approaching the turn, lodged by the rider of
Robbedinthebahamas.

Footnotes
RIDE THE RAPIDS took the lead two deep at the mile marker and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, extended her
lead at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert to increase that margin in the lane. CASTLE OF CAYLEE raced well back off the rail, bid past the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and came along to take second later yards. VIKING QUEEN rounded the opening two turns in the four
and five paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. BEAUTIFUL
STAR raced well back from early contention, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride. HOLMDEL PARK raced
well back inside, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole and could only improve her position. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY settled close inside, gave
chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and weakened. RUXTON ROCKS saved ground, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then gave way. ELEGANT TASTE was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
SPIRIT ON THE WIND gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn then dug in for the lead later yards and ran clear toward the
wire. CREME DE LA QUEEN pressured the pace and contested even terms two deep on the turn, took the nod entering the stretch and kept the advantage
through the upper stretch, but was caught; and relented later yards. UNALTERED contested the pace and raced at even terms nearest the rail on the turn,
remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened mid-stretch and just lasted for third. BRAZEN BEAUTY came away a step slow then gave chase,
raced in the four path on the turn, finished evenly and just missed third. BIT OF BLESSINGS chased, raced in the six path on the turn and passed rivals
widest. FROSTY RIA broke a step slow, gave chase inside then flattened leaving the turn. SWISS HORIZON gave chase outside, rounded the turn about
the five path and showed little in the lane. GANGSTER AMERICANO contested the pace inside through most of the backstretch but checked at the rail in
the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole and weakened leaving the turn.

SECRET CASTLE settled in the four path the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and drew close four wide on the far turn, took
over entering the stretch and was steadily handled to widen. GORMLEYESQUE took the lead two deep leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met at the eighth pole but dueled through the
stretch for second. EXTRA CRUNCHY stalked inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep
while between horses on the far turn, but dropped back entering the stretch and flattened stride. SEEMS TO WHISPER rounded the first turn in the four
path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, contested the far turn three wide but flattened in the lane. ULTIMATE BREEZE raced in the three
path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. URKILLINGMEBETH raced off the rail the first turn and never factored. NEED A
MARKER saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but faded toward the far turn. SUPER WILDCAT saved ground.

Footnotes
RUN RAEGAN RUN took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
held well under steady handling. WATERLOO ROSE raced through the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn four wide, then dueled through the stretch and took second later yards. BLUE TWIRLIN raced in the five path the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, dug in leaving the turn and dueled for third while outfinished for second.
MISS ANTIETAM saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead near the rail on the far turn but flattened
stride later yards. HONEYCAMP stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole, had range on the lead in the three path on the
turn but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. BACKSTREET GAL raced in the six path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn widest and showed little in the lane. SISTER SPIRIT rounded the first turn in the six path, left the turn toward the outside and gave
chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened. FREE SHOT settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three
eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. LONDON GOLD rounded the opening turn in the five path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but
faded in the five path on the far turn. SWEET FACTOR raced in the seven path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole then weakened
near the rail on the far turn.
