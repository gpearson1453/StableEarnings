Footnotes
MACEE set a clear pace in the two path, met an outer challenge turning for home in the three path, then dug in and gamely clung to an advantage from that
one through the lane. MO SMOKING tracked along the inside, gained place with a half mile remaining, sustained progress to bid outside of the leader and
from the four path turning for home, sparred through the lane but narrowly missed. HOT PATOOTIE stalked closest to the clear leader from the four to three
path around the first turn, lost place to an inner bidder at the half mile pole, chased the top pair from the inside while giving way around the far turn, yet held
show. I DONT KNOW EITHER chased from midpack two wide, retreated before pursuing along the inside around the far turn, then moved up along the rail.
STAR'S DREAM failed to menace from the two to three path. TRINITY HOPE broke a step slow, trailed in the two path and improved between horses
nearing the lane. AGAMI tracked in the three to four path leaving the first turn, but came under a drive in pursuit with a half mile to go and weakened.
SUPER ET broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four to five path and was outrun.

Footnotes
LADY MERCEDES tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket and behind foes around the far turn, paused awaited racing room nearing the lane, yet
slipped through in upper stretch, offered a steady rail charge and edged past the leaders in the final furlong. IM SINGLED UP pressed outside of the top pair
and from the four path, sustained pressure under urging around the far turn, bid along with an outer rival entering the lane, sparred with that one before
being bested by an inner bidder late, then gamely held place. MISS TAPPY TONE broke awkwardly and was off multiple lengths slow, trailed shifting out to
the five path around the first turn, ranged up outside of rivals around the far turn to bid entering the lane, but hung on her left lead, was outkicked by an inner
bidder in the final furlong, hung late and failed to gain place. TRAVAILLE set the pace a bit of the inside as a pair of outer rivals applied pressure, showed
the way until getting headed by an outer pair entering the lane and yielded between horses. RUBY FOO prompted between the top pair and from the three
path, came under urging while subtly yielding around the far turn, yet kept on in pursuit through the lane.

SPEIGHTFUL ONE set the pace in the two path, shook clear entering the lane and held sway from an outer pursuer. CHAD'S FLASHY WAYS bumped with
an outer rival upon leaving the gates, raced close up along the inside, stalked from the pocket awaiting racing room turning for home, tipped to take aim
outside of the clearing leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase that one thereafter whlie being kept at bay. CAJUN MISCHIEF chased from the
two path, ran on to gain show from an outer foe passing the three sixteenths pole and was best of the rest. TABLEAUX RESEAUX pursued from the three
path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and failed to menace. MUNCLE leaned outwardly at the start, tracked from the four path, came under coaxing
with three furlongs to go, lacked a response and gave way. LEISURELY bumped with an in inner rival at the start, recovered to press the leader from the
three path, required urging to sustain pressure around the turn, then faded between horses in upper stretch. MISTERHOLYROLLER broke slowly, trailed in
the five path and was outrun.

LEGALLY LUCKY vied with an outer rival and in the two path, shook free of that one after entering the lane in the three path and held sway. MRS.
SPEAKER brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked the top pair from the two path, swung to take aim in the six path entering the lane, offered a bid
outside of the leader but was kept at bay. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL tracked in the three path, chased under urging around the far turn, then kept on to
edge show. TRIBEST (ARG) vied outside of the eventual winner and from the four to three path, but gave way between horses in upper stretch. MARMO
MOON bobbled at the start, then saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. DOOBLAY brushed with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the
two to three path and was outrun. GRAY PEARL lacked speed in the four to three path and never got involved.

EYE DEE KAY tracked two wide and between horses, ranged up three wide around the far turn, bid nearing the lane, drew clear in upper stretch under a
drive, then was put to hand in the final sixteenth. ZING tracked along the inside, stalked into the far turn, but was outmoved by an outer bidder while
awaiting racing room turning for home, tipped two wide for clear sailing after that one kicked away in upper stretch and ran on to be second best. NORDIC
LIGHT gained in the five path to vie with an inner pair leaving the first turn, prompted two wide into the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder nearing
the lane, yielded yet surpassed a tiring rival for show. PREMIUM stumbled at the start, vied with a pair of outer rivals entering the backstretch, led before
proving no match for an outer bidder entering the lane and gave way. CRIMINAL DEFENSE vied for the lead in the three path and between horses leaving
the first turn, but failed to sustain position down the backstretch and gave way. MORE ICE lacked speed three wide and between horses early on, then
along the inside around the far turn and failed to factor. MAU MAU checked between horses around the first turn before settling off of the pace four wide, but
was through early.

Footnotes
EARL OF DASSEL tracked along the inside, bid inside of the lugging leader entering the lane, sparred neck and neck thereafter and prevailed. EMPIRE'S
BEST dictated terms via a loose advantage in the three to two path around the first turn, but lugged out multiple paths around the far turn, met a challenge
from an inner bidder while entering the lane in the six path, shifted down and dueled thereafter but was bested. ACTIVE DUTY backed out between horses
soon after the start, trailed in the two path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up at the furlong grounds. BEAUMONT RED pursued
from the three path and failed to menace. GREAT RUNNER stalked the leader from the four to three path, but was floated outwardly multiple lanes by that
one around the far turn, entered the lane in the seven path and gave way. SOUTH SIDE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
VISIONISTA laid off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride two wide turning for home, sustained progress to bid inside of the leaders in midstretch
and edged ahead. LOVERS NEVER SAY dueled for the lead three to two wide, then between horses around the far turn, sparred among foes through upper
stretch, but drifted out in the final furlong and was bested by an inner bidder. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE prompted between the top pair before backing off to
stalk outside of them with more than five furlongs to go, ranged up three wide to bid at the three furlong pole, led entering the lane in the five path, but
shifted outwardly from an inner drifting rival passing the furlong grounds and yielded late. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, gained under urging in the five path turning for home, shifted out to the six to seven path in upper stretch and ran on willingly. OUR LITTLE GIRL
trailed along the inside, improved inside of rivals around the far turn, shifted out entering the lane and failed to menace. MONEY WELL SPENT tracked
along the inside, was roused four wide turning for home, but flattened out entering the lane in the six path and weakened. SHELLI'S ANGEL lacked speed
three wide and made little impact. GUITAR WOMAN tracked in the four path and steadily faded. LUYV dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened
turning for home and stopped.

Footnotes
CALIBRACHOA KID prompted inside of the leader, bid along with an outer G'WILDCAT entering the lane, dueled with that one thereafter and prevailed.
G'WILDCAT tracked along the inside, split foes turning for home to bid three wide entering the lane, dueled with a rail bidder through the stretch but was
denied. HALF AGAIN tracked in the two to three path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane and ran on willingly. OUR FREDDIE MAC saved ground
off of the pace but to no avail. GOLD PUNCH set the pace three to two wide, but faltered between bidders at the quarter pole. BLACKTECA was last away,
chased in the four path and faded. PINCH ME A PENNY broke a step slow, trailed into the turn, but collided with an outer faltering foe nearing the lane
causing his rider to lose his irons, and was eased through the stretch. BINDING AGREEMENT raced off of the pace in the three path into the turn, but
suffered an injury at the five sixteenths pole, collided with a rival while pulling up nearing the lane and was vanned off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REVIEWING THE INCIDENT NEARING THE LANE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE set the pace in the three path and drew off. MOTION TO STRIKE chased along the inside, tipped to the three path in upper stretch
and ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole. HERD IMMUNITY pursued along the inside, then stayed on in the two path to gain show late. JRUE BREEZE
tracked in the two path, shfited to the four path in upper stretch but lacked a bid. STARBURST prompted inside of the eventual winner, but gave way.
SPOTTED BULL laid off of the pace four to six wide and moved up. CRIMSON STORM laid off of the pace two wide and between horses and failed to
menace. CRYPTOZONIC lacked speed in the four path and failed to factor. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE made little impact three wide. MARVIN tracked in the
three to five path and weakened. DIXIE STREET trailed in the two path and was outrun.
