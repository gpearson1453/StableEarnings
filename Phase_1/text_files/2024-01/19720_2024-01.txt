Footnotes
WEST STAR saved ground on the turn stalking the duel, swung to the three path in upper stretch, swept to command near the eighth pole and prevailed
under brisk urging. THE LAST JUMPSTART bobbled when bumping with RUFFNER leaving the starting gate, circled foes on the turn, was four deep turning
for home and rallied outside the winner. I WANNA ROCK lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path for the drive and passed tired
rivals. WHERE'S RAY showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to mid stretch then faded. MOONSET , three deep chasing the pace to the stretch, gave
way. RUFFNER bumped with THE LAST JUMPSTART leaving the starting gate, dueled between horses down the backstretch, remained prominent to
upper stretch then faltered.

UP AGAINST IT pulled his way clear leaving the chute then dropped in towards the rail to set a rated pace, moved away while confidently handled mid turn,
entered the lane about two wide then responded when set down soon after, opened up a commanding lead under a solid drive past mid stretch then
maintained a comfortable advantage while kept to task. CAPTAIN CARDO saved ground under rating leaving the far turn, picked up steam and advanced
under coaxing while saving ground into the stretch, eased out a bit with pursuit past mid stretch and kept on willingly to be clear of the rest. HE HATE ME
broke a step slow, settled off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide past the three eighths and churned on. SHIVAREE drafted back after an alert
beginning, was under pressure off the rail mid turn, angled six wide into the lane but lacked a serious run through the final furlong. MORNING THOUGHTS
stumbled at the break, recovered and raced four deep leaving the chute, raced in closest pursuit of the winner while about three wide mid turn, failed to kick
on under asking in upper stretch and weakened. SENATE CHAMBER stalked two wide, was ridden along mid turn and gave way in upper stretch. VIRGINIA
FULLA lagged back, raced three wide in upper stretch and failed to respond. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) , four wide early, was floated out a bit by PRINCE
KHOZAN near the five furlong marker, was guided inward and exchanged bumps with that rival nearing the turn, made steady progress along the rail past
the three eighths, came off the rail into the lane, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and tired. PRINCE KHOZAN , two to three wide between rivals
pursuing early on, carried out ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) a bit when attempting to work outward leaving the five eighths, was bumped and forced in by that
one approaching the far turn, failed to go on mid turn and retreated.

HAD TO HAVE HIM , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, rallied and split foes inside the sixteenth
pole. KICK STARTNESS edged up outside, steadied briefly off heels nearing the turn, raced three deep chasing the pace around the turn, floated four wide
in upper stretch, challenged for the lead outside horses near the sixteenth pole and hung. SIN PERMISO , pinched back leaving the starting gate, hugged
the inner rail around the turn then rallied between horses. STELLARS IN CHARGE bore in leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, set the
pace along the rail, opened up in mid stretch and weakened. LANDSLIDE IS HOME prompted the pace outside STELLARS IN CHARGE, drifted out in
upper stretch and tired. CHOCHOCHO bobbled slightly at the break, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed to
rally. THREE CAPTAINS , outrun, steadied on heels entering the turn. CORONATION TIME was no factor. MIKE THE BOMB was outrun.

Footnotes
BIG CHEEKS , inside rivals under rating early and in range of the embattled leaders, came under a firm ride as the leaders separated past the three eighths,
worked outward to be about four wide entering the lane, closed determinedly under stout encouragement, took command late and drew clear. ALWAYS
LAUGHING got involved in a duel to the inside of CARROLL GIRL around the first turn, carried that battle past the five sixteenths, shook clear entering the
lane, opened up a bit while under a drive in mid stretch, could not withstand the winner's charge inside the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and held
down the place. HAINT BLUE , off a bit slow, settled off the pace while saving ground, remained inside with momentum into the stretch, eased out some and
steadily bridged the gap with a willing run. CARROLL GIRL , away alertly, disputed the pace outside ALWAYS LAUGHING, stayed on under pressure past
the five sixteenths, could not quite find enough leaving mid stretch and faded. CLICK TO CONFIRM , two wide between rivals early, raced outside a rival
into the far turn, angled in for the drive and found a bit of run through the final furlong. DRY WELL , rated along three wide between rivals early, chased
under pressure past the three eighths and came up empty. BLACK ICE , four deep the first turn, stalked the duelers three wide into the far turn, saw that
pair widen past the three eighths, stayed on with effort to upper stretch then faded.

Footnotes
NO EASY DAYS hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out entering the stretch, gained the lead outside SMOOTH RICO in mid stretch and edged
clear under steady handling. DISPUTED NOTION lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and closed gamely. SMOOTH
RICO sped to the early lead and was taken to the inner rail, remained along the rail around the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and gradually
weakened the final furlong. RASCALLY REBEL , raced in the two path on the turn, moved to the three path turning for home and weakened. IRISH
WARLOCK , three wide chasing the pace around the turn and to mid stretch, gave way. GENERAL NOOZ , unhurried down the backstretch, was no factor.
SEA TO AIR bobbled at the break, prompted the pace in the two path and gave way leaving the turn. AMANI'S EAGLE pulled up lame leaving the
backstretch and was vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.

STRONG FINISH rated kindly in mid pack while saving ground, eased out four wide into the lane, closed determinedly under pressure and got up at the
wire. FEDERAL OFFENSE tracked a contested pace outside, circled four wide past the three eighths, kicked clear soon into the stretch, drifted in under
right handed asks past the three sixteenths, straightened and kept on past the furlong grounds, dug in gamely when confronted past the sixteenth marker
but got nipped at the wire. GREAT CALL rated off the pace while saving some ground, eased out for the drive and finished up willingly.
SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE steadied leaving the chute, lagged well back into the turn, raced three to four wide in upper stretch and finished with interest.
LIGHTNING LAD , off the pace, swung six wide into the lane, moved up some nearing mid stretch then flattened out. BOLD HONOR , sluggish from the
gate, moved up early, saved ground through the lane and churned on. CRAZY ODDS , tucked up inside just off the duelers, eased out past mid turn, came
five wide for the drive, remained a presence past the three sixteenths then faded. HE ROLLS pulled his way clear early on, dropped in towards the rail and
set the pace, was joined past the five eighths, dueled inside of LANDON JACK around the turn, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and weakened.
BORUFF broke awkwardly, raced off the pace and off the inside, angled very wide for the drive but failed to menace. DUCKPINS , three deep chasing, gave
way nearing the lane. LANDON JACK moved up from the outside to join HE ROLLS leaving the five eighths, poked a head in front into the turn, dueled
around the turn then tired in upper stretch.

MY SUGAR BOO , patiently rated down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail around the turn, moved to the three path turning for home, rallied between
horses and was up at the wire. SHINING SPIRIT , difficult to load into the starting gate, stumbled at the break then bumped with AMIE'S SYMPHONY, was
rushed to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way stubbornly. AMIE'S SYMPHONY , jostled between horses soon after the break,
angled to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. CONCRETE FAZE , well positioned along the inner rail on the turn, failed to rally. K KAKE
POP , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in the drive. DROPPING LEMONS , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gave
way. INDEPENDENCE WAY , four deep on the turn, retreated in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHEILAHS WARCLOUD drafted back off the early pace then was deftly maneuvered towards the rail heading to the turn, advanced inside leaving the far
turn then angled out near the three eighths, circled four wide under a light hold and took dead aim of the dueling leaders into the stretch, forged clear then
responded to left handed asks leaving the three sixteenths, drifted in towards the rail with a sixteenth to go then held firm while kept alert. I'M A CUTIE PIE
tracked the embattled leaders while saving ground, sat patiently mid turn, got through along the rail to advance past the three sixteenths, worked outward in
the final furlong and finished gamely to gain. C C ROYAL sped to command early while two wide, handled outside pressure into the turn, dueled under some
coaxing around the turn, stayed on battling past the quarter pole, could not quicken with the winner past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly
through the final seventy yards. PERFECTLY WICKED broke a bit slowly, angled out early and edged up to stalk two wide between rivals, eased out a path
with pursuit nearing the stretch, altered out past the three sixteenths, chased and came up empty. SKY VICTORY , brushed at the start, accelerated
between foes leaving the chute and attended the pace three wide outside C C ROYAL, dueled with that one into and around the turn, stayed on under a
hearty ride between foes into the lane, chased past mid stretch and faded. ZUMA bobbled at the break then was soundly bumped and pinched back,
regrouped then moved up three wide between runners to reach a forward spot after a quarter mile, was scrubbed upon to no avail leaving the far turn,
dropped back past the three eighths, shifted out in the stretch and had a bit of late interest. OLD BAY came in at the break bumping ZUMA, corrected and
rated off the pace and off the inside, dropped to the rail to make some progress mid turn, swung six wide for the drive but came up empty. LILLY
LIGHTNING , four deep in close attendance into the turn, lacked a response under a ride nearing mid turn then gave way.

Footnotes
NEXT GIRL lacked speed along the inner rail down the backstretch, swung to the three path entering the far turn, remained outside foes on the turn, swept
to command on her left lead inside the eighth pole and pulled away under urging. R B'S BIG MOMENT disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, opened
a clear lead in upper stretch and drifted out near the eighth pole when tiring. PRINCESS ANISA , never a threat, passed tired rivals. OUTFACTORED
disputed the pace two wide and faltered entering the stretch. TOHONORSTELLE , near the inner rail much of the trip, dropped back. IRISH ANGEL ,
fractious behind the starting gate before the race, hopped at the break and was outrun. PERTURB , three wide the first turn, retreated through the stretch.
