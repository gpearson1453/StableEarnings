Footnotes
SHAMROCKIN lacked early speed, passed troubled rival into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, closed steadily through the stretch and got up at the
wire. JANE KENDEIGH stalked in the two path outside a rival, launched a bid three deep at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, dueled with
RUNAMILEINMYSHOES through the final furlong and got nailed at the wire. RUNAMILEINMYSHOES dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at
the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch, fought back from inside and went gamely to the wire. PRINCESS SNOW chased off the rail then three wide
into the turn, got moved out to the four path midway around the bend, drifted to the inside in the stretch and lacked a rally. BEAUTIFUL JANET chased
along the rail then shifted to the two path on the turn, drifted in to bother rival in upper stretch and proved no menace. ZOOM ZOOM ZOYA tossed her head
and hopped at the start, gained ground up the backstretch, traveled two wide then along the rail on the turn, lacked room and checked in upper stretch and
could not regain momentum. MISS MICHE LADA dueled for command from inside holding a slim advantage, lost command late on the turn and gave way in
the drive. PRINCESSPRANCEALOT brushed the gate and had the rider lose his irons shortly after, tried to regain his footing up the backstretch failed,
coasted around the turn and down the lane and walked off. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF PRINCESSPRANCEALOT AND RULED THAT
SHE BRUSHED THE GATE CAUSING THE RIDER TO LOSE HIS IRONS AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

Footnotes
JOHN DUNBAR got brushed by inner rival at the start, chased two wide into the turn, drew closer and roused approaching the quarter pole, drew alongside
late on the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under left handed urging. GETEMDUSTY brushed JOHN DUNBAR at the start, dropped back
off the pace then inched closer up the backstretch, gained along the rail then two wide into the stretch, chased after the winner determinedly in the late
stages but could not make any headway. BIG DRINKER bothered by SEABOARD at the start, traveled off the inside then angled to the two path early on
the bend, eased out and came four wide into the stretch and was along for the show. SEABOARD broke in a bit to bother BIG DRINKER then sprinted out to
a comfortable lead, held a diminishing lead along the inside through the turn and was collared entering the lane, offered no resistance to JOHN DUNBAR in
upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. FINALLY AN EDDIE chased outside a rival or three wide to the stretch and weakened.

MAKE IT SNOW settled off the pace and moved inside, gained through the turn and tipped out leaving the bend, fought three deep into deep stretch and
dug in late to prove best, was dismounted when returning on the clubhouse turn and walked off. STRIKINGLY raced up close outside the top pair, bid three
then two wide on the turn, battled between rivals with a sixteenth remaining and got outkicked by the winner. DANCING MO lacked early speed, trailed on
the inside into the turn, angled out to the three path around the bend, finished well and missed the place. APPLE FEST pressed the pace from outside, took
over at the five-sixteenths pole, moved inside once clear late on the turn, resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. DOWHATEVERITTAKES chased
outside a rival, had to steady briefly approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend in the two path and lacked a rally. MUTEKI took control early
and set the pace under pressure from inside, lost command midway around the turn, could not keep up with outer rivals into the lane, tired in the drive and
was eased, then walked off. COLLECTIVELY hit the gate and bobbled slightly at the start, stalked near the inside, pulled up approaching the
seven-sixteenths pole and take out wide and walked off following the race.

THE SHUSHALA cleared and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, roused and asked right handed with a furlong remaining, inched
away and stayed clear to the wire. LADY MONCLAIRE stalked along the rail up the backstretch, took hold at the seven-sixteenths pole and lost some
ground into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane, could not reach the winner and held the place. GIRLCANTHELPIT broke a
step slow, trailed on the inside through the turn, stayed along the fence in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to earn the show honors. LANESRA
bobbled crossing the dirt, stalked outside a rival, coaxed along the around the bend, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
WISHES TO RICHES broke a step slow, raced in range three deep, came four wide into the drive and failed to produce a bid. WILD RULER sat off the pace
and moved inside, eased out to the three path around the bend and tired. ELEGANT KID tossed his head at the start but still came away quickly, got
crowded between rivals crossing onto the dirt and dropped back, drew closer outside a rival up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, exited the bend
four wide and failed to menace.

PANDA PEAK set the pace inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch before clearing at the seven-sixteenths pole, inched away a bit off the rail around the
turn, roused at the top of the stretch, asked left handed at the eighth pole and responded by keeping clear to the line. BIG RAINBOW chased along the
inside into the turn, ridden along into the stretch, tipped out in the lane, finished determinedly but had to settle for second best. DIXIE BLAZE pressed three
deep up the backstretch, chased three wide into the turn, two wide into drive and weakened. STAY UP chased in range off the inside, rounded the bend
three deep and weakened. SMILING WIDOW pressed the pace from between rivals in the early going, lost touch with the leader into the turn, dropped back

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LOVE stumbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly, led three wide into the first turn then cleared and moved to the inside, met the bid from
SENSE at the three-eighths pole, kicked clear outside the quarter pole, drew off when asked and coasted in approaching the wire. SENSE hustled from the
gate, chased three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, bid outside with three furlongs remaining, failed to kick on with the leader approaching the
quarter pole and stayed on to secure second. THIRSTY LOV stalked from inside and had to steady early on the clubhouse turn, came out into the
backstretch, advanced two wide on the far turn and put in a mild rally for the show honors. VERITAS AEQUITAS chased two wide into the clubhouse turn
then got floated out around the bend, traveled three deep up the backstretch, remained three wide into the lane and weakened. POLIS stalked along the
inside then drifted out on the clubhouse turn, tugged between rivals briefly on the backstretch, chased two wide then on the inside on the far turn and could
not rally when called upon. BEAR COAST forwardly placed two wide then moved inside, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the final furlong and walked
off. NAUKANAUKA antsy in the gate, hopped and hit the gate to come away slow, got forced out entering the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn,
started to weaken around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
THIRTY FOUR COUPE rated outside a pair of rivals, set the pace two wide then moved inside, met bids from outer rivals into the far turn, cleared into the
stretch, asked right handed in the lane and held safely. NUMERO DIX (GB) hesitated at the start and lagged behind early, inched closer on the inside up the
backstretch, ran into traffic in upper stretch, gained an opening and rallied late to get up for second. ENAHM broke a step slow, got bumped from outside
early, traveled along the rail then moved to the two path on the backstretch, angled four to five wide turning for home, finished well but got edged for second.
INTO IT pulled early showing speed between rivals, chased in the two path into the clubhouse turn, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, bid between
foes into the far turn, lost touch with the winner into the lane, remained within range through the final furlong but faltered late and lost the place and show.
RESULTANT bumped leaving the gate, got bumped again early and forced to take up, sat off the pace outside a rival, chased outside a rival at the back into
the far turn, trailed into the lane, steered out into the clear and finished well to improve position. MY PARTNER GLEN bumped with inner rival at the start,
moved inside chasing out of range, tipped out to the three path on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, chased between into deep stretch and could
not rally. DISCRETIONARY DAY raced in range outside a pair of rivals, bid three deep entering the far turn, failed to sustain the challenge around the bend
and flattened in the drive. WORSE READ SANCHEZ got knocked into outer rival at the start, had to steady when losing his path early, began to pull shortly
after, traveled in mid-pack off the rail up the backstretch, moved into striking distance approaching the far turn, shifted out midstretch, bothered by outer rival
late and weakened. LUKA GRAZIE stalked outside a rival or in the two path, chased between into and around the far turn, bumped with inner rival entering
the stretch and weakened. CENTRE CIRCLE forwardly placed on the inside, came under ride on the far turn, bumped with LUKA GRAZIE into the stretch
and weakened.
