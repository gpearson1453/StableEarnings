Footnotes
STANDINGINTHEFIRE set a pressured pace throughout, opened a clear lead while wandering out and in through the lane and finished determinedly in a
game effort. MO SNOW bobbled leaving the gate, tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied four wide, leader crossed his path mid-stretch, kept on
down the lane but could not get by the winner in a good effort. FATHER OF LIES pressed the pace to the top of the lane to loom in upper stretch, altered
course in the stretch as the winner impeded his path twice in the drive and was out-finished in deep stretch after encountering trouble in the lane.
WILDERZAR unhurried in the early going to trail and made a mild bid in the stretch passing tiring rivals along the way. SUGAR HOOF stalked the leaders
through the turn from the fence and lacked a closing response when called upon. BALAMOR was never a threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
COUNTESS COLETTE stalked the pacesetters to the turn, bid three wide to engage the leader turning for home, battled though the lane and drew clear in
the final sixteenth. AMY'S STAR pressed the pace to the turn, took command on the bend, dueled in the stretch, was out-kicked late to be a clear second
best. WINGS OF HEAVEN broke in to crowd rival, was reserved off the pace to the top of the lane and showed good late energy to gain the show.
MERRIEMELOUIE crowded at the start to drop to the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn cutting the corner coming home and made a mild rally down
the lane. COWGIRLS HUMOR failed to menace. RIVER HUSTLER went one-paced while never a threat. MY DANIELA chased the leaders through the turn
and flattened out. LIGHTENING LOTTIE showed early speed dueling on the lead in the turn and gave way in the stretch.

along the rail, angled out turning for home and rallied mildly through the stretch. DOMI hesitated at the start to give the field several lengths from the gate
and showed good late interest with a belated rally. AKITO set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened in the lane. NATURE OFTHE BEAST rated off
the leaders through the turn and mounted a mild rally in the stretch. MINDSHIP Q failed to menace. LEGEND went evenly as no threat. DR. ROGER chased
the leaders from four wide on the turn and tired in the stretch. WHEN IN ROME well placed near the lead racing three wide on the bend and gave way

Footnotes
DULCE VICTORIA stalked the pacesetter to upper stretch, engaged that one at the eighth pole, drew clear and held the closers safe. ENCHANTED
MELODY reserved of the pace along the fence through the turn and rallied well down the lane to be gaining in deep stretch. MISS SHADY tracked the pace
into the turn, rallied four wide turning for home and could not close the gap late in the drive. BLUE HOUR sped off to a clear lead early, widened the
advantage in the turn and had no response when challenged in mid-stretch. MOONTAP trailed the field while racing wide down the backside and made a
steady grinding advance while still wide down the lane. FALL CAMPAIGN well placed for the first half mile and flattened out in the drive. MY GIRL GABBY
was never a threat. JUMP INTO SANITY was not a factor. VAVITE chased the leaders from four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
ROCKSTAR RO tracked the leaders from the fence through the turn, tipped out two wide turning for home to split rivals and challenge for the lead and
prevailed in a determined drive down the lane. UNCLE EARL stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to threaten in upper stretch and was
out-kicked late in the lane. FOX RED bobbled slightly at the start, rushed to prompt the pace through the turn and finished evenly lacking a late resposne.
SUDDENLY SEDUCTIVE unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and rallied mildly in the stretch from six wide. UHAVETOBEKITTENME sprinted off
to a clear lead leaving the gate, maintained that advantage to the quarter pole and gave way in the lane. CALL WEST failed to menace. GEMO RAIN
contended early and dropped back on the turn as no threat. STRIKE A BEAT was not a factor. T MONEY raced mid-pack for a half and faded.

through the turn, made a bid in upper stretch and flattened out in mid-stretch. TITEBLUEJEANS unhurried early to be near the rear of the filed and showed
late interest down the lane. RUBY LAYNE well placed racing three wide between horses on the bend and lacked a closing rsponse. HOLLYS SUPER STAR

Footnotes
SHE'S CRAFTY unhurried early to be well off the leaders into the far turn, commenced a steady advance on the bend, engaged the leader in deep stretch
despite lugging in and prevailed in the final strides. KINGDOM QUEEN stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied three wide to take command at the quarter
pole, responded when challenged in the lane and was out-nodded by the closer late in the lane. LOST BIKINI unbalanced at the start to break a bit
awkward, prompted the pace down the backside, made a bid from two wide between horses turning for home, battled to mid-stretch and weakened late in
the drive. TIMELY SECRET sped to a clear early lead, dueled from the fence through the final bend and faded in the stretch. LUCKY PENNY ROSE was
not a threat.

Footnotes
SWING STATE set a well rated pace throughout, responded when called upon turning for home and repelled all challenges. HIDDEN ACCESS prompted
the pace throughout and failed to gain on the pacesetter while keeping on well in the lane to be second best. ONE MORE CHAPTER tracked the leaders
around the first bend, lost position down the backside and rallied mildly in the stretch showing late interest. KNOCK WOOD reserved off the pace to the far
turn, rallied four wide on the bend and finished evenly. PAINT THE TOWN rated in mid-pack between rivals through the far turn, rallied to contention on the
turn and failed to sustain the bid. HITE well placed in striking distance to the far turn and flattened out. CHOCOLATE PHILLING was not a threat. DASH OF
FIRE was never a factor.
