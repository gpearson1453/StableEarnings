Footnotes
STEIN'S GIRL away a step slowly leaving the start, recovered and stalked the early pace three wide along the first turn, kept attendance to the modest
fractions through the backstretch run, was roused two wide at the quarter marker and battled for the lead into the stretch, took command and met the late
bid of GRIGORO into the final sixteenth, dueled to the finish and dug in determinedly to prevail. GRIGORO tracked the early pace from the inside, was well
positioned through the backstretch run and saved ground into the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane and tipped three wide into
upper stretch, chased the leading pair to the furlong marker and rallied into the final sixteenth, confronted STEIN'S GIRL into deep stretch, dueled with that
determined rival to the wire and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. SHERILINDA assumed command away from the start, set the
early pace while off of the rail, dictated terms into the backstretch run while setting modest fractions and showed the way into the far turn, was confronted by
STEIN'S GIRL into the stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, could not match strides with the top pair into the final sixteenth, weakened in
deep stretch and just held for show honors at the finish. JAZZY LOVE tracked the early pace from the inside, saved all of the ground while well placed
through the backstretch run, maintained a rail path into the second turn, tipped three wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, did not offer a late rally
and just missed for third on the wire. PANDEMIC GIRL bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle and raced two wide into the first
turn, tracked the modest pace between runners through the backstretch, mounted a two to three wide bid at the quarter marker, swung four wide for the
drive and chased to mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and weakened in the final sixteenth. RUNNING LUCK settled off of the early pace, was
floated out a bit into the first turn and raced three wide into the backstretch, tracked the modest pace while widest to the half-mile pole, chased two wide
along the far turn and tired in the stretch.

TIZ A TIGER settled off of the early pace while not far back, saved ground into the turn and tracked the moderate pace to the quarter marker, was roused in
upper stretch and improved position at the furlong pole, rallied along the inside into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and held in a drive to
prevail in a blanket finish. LILA AT THE BEACH broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, was well handled while setting moderate fractions
into the turn, showed the way to the quarter marker and drifted out a path into upper stretch, maintained a clear lead approaching the furlong marker then
came under pressure past mid-stretch, lost the lead inside of the sixteenth pole and battled into deep stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final
strides and just held for second. HERSABIGGIRL tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, gave chase three to four wide along the turn, raced
widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, just missed for the win and place honors and was clear
for show. DADDYS NINA stalked the moderate early pace, was well positioned into the turn and raced two to three wide to the quarter marker, chased into
the stretch and did not offer a late rally.

WHERE IT'S AT took back off of the solid early pace, tracked between runners approaching the half-mile pole and raced two to three wide into the turn,
waited for racing room at the quarter marker, navigated traffic into upper stretch and split rivals while full of run nearing the furlong pole, slipped to the rail
past mid-stretch, made a quick move approaching the sixteenth-marker and took command into deep stretch, kicked clear in the late stages and was hand
urged to the finish in an impressive debut. PARTY WITH PADDY broke alertly and assumed command leaving the start, set solid early fractions and
dictated terms into the turn, set the pace a bit off of the rail heading to the quarter marker, kicked clear into the stretch and was kept to task past the furlong
grounds, was collared by WHERE IT'S AT at the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and held for second at the finish.
UNBRIDLED RHYTHM stalked the solid early pace while between runners, raced close up into the turn and chased two to three wide approaching the
quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and chased while still within aim at the furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep
stretch and missed for second. MEEKING forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the solid pace from the outside and was guided three to four wide
into the turn, raced close up to the decent pace approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, lacked the
needed response in the final sixteenth and weakened. HOT GOBLIN was allowed to settle while not far back, tracked outside of runners into the turn and
raced three to four wide approaching the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and could not muster a late rally. MONSIEUR broke in a bit leaving the
start and was away a step slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and inched closer nearing the quarter marker,
maintained an inside path into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
KIKI KRAZY broke sharply and made the lead before the turn without much effort, quickly cleared off through the first turn, set a reasonable pace while
always traveling well, got some light pressure from SOO BROOKLYN approaching the half, then raced in tandem with that rival through the far turn,
quickened the pace, pulled clear of the rest in the stretch, gained a slight advantage over that foe passing the three-sixteenth, went clear and won well. SOO
BROOKLYN broke outward and bothered SILVER FLIRT at the break, chased KIKI CRAZY into the turn, moved up to put pressure on that one as they
straightened down the backstretch, then went to challenge for the lead through the far turn, went together into the stretch then was unable to keep pace with
that one with a furlong to run but ran on well to hold the second spot. AFTER MY OWN HEART was reserved to the outside of ZEE PERFECT RUN tracked
the pace from mid-pack through the first half mile, launched a bid with three furlongs to run three wide on the far turn, made steady gains to improve position
but was never a threat to the top two. INFINITE LOVE was four wide early, circled the field and was up pressing the pace by the backstretch run, did not
keep up when the top pair quickened through the far turn, was put into a drive from the five-sixteenths pole, held position to deep stretch but was outfinished
for third in the final yards. SILVER FLIRT got shuffled back when SOO BROOKLYN came over and took the path, changed course to the inside but lagged
at the back of the field through the early stages, started a mild rally from the seven-sixteenths pole and finished even-paced while never a serious threat.
ZEE PERFECT RUN content to track the leaders from mid-pack, went into a stiff drive with three furlongs to run, but did not go on and was outfinished in the
stretch. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM broke well but was under a tight hold from the break, was keen fought the rider some through the first turn while holding
the inside position, raced near the rear of the field to the far turn, and was done before the stretch.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC rated just off of the early pace, tracked from the outside along the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and was well
placed approaching the half-mile pole, was roused three wide into the far turn and inched closer at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, responded
to urging past the furlong marker and took command into the final sixteenth, drew clear into deep stretch and was hand urged to the finish. MOTHER'S
PRAYER was hustled leaving the break and assumed command of the early running, set the pace off of the rail into the first turn, carved out decent
fractions while controlling the pace along the backstretch run, showed the way into the second turn and kicked to a clear lead into the stretch, felt pressure
from KENNEBEC into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and held for second. ROBIE was prominent away from the
start, stalked the early pace three wide along the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run and raced close up into the second turn,
chased MOTHER'S PRAYER into the stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held clearly in the end for third. WINE AND WHISKY was forwardly
placed in the early running, saved ground into the first turn and stalked the decent pace from the inside, was well placed heading to the half-mile marker,
raced within aim into the far turn and waited a bit for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally.
SUPERMAZEL forwardly placed away from the start, went two wide and between runners into the first turn and stalked the pace into the backstretch run,
remained between rivals while tracking to the half-mile marker, chased two wide to the quarter pole, ran evenly into the stretch and lacked a late response.
GROSS PROFIT was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, raced two
wide into the second turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not factor.

UNION EXPRESS was bumped leaving the start and broke a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace and raced wide into the first turn, maintained an outside
path into the backstretch and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn then angled three to four wide for the drive, gained
ground at the furlong marker and closed fast into the final sixteenth, wore down foes in deep stretch and got up in the final strides for a determined win.
DANZING REBEL broke alertly and assumed command leaving the start, took back approaching the first turn and ceded the early lead to EN TU HONOR
BRO, stalked that runner from the inside and was well positioned into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker and saved ground
into the far turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane and raced a bit in tight approaching the furlong marker, tipped two wide past mid-stretch
and rallied into the final sixteenth, vied between runners in deep stretch, missed for the win and got up for the place in a game runner-up effort. EN TU
HONOR BRO bobbled at the start, bumped UNION EXPRESS and was off a step slowly, recovered and rushed up to be forwardly placed heading into the
first turn, assumed command and set the early pace while off of the rail, dictated terms into the backstretch run and carved out decent fractions approaching
the half-mile marker, set a pressured pace into the far turn and repelled BOOMING BERNARDO into the stretch, was set down for the drive and led into the
final sixteenth, was all out into deep stretch, was caught by oncoming rivals in the final strides and held clearly for third in a good effort. BOOMING
BERNARDO took back leaving the start and tracked two wide into the first turn, made a middle move between rivals along the backstretch and rushed to
contention heading to the half-mile pole, contested the pace two wide into the second turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, lost ground into the
stretch and chased to the furlong pole, could not muster the needed late response and weakened in deep stretch. THE FUSS was a bit slow into stride away
from the start, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, made a middle move between runners and vied for the lead nearing the half-mile
pole, lost position along the far turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch and faded in the late stages. VINNIEBOB
settled off of the early pace and tracked four wide into the first turn, pulled on the rider entering the backstretch run and raced close up to the decent pace
while four wide at the half-mile marker, lost position into the second turn and chased three wide to the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and tired in
the final furlong. CALCULATED SPIN rated off of the early pace and tracked three wide into the first turn, tracked between runners into the backstretch and

Footnotes
FIVE O COCKTAIL took back off of the solid early pace and tracked from the second flight to begin, was steered three to four wide along the turn and
gained ground at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and led to the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, felt
mild late pressure from the runner-up, was kept to task into deep stretch and held safely for the win. HONORABLE GAL rated nicely off of the early pace
and tracked between runners heading to the half-mile marker, was guided two wide into the turn, steadied and altered course at the quarter pole then was
blocked into upper stretch, angled out for the drive and improved position at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in
deep stretch and was clear of the rest for second. MS FLASHY HARBOR settled off of the solid early pace, tracked from the inside and was well placed
heading into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker then waited a bit for racing room nearing the top of the lane, found room into the stretch and ran
evenly to the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch to secure show honors. MO TOWN GAL took back off of the
contentious early pace, tracked from the outside and gained ground four to five wide along the turn, raced widest into the stretch and lost ground at the
furlong pole, could not muster a final response and was outfinished for third. MORNING ADDICTION showed good early speed, engaged with HIIS REINA
and disputed the solid pace while inside of that rival, dueled with a pair of rivals into the turn and carved out decent fractions to the quarter marker, was
overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and weakened in the final sixteenth. BLURSDAY broke alertly, contested the early pace while
three wide and pressed outside of the leading pair heading into the turn, disputed the solid pace three deep at the quarter marker, battled into the stretch
and lost ground at the furlong pole, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and gave way. HIIS REINA was sent leaving the break, contested solid early
fractions with MORNING ADDICTION and dueled between runners into the turn, disputed the pace between runners heading to the quarter pole, stopped in
upper stretch, was not persevered with through the final furlong and was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
THE CALABRESE KID reserved from the break, raced near the back of the field through the early going then launched an extended rally from the
seven-sixteenths pole, got a perfect inside trip through the turn and into the stretch and continued the rally up the rail, took the lead passing the sixteenth
pole and won driving. AWESOME DUDE lacked speed from the break, settled into stride racing five wide to the turn, angled in a bit while making forward
progress through the turn, had to check in traffic near the three-sixteenths pole, found a seam approaching the furlong grounds then finished well under
strong handling to just miss. MY SUNSHINE was hustled from the break but was not fast enough to contend for the early lead, advanced steadily up the rail
through the run down the backstretch, had to wait for racing room on the turn for home, took advantage when DECIMATE left the rail open, had the lead
briefly near the eighth pole then was overtaken by the top two finishers inside the final sixteenth. SCHOCHOH broke well and was chasing the dueling
leaders through the first quarter mile, responded when asked to go after the leaders passing the three furlong marker, got clear run five wide into the stretch,
ran on well under steady handling and was gaining but ran out of time. R M C HOOK'EM was sent hard from the break and got forward position in the
tracking group behind the two pacesetters, cruised into contention five to six wide through the turn, gained ground at mid-stretch, finished evenly and
needed more in the final stages. CONTINENTAL UNION steadied just after the break and then a half-furlong out, chased from the rear of the field while
saving ground through the far turn, was kept to task, finished willingly but came up short. LIL MIRACLE MAN made light contact with CONTINENTAL
UNION after the break, then attempted to duck in at the gap a few strides out, got straight then was forced to steady and alter course when THE
CALABRESE KID cut in front, moved out the the three path for racing room, began to gain ground through the turn then swung four wide into the stretch,
was behind horses then angled out to the six path for the stretch run and showed some late interest but was unable to overcome earlier troubles. POLACCO
was first away but ceded the lead to DECIMATE, let that foe slip away through the turn but came back on to get even near the quarter pole, took a slight
lead at the top of the stretch but weakened a furlong out. DECIMATE was forced out some after the break then went quickly to engage with POLACCO for
the early lead, took over passing the five furlong pole, opened up on the field going into the turn, became surrounded by challengers at the quarter pole,
stopped, then was galloped out to the finish.
