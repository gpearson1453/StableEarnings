CHAD'S FLASH stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, bid entering the lane and drew off. CHARLIE'S CREED laid off of the pace in the four path and
ran on to edge place entering the final sixteenth. FAMILY CREED vied two wide, led around the turn, but was headed by an outer bidder leaving the quarter
pole, gave way yet lasted for show. MAGIC MONDAY broke through the gate pre-race, bumped an inner rival at the start before bumping with an outer foe
soon after, chased from midpack in the three path and between horses, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and moved up. RAMMER JAMMER
bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, took the turn in the two path, moved forward between horses entering the lane to vie for
show with an outer rival in upper stretch, but tired. EL MIC TIESUN lagged behind and got outrun. LOVE A FIGHTER bumped with an inner rival early on,
vied along the inside, then weakened turning for home.

LANETTA broke slowly yet quickly rushed forward to show the way into the first turn, led from an outer presser around the far turn, drew away from that one
entering the lane and was driven home while hanging on his left lead. CAPELLA RED broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the
inside, tipped outside of the top pair around the far turn, then chased the clear leader home to prove second best. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) laid off of
the pace in the four to three path, then moved up. IMPERATOR FURIOSA stalked two wide, moved to press into the far turn but weakened entering the
lane. IRISH MOLLY was bumped by an inner rival at the start and showed little.

KEYS INCLUDED tracked three wide and between horses, chased around the far turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to drive past the
leader in the final sixteenth and drew clear. ZAICI showed the way in the three path, built a clear margin in upper stretch, but was caught in the late stages
and lasted for place. HAMMERIN AAMER laid off of the pace in the three to four path, ranged up in the five to four path into the far turn, took aim on the
leader turning for home, but only managed to chase that one in upper stretch, lost place passing the furlong grounds and kept on. TWO WORLDS stalked
two wide and between horses, chased around the far turn and pursued evenly. BONUS APPRECIATION tracked along the inside, chased turning for home
and gave way. MAX PANDOWDY trailed, gained in the two path around the far turn, shifted to the fie path in upper stretch and leveled off. ONE TIME GEM
saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. NOBLE PURSUIT pursued from midpack hung five wide, weakened around the far turn and was eased through
the lane. MEDITATE tracked four wide and between horses, but was done early and eased home.

UNCLE JAKE vied along the inside, drew clear into the far turn and held sway under a drive. QUATERNION lunged into the outer part of the starting gate
upon leaving it, trailed along the inside, gained place from outer rivals approaching the five sixteenths pole, then chased the clear leader through the lane
while hanging on his left lead to be second best. DEVIL'S HARVEST tracked in the three path, trailed briefly in the two path around the far turn and failed to
menace. SIMPLE LOGIC moved forward in the four path around the first turn to vie for the lead with an inner rival nearing the backstretch, but weakened
entering the far turn.

SWEET DARLIN broke slowly and brushed with an inner foe at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper
stretch and drove past entering the final sixteenth. FREEBURN showed the way, built a clear margin entering the lane, but hung on his left lead as an outer
foe pursued through midstretch, and was caught by that one at the sixteenth pole. OLIVIA G chased from midpack in the three path, shifted out to the five
path in upper stretch and ran on. THE CALLING STONE brushed an outer rival while off slow, settled off of the pace in the two path and improved inside of
rivals. MY ROYAL PRINCESS trailed in the three path into the turn, then improved between horses. CAJUN CATALINA pressed outside of the leader but
weakened entering the lane. BITSY PERFECTMATCH lacked speed in the four to five path and failed to factor. BOHEMIAN JIGGLES pursued along the
inside and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
GILCREASE tracked the dueling leading trio from the inside, offered a rail bid in upper stretch, led into midstretch and held sway. CREW DRAGON trailed
along the inside early on, moved out of last tipping to the two path into the turn, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to gain place and take aim
on the new leader at the furlong grounds, but only managed to chase that one home to prove second best. PLANE TALK dueled for the lead inside of a pair
of rivals, inched free in the two path in upper stretch, but met an inner challenge shortly after and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds.
AMBIVALENT trailed in the two to three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and moved up. INVULNERABLE was last away, yet rushed forward to
spar for the lead outside of a pair of rivals, but weakened in upper stretch. INTO THE SUNRISE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses but
weakened leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SWOT ANALYSIS set the pace along the inside as an outer rival applied pressure, shook free of that one in upper stretch and held sway under a drive.
MIKE J pressed outside of the leader and chased that one well through the lane. FIESTY FIST chased along the inside, checked slightly inside the final five
sixteenths, claimed show from outer rivals in midstretch, drifted out and held. HELAIRE lacked speed in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch
and moved up. LANGS DAY lagged behind and surpassed tired rivals. JAX MAN laid off of the pace in the two to three path and failed to factor. BRIAN'S
IRON MIKE raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but gave way through the final furlong. CLEAR AS A BELE leaned out and steadied at the start,
tracked four to three wide into the turn and weakened between horses in upper stretch.
