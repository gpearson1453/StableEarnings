Footnotes
NO TROUBLE moved forward outside to attend the pace up the backstretch, went about four wide through the turn taking a narrow lead near the quarter
pole, drew clear when mid-stretch while much the best. YO SOY ROY broke just a step slowly, settled at the rear, shifted out on the turn fanning seven wide
into upper stretch, was second best. CHASING COYOTES bumped with a rival at the start, soon moved forward attending the pace between runners three
wide just off the leader, bid between coming to the five-sixteenths, floated out a bit turning for home, could not kick on with the winner and was outfinished
for place. RIGHT IN FRONT was urged forward between runners to a prominent position briefly prompting the pace from the five-eighths, dropped back at
the half racing inside the second flight into the turn, moved out further off the rail turning for home, kept on to improve. RED FROST was forced out heading
up the backstretch racing outside runners, went about five wide on the turn, angled nine deep in upper stretch and ran on. CASH FOLLOWS ME bumped
with a rival at the start, quickly moved clear to set the pace shifting in, soon faced outside pressure from numerous rivals, gave way in the stretch.
LOVESUNFAIR forced a rival out heading up the backstretch, moved in racing between runners chasing four wide into the turn, moved in a bit further early
on that bend, came out for the drive, faded.

Footnotes
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT broke just a hair slowly but was allowed to settle into stride, angled out very wide on the first turn, advanced rapidly outside about
five deep heading to the lead by the seven-sixteenths, edged to a narrow advantage, held sway while being kept busy. BURNZ DA BOSS was forced wide
on the first turn but floated a bit wider by a drifting foe, made a mild advance in behind the eventual winner heading into the far turn, urged along by the
quarter pole, was no match for the winner but second best. LOOKING FOR BULL was caught wide on the first turn racing five deep and moving forward to
the force the pace up the backstretch from outside, had a narrow lead briefly, was overtaken by the eventual winner outside, raced nearer the inside about
three wide on the far turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, kept on in the lane but needed more. DOM WAYNE settled off the pace three to four wide
mid-division, angled eight deep into upper stretch, ran on. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP chased from inside, came off the fence for the stretch run, went evenly
and needed more. REVOLT AND RIOT was up close four wide early, dropped back, fanned nine wide into the stretch, failed to menace. WILLTOBELUCKY
was unhurried bringing up the rear and never a threat. GORDY'S RULES set the early pace racing well off the rail, continued to contend in the two to three
path with pressure up the backstretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
DESERTROSE OFTEXAS attended the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, engaged the leader more earnestly turning for home while
exchanging light contact, dueled in upper stretch, edged away late. AWESOME WALKER moved quickly to the lead, set the pace racing off the rail and with
outside pressure, exchanged minor contact leaving the turn now under a drive and engaged in a duel inside the eventual winner, was no match and
outfinished but clearly second best. SPECIAL PRIDE settled at the rear, swung eight wide, finished willingly to get up for show honors. TIME IS PRECIOUS
pursued the leading pair three to five wide through the turn, floated seven deep into upper stretch, was outfinished for show. PASSION BELLE chased in
behind racing two to four wide and ridden along by the three-eighths, failed to rally. INDIAN EXCELLENCE broke in the air, was encouraged forward
chasing inside, tired.

Footnotes
OPEN ROAD attended the early pace between runners, pursued the inside foes four wide on the turn, took a narrow lead outside the furlong marker, drifted
out and dueled with an outside foe, shared the win. MAGIC MOSCO raced up close going five wide into the turn just off the leaders, engaged the leader just
past the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and fought on gamely to share the win. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY switched out off the inside up the backstretch
racing well back of the leaders, edged closer into and on the turn and began to move out further past the three-eighths, was six deep coming to the quarter
pole and eight wide by upper stretch looming a threat, gained steadily but slowly and missed. TW SKIPPING STONES attended from outside going six wide
on the turn and in contention, lacked the needed late kick. MAGIC IS FLYING angled in early, settled off the leaders, saved ground on the turn, came out
turning for home, altered back in near mid-stretch, ran on. FLAT FAST pressed from between runners into the turn, raced two to three wide on that bend,
weakened in the stretch. JUST CALL ME KEN was caught wide outside foes off the pace four to six wide through the turn, failed to menace. TRACK
BOUND raced well off the inside early, was three to five wide through the turn off the leaders, failed to menace. BULLAWAY was encouraged forward, vied
inside runners for the lead but off the fence, took a narrow advantage into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
GRAZEN BOY stalked in behind racing off the inside, angled out past the quarter drifting eight wide into upper stretch, lugged in at that juncture but soon
took command and powered away under steady handling. NORTHERN COCKTAIL soon moved to the lead dictating terms racing well off the rail in about
the three path on the turn drifting out a bit on that bend, was overtaken and no match but second best. STOREY'S FURY was just a hair slow into stride,
steadily moved forward stalking from outside four to five wide, was still in range into upper stretch but needed more late. STELLA BOY was outpaced early,
switched out off the rail coming to the half, went in the two to three path on the turn advancing, kept on inside to round out the super. PARS AND BIRDIES
moved forward leaving the backstretch and further off the inside racing three to five wide, kept on evenly. OKAY YOU SAY WHEN broke a step slowly,
settled off the pace, raced mostly two to three wide on the turn while well back, angled ten wide in upper stretch and kicked on mildly. SAGA chased in
behind near the rail, shifted outside a tiring foe around the seven-sixteenths, appeared to be getting out continuing to drift wider through the remainder of the
turn, ran on. AHEAD OF TIME KID was outpaced early, passed tired rivals. ATTILA'S ACE quickly took a brief and narrow early lead inside, continued to
chase but soon steadily retreated. BAJA BOOGIE stalked from outside early, went mostly four to five wide, advanced on the leader to be within contention
turning for home while drifting out a bit, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
ROCHESTER'S FINEST rated off the pace about four to six deep, bided time into the turn, angled out leaving that bend and again in upper stretch, took aim
and drove past. PLAYING FIELD was urged from the start but lacking early speed, caught wide outside foes five to six deep on the turn advancing while
fanning nine wide into upper stretch, took the led in mid-stretch but was outkicked. RIO CUTIE broke in a bit, moved forward racing three wide into the turn
and coming out six wide leaving that bend, kicked on but needed more. AUTISM WARRIOR settled at the rear switching out off the inside, fanned twelve
wide, continued to improve. D C GUN RUNNER was ridden from the start, moved forward attending the pace into the turn racing four wide, bid at the
quarter pole, drifted eight deep leaving the turn, was overtaken and lacked the needed late kick. THOUGHTS OF GOLD was within range, bid between foes
three wide coming to the five-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch. ATTILA THE STAR broke a step slowly, raced toward the back mostly three wide, altered
outside a foe at the top of the stretch, ran on without being pressured but finished willingly. D C ALLIED FORCES had a brief early lead inside then
continued to chase, soon dropped back, faded. TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE was in pursuit early then pressed then soon took over the lead past the half, moved
in from three to two wide on the turn contending inside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
LET HIM BE was outsprinted in the early going and content to sit off the the leaders in behind tracking inside on or just off the rail, waited briefly coming past
the quarter pole, split foes at the top of the stretch taking the lead, spurted clear and held sway. DIABOLICAL STORM advanced five to six wide, was in
contention in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but held the place. ALL CHROME was unhurried early, fanned eleven wide, was gaining too
late. DELBERT TOO settled off the leaders, moved in to be four wide into the turn, fanned ten deep out of that bend, kept on for the minor award. MASSIVE
ROAR rated in behind mid-pack, went about three wide early on the turn, was guided out nine wide leaving that bend, ran on evenly. STORM BAYOU
settled inside off the pace, shifted six wide into upper stretch, steadied on heels when in tight between foes coming to the furlong grounds, ran on.
ANTONIOS MARK was off the rail at the rear early, swung four wide into upper stretch, was guided in a bit and ran on evenly while making no bid. NO
PASA NADA advanced outside on the turn six to seven wide, weakened in upper stretch. LARIAT took the early lead soon after the start, was challenged by
inside and outside foes vying between three wide, reasserted prominence on the turn, was empty for the stretch run. MAMIE'S LAST HOPE was within
range attending the pace four deep into the turn, weakened turning into upper stretch and came out a bit at that point, faded thereafter. TUCUM contested
the pace inside foes but off the rail into the turn, faltered at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
COMMUNITY LEADER was bumped lightly at the start, then bumped an inside rival soon after, stalked the leader from inside a foe and off the rail, moved
out four wide leaving the turn and encouraged along gaining on the leader, struck a narrow lead in mid-stretch, began to edge away from that foe then just
held from a new inside challenger late. MARKING CANYON was bumped sideways early, chased the leaders racing near the inside, gained steadily through
the stretch under an all-out drive but just missed. MILK IT came out a path or so and was urged clear at the start, set the pace in hand, came out a bit
leaving the turn, was challenged by an outside rival and overtaken in mid-stretch, yielded grudgingly. HOLY BULLET was in tight and squeezed back at the
start, raced outside at the rear lacking speed, shifted in a bit on the turn, ran on to improve position. EVERYROSEHASATHORN bumped the inner rival at
the start, chased from outside four wide, floated six deep into upper stretch and weakened. AMIGO LOCO steadied just after the start when squeezed back,
switched out abruptly soon after, raced at the back off the inside, failed to rally. HEZEKIAH'S RULE was bumped into a rival in the early going, chased from
off the rail mostly two to three wide, tired.

Footnotes
PAYINGOFFMYMARKER got away alertly but soon ceded the lead content to stalk from outside while kept very wide, moved inward four wide rapidly taking
command past the three-eighths, kicked clear and received just mild urging late. MARK THE WINNER stalked in behind the leaders from off the inside,
moved out from four to six wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. MAKE UP A STORY angled in up the backstretch, saved some
ground near the rail into the turn, moved out five wide past the quarter pole then shifted back in a bit at the top of the stretch, ran on but needed more.
STREET MARK was caught wide through the turn racing four to seven deep and outside foes, evened out in the lane. HONKY TONK HONEY raced outside
off the pace mostly five to six wide and kept on evenly. MARK IT DOWN was coaxed to the lead inside, dueled with a foe, weakened. WILDCAT REESE
was near the inside toward the rear and failed to menace. EMPRESS IN FRONT was hard to load, exchanged a bump at the start, urged forward inside
chasing mid-pack, came off the rail for the drive, failed to rally. KOMFORT KID was bumped sideways at the start then coaxed forward, pressed then dueled
with the inside leader, came up empty.
