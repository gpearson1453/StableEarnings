Footnotes
BLUEISH broke awkwardly, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and shook clear in upper stretch. KHOZALL stalked the pace three wide, could not
gain on the winner in the lane but kept on to outfinish foes for the place. VYBES raced a bit greenly down the backstretch, was in range at the rail and was
one-paced at the rail in the lane. BABY BLOCKS bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide between foes and weakened in the final furlong.
CAIRNHILL raced greenly behind foes down the backstretch, raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened. IT'S ONLY WORDS was
bumped on both sides at the start, raced two wide and never reached contention. GENTING was bumped at the start, raced three wide and played no
factor. VERDUGIRL broke awkwardly but quickly, chased the pace three wide and was through early.

ROUGH DRAFT laid in range in the three path, was ridden into the far turn, angled out to the four path to bid at the top of the lane, took the lead passing the
eighth pole, and held sway. EYES ON TARGET trailed in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the five path turning
into the stretch, and ran on for place. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY raced off the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside passing the three-eighths,
tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and kept on between foes for show. GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) laid off the pace in the two path, was
cued while angling out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but appeared to be trying to lug in though the stretch, and finished evenly. CHANCEUX set
the pace in the two path, was nudged along around the far turn, cued from the three path into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. CITIZEN K stalked
inside, was roused passing the three-eighths, cut the corner to bid inside of foes turning into the lane but faded in the final furlong. NIGHT JUMPER was
keen going into the first turn, rated in the four path but never threatened. GENTLEMAN GERRY trailed throughout around the two path.

CHANGE OF COMMAND settled outside of the leader to prompt the pace in the three path, was roused to bid early into the far turn, took the lead from an
inner foe midway around the far turn, dueled with that inner foe turning into the stretch, inched away around the sixteenth, and held on. CARDINALE set the
pace inside, was coaxed when facing an outer challenger approaching the three-eighths, lost the lead midway around the far turn, dug in while dueling with
that outer foe to retake the lead at the top of the short stretch, but was edged out in the final furlong to place. RAGUEL tracked in the two path, was ridden
into the far turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, and was along for show. CHISPARRAJOS stalked in four path but faded in the stretch.
REAL MACHO chased in the four path, was coaxed from the five path into the far turn, but did not threaten. ORB ALPHA raced off the pace in the two path
but never menaced.

KANTHARI set a pressured pace in the two path and edged clear under a drive. CAROTARI pressed the winner in the three path, could not get past but
held safe for the place. RUN CURTIS RUN was off slowly, trailed three wide, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied outside while trying to lug in through
the stretch. AXTHELM raced well back three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied while racing in tight quarters between foes. OXYMORE
chased the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. CRISPY CAT (GB) raced off the duel in the clear in the two path and weakened
in the stretch. BOHEMIAN BOY played no factor while racing two wide. AVANT GLORY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ROAN stalked in the four path, was ridden three wide into the turn, bid in the four path at the top of the lane, stayed on while on his left lead, and inched
ahead in the final sixteenth. EASTBOSTONBENNY set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the three path at the top of the
stretch, dug in while tipping inwards slightly on his left lead, but was edged out in the final sixteenth to place. ADIOS NOW laid in range behind the leader in
the two path, waited for room around the turn, swung from the three path into the stretch, tipped inwards into the final furlong, and kept on, but had to steady
slightly late for show. WEMBY tracked in the four path, floated out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but was one paced. CURLINS
CRUZIN rated along the inside, was roused passing the three-eighths, but did not factor in the three path down the lane. FIRST SHOT FIRED chased in the
five path, was cued in the three path passing the three-eighths, but did not threaten. AHORSEWITHNONAME pressed inside, was coaxed along going into
the turn, but gaveway into the stretch.
