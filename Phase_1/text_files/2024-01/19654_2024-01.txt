passing the eighth pole but held on for second. HE ROLLS gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn then dueled through the
stretch for third. GLORIOUS MAHOMES chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MO EH

rounded the far turn about the three path then dueled through the stretch for second. EXPRESS LADY raced through the opening turn about the six path,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, left the turn outside and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
MIND YOUR OWN rated a slim early lead inside, was met passing the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but faded into the far turn. REVEIRS

midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. MISS WILD saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. SO RED THE ROSE

DIVINE FASHION stalked off the rail then challenged approaching the five sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving the quarter, drew clear into the lane and
was kept sharp to draw away. BABY MAN took a quick lead while angling to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths
pole, was met at the quarter and had to settle for second best. FLAT DISCOUNT rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened stride. TIMEISGOLDEN saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY rated close off the rail the opening turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. UNCAPTURED RUBY rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn
toward the outside and gave chase leaving the half mile pole, but weakened in the five path on the far turn. SHERIFF'S KID raced in the five path the first
turn, showed little response through the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the four path and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
ARYA CHARMING stalked while lacking a clear path through the backstretch, started a bid leaving the quarter pole and angled out to come between horses
midway on the turn, took over approaching the eighth pole and was kept alert in the lane. NOVEMBER IMPERIUM lacked a clear path leaving the three
eighths pole, eased to the six path into the turn, corrected course inward entering the stretch and dueled through later yards for second. JUBA'S YANKEE
ONE raced with the pace through the backstretch, took the nod into the turn and drew briefly clear midway on the turn, was met toward the head of the lane
then outfinished in a later duel for second. JUBA'S MOCHA stumbled at the break then angled out to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path and
finished evenly to pass rivals. METALLIC CAT gave chase toward the outside, raced in the five path on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.
VIESTE gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the stretch. TIME TO SNOOZE gave close chase through
the backstretch, steadied midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. BOUNDTONOONE raced with the pace inside but dropped back at the rail midway
on the turn and weakened.
