Footnotes
MAGIC TAP broke well, in the second flight while racing off the inside, moved closer in the two path late in the final turn, split foes nearing the furlong
marker, bid, gained the advantage and held late in determined fashion. CREATIVE MINISTER off step slow, trailed while racing in the two path, continued to
see all his rivals through the final turn, rallied late from between foes to garner the place. O P FIRECRACKER moved off the inside midway on the first turn,
raced unhurried in the run up the backstretch, angled out four wide turning for home, late interest down the middle of the strip, outkicked for the runner up
position. ETHEREAL ROAD lacked speed, raced four wide into the stretch, challenged outside the leader a furlong out, flattened in the late going. SPEED
BIAS away in good order, set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way into the lane, faltered the final furlong. TAHOE RUN prompted the pace in
the three path, continued to pressure the leader the middle half, had little left the final furlong. WINTERS LION dropped inside first turn, raced forwardly
midway on the final turn then began to give way, continued to back up through the lane.

Footnotes
BRAHMS IMAGE broke alertly, angled toward the inside in the run up the backstretch while setting the pace, edged clear when straightened for home, held
the runner up comfortably safe under steady handling. MONEYSTRIKE forwardly placed outside, four wide into the turn, continued to prompt the winner
through the bend and into the stretch, minimal gain on the winner late, second best. CHEZ WHIZ void of speed for a half, came four wide for the drive, late
rally for the show. KISSOFTHENILE forwardly placed while racing off the inside, between the top two entering the stretch, lacked a closing punch.
BRADFORD turned in a one paced effort off the inside. SINGING GROOM off a step slow, void of speed after moving out, came five wide for the drive,
improved position without making a serious impact. STREAKIN DEACON in mid pack early while outside, made a mild advance four wide through the turn,
failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. HARD LUCK HENRY lacked speed well out in the strip, four to five wide turn, failed to muster a closing
response. BET ON TIZ in the second flight early while in the two path, began a steady retreat before a half. BOOTS N BOURBON off a step slow, remained
always back. MR. BENNY tired while racing three wide. BLOWOUT MOUNTAIN in the second group early while along the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
PLAY THE TRUMPET behind the pace along the inside in the run up the backstretch, patiently handled through the bend, came in the two path for the drive,
steered out in traffic for room past the furlong marker, outside bid, strongly clear. POWER SLAM away in good order, pressed the early leader from the
outside, dueled through the turn off the inside, took over in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. BYE BYE LIAM
in the second flight early, moved closer three wide through the turn, up for the show late, not a serious threat for the place. HEY JOE JOE void of early foot
after lugging soon after the start, three wide through the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest. BOURBON AFICIONADO lacked speed, raced three
wide through the bend, failed to menace. WALDRIP last away, trailed in the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while also not a serious threat. SECRET
TAVERN broke on top, set the pace along the inside early, dueled through the turn with the runner up, gave way entering the stretch. BELL DOZER back off
the pace and the inside, moved closer with a mild middle move four wide in the turn, backed backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
JACKMAN broke on top, set the pace while racing just off the inside, shook clear into the lane, extended that advantage to the wire under steady handling.
COLT FICTION moved off the inside when off the early pace, four wide through the turn when making a mild move, could do little with the winner in the
drive, proved game for the second spot. TROPIC STORM dropped inside early in the turn, continued to save ground into the lane, not enough for the place
while remaining inside. LUV TO WIN pressured the winner from three path then could not keep up, continued to weaken from between horses the final
furlong. LYKAN failed to menace while racing three to four wide through the turn. SOLIDIFY hesitated at the break, moved out steadily through the turn,
came five wide into the stretch, failed to rally. TRIGGER HAPPY off a step slow, remained back while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
COMMON DEFENSE settled off the pace and in the inside, crept closer late in the final turn while angling out four wide for the drive, slight drift nearing the
furlong marker, bid, kicked well clear. GIVE ME LIBERTY lacked early foot, improved into the stretch while four wide, continued willingly to the end, gained
the nod for the place. NATIVE LAND last to leave, raced back early, moved into contention with a four to five wide move through the second turn, bid,
gained the advantage past the furlong marker but could not contain the top two. EL MAGNIFICO pressured the early leader off the inside, put a head in front
midway on the final turn, gradually weakened through the lane. JUSTIFIABLY SO six wide into the first turn, continued in mid pack outside, five wide into the
second turn, lacked a closing kick. SITKA within striking distance inside, lacked a closing response. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN lacked speed, saved ground while
remaining back through the second turn, improved position with some mild late interest. ELKO COUNTY void of speed for six furlongs off the inside, four
wide for the drive, passed tiring rivals. JACKED void of speed off the inside, four wide through most of the final turn, failed to rally. PENROD settled early in
the three path, continued off the inside, gave way in the second turn. CHARLESTON prompted the issue up front for five furlongs and also gave way. ASK
WILLIE took command after start, set the pace then stopped in the second turn when headed.

Footnotes
FROSTED GRACE settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the far turn, moved closer while three wide into the lane, lost some ground to the
leader, engaged that one inside the furlong grounds, edged clear under firm handling. PATS PROPERTY broke sharp, set the pace inside, rated the middle
half, continued to show the way through upper stretch, proved stubborn until late, comfortably clear of the others at the end. PERFECT FLIGHT within
striking distance along the inside, remained within contact of the runner up while saving ground through the second turn, lacked a closing kick in the drive.
ETHICAL JUDGEMENT forwardly placed while in the three path, also came up empty for the drive. UNINVITED GUEST off a bit slowly, raced back and four
wide through the first turn, three wide when moving closer second, flattened out in the drive. SHOOTERS SHOOT prompted the pace outside, moved closer

Footnotes
KANTEX back off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, angled in nearing midstretch, inside bid, drew clear. KABOOM BABY void of early
foot, asked along four to five wide into the stretch, rallied midtrack, could not match strides with the winner late, maintained daylight for the place. MOZINGO
forwardly placed while between horses up the backstretch, fell back turn, moved out four wide for the drive, brief rebid, finished up evenly to prove best of
the rest. CONNIE K narrowly showed the way early, dueled turn, headed, regained lead, could not last. UNBRIDLED TWISTER void of speed inside,
continued to save ground turn, improved position, no real threat. HISSY MISSY off slow, raced in the back off the rail, three wide into the stretch, also
improved position without posing a serious threat. RUN FEARLESS settled in mid pack off the inside, failed to rally. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke in to
help bother GRAMERCY PARK, was straightened to duel up front off the inside, faltered in the drive. SHE'S STORMING broke out, raced in midpack for a
half, tired through the stretch. GRAMERCY PARK pinched and was off slowly, remained always back while outside. SUMMER SHOES behind the first flight
inside, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MIDSHIPMAN'S DANCE outrun in the early going inside, continued to save ground turn, moved closer then was roused past the furlong marker, challenged
soon after, gained the advantage then held the runner up safe late in game fashion. TANYA SHOWERS back off the pace out in the strip, advanced four
wide late turn, challenged while remaining widest through the lane with a sixteenth to run, denied. SHARP TUNE away in good order, sprinted well clear
through a lively set of early fractions, continued to show the way through the turn, offered but brief resistance to the top two late, saved the show.
EDISTRUDIS broke alertly despite bumping with XTREME SMOKE SHOW, allowed the speed to go in the second flight, two path through the turn, had little
left for the stretch run to miss the show. XTREME SMOKE SHOW bumped at the start, in the second group while racing three wide, moved closer late in the
turn in the three path, flattened. DIVINE GAL last to leave, raced back off the pace outside, swung out further to be five wide into the lane, failed to fire.

Footnotes
CAN'T HUSH THIS broke alertly, tracked in a forward position along the inside, patiently handled in traffic second turn, steered out three wide turning for
home, bid, took over, going away. KING RUSSELL in mid pack off the inside, rallied three to four wide into the lane, rallied for the place, no threat to the
winner. ELUSIVE TARGET just off the inside when lacking speed, in traffic late in the second turn, continued through traffic when rallying stretch, up for the
show. MEGAN'S HONOR back off the pace just off the inside, angled out to be five wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to improve late. HERN in mid
pack while racing just off the inside, came three wide for the drive, lacked a serious closing response. JUILLIARD carried out a bit in the first turn when
pressing the pace, continued to force the issue the middle half mile, bid second turn, weakened in the drive. BIZZY LEGS off a step slow, raced back and off
the inside, three wide for the drive, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SEASIDE BOY void of speed, came five wide out of the
final turn, failed to rally. KING'S OVATION within striking distance while four wide first turn, three wide second bend, faded through the stretch.
NULLARBOR set the pace while a bit keen first turn, gave way when headed late second turn.
