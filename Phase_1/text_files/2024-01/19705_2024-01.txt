Footnotes
BET ON BOBBY rushed to set the pace inside of a pressing rival, inched closer of that bidder entering the lane and held sway while gradually drifting out.
JACK THE WHISTLE tracked along the inside, pursued just behind the leaders entering the lane, gained place inside of the clearing pace setter in upper
stretch, tipped outside of that one to take aim in the final furlong, but was fended off. A TRUE TARGET laid off of the pace in the two path, launched a rally
shifting four wide turning for home, but leaned inwardly and brushed a foe while bidding for minor placings entering the lane and leveled off. BOLIE pressed
outside of the leader, attempted a bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane and yielded between horses. INVOLVEDNTERACTION
lagged behind in the two path into the turn, swung to the seven path entering upper stretch and moved up. POETIC ROAD lacked speed in the five path and
failed to factor. RUN RICE RUN broke a bit inwardly then made little impact from the three path. BABY'S LAST DANCE broke outwardly, stalked three wide,
but was outkicked and brushed by an outer rival entering the lane, then faded.

Footnotes
PATIO'S PORCH rushed clear after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, set the pace in hand and a bit off the inside around the turn, then drew off under a drive
in upper stretch. CHAD'S FLASH bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, moved to offer mild pressure outside of the leader around the
turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and remained clear of show. LIL WOADIE laid off of the pace in the four path, gained show nearing the lane
then flattened out. CABOCHON TREASURE bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but failed to maintain forward position nearing
the half mile pole, chased while yielding entering the turn and lacked a bid thereafter. HARPES HILL was outrun in the four path. GOBOT saved ground
towards the rear and made little impact. MUCHO BUENO chased from the two path along with an outer rival into the turn, then faded turning for home.

CHANNEL WON saved ground off of the pace, launched a rally in upper stretch, tipped outside of the leading pair leaving upper stretch to bid at the furlong
grounds, led an as an outer rival gave chase in the final furlong and held sway. THINKABOUTIT tracked in the two to three path, floated four wide in upper
stretch, rallied to take aim on the new leader leaving the furlong grounds, but only managed to chase that one home. ALICIA'S KID stumbled at the start,
raced at the rear in the three path, shfited to the five path around the turn, then rallied to gain show nearing the final sixteenth. SILVER WINGS lacked
speed in the three path, then improved between horses in the final furlng. SMOKIN RICHIE rushed to vie three wide early on, dueled two wide around the
turn, but was outkicked by outer bidders at the furlong grounds and gave way. SATURDAY'S GOLD dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, then
only inside of an outer rival around the turn, but was bested by outer bidders at the furlong grounds and weakened. FIREINTHESTORM vied along the
inside foe a quarter mile, but chased into the turn and faded between horses. OUR FREDDIE MAC was urged along in midpack in the four path and
weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
LUKE popped open the gate pre-race, walked out of the front before being reloaded, brushed with an outer rival while off half a beat slow at the start,
tracked from the two path, split the leaders at the three sixteenths pole to lead into the final furlong as an outer HIGH ENOUGH took aim, dug in before
shifting out and brushing that bidder in the final sixteenth, yet narrowly held. HIGH ENOUGH bumped with an outer rival and brushed with an inner foe at the
start, pursued from midpack in the four to five path around the first turn, ranged up turning for home, bid outside of the new leader in the final furlong, but
was brushed by that one in the final sixteenth and missed. PERFORMANCE PLUS broke through the gate pre-race, then broke a touch outwardly at the
start, chased in the three to four path and between horses, lacked a response to urging turning for home, yet sustained stride thereafter and improved
position. ALVIN set the pace in the two path as an outer foe applied pressure, but gave way to an outer pair of bidders nearing the furlong grounds. EL
KECZAL was bumped by an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three to two path and failed to factor. SATURDAY STARTER broke slowly, advanced in the
five path and outside of rivals into the first turn, pressed the leader from the four to three path leaving that bend, attempted to offer a bid turning for home but
faded between horses in midstretch. A RIDER'S OBJECTION AS WELL AS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY REVIEWING THE LATE STAGES RESULTED IN NO
CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA tracked in the three to four path, took closer order to stalk into the far turn, bid turning for home, led entering the lane and drew
off in upper stretch. BLUE VORTEX tracked in the three path and between horses, then ran on to claim place entering the final sixteenth. A LIL
PSYCHOTIC pressed two wide, vied into the far turn, led very briefly before being headed by a outer bidder passing the five sixteenth pole, gave way to that
one in upper stretch, then lasted for show. ENGLISH LUNA lacked speed along the inside, shifted out entering upper stretch and improved between horses.
SIGNING was carried wide by an inner rival entering the first turn before settling well back in the three path, saved ground around the far turn and failed to
menace. STILL TEMPER stalked along the inside, but faded behind a faltering foe turning for home. JOCELYN laid off of the pace in the two to four paths,
drifted to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. NOT TONIGHT JOE set the pace along the inside, but weakened to a pair of outer rivals
turning for home. BAD BETTY broke a beat slow, bore out into the first turn and showed little.

Footnotes
COACHES MEETING chased between horses early on, failed to sustain midpack position at the half mile pole, settled further off two wide around the turn,
fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied to drive past the leaders inside the final sixteenth and drew clear. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN set the pace inside of
a pressing foe, shook free of that one entering the lane, fended off an outer pursuer through midstretch but was bested by a wider bidder in the final
sixteenth. AMANWALKSINTOABAR stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the newly clear leader in upper stretch, yet was kept at bay by that one
and got outkicked for place passing the sixteenth pole. CAFE RACER pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped three wide and between horses in
midstretch and ran on willingly. HOGSLAYERS R I P tracked two wide, tipped four wide entering the lane but lacked a bid. AUTO DIAL broke outwardly and
failed to factor from the three path. MO SATURDAYS steadied behind a faltering rival at the half mile pole, laid well back along the inside and made little
impact. PRINCE COSMO prompted two wide, but yielded to his inner counterpart entering the lane in the three path and weakened between horses. EL
PAJARO LOCO showed little.

Footnotes
FIRST LOVE set the pace inside of a vying rival, drew away from that one nearing the lane and held sway under a drive. MRS. SPEAKER tracked in the
three path, gained place in the four path at the three sixteenths pole and held from an inner bidder. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL lacked speed in the three to
two path, shifted back three wide entering the lane, then stayed on to bid for place along the inside passing the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay.
FREEFORM laid off of the pace in the four to five path, ran on in hopes of bidding for place in the final furlong but leveled off. MARMO MOON lacked speed
two wide and between horses, but steadied and faltered among foes into the turn, trailed turning for home, then surpassed tired rivals. GRAY PEARL lacked
speed along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane but made little impact. GOTTAGONOWNOW chased along the inside and faded. GOLD PLUS
vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but yielded nearing the lane and weakened.

HIGH TIDE settled off of the pace in the three to four path, tipped from the three path to the five path entering the lane, rallied to bid in the final furlong and
drove past the leaders passing the sixteenth pole. FIREWATER JAKE pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room nearing the lane, tipped
two wide straightening for home, rallied to bid inside of the leaders passing the furlong grounds but needed more late. BIG DREAMING tracked three wide,
bid turning for home, vied between horses leaving upper stretch, but was outkicked in the final furlong and missed place. SOUL COAXING pursued from
midpack in the two path, stalked behind the leaders around the far turn, encountered traffic in the four path in upper stretch, tipped in to take aim inside of
the leaders along with an inner rival nearing midstretch, but lacked a punch between horses. BIZZEE CHANNEL stalked two wide, bid around the far turn,
led as an outer rival challenged nearing the lane, sparred through midstretch, but yielded among foes at the sixteenth pole. TIDE OF THE SEA set the pace
along the inside, but was headed by an outer pair turning for home and weakened. VITALE was outrun. FLY NIGHTLY showed little.

Footnotes
CRUSADER EXPRESS vied along the inside, led around the turn, cleared in upper stretch and held sway. SMOOTH COLLIERY broke a step slow while
last away, lacked speed in the two to three path, fanned out to the five path entering the lane, rallied on his left lead to gain place entering the final sixteenth
and closed in on the leader. MUCHO MARVIN tracked in the four path gained place in upper stretch, lost place to an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and
lasted for show. NORTHERNREFLECTION laid well back in the three to four path and stayed on belatedly. BIG SCULLY vied two wide and between
horses, chased his inner counterpart around the turn and faded. GREELEY WENT WEST broke a step slow, saved ground off of the pace, steadied behind
traffic nearing the furlong grounds and failed to factor. J B GRAY trailed along the inside and never got involved. BIBLEMAN prompted three wide but
weakened between horses in upper stretch.
