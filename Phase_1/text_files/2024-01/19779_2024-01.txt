DESTINANO stalked the pace three wide and made a two wide bid to latch on to MO MOSCATO at the the quarter pole, then had a long drive with that rival
and slowly edged clear late to prove best under crop urging. MO MOSCATO set the pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole, dug in gamely
but was out-kicked late in a game try, clearly second best. SHELTRFROMTHESTORM tracked the pace from the outside early, three wide on the turn and
weakened in the drive, held show award. BRIGHT PATH was off slowly, two wide on the turn and had no rally. SUPER ROCKY was well placed on the
inside on the turn and then was empty in the drive. RIGATONI ALA VODKA failed to respond.

SPEAK OF THE DEVIL set the early pace while clear, then was confronted leaving the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the drive and held on to prove best
under a drive. DORSODURO stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bud by the quarter pole, had a long drive with the winner but just missed
while in between rivals on the wire. BLUEBERRY MASH was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide off the turn and
closed well to just miss while needed more. SOUL STORY broke in the air and was off nearly ten lengths last, four wide into the first turn and had no rally.
LAWLESSNESS was reserved early and failed to respond.

DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN was well rated early, made a three wide move on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then kicked clear leaving the turn
and was kept to right handed crop urging to prove best. EAGLES CRY prompted the early pace two wide, then swung out four wide leaving the turn for aim
but could not gain on the winner while finishing willingly. BEST DEFENSE set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the five sixteenths and gave
way in the drive.

Footnotes
TILTED TIARA was soon clear to set the pace on the inside, drew off leaving the turn and widened the margin while being ridden out to the wire. MELODIA
was allowed to settle early, inside on the turn and swung wide leaving the turn and rallied well to gain the place award. CRICKET WEST tracked the pace
three wide and faded in the drive, lost place award late. DAILY BRIEFING was well placed early, saved ground on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
THAT'S MY BUSINESS was away alertly to cross over to the inside on the first turn and vie for the early lead, then deferred and sat behind the pace, shifted
off the inside entering the far turn and was three wide stalking, then made a bid nearing the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best under a drive.
TEMPESTUOUS was settled back on the inside, advanced on the far turn and was two wide by the quarter pole, angled in by the furlong marker and
finished well. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was five wide into the first turn, settled on the outside, four wide on the far turn and came five wide off the turn and
rallied. THE GREAT CASBY was bumped at the start, reserved early, four wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally. SOUPER ROYAL MOON vied
for the early lead two wide, then went on to set the pace while remaining in the two path, then still led off the turn but weakened in the final furlong. LAKE
NAKURU was reserved early and raced wide on the backstretch and had no rally. CHARGING LION was four wide into the first turn, settled between rivals,
then was on the inside by the quarter pole and came up empty. HELLMAN was settled early on the inside and tired. HROTHGAR tracked the pace three
wide and tired.
