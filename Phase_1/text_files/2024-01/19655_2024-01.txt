Footnotes
AGARRAMESIPUEDES lacked speed, raced along the inner rail the first turn and down the backstretch, swung four wide leaving the far turn, closed nicely
outside horses and swept to the lead approaching the finish. INSPIRED IRISH hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace, gained the lead in upper stretch
and drifted out late when tiring. BILL OF RIGHTS set the pace in the two path, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. MASTER OF NONE , three
wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, chased the pace to the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER settled off the dueling leaders and off the inside, came under a ride leaving the far turn, moved up past the quarter pole, swung out to
about the five path soon into the lane, closed under right handed asks, forged to command outside DOLICE VITA leaving the sixteenth marker and edged
away late. DOLICE VITA rated behind the embattled leaders, angled out departing the far turn, moved up four wide outside the duelers entering the stretch,
took a slim lead under left handed urging in mid stretch, could fend off the winner's charge but kept on gamely to the wire. EXIT RIGHT moved up to the
outside of OVERLY CRITICAL near the seven eighths pole and joined that one for the lead, carried a battle through the backstretch and final turn, held a
short lead entering the stretch, fought on between runners past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. OVERLY CRITICAL was sent to the early
lead inside of rivals, was met from his outside by EXIT RIGHT after a quarter mile, sparred for command to mid stretch, kept on past the sixteenth marker
then faded late. JARDANI , well off the leaders, saved ground with an advance into the stretch, chased past mid stretch then flattened out. HUNTER JOE ,
well placed in the clear and in range of the leaders, came under pressure leaving the far turn, failed to kick on and faltered through the drive.

SUN STREAMING lacked speed along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, swept to the lead under brisk urging approaching
the sixteenth pole and drew away. SHARMIN brushed with NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep while attempting to
get out, drifted five wide leaving the turn, drifted out further in upper stretch and drifted in approaching the finish. OUTFACTORED , four wide leaving the
backstretch, circled the turn three wide, chased the pace to mid stretch and gave way. LEAVE DRAMA BEHIND showed speed along the inner rail and
weakened late. MARTHA'S HEART saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and flattened out. NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE brushed
with SHARMIN leaving the starting gate, was no factor and raced three wide on the turn. IT STARTS NOW in the three path between horses leaving the
backstretch, chased the pace to mid turn and faltered.

TOP BOSS showed speed then inherited a clear lead nearing the half mile marker, dropped in and set the pace, kept on under strong handling through the
final furlong and held firm. NOTTOWAY drafted back after an alert start then chased off the inside, advanced three wide nearing the lane, shifted out a bit
wider with hard pursuit past the three sixteenths, continued on with effort and earned the place in the final yards. HIS NAME IS SUE edged up three wide
early on, gave hard chase outside a rival past the five sixteenths, raced between foes nearing the lane then gave way grudgingly through the final sixteenth.
WILD BEHAVIOR moved up early and chased the winner, raced inside rivals into the lane, failed to kick on near mid stretch and gave way. GRAND
MANNER came off the rail leaving the five eighths to avoid a rival, raced between runners into the turn, came four wide for the drive, angled in and failed to
threaten. MONTAUK DADDY drifted out at the break, raced off the pace while removed from the rail, circled four to five wide into the stretch but failed to
respond. SUPER QUALITY rushed up to the early lead, lost his action leaving the five eighths, was rated back to last leaving the far turn, dropped further
back in upper stretch, was eased to the wire, pulled up soon past the finish when injured then was vanned off.

was guided off the rail and kept on under a drive past the furlong grounds, failed to contain the winner's rail surged but continued on with effort to be well
clear of the rest. HURRYING HOME , four deep with the early pace, dropped in a couple of paths nearing the turn and pressed outside the leader, was
under a solid ride attempting to stay in touch into the stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch and kept on with interest while preserving the show. HOLEY

the lane, shifted out four wide with aim past the quarter pole, switched over to his left lead past mid stretch and hung. BAND CAMP , off the pace and off the
inside, circled five wide into the stretch but failed to drum up a serious run. THE LAST JUMPSTART , brushed at the break, chased in mid pack, came four
wide for the drive and faded. IMSTILLHERE drifted in at the break bumping a rival, forced the early pace two wide between rivals, chased while towards the
inside around the turn then tired in upper stretch. CORRECTED PEDIGREE chased the pace, edged up off the rail into the turn, failed to kick on in upper

Footnotes
THUNDER BUGGY hugged the inner rail, opened up on the turn and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. IRISH LACE lacked speed, raced in the three
path between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied mildly outside foes. THEA'S THEME saved ground on the turn, chased
the winner and faded. REDWHITEANDTACOS lacked speed, was along the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired foes. INSTINCTIVE saved ground on
the turn, eased out for the drive and failed to rally. SWEET TALIA worked between horses on the turn and was no factor. MATOULA prompted the pace
outside the winner and gave way. RATIONALMILLENNIAL had a wide trip on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TAKE A HINT , nudged to the front, set a rated pace towards the rail, edged clear around the turn, responded and kicked away past the three sixteenths,
continued on while under strong handling inside the furlong grounds and proved resolute to the wire. FREEZE THE FIRE forced the early pace outside the
winner, gave hard chase two wide past the five sixteenths, shifted towards the rail for the stretch run and came back gamely to the inside of
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE to earn the place. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE edged up between rivals into the turn, advanced three wide to take aim nearing the lane,
pursued outside FREEZE THE FIRE inside the furlong grounds then came up empty through the final yards. HEMP settled well back early on while saving
ground, continued inside into the lane and gathered some momentum past the three sixteenths, shifted out for the final furlong and finished well. BOSS
MAN J J chased while saving some ground, briefly lost action leaving the three eighths, recovered past the five sixteenths, swung out for the drive but
lacked a serious finish. BY ITS ABSENCE broke a bit slow, raced off the pace, came three wide for the drive but failed to respond. NOAH CHANCE , three
wide, made a mild run nearing the lane then gave way through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SAVOY , rated back soon after the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn, remained along the rail until altering course to the two path near the sixteenth
pole, closed between horses and was up late. CLAW saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch, gained the lead approaching
the sixteenth pole and continued willingly. GRAND ESCAPE set the pace along the inner rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened in
the drive. UNLEVERAGED raced along the inner rail on the turn, angled out for the drive, worked between horses, steadied in traffic near the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly. MICE AND MEN stalked the pace three deep around the turn, loomed five wide in upper stretch then came up empty. BUFFALO
SHUFFLE prompted the pace outside GRAND ESCAPE, was floated out in upper stretch and faltered. NOTION TO TAPIT , never a factor, swung four wide
leaving the turn.
