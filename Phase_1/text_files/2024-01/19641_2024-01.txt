Footnotes
RETURN THE RING was hustled to the front, set the pace under some pressure, controlled the action while along the rail on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths then roused for more coming to the quarter-pole, responded well under the crop in upper stretch, remained under the crop until outside the
sixteenth-pole then was flagged with the crop under steady urging to the finish. HE'S GOT IT climbed while dropping back early then was urged along well
off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came three wide at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and finished with late energy to garner the place.
PRESIDENT Z tracked the pace on the outside, chased four then three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner while
remaining on his inside lead until near the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and weakened but was clear for the show. NECROMANCER
settled on the outside, moved in near the five-eighths pole, was roused two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. STREET SWAGG
reared outward at the start and was off slow then checked, spotted the front around five lengths, moved out at the rear then was urged along on the
outside,went five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ELITE FORCES broke out at the start, pressed the pace down the backstretch, chased three then
two wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
WHISTLER'S STYLE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, seized command just outside that
station and spun three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. HALO CITY chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to secure the place honors. RUN DEVIL vied briefly between foes before chasing three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. FREUDIAN chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. TIMED OUT chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. VEGAS WEEKEND vied briefly outside a
pair of rivals before chasing four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the
drive. JACKIE THE JOKER vied briefly inside a pair before establishing sole command to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn
and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, when coming under pressure, succumbed on the front just outside the quarter pole and took the inside route
into upper stretch, then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BEARY FUNNY stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path outside the three-eighths pole, took the lead at the quarter-pole, fought outside
the runner-up in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. WAFLR was away alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole, fought on with
that foe in the stretch but missed while clear for the place. MUNNY FOR NUTHIN tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on
the turn, chased the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DOLLY'S BANK broke a step slow then was taken up while
having his path taken, settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ESCAPE
KEY was well placed down the backstretch, passed the half-mile pole under urging, chased while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, pursued
the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. NOBILIS settled under some urging, went two then three wide on the turn, came seven wide
into the stretch and was no factor. LOOKIN' TO WIN came outward at the start then was corrected by the rider, settled off the pace, was asked leaving the
backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

SITTIN ON GO raced three then two wide into the first turn taking over command, showed the way under a rating hold just off the inside under some
pressure from OPTIC WAY to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail.
OPTIC WAY coaxed from the gate, led briefly early on, raced along the inside through the first turn before prompting the leader from the outside three then
two wide while widening away as a pair from the rest of the field down the backstretch and through the far turn, swung three to four wide for home, got
shaken off proving no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. PORTOS raced three wide through the first turn, chased four
wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position
to secure the show honors. HIGHER QUALITY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four wide into upper stretch,
weakened. BOLD VICTORY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch and tired. HANG TIGHT chased along the inside through the first turn before taking to the five path down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. LIFE AND LIGHT along the inside
through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing half a mile out, angled four to five wide at the head of the stretch, faltered, and was eased

Footnotes
BUSTIN SHOUT settled off the pace, drafted four wide while pocketed behind horses on the turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole until inside the
three-sixteenths, altered out while roused outside the furlong marker, rallied outside to get the lead before the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong
urging. BIG ENGINE brushed with a rival at the start, moved out leaving the chute, was taken up briefly near the five-eighths pole, dropped in late on the
backstretch, moved closer while saving ground on the turn, came off the rail while in hand behind foes into upper stretch, found room and got through
between horses near the three-sixteenths, chased into the final sixteenth and finished willingly to just get the place. MARKET ALERT was hustled from the
gate, established a good position while rated just off the pace, drafted behind horses while two to three wide on the turn, waited while blocked from the
quarter-pole until outside the furlong marker, was roused at that point then followed BIG ENGINE into the final furlong and finished with good energy to just
miss the place. FULL MOON FEVER was last to commence, settled on the far outside, was roused five wide on the turn, rallied outside to get the lead in
upper stretch, led under a drive until inside the furlong marker then was overtaken and tired late. QUICKFLASH tracked the pace on the outside, chased
four wide on the turn, made a bid near the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. BAR FOURTEEN disputed the pace
between horses, vied in the two path under urging while still between rivals on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. PRINCE OF JOY
contested the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path while asked on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and also capitulated. NO
SALT was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came out six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. TOMMY GUN brushed with
a foe at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of two opponents, vied inside under urging on the turn and faded.

under a hand-ride to the finish. FONTANAFREDDA bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up in tight quarters, moved out then settled
on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and
narrowly earned the place. MISSING FORTUNE came away a touch awkwardly while breaking in front then was bumped in the hindquarters, stalked the
pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn, chased three wide into the stretch, pursued the the winner in the drive and just missed the
place. IM JUST KIDDIN broke out and bumped with a foe then was corrected by the rider, settled just off the pace, was asked while moving from the rail to
