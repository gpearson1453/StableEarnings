Footnotes
EXPERIMENTAL moved up to get lead after going a sixteenth of a mile, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was
asked inside the five-sixteenths, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up near the furlong marker,
dueled with that foe into the final sixteenth then moved clear under strong urging. PIN UP BETTY was urged early then rated just off the pace, drafted inside
on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, got through along the rail in upper stretch, made a bid near the furlong marker, battled with the winner into the
final sixteenth then was turned away and outfinished while clear for the place. JUST MUSIC settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, went
around the turn in the two path, was given her cue while between foes at the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the
drive and lacked the needed kick. KATHYNMARISSA settled on the outside, moved up to stalk the pace with five furlongs to run, was asked in the three
path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and tired. WEATHER DELAY angled out then settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn then
dropped back and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over
command with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive to prevail. SWEET AS SUGAR established the front shortly after the start and showed
the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, got collared at the three-sixteenths and ran on to secure the place honors. SLACK TIDE chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HYDRA chased four paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and tired. EVERLYS GIRL lunged at the start getting away last and conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five
to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RUN FOR YOUR HONEY bobbled at the break, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before advancing tucked to the two path into the turn
to vie among a quartet and then a trio under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, traded a bump with UNICORN CAKE
at the three-sixteenths, dug in taking command near the sixteenth marker and then just held on over a rival on the wire. BARONESS BOURBON four then
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and
just missed at the end. UNICORN CAKE coaxed from the gate, dueled six paths off the inside down the backstretch with SUN AND WIND to her inside, got
confronted by an additional pair and shook off her early pace rival now flanked by foes, swung four wide into upper stretch, traded two bumps with RUN
FOR YOUR HONEY at the three-sixteenths, clung to command until yielding near the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages while along for the
show honors. SCARLET'S DREAM seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn advancing to vie for command when
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BORNFORGREATNESS chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened. SUN AND WIND dueled three to four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked inside into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off inside the three-eighths, went three
wide into upper stretch and tired. TOMAKI hustled from the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tipping out three to four wide
through the turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

DOC SULLIVAN broke in at the start, settled off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, shifted from the two path to the four path before the
three-eighths pole, gained to take the lead near the quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. BRICK AMBUSH
broke in and bumped with a foe, contested the pace, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch and proved on
match for the winner while clear for the place. BROWN DON'T STOP was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide for most of the turn, brushed with
a foe near the three-eighths pole, shifted four wide late on the bend and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. LOTSA TROUBLE was urged
along off the pace, went three to four wide for most of the turn, brushed with an opponent near the three-eighths pole, moved to five wide late on the bend
and failed to respond. KING FREUD was bumped at the start, pressed the pace on the inside of a duo, dropped just off the pace with five furlongs to run,
chased inside to the two path on the turn and capitulated. SLAMMIN GOLD contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while asked on the turn
and faded. TAPORICAL dropped well behind under urging, angled in early on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and was
eased but walked off.

five-sixteenths to run, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BIG HAZEL
forced DASHING DELLA to steady off her heels when tucked out of the gate to the four path five and a half furlongs from home, tucked once more to chase
just off the inside and then along the inside into the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick. DEVILLY stumbled at the start, chased three then two wide advancing to offer a bid at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper

asked near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, shook off a foe near the three-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead in the drive and just
held under strong urging. LADY MINE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled to the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was
asked while four then five wide on the turn, chased the winner into the furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place.
GONE AND FORGOTTEN moved in while urged along at the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, came three wide into the
stretch and finished willingly for the show. MISSING FORTUNE broke a step slow, settled on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid
near the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch and was outfinished. MIDTOWN LIGHTS was coaxed along on the inside of a foe, went
around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed kick. QUEENS MASTERPIECE moved in
while settling off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the two path to the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
I LOVE CARA got steadied at the start when losing her lane after breaking a beat slow and conceded six to seven lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home before tipping to the two path midway and then
three to four wide at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to steadily gain whittling away at the top pair through the final furlong and
was up in the late stages to score. NO SURRENDER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch
under pressure from LITTLE SKIPPY and at times engaged in a duel with that rival, tucked to be just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive leg weary through the final furlong and was caught in the late going.
LITTLE SKIPPY broke out at the start taking over the lane vacated by I LOVE CARA and forced that foe to steady in behind her, prompted the pace of the
aforementioned foe from the inside two to three wide at times advancing to knock heads before backing away, had the opportunity to tip outside her main
pace foe at the seven-sixteenths when briefly shaken off and did so taking to the three path before coming once more to press the issue, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shaken off for the final time a furlong out and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. BELLE
OF THE BALL chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last
major share. A LISTER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened.
NOBILIS six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung seven wide
for home and tired. GROWTH MINDSET coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven to
eight wide into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.
