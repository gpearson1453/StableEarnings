Footnotes
AZTEC EMPRESS vied along the inside, gained an advantage at the quarter pole, drove clear in upper stretch and held from an outer late challenger.
GREYHOUND STATION tracked in the two path, chased the clearing leader while gaining place in upper stretch, closed in on that one in the final sixteenth
to offer a late bid but missed. MISS PEARL HART set a pressured pace in the three path, got headed by an inner vying rival entering the lane and gave
way. PINK LADY LU SHA stalked forwardly in the four path, but lacked a bid and faded. DOOBLAY trailed along the inside and never got involved. BIKINI
BOTTOM lacked speed two wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
MARY JACK set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin nearing the far turn and lasted under a drive. CAVE CREEK bobbled a step leaving the
gates, laid off of the pace in the two path, got shuffled back behind a faltering foe with five sixteenths to go, shifted to the three path to rally between horses
nearing the lane and sustained progress to gain place from an outer foe late. FADED MEMORIES tracked four wide, then between horses down the
backstretch, rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds but was caught by an inner rival late. QUINN MURPHY broke a step slow and bumped with an inner
rival at the start, trailed in the three to four paths before swinging to the six path entering upper stretch, and ran on willingly. FROSTY FLIRT leaned inwardly
at the start, tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. ROYA broke in the air and was off slowly, laid off of the pace in the four to five
path and failed to menace. BROADWAY PEARL stalked three wide and between horses, gained place into the far turn, chased as the clear leader's main
pursuer around that bend, but lacked a bid and tired between horses in midstretch. ANGEL OF VERDUN pressed two wide, but faltered between horses
around the far turn. FAT AND FURIOUS bumped an outer rival while off a step slow, pursued from midpack in the three to five path, tracked approaching
the far turn, but bore to the seven path around that bend, weakened and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MUCHO MACHO GIRL prompted along the inside, stalked the outer pace setter entering the turn, took aim outside of them turning for home, bid in hand
entering the lane and drew off under moderate urging. ROSE PALACE broke a bit outwardly and was off slow, raced at the rear along the inside, rallied to
split foes two wide at the furlong grounds and was gaining on the clear leader late. LURE'EM IN laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped three wide
entering the lane, ran on evenly while getting outkicked for place by an inner foe in the final furlong and edged show late. VIOLA set the pace two wide,
cleared an inner prompter into the turn, but offered little resistance to that one's outside re-bid in upper stretch and weakened. SALLY'S SUPRISE bumped
with an outer rival at the start and failed to factor two wide. FIT AND FAMOUS bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path and
weakened.

Footnotes
CITY OF LOVE tracked in the four path, chased GOT ME A CHRYSLER's bid to gain place at the furlong grounds, then sustained late progress to real that
one in at the wire via a dead-heat. GOT ME A CHRYSLER stalked in the three path, bid before forging an advantage leaving the three sixteenths pole, dug
in to resist an outer foe's late challenge and held via a dead-heat. BATTALION STRIKE chased along the inside, chased the top trio in upper stretch and
kept on to edge show from a tiring rival late. AZTEC GEM set a clear pace in the two path, got headed passing the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
PURRRFECT RHYTHM lunged outwardly and broke slow, lagged behind into and around the turn, then improved inside of rivals in upper stretch.
CONTRABAND EARLY broke a step slow and made little impact from the four path. BIG TAP BABY broke a step slow and a bit awkwardly, lacked speed in
the three path and tired. MEASURE OF FAITH laid off of the pace in the three path and weakened.

Footnotes
IM SINGLED UP broke out and sternly bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, ranged up in the three to four path turning for home to bid
outside of the leader in upper stretch and kicked away. CAPELLA RED leaned out and brushed an outer foe at the start, raced towards the rear three wide,
shifted out to the five path at the five sixteenths pole and rallied to gain place entering the final sixteenth. TRES CHIC (ARG) transferred contact from an
inner rival to an outer foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace and ran on to gain show between horses late. KAZILLION pursued from the three to four
path around the first turn then chased between horses through the lane. IMPERATOR FURIOSA bobbled and took light contact from an inner foe at the
start, set the pace, felt pressure from an outer pair with five furlongs to go, inched clear turning for home, but offered little resistance to a challenge in upper
stretch and faded. TRIBEST (ARG) took firm contact from an inner rival and was forced to bump an outer foe at the start, tracked shifting two to three wide
around the first turn, advanced to press with five furlongs to go, sustained pressure outside of the leader into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths
pole. GATHER THE FACTS raced towards the rear two wide and between horses, trailed approaching the far turn and was outrun. PARISIAN SPIRIT was
bumped by an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide, pressed between horses down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn, wilted around that
bend and was eased through the lane.

BRON AND BROW tracked in the three path before tucking to the inside into the turn, shouldered an outer rival to shift outside of the top pair at the three
sixteenths pole, rallied to bid entering the final sixteenth and drove clear. MIKE J dueled for the lead with an outer rival, inched clear of that one at the
furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, but was bested by an outer bidder with a sixteenth to go. MANGUM settled off of the pace along the inside,
shifted out to the five path entering the lane, ran on willingly and moved up late. NOT ON HERB dueled for the lead two wide but yielded in midstretch.
AUTUMNS STRONG MAN stalked in the three path, but was brushed to the four path while getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch and gave
way. LANGS DAY broke a step slow, trailed in the two path, swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WONDER OF YOU pressed outside of the leader, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, drove clear and held sway. LA LA ROSE tracked along
the inside, pursued in hand behind rivals around the turn, tipped three wide and between horses for clear sailing in upper stretch, and rallied to be second
best. SYBARITE set the pace inside of a pressing foe, got headed by that one passing the three sixteenths pole, gave way yet held show. MATCHING
ENERGY stalked the top pair from the two path, but only managed to chase through the lane. BEAUTIFUL MISCHIEF laid off of the pace in the two path,
shifted to the five path entering the lane and ran on but failed to menace. RENFREW broke outwardly, pursued from midpack in the three path, but faded in
the four path and between horses in upper stretch. OH MACARENA trailed in the three path into the turn and was outrun.

OVA CHARGED set the pace in the four to three path and outside of a rival into the turn, cleared turning for home and drew off under vigorous hand urging.
BELEOUT vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, yielded to that one with five sixteenths to go, met an outer bid for place entering the lane, yet
repelled that challenge entering the final furlong. FREE LIKE A GIRL stalked in the four path, bid for place entering the lane, but was turned away passing
the furlong grounds and held show. SPIRITED BEAUTY broke slowly, trailed along the inside, then improved along the rail in upper stretch, but needed
more to gain show. KYLE BEAUTY chased along the inside, shifted out entering the lane but lacked a bid. NONEYA laid off of the pace in the three path
and between horses, then faded. LAKE MARIE pursued from the five to six path and tired.

OEUVRE stalked from the four path, took aim in upper stretch, sustained slow progress on the leader through midstretch, then edged past that one at the
sixteenth pole and drew clear under hand urging. SWEET TEMPERAMENT set the pace in the two path, maintained a margin from a pair of chasers
through upper stretch, shifted out while embracing OEUVRE's challenge entering the final furlong, got bested by that one with a sixteenth to go and held
place. CARIMBA pressed the leader from the three path and between horses into the turn, got outmoved by an outer counterpart while chasing in upper
stretch, kept on to attempt a bid for place inside of the early pace setter in the closing stages, but was kept at bay. GOIN' GOOD laid off of the pace along
the inside, trailed in the two path around the turn, then moved up between horses passing the furlong grounds. STELLA NOIR broke a step slow, laid off of
the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, then failed to factor. BRANDON'SMYLAWYER tracked along the inside and weakened. BREEZE
EASY (GB) brushed the outer part of the gate and broke slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, drifted to the five path entering the lane and faded.

ARCTIC ROSE stalked along the inside, vied around the far turn, led as a outer ZONG TOUGH battled in upper stretch and gamely clung to a margin to the
wire. ZONG TOUGH stalked two to three wide, bid turning for home, sparred with an inner rival but was denied. GALLANT STAR lacked speed along the
inside, advanced between horses shifting to the five path nearing the lane and sustained a rally. WISE GUY pursued from midpack two wide and between
horses and chased through the lane. GUITARTUITION PLZZ settled off of the pace in the three path, inched closer four to six wide and under a drive
