Footnotes
MEXICOFFEE set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, dug in while dueling with an outer foe in the three path passing the eighth
pole, and held on. KERN RIVER pressed in the four path, bid passing the three eighths, dueled with the inner pacesetter from the four path down the
stretch, briefly stuck his head in front passing the eighth pole, but was repelled late to place. GABAGOOL bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in
the three path, was roused passing the three-eighths, tipped out to the four path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. MACLIN raced wellback in
the two path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, angled to the rail passing the eighth pole, and stayed on. SIR GOOSA tracked in the five
path, was coaxed from the four path into the turn, tipped back out to the five path at the top of the lane, but was one paced. CORPORATE AFFAIR raced off
the pace in the three path, was ridden between foes into the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but was no factor. WILD FLIGHT trailed in the two
path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but did not threaten. BLUE SOLDIER was hustled from off the lead in the five path, floated out to the
seven path turning into the stretch, but never menaced. CONSTITUTIONALSONG bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased inside, but had to steady
going into the turn, and weakened along the inside in the stretch.

STRAND OF GOLD saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch, surged and was up in the final strides. MARY KATHERINE raced off the pace
along the rail, swung five wide in upper stretch, closed between foes and was narrowly outkicked. BELLESHAZZA stalked the pace two wide to upper
stretch, bid three wide in midstretch, dueled to deep stretch and just missed. CALMING SEA bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail, moved into the
two path turning for home, dueled between foes through most of the stretch and was outfinished. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM stalked the pace from the rail,
bid inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch and battled to the wire. NO WASABI FOR ME tracked the pace two and three wide, had aim through the lane
and was one-paced. KILKENNY BELLA broke awkwardly, raced two and three wide and never threatened. NEWTON'S STAR (IRE) was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. PIMENOVA was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
KING CURLIN bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path in the early stages, tipped to the rail while under a ride going into the final turn,
shifted out to the four path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to draw past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. HARRY HOOD bumped with an outer foe at
the start, then steadied along the inside into the first turn, stalked in the two path, bid between foes passing the three-eighths, was roused in the three path
at the top of the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole but was caught late by an outer foe to place. OCALA DREAM tracked in the three path, was
ridden in the two path into the final turn, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. ROCK THE STARS settled wellback in the
three path, was roused from the four path into the final turn, angled into the two path entering the stretch, but made no impact. SAMBURU (GB) set the pace
inside, was roused midway around the final turn, but faded in the stretch. JEOPARDY THEORY raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed from the
two path into the final turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but flattened. KING'S SECRET (GB) laid up close in the three path but backed up
around the final turn. MODERN LOVE was unhurried in the two path early but never menaced. THE FRACTIONAL TIMES FOR THIS RACE ARE

RESILIENCE tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, edged closer three wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch and powered clear
under a drive. SKIP THE LINE broke inwardly, raced off the pace two wide, checked near the quarter pole, continued on the left to deep stretch and rallied
between foes for the place. LIAM'S JOURNEY pressed the pace two wide while fighting restraint around the first turn, reached near even terms rounding the
far turn, could not keep pace with the winner turning for home, angled out in upper stretch and held third. THEMANUPFRONT set the pace along the rail
and gave way in upper stretch. DOMINGO raced in range three and four wide just outside of the winner and faded in the drive. STOP THE PRESS failed to
menace while racing three and four wide. MOONLIGHT ROAD was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. VINNY
AND LEO was pinched back at the start and trailed inside.

lead passing the eighth pole, but was outlasted by an outer pair to finish with show. CALIFORNIA FROLIC raced off the pace inside, waited for room around
the far turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and stayed on. BLUEBIRDS OVER stalked inside, was stymied along the rail rounding the far turn,
tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, but was one paced. HENLEY'S JOY trailed in the three path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the
stretch, but was no factor. SOUZAK (FR) set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside passing the quarter, but gaveway in the final furlong.

Footnotes
POWER SQUEEZE settled in range three wide, tipped four wide near the quarter pole, seized command in midstretch and drew off under left-handed
urging. QUEEN'S MARTINI was forced out at the start, raced in range four wide down the backstretch, bid three wide nearing the five-sixteenths marker,
vied to midstretch, was no match for the winner but kept on well to go clear of the rest. DONE ENOUGH set a pressured pace along the rail, led to
midstretch and held well enough to preserve the show. SWEET HAZELY veered out at the the start, pressed the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in
the lane and weakened. CHI CHI raced in range two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. DE REGRESO saved ground in range,
lacked a rally at the rail, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole, tipped out and dropped back.

FULMINATE set the pace in the two path, was roused while floating out to the four path turning into the lane, and dug in to hold sway. RUN FOR THE
HILLS raced up close in the two path, waited along the inside rounding the turn, was coaxed while tipping out to the five path in upper stretch, and ran on for
place. PLAY THE MUSIC bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the four path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, and rallied
between foes from the five path in the stretch for show. BEDTIME STORY tracked in the three path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch,
and finished evenly. FUTURE IS NOW broke out and bumped an outer foe, stalked in the three path, was roused midway around the turn, but evened out in
the six path down the stretch. OPENING BUZZ steadied along the inside early, raced in midpack along the inside but was one paced from the two path
down the lane. SHASTA STAR got pinched at the start, raced wellback in the two path, but was stuck in traffic inside of foes passing the quarter, angled
very wide into the lane, and couldn't make an impact. QUALY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the five path, was coaxed in the
four path around the turn, shifted out to the nine path in upper stretch, but was no factor. SOL HOPE broke in and bumped an inner foe, rated in the three
path, tipped inside turning into the stretch, but did threaten. DAVID'S ROSE was held up in the two path, cued midway around the turn, but weakened from
the three path down the lane. OH DARLIN trailed in the three path, went widest turning into the stretch, but never menaced. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE)
prompted the pace in the four path early but gaveway turning into the stretch.

OTELLO settled off the pace along the inside, waited for room from nearing the quarter pole to midstretch, angled three wide near the eighth pole, split rivals
soon after, kicked in and was up late. FIRST WORLD WAR raced in range three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, inched closer in upper stretch, took the
lead near the sixteenth pole but was unable to repel the winner in the later yards. SEA STREAK pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths marker, angled to the rail turning for home, vied inside to deep stretch and was outfinished. INVEIGLED raced in range two wide between
foes, waited for room nearing the quarter pole, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied outside. NO MORE TIME was rank and hopped at the start, trailed
down the backstretch, circled four wide around the turn to reach contention nearing the quarter pole then flattened out in the stretch. EVERDOIT set a
pressured pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker.
