Footnotes
HIGH SPEED prompted the pace two wide into the turn, took command, set the balance of the pace and proved best under strong handling. AWAY TO
RETURN never far back, was steadily gaining ground three wide in the fie path through the final stages. BACKSPLASH raced outside and found her best
stride late in the middle of the racetrack. COWGIRL KIMMIE settled seven wide down the backstretch, offered a mild bid in the six path through the turn and
into the stretch then was outfinished. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY failed to menace. SHELLEY'S GEM set a pressured pace inside the winner into the turn,
kept on past the furlong marker and weakened late. SWEET BELEN had brief speed. ALL ABOUT KATHERN was no factor.

Footnotes
THAT'S THE WAY allowed to settle, responded readily when set down three wide on the far turn, rallied to make the lead in upper stretch, was put to mild
left handed urging near the furlong marker and drew off. MONSTER HUNTER trailed into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the five path and finished well
clear for second. TIGER TRAIL stalked the early pace four wide, bid two wide midway on the far turn, battled until deep stretch then came up empty.
SERENDIPITOUS set the early pace two wide, kept pressure through the far turn and weakened in the stretch. JOSH'N pressed the early pace along the
inside, made the lead before a half, set a pressured pace into the stretch then gave way in the final stages. NAMBITI tracked the leaders three wide and
was through after a half.

KERANOS saved ground down the backstretch, angled out to the five path nearing the turn, was put to left handed urging near mid stretch, closed rapidly
five wide through deep stretch under an energetic hand ride and got up in the final strides. DUEL FUEL trailed into the stretch, swung wide, closed
determinedly outside rivals and just missed. RIKIO pressed the pace three wide for a half, made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was
outfinished. UNCLEJACKOMO went evenly. FLY HOME well placed, offered a mild bid four wide into the stretch then came up empty. COMPASS POINT
stumbled at the start and was no threat. ESTILO FAVORITO sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then
weakened in the final furlong. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ was no factor. HOUSEBUILDER pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half.

MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE trailed down the backstretch while racing outside, closed rapidly through the turn five wide, swung out to the seven path entering the
stretch, was put to right handed urging making the lead three wide near the furlong marker and edged clear in the final stages. REINSURE pressed the pace
along the inside for a half, inherited the lead when the leader drifted out at the top of the stretch then couldn't handle the winner. WIZARD WILLIE away
alertly, set the pace three then two wide for a half, drifted to the six path entering the stretch then was outfinished. WILE E PEYOTE failed to menace.
ALPINE GHOST pressed the pace two wide into the turn then weakened. LIGHTNING JACK bobbled outward at the start, rushed to contention five wide
before a quarter and was through early.

Footnotes
MOBIL MEMORY prompted the pace three then two wide into the stretch, responded under right handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker
and wore down rivals in a game effort CREME DE MAIS was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace until
mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner. DANZANITEAWAY broke inward bumping the runner up at the start, was never far back, loomed boldly four
wide into the stretch and finished with good courage. COMMISSIONER D never far back, finished determinedly in the two path. SWEET MOBILTEE went
evenly. VAMONOS PIACENTE sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, remained a sharp threat into the
stretch then weakened. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN was outrun. MY TWO JAKES offered a mild bid five wide on the turn then came up empty.
