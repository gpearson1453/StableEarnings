Footnotes
BACKCHAT settled around the first turn to race off the pace in the four path down the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, floated out to the
ten path turning into the lane, rallied down the center, and drew past an inner quartet before the sixteenth. TREASURE KING stalked in the three path, was
roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, bumped with an outer foe around the sixteenth, but stayed on for place. SHANKAR
chased in the three path, was floated out to the seven path while under a drive turning into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe around the sixteenth, and
kept on for show. RIBBONS AND MEDALS set the pace in the two path, was cued approaching the quarter, swung out to the four path turning into the
stretch, but faded in the final furlong. CAPTAIN ANTHONY tracked inside, was coaxed along the rail around the far turn, bid inside of foes from the two path
passing the eighth pole, but flattened. CABLE BOSS trailed in the two path and never menaced. ADMIRAL'S WAVE rated in the five path, was cued while
four wide going into the far turn, but came up empty.

Footnotes
NOTHING BUT PUMPS raced off the pace in the two path, was cued while behind and along the rail midway around the far turn, angled out to the eight
path turning into the stretch, and rallied outside of foes to be up in the closing stages. ANDIE ONE tracked in the three path, tipped inside and received a
right handed cue midway around the far turn, floated out to the four path at the top lane, angled back in to the two path, and ran on for place. A RING
THING set the pace in the three path, was coaxed in the two path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, stayed on
in upper stretch, but faded in the final sixteenth to show. MACASSA stalked in the two path, was roused approaching the quarter, bumped with an outer foe
while swinging out to the five path turning into the lane, and evened out. ITS A BIRDIE raced wellback in the four path, was roused into the far turn, got
bumped out to the six path turning into the stretch, and was one paced. DOWNTON TABBY was restrained around the first turn while racing in the four path,
ranged up to bid in the three path rounding the far turn, but weakened from the four path passing the eighth pole. GOLDCREST prompted the pace in the
four path but backed up between foes around the far turn.

Footnotes
CONCRETE GLORY set the pace in the two path, opened slightly under a nudge around the turn, was cued along the inside into the stretch, and continued
to draw clear while being kept to task. PROVERB rated in the five path, was cued in the four path passing the three-eighths, tipped into the two path at the
top of the stretch, and chased on for place. ENSIGN PARKER broke out at the start, tracked inside, was roused passing the three-eighths, swung from the
five path into the stretch, and was one paced for show. ROD TWO ROD bumped between foes at the start, trailed in the four path, was coaxed along in the
three path around the turn, angled out to the eight path turning into the lane, but made no impact. LIKE A SALTSHAKER prompted the pace in the four path,
floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and faded. SARAWAT bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path, but did not threaten
in the five path down the stretch. IMPACTO bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path but weakened turning into the stretch.
