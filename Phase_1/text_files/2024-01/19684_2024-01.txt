Footnotes
MAMBA OUT prompted the issue up front in the three path, ranged up and took over turning for home, edged clear under steady handling then held the
runner up safe late. PENZIG back off the pace inside, shifted out for room when straightened for home, finished willingly late to be closing the gap on the
winner, clear for the place. ACCELERATING BABE broke alertly from along the inside, set the pace while continuing to save ground, responded when
confronted entering the stretch, proved stubborn until late. DRAMEDY'S BLUR one paced three wide, roused for the drive, lacked a serious closing
response. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN off a step slow, raced back for a half, angled four wide into the stretch, displayed a mild amount of late interest outside
to improve position a bit. DIFFERENTLY in the first flight while racing four wide, tired in the drive. KAT'N CHROME remained back in failing to menace.
TRUE EMOTION pressured the leader from between horses, faltered. BODI ODI broke well, fell back, backed up even further through the lane to be well
beaten.
