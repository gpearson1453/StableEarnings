Footnotes
DENNISON GIRLS hugged the inner rail on the turn, found room inside SUNNY SUNSHINE to take command approaching the stretch, opened up in mid
stretch, drifted out late and prevailed under steady handling. SUNNY SUNSHINE sprinted clear early, was kept in the two path setting the early pace,
dropped back a bit in upper stretch then rallied late. THREE'S A CROWD lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tired horses. MY
CATHOLIC GIRL , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and weakened. DAZZLING DEMELZA , four deep
leaving the backstretch, moved to the three path mid way on the turn and gave way after a half mile. NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE bumped with LEAVE
DRAMA BEHIND at the start, was outrun and hugged the inner rail on the turn. LEAVE DRAMA BEHIND , rank at the break, bumped with
NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while three wide, drifted very wide leaving the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PORCH SWING , between rivals early, shifted in towards the rail leaving the five sixteenths, forged through to the inside of rivals leaving mid stretch, took
over heading to the sixteenth pole, kicked away under a drive and was taken in hand for the final strides. THE GREAT GAZOO saved ground off the early
pace, picked up momentum towards the rail mid turn, swung out entering the stretch, straightened away in about the seven path and kept on willingly to nab
the place in the final yards. CASINO TRICKS bobbled at the break, regrouped and rushed up outside rivals past the five eighths, stalked the leader three
wide around the turn, closed in four wide entering the stretch, spurted clear on his left lead then faded through the final seventy yards. BORUFF lacked
speed off the rail, was ridden along past the three eighths, removed well removed from the inside for the drive and had belated action. LANDON JACK sped
clear early, set the pace two wide, was collared while three wide entering the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. PRINS FIRE , a bit fidgety in
the gate just prior to the gates being sprung, broke in the air to be away last, lagged back and failed to menace. OBOY , four wide nearing the half, failed to
respond past the five sixteenths and faded. DREAMS DELIVERED , along the rail early on giving chase, moved to the two path leaving the far turn, lacked a
punch in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NAMI , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was under brisk urging in the drive and drew off. GOLDEN CHARM , three wide leaving the
backstretch, prompted the pace outside the winner, was no match for that one and bested the others. FINALJUMP broke slowly, hugged the inner rail
around the turn and weakened through the stretch. MARLEY'S GHOST , four wide entering the turn, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and faded.
LITTLE BABY GIRL , in the two path chasing the pace on the turn, retreated through the stretch. PEACHESSWEETNOTION prompted the early pace
outside the winner, failed to keep up on the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. DIANE , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn.
DAYLIGHT QUEEN trailed.

Footnotes
FOOLISH GHOST rated back off foe early then was deftly maneuvered towards the inner rail, edged up under coaxing and tracked a three horse scrum
past the five sixteenths, took advantage of a clear inside path in upper stretch, moved through to challenge inside the dueling leaders in mid stretch, wrested
command near the sixteenth marker, drifted out a bit while dueling and grimly prevailed. PRIVET MOON , with the pace four deep heading to the turn,
dueled three deep mid turn, battled on while fanned out to about the five path in upper stretch, took the lead heading to mid stretch, battled valiantly outside
the winner through the final seventy yards and just missed. KADRI was sent up inside to contest the pace with three foes to his outside, sparred inside a
pair of runners mid turn, was guided off the inside and to about the three path in upper stretch, straightened away, fought on between runners leaving mid
stretch then faded late. PERFECT DAY was sent up between foes early and vied, dueled between runners mid turn, failed to kick on with the leading trio in
mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. LUV YA BYE BYE , three wide between rivals early, failed to keep up leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
STRONG FINISH made the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up when set down turning for home, drifted out near the eighth pole and
was kept to his business in the drive. HE'S ON FIRE , a forward factor along the inner rail, moved up nicely leaving the far turn, was no match for the winner
and held the place. GAMBLING TZAR , alertly taken to the inner rail after a slow start, saved ground on both turns, swung to the four path in upper stretch
and flattened out. LONG LIVE NOW , in the three path the first turn, advanced along the inner rail on the far turn and failed to menace. MAJOR CAM , three
wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. EL DE CHIMI , four wide both turns, was not a factor. FOOD FOODIE raced forwardly between horses
and gave way. APPENDAGE prompted the pace outside the inner and faltered.

Footnotes
GALATIANS , taken to rate while saving ground and within range, took closer order nearing the far turn, eased out past the three eighths then went on the
attack outside CAVALRY COMMAND leaving the five sixteenths, dueled with that one past the furlong grounds, shook clear near the sixteenth pole and
widened under a drive. CAVALRY COMMAND took over early and set a rated pace toward the rail, handled some outside pressure then spurted clear into
the far turn, dug in when confronted by the winner, battled on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. STEELE MONEY
settled off the pace while saving ground, steadily progressed towards the rail around the final turn, came out three wide for the drive and churned on.
DREAM OF BLESSINGS , off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane and offered a belated response. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE , four wide
outside rivals leaving the seven eighths and into the backstretch, moved up three deep nearing the half and had aim, failed to kick on under a ride past the
five sixteenths and weakened. WORKIN ON A DREAM , between rivals early, was under asking three wide leaving the far turn, lacked a punch soon after
and weakened. SHOOT THEMESSENGER prompted the pace outside the leader, failed to go on leaving the far turn and faltered. FERMAT , sluggish from
the gate, raced three wide while well back past the three eighths and failed to menace. MIRACLE SILVER lost ground four to five wide around the first turn,
gave brief chase and retreated. NORTHERN THUNDER broke awkwardly, raced off the pace and four wide into the backstretch, failed to generate a
response and dropped back.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch, found room along the inner rail to take command mid way on the far turn,
drew off and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. ALOTTACENTS lacked speed, worked between horses on the far turn, was fanned wide turning for
home and rallied. UP AGAINST IT , three wide both turns, chased the pace, drifted out turning for home and weakened in the drive. BOBBY G lacked
speed, steadied when lacking room near the inner rail leaving the far turn, raced inside horses in the drive and passed tired ones. NEPOTISM , kept outside
horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide and weakened. NEVER CHANGE , near the inner rail most of the trip, faltered. HELMS DEEP
sped to the early lead, raced in the two path on the far turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
ROANAN GODDESS rated forwardly while saving ground, crept closer under some nudging past the five sixteenths, moved through along the rail to
challenge leaving the three sixteenths, bounced around with RECONCILE when put in tight soon after, wrested command near the sixteenth pole and drew
clear under a drive. RECONCILE went clear soon after the break, set a rated pace two wide and handled outside pressure into and around the turn, edged
back clear entering the lane, shifted inward making solid contact with the winner in mid stretch, corrected and fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave
way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. C C ROYAL prompted the pace three wide outside RECONCILE, was under pressure attempting to keep
pace in upper stretch, gave hard chase of the leaders past mid stretch and continued on with effort to the wire. HEART tracked outside a rival while under
some rating, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, angled four wide soon into the lane, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. STILL GAME
dropped well off the early pace, saved ground into the stretch and offered a belated response.

GUANARE , off a bit slow, shifted in soon after and was taken to rate, tracked the dueling leaders three wide, moved to engage after a half mile, responded
to firm asking and forged to command approaching the quarter pole, kept on under vigorous asking and edged away through the final sixteenth. SWEET
SODDY J secured the rail leaving the chute while racing on near even terms with HAD TO HAVE HIM, sparred with that one into and around the turn, was
put to a strong ride to hold position past the five sixteenths, remained a serious presence along the rail to mid stretch, switched over to his left lead with
about seventy yards remaining and kept on with good effort. HAD TO HAVE HIM got involved in a duel to the outside of SWEET SODDY J soon after the
start, held a slim advantage sparring into the turn, was under heavy pressure between rivals leaving the five sixteenths, could not keep up soon into the lane
and gave way.

Footnotes
IRISH RAGE , snugly rated while saving ground on the turn, found room inside AT FIRST SIGHT at the head of the lane, eagerly pulled away and was
under the whip in mid stretch. YUMYUM EAT EM UP lacked speed, raced near the rail into the turn, drifted out mid way on the bend, swung wide upper
stretch and passed tired horses. AT FIRST SIGHT set the pace along the inner rail, bumped with TROUBLED DREAMS leaving the backstretch, raced
along the rail on the turn, drifted out approaching the stretch and gave way. AMORICA void of speed, steadied on the heels of YUMYUM EAT EM UP mid
way on the turn, raced near the inner rail in the stretch and finished willingly. DESIGN DIVA , three wide on the turn, was outrun. TROUBLED DREAMS
bumped with AT FIRST SIGHT leaving the backstretch, chased the pace three wide on the turn and gave way. CHAVETA , three deep chasing the pace on
the turn, drifted wide in upper stretch, dropped back and was eased.
