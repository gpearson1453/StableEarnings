Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MIKEY pressed the pace to midway on the turn, took command nearing the quarter pole and drew away unthreatened in the lane. GIV'EM THE
BIZ set a pressured pace to the head of the lane and kept on down the stretch gamely to hold the place. MCGRAW reserved off the early pace, tracked the
leaders through the turn from four wide and made a mild rally in the lane. UPGRADE AL stalked the pace from the inside while hustled to keep pace and
lacked a closing response. HOPPY GILMORE went evenly failing to mount a closing rally. JOSH'N chased the pacesetters through the turn and flattened
out coming home. DASH OF FIRE trailed most of the way posing no threat. RUN BUBBA RUN was not a factor.

Footnotes
EPICUREAN pressed the pace into the turn from two wide, took command midway on the bend, opened a clear advantage and held well through the lane.
TIZ INDEPENDENCE unhurried in the early going to be reserved off the pace, split rivals turning for home, angled out, drifted wide while finding best stride
late to be closing well with a belated rally. SMOOTH JUSTICE stalked the leaders to the turn, rallied to the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid in the
stretch finishing evenly. DIVINE MARTHA hustled early up the fence to set a pressured pace to midway on the turn and weakened coming home. CEVICHE
raced mid-pack tracking the leaders and failed to mount a closing kick. QUARANTINA never menaced. LOVE MY CHERYL contended early and dropped
back steadily.

BIG JAVA stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied three wide on the bend to take command turning for home and drew clear down the lane. MOONTAP
reserved off the pace for the first half mile, commenced a steady advance under a long drive on the final turn and finished well to be second best. FABIOLA
PRINCESS pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the stretch and kept on down the lane. UNCAPTURED FAITH hustled to the lead into the first
turn, settled to set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch drive. PURDY PUMKIN went one-paced failing to menace. MYRA
FLEENER was never a threat. STORMIN MELLY was not a factor. PEARLINTHEROUGH showed brief pace to contend early and was through after a half.

Footnotes
PRETTY PATTY broke alertly to set a pressured pace, repelled the challenge from the runner-up at the quarter pole and drew off convincingly. DANCE
DRAMA pressed the pace through the turn, rallied two wide to challenge turning for home, was no match for the winner and finished well as second best.
I'M JAC'D stalked the pace down the backside making a brief threatening bid into the turn and failed to sustain the rally while keeping on to best of the rest.
MY PINK BABY BIRD tracked the leaders to the turn, mounted an early rally leaving the three-eighths pole and flattened out. C MORE PRIDE trailed most
of the way failing to menace. TV TIZ GORGEOUS was no threat, pulled up with an injury after the wire and was vanned off.

MUTUAL CONFIDENCE stalked the pacesetters to the turn, rallied three wide on the bend to engage the leader in upper stretch and drew clear inside the
sixteenth pole. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT reserved off the leaders early, made a steady advance on the turn from five wide and mounted a bleated bid to be
gaining late. AMIGO'S AFFAIR pressed the early pace, assumed command on the turn, battled to mid-stretch and was out-finished late in the lane.
APACHE unhurried early to be off the pace, circled seven wide turning for home and mounted a mild rally down the stretch. CRIMSON ROCKET trailed to
upper stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane. MASTER flashed brief speed to be on the pace to midway on the turn and came up empty.
ENZOEXPRESS chased the leaders and was through early.

DARK VADER unhurried in the early going to be off the pace, circled four wide while rallying on the turn and closed well finding his best stride late to be up
in time. LUCKY STREAK settled in hand early to track the leaders, split rivals while rallying into the turn, took the lead in mid-stretch and was run down in
the final strides. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY set a pressured pace to the turn, responded when challenged turning for home and kept on willingly in a good
effort. THE PINK Z saved ground cutting the corner coming for home and rallied well up the fence while unable to gain on the leaders in deep stretch.
RUMBLE STRIP RON pressed the pace to the quarter pole from three wide and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
VIMISOFA stalked the pace to the turn, rallied four wide to take command in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage and held on late. AVA'S STORM
unhurried in the early going to trail, tracked the leaders while circling, altered course through the stretch to be gaining late with a belated rally. FAITHFUL
STEPS tracked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied four wide turning for home and lacked a late closing kick. DAISY JONES set a pressured pace from
the fence and weakened turning for home. COUNTRY STYLE pressed the pace through the turn taking a brief lead nearing the quarter pole and gave way
in the lane.
