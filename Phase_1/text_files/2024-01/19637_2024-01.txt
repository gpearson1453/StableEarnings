Footnotes
APACHE prompted the early pace, lost position on the turn while saving ground along the rail, rallied in upper stretch, tipped out around the tiring pacesetter
and rallied determinedly to prevail late. LAUDA SPEED broke inward crowding several rivals from the gate, settled off the early pace, circled five wide on the
turn to threaten in mid-stretch and was out-finished in the drive. CRIMSON ROCKET brushed at the start, tracked the leaders from between rivals through
the turn and mounted a mild bid down the lane. TWICE AS SMART flashed speed to hustle up to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear lead into the
turn, kept on through the lane and tired inside the final sixteenth. UHAVETOBEKITTENME crowded at the start, rushed up three wide in the turn to threaten
with an early bid and flattened out in the stretch. GEMO RAIN in tight leaving the gate, dropped to the rear of the field and ran on with late interest in the
lane while posing no threat.

Footnotes
MAGESTAL BASTIDA broke a step slow to trail the field for the first half mile, rallied five wide into the turn, quickly took command at the head of the lane
and drew off through the stretch as much best. BEING CREATIVE unhurried early to be well off the leaders, slid out to the five path to rally four wide in the
turn, loomed up turning for home and finished well to be second best while no match for the winner. FABIOLA PRINCESS stalked the pace from between
rivals through the final turn and was outkicked in the lane. STORMIN MELLY reserved off the pace for a half mile, launched an early bid from three wide in
the turn and flattened out in upper stretch. MOONTAP tracked from four wide down the backside, took command into the turn and weakened turning for
home. PURDY PUMKIN well placed just off the pace from along the rail to the far turn and faded coming home. WAR MOON set a pressured pace and gave
way. C C'S WORLD was not a threat.

LIL BUT DELICIOUS stalked the leaders into the turn, rallied three wide to take command in upper stretch and drew clear. OPTIMIZME unhurried in the
early going to trail, rallied five wide in the turn and finished well in the lane to take the place. MY D'VALENTINE pressed the pace down the backside, took
command entering the turn and weakened in the stretch. MO RISSA reserved off the pace to the turn, mounted a mild bid in the turn and flattened out.
KEENE ON JENNY saved ground to no avail failing to mount a rally. SPENDING CUTS set a pressured pace and was through early.

INSIDE STUNT dueled from the rail on the lead to midway on the turn, assumed command turning for home and cleared off in the lane. MALIBU CLASSIC
tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied four wide in the turn, drifted further wide in upper stretch and closed well down the stretch to be second best.
MAKING ME CRAZY reserved off the pace through the turn and mounted a mild rally in the stretch. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK unhurried early to be settled
off the leaders, made a steady advance in the turn and finished with a belated bid in the lane. CRAFTY CONQUEST stalked the pace into the turn, rallied
three wide to loom at the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive unable to sustain the bid. FRONTLINER trailed to the top of the stretch and passed tiring
rivals in the lane. TRIGZ TOO went evenly as no threat. ENZOEXPRESS set a pressured pace for three-eighths and gave way. SUMMERFEST was not a
factor.

Footnotes
BLENHEIM BABY unhurried early, tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied five wide to engage the leader in upper stretch and drew off under confident
handling. MIDNIGHT ANGEL stalked the leaders to the turn, took command with a three wide rally on the bend and finished well to be second best while no
match for the winner. BEAUTIFUL SUMMER dueled from the rail in a three way pace battle and kept on through the lane to hold the show. HALCYON
DAYS slow early to trail the field and showed some late energy through the lane. CITRINA pressed the pace from between rivals through the turn and faded
coming home. DR G AND ALI was never a threat. MY JENNY showed brief speed to duel on the early lead from three wide and came up empty.
