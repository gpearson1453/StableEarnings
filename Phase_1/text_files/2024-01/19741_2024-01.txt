MYSTIC LAKE veered out and bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the two path and held clear to the wire. GORGEOUS GIRL tracked the leader between horses through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the
three path and gained ground late. CORINTH stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and kept on to the
finish. GENUINE PERIL raced off the pace early, came around the bend in the four path and improved position in the lane. GIRVIN'S PRINCESS bumped
with the horse to her inside and was pinched back leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a
bid from the two path coming around the turn and flattened out from there. D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER bumped with horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased
the leader from the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. RUNAWAY DIVA bumped with the horse to her outside at
the start, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the lane.
