Footnotes
HOUSE BOURBON set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin entering the far turn, drifted out while meeting an outer challenge in the final furlong
and held. CONTRABAND EARLY laid off of the pace in the two path, gained in the four path around the far turn, sustained a rally on his left lead to bid
outside of the leader in the final furlong, but was herded outwardly through the late stages and was denied. YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU was bumped by an
outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, vied for place with a pair of outer rivals in upper stretch, but was outkicked and held show. BATTALION
STRIKE broke inwardly and bumped a rival into multiple inner foes at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses,, gained place approaching the
five sixteenths pole, but was relinquished that position to bidders on either side in upper stretch, yet kept on to duel for show, but was fended off. BOSTON
BLITZ was pinched between rivals and steadied hard at the start, trailed in the two path, pursued in the five path around the far turn, then shifted in to
improve between horses in upper stretch. BACK BAYOU stalked in the four path before moving to press the leader entering the backstretch, but weakened
between horses around the far turn. TEMPLE OF PEACE hopped slightly then was bumped and pinched between horses at the start, raced off of the pace
in the three to two path and made little impact. PURRRFECT RHYTHM pursued from the four path and steadily faded.

Footnotes
JUST A TOUCH prompted outside of the leader into the turn, bid turning for home, led entering the lane and drew off under little urging. GUN PARTY
pursued from midpack along the inside, picked up stride before splitting foes to gain place at the furlong grounds and was second best. CAPITAL
CONNECTION tracked from the two path, shifted outside of the top pair entering the lane, chased to offer a bid for place in midstretch, but was outkicked by
an inner rival at the furlong grounds and settled for show. EVAN ON EARTH tracked in the three to four path and lacked a bid. SILVER HALO showed the
way along the inside, vied with an outer prompter turning for home, but proved no match for that one in upper stretch and weakened. MAGICAL MOJO laid
off of the pace two wide, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. DEVILSGOTACAUSE lacked speed along the inside and made little impact.
SUCCESSFUL RUN raced towards the rear three wide, floated to the five path entering the lane and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAVE CREEK pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked in the three path around the far turn, bid outside of the top pair entering the lane and drew
offf. QUINN MURPHY was slow into stride, trailed in the two to three path early on, advanced in the five path around the far turn, then rallied to gain place
late. FADED MEMORIES stalked along the inside, got subtly shuffled behind the faltering early leader into the far turn, recovered to split foes and gain place
leaving the furlong grounds, but was caught late. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME lacked speed in the two path, then in the six path around the far turn and moved
up. SKYKAT pursued from the four path, chased between foes around the far turn and lacked a bid. JUST PASSING THRU tracked in the two to four path
around the first turn, ranged up into the far turn to vie outside of the leader turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave
way. MARY JACK prompted along the inside, bid outside of the leader nearing the far turn, led tucking to the inside entering that bend, but was confronted
turning for home, proved no match for a wider bidder leaving the three sixteenths pole and weakened. DRE ME LESS stalked forwardly in the three path,
chased between horses around the far turn and faded. COINMAKER lacked speed in the four path and was through early. SHE'S A BIG STAR set the pace
two wide before tucking to the inside down the backstretch, but faltered into the far turn and readily stopped.

GUN PILOT stalked in the three path, bid outside of the leader in upper stretch, took light contact while forging an advantage at the furlong grounds and
drove clear. POWERFUL prompted along the inside, stalked into the turn, then sustained a rail chase to edge place leaving the sixteenth pole. SAINT
SELBY showed the way in the two path, drifted out while getting collard by an outer bidder in midstretch, brushed that and relinquished an advantage at the
furlong grounds, then gave way. BOSS' DIALIN IN tracked in the four path and chased evenly. MISSED THE BOAT laid off of the pace in the two to three
path and lacked a bid. LAGOON trailed while remaining in the five path and was outrun.

Footnotes
MS QUALITY CONTROL tracked two wide, bided time behind the leaders turning for home, tipped outside of them and to the five path in upper stretch,
rallied to bid at the furlong grounds and drew clear. JUST BETTER advanced three wide around the first turn to a stalking position, ranged up in the four
path to offer a bid in upper stretch, led briefly at the furlong grounds but was outkicked by an outer bidder leaving that station and was second best.
GREYHOUND STATION pressed two wide, then between horses around the far turn, vied in the three path among foes in upper stretch, but failed to go on
with an outer pair leaving the furlong grounds. LADY ARIEL stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, shifted out in midstretch and
lacked a bid. LUCKY SPEECH set the pace just a bit off of the inside, led from a pair of outer pressers around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch and
weakened at the furlong grounds. STAR ANISE broke a step slow then steadied from between horses at the start, trailed in the two path, moved out of last
around the far turn yet made little impact. SHARE THE BLESSING laid off of the pace along the inside, but was done early.

Footnotes
FOXFIRE tracked along the inside, gained entering the lane to split the leaders at the three sixteenths pole, assumed command coming to midstretch and
drove clear. NOT TODAY GEEGEE dueled for the lead inside of a rival, disposed of that one before proving no match for an outer bidder approaching
midstretch and was second best. NOTABLE QUEEN dueled for the lead with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, but yielded three wide in
upper stretch, then lasted for show. ROXY'S BALL stalked the embattled leading pair from the four path, but lacked a bid before hanging late and failing to
reach show. HAPPY CHARGER laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to menace. SONG BRIDGE lacked speed two wide and failed to factor. MISS
GOLDEN PENNY broke slowly, trailed in the four path and was outrun. IMMA MADI TUE chased from midpack in the three path and tired.

Footnotes
PYRENEES stalked outside of the leader, vied along with an outer presser around the far turn, wrestled an advantage entering the lane and edged clear.
BRIGADE COMMANDER showed the way along the inside, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, got headed by his
closest challenger entering the lane, failed to keep pace with that one in midstretch, yet kept on through the final furlong to hold place. BRIGHT SPARK
broke awkwardly while away slow from the gates, trailed in the three path, shifted out to the path in upper stretch and ran on. FROMANOTHAMUTHA
tracked three wide, moved to press the top pair into the far turn, sustained pressure turning for home but gave way in upper stretch. SUNDAY BREEZE laid
off of the pace along the inside, tracked before coming under urging turning for home, then faded.

Footnotes
STEAL IT BACK pursued from midpack along the inside, gained entering the far turn to bid for the lead in the three path and between horses with five
sixteenths to go, forged an advantage entering the lane, inched clear and held. TSURIS was off a step slow and bumped by an inner rival at the start, trailed
in the three to two path, picked up stride swinging to the six path entering the lane, then offered a belated rally to reach place at the wire. JUJU NINETEEN
bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, advanced in the three path turning for home, tipped to the four path to
take aim outside of the new leader in upper stretch, sustained progress to bid in the final furlong but was fended off and nailed at the wire for place. FORT
BONZ saved ground off of the pace and chased up the rail. GALLANT STAR was fractious in the starting gate, chased forwardly in the two to three path,
ranged up in the four path around the far turn but yielded drifting to the five path entering the lane. PAYOFF CYCLE prompted inside of the leader, inherited
an advantage from that faltering foe with five sixteenths to go, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and weakened. SMOOTH COLLIERY
lacked speed in the two path, inched closer turning for home before improving between horses entering the lane, but failed to menace. UNWANTED
INTRUDER failed to factor from the three path. GREELEY WENT WEST chased from midpack in the three to four paths and tired. ZONG TOUGH pursued
from midpack in the four path and faded. WAR COUNT showed the way in the three to two path entering the backstretch, but weakened between horses at
the five sixteenths pole. SIR OVERANALYZE chased in the two path, but was done after a half mile, pulled up and walked off.
