Footnotes
SIX PACK SENORITA broke a step slow, tugged very hard on the bit while rated off heels under vigorous restraint, continued just behind the leading quartet
while full of run off heels, started the turn in the two path while still very keen, was let out while shifting out from behind foes just inside the three-eighths
pole, accelerated quickly in the four path, stormed to the front into the stretch, kicked clear near the three-sixteenths, drifted in significantly outside the
furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. NEXT ON STAGE broke out at the start, contested the pace between horses, vied in the two
path while still between foes on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. UNHEARD disputed
the pace on the outside of three foes, vied in the three path on the turn and weakened while able to get the show. EXTRA DIRTY broke out then was quickly
corrected by the rider, disputed the pace between horses, dropped to the rail leaving the backstretch, vied inside under urging on the turn, dropped back
approaching the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch and tired. E STORMY was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of three
opponents, checked outside the half-mile pole and dropped back, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and had
nothing left.

Footnotes
SHIGEKO seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and seized
command just inside that station, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final seventy yards.
AFILADA rushed the gate at the start when the latch was sprung and got taken in hand getting away near the rear, chased six to seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch before tucking briefly five wide before going four wide into the turn, came under coaxing midway and angled out six wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors by a nostril. ALTERINA seven to eight paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and kept on to just
get bested for the place honors. SHASI showed the way in hand four then three wide before tucking to the two path through the turn, yielded the front just
inside the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SHAYMYNAME forwardly placed just off the inside, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths in retreat, continued to back away and went three wide into upper stretch, then folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
GRINGOTTS lacked early speed while urged along on the outside, went five then six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, rallied on the
outside, closed well to get the lead inside the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN
was completely void of speed, dropped well behind while ridden along, went two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved to the far
outside before the furlong marker and finished fast but was too late while clear for the place. DARN THAT SONG went to the front while moving well off the
inside, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths, fought on even terms for the lead into the
final furlong and tired while able to get the show. TRADE SECRET moved out near the three-quarter pole, was urged along off the pace, went four then five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. CAPTIVATING CARA was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the
outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, took a short lead while three then four wide on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. TOWERING GAZE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response.

Footnotes
CRIMSON LIGHT veered in at the start brushing the gate and then striking the temporary railing while bucking a bit under correction, conceded at minimum
twenty lengths to the leader before settling into stride when guided outside six to seven paths off the rail, chased detached at the tail of the field tucking
three to four wide through the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch, drifted out straightened away two to three paths mimicking the drifting of SHORE
TIME in front and to his inside, rallied with good courage and good energy to close stoutly on the outside coming in slightly when corrected from drifting to
trade a bump with SHORE TIME who came outwards forty yards from the finish and was up in the final jumps to score. SHORE TIME four then three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, drifted out three paths straightened away while rallying to issue a
challenge through the final furlong, drifted out forty yards from home when just getting on near even terms with the leader and traded a bump initiating
contact with the aforementioned foe and then just missed on the wire. PERNO got brushed at the start by UPTOMYKNEESINIT, showed the way in hand
just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch under threat to the
outside, dug in stubbornly to turn back that rival and was nailed by a pair of foes outside in the final strides to the finish. UPTOMYKNEESINIT broke out at
the start brushing PERNO, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick but was out-finished in the late stages. PROFITABILITY four then three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader,
got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and shied briefly before being corrected just outside the eighth pole, kept on to the
finish but was out-finished in the late going. VITALIZE chased just off the inside climbing when a bit green and facing kickback early on, tucked inside into
the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. WONDER WONDERLAND five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of SHORE TIME alleging interference
against CRIMSON LIGHT. After review the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
BON ADIEU went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action while inside on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch,
responded well to the challenge of KARA PARA near the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker, dueled gamely with
the aforementioned foe to the finish and narrowly prevailed. KARA PARA settled off the pace, went three wide early on the turn, shifted five wide outside the
three-eighths pole, dropped to the four path while gaining late on the bend, made a five wide bid into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner, drifted out
under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, was switched to a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, fought with the winner to the finish and was denied
while well clear for the place. RACING COLORS settled off the pace, angled in with five furlongs to run, moved from the rail to the two path under urging on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. LADY FORTUNA was coaxed along on the outside,
went five then six wide under stronger encouragement on the turn, spun eight wide into the stretch and came up empty. VAX stalked the pace, chased in the
three path on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and tired. SARATOGA KISSES tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn,
dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and retreated. STARRY MIDNIGHT was urged along off the pace, gained in the two path early on the turn, made a
brief bid at the three-eighths pole then chased the leader, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

PRINTRACK went to the front, set the pace under pressure, was asked in the two path on the turn, dueled inside of the runner-up in the stretch, disposed of
that foe into the final sixteenth and moved clear under steady handling. SAFFA'S DAY pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn,
spun four wide into the stretch, dueled outside of the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while well clear for the place. DOT'S DOLLAR
tossed his head at the start but broke with the rest of the field, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three
wide into the stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn,
moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond. BRING ME A CHECK was taken in hand after the start then reserved off the pace, came under coaxing
near the nine-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. RYAN'S CAT tracked the pace on the
outside, chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered. ONE MORE BREW settled at the rear, climbed some while moving out
near the five-eighths pole, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
FRANNIE LEW was well placed just off the pace, drafted behind horses in the two path on the turn, was asked three wide into the stretch, chased into the
final furlong then made a bid between horses, fought inside of the runner-up in the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. PRACTICAL MISS settled
on the outside, chased four then five wide on the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied
while clear for the place. DREAM ON CARA was urged along on the outside, advanced five then six wide on the turn, chased while looming a threat into the
final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show. MO DAMORNINGGROUCH pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the
turn, took a short lead outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened.
GALATRONA chased the early pace then raced just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, pursued the
vanguard into the final furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. FOLLOW THE FED was urged along off the pace, raced
inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. ARMY OF THOUGHTS climbed badly nearing the five-eighths pole, was hard ridden off the pace,
moved from three to five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. OUR REWARD went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to
the two path on the turn, lost the lead late on that bend and tired. MAXING THE BANK was fractious in the gate then backed before being reloaded, came in
hand while last away, was urged at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
