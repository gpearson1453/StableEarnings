Footnotes
LATE NIGHT LIVING bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch,
dueled from the rail around the far bend and into the lane and dug in gamely to the wire to just hold the win. FRIZZANTE raced in the three path early,
stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled
to the finish to just miss. PEACE NOT WAR raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the
outside around the far turn and continued to battle to the wire to narrowly miss. BEAR HUNT hopped up and bumped with the horse to his outside at the
start, was pinched back and trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn, moved up to chase the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came
around the far turn in the two path and gained ground late on the outside to not miss by much. FORT BLING raced in the two path early, tracked the leader
between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
SHE'S A JOY saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn, and drew off in
the lane while drifting out mildly. ALWAYS ROYAL raced in the three path early, settled off the pace between horses up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the second bend and improved position in the lane. CLOUDY BAY raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second turn and weakened in the lane. PASTA SALAD RHONDA raced off the pace in the
two path through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend still in the two path and never threatened. SUSIE'S SAVER raced in the three path
around the first turn, chased the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the stretch.
BACHELORETTE saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and tired from
there. CHRIS'S MOTOWN GAL raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around
the far turn in the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and just held to the wire. IDEAL
BREEZE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and gained
ground steadily to the finish to narrowly miss. RUBYSA raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path,
began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. ROYAL TO BE stalked the pace setter between horses up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. MAMBO DANCER trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and
passed tiring horses in the stretch while never truly threatening. QUEENS RANSOM raced in the middle of the pack through the opening stages, swung out
to the four path coming around the turn and faded in the lane. NURSE JUDY tracked the leaders early, dropped back coming around the turn, entered the
stretch in the five path and continued to tire from there.

THOUGHT tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late
to get up for the win in the final strides. BIG MARTINI led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, drifted out a lane near the quarter
pole, having mild contact with SAN CONSTANTINO in the process, dug in in the lane and was caught at the wire. THE JUDGE AND JURY chased the
leader between horses through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on to the finish. SAN COSTANTINO stalked the leader
on the outside early, angled in to save ground around the turn, raced into traffic and bumped slightly with BIG MARTINI near the quarter pole and weakened
in the final furlong. HOWBEIT trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and never threatened. WINTER'S GHOST raced off
the pace on the outside through the opening stages, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and made no bid. MR. KRINGLE raced off the pace
on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and was empty in the lane.
