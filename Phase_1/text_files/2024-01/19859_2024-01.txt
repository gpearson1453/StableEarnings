MY SPECIAL MISTAKE was unhurried early, loomed five wide through the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, dueled with QUANTUM BULL to late stretch
and prevailed for the win. QUANTUM BULL pressed the early pace, advanced three wide into the turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled to the wire and
finished second best. MR. BIG RIG was up close early, raced along the inside in too the turn, angled out and was gaining late. DISCOVERY N SIGHT was
allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the turn, angled in and offered a mild late rally. TATAS JOE MARK tracked the early pace, raced between rivals
into the turn, angled out stretch and was empty late. TWO STEP JACK bumped at the start, wash rushed to set the early pace from the inside and faded.
