Footnotes
SPEIGHTS DANCE was off a step slow, moved up to race just off the pace on the outside, was asked in the five path on the turn, made a bid at the
quarter-pole, battled outside of two foes into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging. DOLCE
VELOCE broke in but was away quickly, attended the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the four path on the turn, took a short lead into upper
stretch, battled under a drive while remaining on her left lead until just before the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point, fought with the
winner to the finish and missed while clear for the place. MANGIA was reluctant to load, broke in then went to the front, contested the pace, vied in the three
path on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired while well clear for the show. AMY'S LIGHT bumped with a
rival at the start, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and capitulated.
JAY'S LOVE broke a step slow, was coaxed along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. MASTERY'S SECRET was slow
into stride then dropped well behind, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. LET'S CONNECT bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along
off the pace, dropped back while saving ground early on the turn, shifted three then four wide starting around the three-eighths pole and had nothing left.

Footnotes
M B'S MUNNING was forwardly placed on the far outside, stalked three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, made a bid at the
quarter-pole, took the lead under a drive at the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. SWIFTY DEVIL was urged along off the pace, went two
then three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, rallied into the final furlong, closed strongly into the final sixteenth, moved out late and
finished fast to just get the place. LITTLE LUCA tracked the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead
outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner at the furlong marker, fought with that foe into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished then caught for the place. HOT ROD RUMBLE was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside
on the turn, lost the lead under urging outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under the crop in upper stretch and tired. JESTER'S SONG was coaxed along
off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HATCH was
hustled from the gate, chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, remained on his inside
lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. FIGHT FIERCELY was urged along near the back, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to
threaten. GOLD IN THEM HILLS stumbled at the start, came inward early, raced well back in the field, went around the turn in the four path and was no
factor. GRUMLEY stumbled at the start, settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PIT BOSS dueled briefly with CO CONSPIRATOR early on before establishing sole command four then three paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path nearing the half mile pole, shook away with authority midway on the turn to open up a commanding lead and was set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, continued to widen away to inside the eighth pole and held clear kept busy to the wire. COOL QUARTET chased five
then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the
rest to be along second best. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. CO CONSPIRATOR dueled briefly with the eventual winner before chasing that rival three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and was one paced through to the finish. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY chased
four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. ACH DU LIEBER chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch, tired. DATESFREEDOM coaxed
from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. GOLDINI coaxed from
the gate, chased along the inside getting placed in tight by a pair of rivals with nine-sixteenths to go and was taken briefly in hand brushing the rail, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
IRIDESCENT was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear under the crop in upper stretch
and drew away under steady urging. WECALLEMFUNCOUPONS pressed the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the turn, lost touch with the
winner in upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. AUGUSTINE RED was last to commence, climbed while moving out behind foes
nearing the five-eighths then settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, gained four wide on the turn, loomed a threat passing the
three-eighths pole, began to lug in outside the five-sixteenths, was steadied while continuing to lug in outside the quarter-pole, was guided in by the rider
while still lugging inward outside the furlong marker, reached the two path shortly thereafter, persistently lugged in to the finish and just earned the show.
REMEMBER THE NAME settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response
then just missed the show. MAD BANKER jostled with a rival early, was coaxed along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and came up
empty. BONNE CHANCE jostled with a foe early, was urged along at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GHOSTBUSTIN showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, started the turn in the two path under extra left-rein pressure then dropped
to the rail, shook clear into the stretch, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up near the three-sixteenths, fought with that foe into the final furlong
and edged clear under strong urging. FOXY CARA bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, rallied to make
an outside bid in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. SHE'S A NATURAL was coaxed
along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch behind a rival, was roused near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response
while just able to get the show. HAPPY'S SMILE was last to commence then reserved towards the rear, drafted in the two path on the turn, raced behind
horses late on that bend, swung seven wide into upper stretch and improved to just miss the show. MOONLIT WEEKEND bumped with a rival at the start,
was coaxed along off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and weakened then missed the superfecta. TURRIGA
was well spotted just off the pace, chased four then three wide on the turn and tired. ACCELERINA was hustled from the gate, chased the pace, dropped
back between horses leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch then moved to the eighth path and capitulated.
EASTERN STAR stumbled at the start but broke towards the front, raced just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, steadied off heels into upper
stretch, altered out inside the three-sixteenths and had nothing left. MONETARY MONARCH moved up to be well placed just off the pace, chased inside on
the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and also capitulated. KRYSTALHEIR angled in while settling towards the rear, went
four then three wide early on the turn, dropped to the rail near the three-eighths pole, shifted back to the three path late on the bend, moved out outside the
furlong marker and failed to respond. RED JASMINE disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path two path on the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and faded.
