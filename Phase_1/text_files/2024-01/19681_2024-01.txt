Footnotes
CAVU set the pace in the two path, was nudged along while just off the rail rounding the turn, tipped back out to the two path at the top of the lane, opened
slightly into the final furlong, and held sway under a drive. BRODERIE laid in range along the inside, was ridden from the rail around the turn, and ran on up
the rail down the stretch to get up for place late. MYSTIC SUNRISE got bumped at the start by an inner foe, stalked in the four path, was roused from the
three path into the turn, and kept on in the stretch for show. STREET CHARITY tracked in the three path, was cued between foes in the two path passing
the quarter, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. SUPER SPIN broke out and bumped with an outer foe, raced off the pace in
the three path, was coaxed along in the four path rounding the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, but failed to bid. THE CONTESSA chased in the
two path, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. MARILYN trailed throughout around the four to six paths.

Footnotes
DIAMOND MESSA stalked the pace from the rail, took over inside of the pacesetter turning for home, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a
steady drive. SWEET TRAVELS was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, circled five wide around the far turn and rallied outside. STING
MUSIC was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. MY GREAT ILLUSION raced in range three wide,
bid three deep around the far turn, briefly led leaving the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. MAGMA was forced out and checked between foes
entering the first turn, raced well back four and five wide and passed tiring rivals. LAST RUN saved ground and failed to menace. PRAISEWORTHY raced
off the early pace four wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid in the four path around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. GIURO broke
out and bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and faltered in the drive. BAD HOMBRE had his head turned at the start and was outrun inside.

RO TOWN set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the turn, dug in while back in the two path turning into the stretch, and
held sway. GUNESH stalked inside, was roused from the two path into the turn, swung from the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place.
ADMISSIBLE bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path, waited for room under a hold along the inside rounding the turn, was coaxed
from the three path into the stretch, and kept on for show. WISE AND ELEGANT laid up close in the three path, bid in hand approaching the quarter, was
cued while floating out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but faded. BLACK BELT BARBIE got bumped on both sides at the start, tracked in the two
path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, drifted in passing the eighth pole, and did not
threaten. BUSTIN BULLET bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but never menaced.

Footnotes
MEGAN MAKIN MONEY set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and held clear while ridden out. MUDSHAFT raced off the pace outside,
advanced four wide around the far turn and kept on to be clearly second best. BARBARA prompted the winner in the three path, could not keep pace with
that foe nearing the quarter pole and held third. BARGAINAIRE chased the pace inside, bumped foes near the half-mile pole, chased in the two path around
the turn and lacked a rally. WINNING AT EASE was bumped near the half-mile pole, raced three wide and never threatened. TALK MUCH was bumped
leaving the half-mile pole, raced four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
KING JULIEN vied for the lead in the four path, was nudged along in the two path around the turn, cued in the three path turning into the stretch, and drew
away from an inner foe passing the eighth pole. BOURBON BOSS bobbled at the start, dueled for the lead with the winner in the two path, was ridden along
the rail around the turn, lost touch with the winner while in the two path passing the eighth pole, but ran on to hold place. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND tracked in
the three path, was coaxed approaching the quarter, swung from the five path into the stretch, and finished evenly to get up for show. SOAR RICHARD
steadied along the inside passing the half, stalked from the two path into the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the lane, but flattened late. FLY
ERIK FLY trailed in the four path, was coaxed in the two path early around the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, but made no impact. GREAT
LILO rated in the two path, but had to check going into the turn, and never factored. MISCHIEF EXPOSED raced in midpack in the four path but failed to
bid. CRASH THE GATE chased in the five path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but never threatened. OMAHA EIGHT raced wellback
along the inside and never menaced.

BEFORE YOU GO GO set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, tipped out to the three path turning into the lane, and drew clear.
MAJESTIC VENEZUELA tracked in the two path, was ridden along the inside into the far turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, and stayed on for
place. MIDSUMMER MO chased in the two path, was ridden in the three path into the far turn, tipped inside entering the stretch, and kept on for show.
ACTIVE raced in midpack in the three path, was cued from the four path into the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and finished
evenly. COLORFUL LADY rated in the five path, was coaxed from the three path into the far turn, but did not factor. RYO AMAZING trailed in the three path,
was cued in the two path midway around the far turn, angled out to the six path passing the eighth pole, but did not threaten. TONY BLUE TAPE prompted
the pace in the three path, but weakened in the four path down the lane. BEST OF ALL raced off the pace inside but never menaced. FIORENZA stalked in

ROCKET DRAGON set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. VINSANITY pressed the winner in the three
path, was no match for that foe in the lane but kept on to be a clear second. EL CHATO raced off the pace two wide and had a mild rally for the show.
MAYHEMINTHEPALACE chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. ICE THE KICKER failed to menace
while racing four wide. BIG TOBY was outrun inside.

INTO CHAMPAGNE broke out at the start, stalked in the two path, waited confidently along the inside around the turn, was roused to split foes in the two
path at the top of the stretch, took command passing the eighth pole, and held sway. LAUNCH chased between foes in the four path, was coaxed along
while floating out to the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. KISSEDBYANANGEL bumped with an outer foe and had to steady at the
start, trailed in the two path, shifted out to the four path under a drive turning into the lane, and rallied for show. LET THEM WATCH broke out at the start,
set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the three-eighths, but faded along the inside into the final furlong. INDESCRIPTABLE bumped with an inner
foe and had to steady at the start, raced wellback in the three path, angled out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, and finished evenly.
SCOOTALOO prompted the pace in the three path, but faded between foes turning into the lane. CARESS tracked in the five path but was empty turning
into the stretch.
