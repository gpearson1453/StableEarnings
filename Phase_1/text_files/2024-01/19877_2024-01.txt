Footnotes
CALDO CANDY tracked the pace on the inside of a foe, made a bid outside of the leader late on the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the turn,
took the advantage under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker, fought outside the runner-up, drifted in when switched to a
right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the finish while best. PASCHAL MOON went to the front, showed
the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat to his outside while in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch,
fought on with that foe in the final furlong but missed while well clear for the place. TWIRLING VINE stalked the pace on the backstretch, was asked in the
four path on the turn, chased the top two into upper stretch, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and tired but held the show. Z
DANCER raced just off the pace on the outside under some restraint, was eased back late on the backstretch then angled in, went three then two wide
under urging on the turn and lacked the needed response. SCHERZANDO broke a step slow, was urged along near the back, saved ground while inside
foes on the turn and failed to respond. FLYING IN STYLE dropped back quickly while showing no speed under urging, went around the turn in the two path,
came three wide into the stretch and was outrun. FLIP'S DREAM broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, raced
between foes in the two path until near the five-sixteenths then dropped back, shifted to the four path shortly thereafter, spun five wide into the stretch and
capitulated.

Footnotes
KHALI MAGIC moved in while going to the front, showed the way under some pressure, moved clear just inside the five-eighths pole, extended the
advantage leaving the backstretch, drew off in the two path on the turn, was shaken up very briefly in upper stretch, widened under very mild coaxing into
the final sixteenth then was geared down more while much the best. AMITY ISLAND was restless in the gate, raced near the back under urging, went
around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the rail and was along for the place. CARBON moved out then advanced to press the pace on the
outside, chased the winner starting with five furlongs to run, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, remained on her
inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and narrowly earned the show. APRIL ANTICS was urged along on the outside,
went five then six wide on the turn, remained on her left lead in the stretch and just missed the show. BERNT AGAIN settled off the early pace, was ridden
along late on the backstretch, raced in the two path early on the turn, dropped to the rail briefly near the three-eighths pole then came back out, reached the
three path outside the five-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead in the lane and tired. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE was hustled from the gate, showed speed
then tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn
and capitulated. VALLARAND broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the crop
and was no factor.

ROTKNEE away near the rear, ranged up to vie for command outside a pair of rivals five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over sole command inside the five-sixteenths, swung six then five wide into upper stretch
and edged clear under a drive to prevail. AGGREGATION coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tipped out bumping
OCEAN'S RESERVE into GENERAL BANKER just outside the half mile pole, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went seven wide into upper stretch and ran on to just secure the place honors over a duo on the wire. ANDIAMO A FIRENZE vied from the two path inside a
pair down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept
on to preserve the show honors. GENERAL BANKER six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, got bumped by OCEAN'S RESERVE when
that foe was bumped by the tipping out AGGREGATION near the half mile pole, chased five wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out,
went eight wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DISARMED hustled from the gate, vied three then two wide between foes coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, faded through the latter portion of the turn and went five wide into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish. OCEAN'S
RESERVE coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and was bumped by AGGREGATION when that foe tipped out
inexplicably near the half mile pole and in turn bumped GENERAL BANKER, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, went seven
wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CAPITAL IDEA was well placed just off the pace while off the inside, moved out leaving the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn, gained seven
wide into the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. SARDIS pressed the pace
on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner at the three-sixteenths, moved out behind that foe in the vicinity of the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. J D FACTOR
was hustled to the front, shied slightly from marks on the track outside the seven-eighths pole, showed the way under pressure to the outside, vied in the
two path while asked on the turn, lost the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired but was well clear for the show.
BOUNTEOUS settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. CONFLICTED
tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, full further back while five then four wide on the turn and faltered. STRATEGIC
DECISION dropped back near the five-eighths then was urged along near the back, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend,
came out into the stretch and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
MEL'S BABY SISTER tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up four then five wide on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, took the lead late on
the bend, shook clear while asked for her best into upper stretch, drifted in under a right-handed crop near the furlong marker and held under strong urging.
FIVE TO TWO was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out outside the
sixteenth-pole and willingly earned the place. PRINCESS VINO was sent hard from the gate, chased the pace on the inside, moved from the rail to the three
path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while just
able to get the show. EKWANOK bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, shfited from the rail the two path late on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved to just miss the show. MISS LAO was urged along off the pace, moved from four to six wide on
the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. POSEIDON'S MIST broke in and brushed the gate, moved up under urging to get the lead
near the five-eighths pole, was urged along while inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner late on that bend and tired. MITOLE'S
GIRL bumped with an opponent at the start, showed speed and led early, lost the advantage coming to the five-eighths then pressed on the outside, vied in
the two to three path for most of the turn, moved to the four path late on that bend, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. MISS BOURBON broke
through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, chased the pace, went three to four wide for most of the turn then
moved to the five path, came six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MIDTOWN ROSE coaxed from the gate, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied coming
inwards a path under a right handed crop just before seizing command a furlong out, which forced VITAEMI to steady off her heels, then edged away under
a drive to prevail. DARN THAT SONG coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command
swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors. MARIAH'S FORTUNE
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. DIVINE CROSS

VITAEMI coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive and
was forced to steady off the heels of MIDTOWN ROSE coming inwards when going on by near the eighth pole, then continued to weaken to the finish.
BEHIND THE COUCH coaxed from the start, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch,
weakened. TOWERING GAZE chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. WARTAPPED showed the way in hand along the inside and
then just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired through to
the end. CAPTIVATING CARA four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went nine to ten wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
LEFT LEANING LUCY three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and faltered. There was a Stewards'
