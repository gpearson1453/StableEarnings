Footnotes
WINMOR WENDY went to the lead entering the first turn to set all the pace, edged away on the backstretch and held on in the stretch. NO MORE WORDS
pressed the pace from two wide and lacked the late response. DEROY stalked the pace from three wide through the final turn then shifted inside to make a
late bid but lacked room late. IRISH MOON was hard to load into the gate then was bumped by inside rival and pinched back at the start, raced near the
back down the backstretch and made a four wide bid going into the stretch for a late run to be best of the others. TERNI VALENTINO was reluctant to load
then tracked the leaders from three wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid at the three furlong marker and flattened out. YES JACK broke
outward and bumped outside rival at the start, raced off the pace around the first turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch but failed to sustain that bid.
GUNPOWDER N' LEAD raced off the pace from between horses but didn't make a rally. FRUIT CUP trailed the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
HOT LE ROY stalked the pace from the inside around the first turn then moved up to go between horses at the seven sixteenth pole to take the lead at the
quarter pole, was kept to task in the stretch and just lasted. AUTOPILOT raced off the pace from three or four wide down the backstretch then made a five
wide bid on the final turn and made a mid track rally in the stretch to be second best. SUEZ was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a rail bid
on the final turn and tipped out to the two or three path in the stretch for a late run to be up for third place money. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY sprinted to a
pressured lead then was overtaken at the seven sixteenths pole and tired. STREET ART pressed the pace from the inside to the final turn then vied for the
lead to mid turn and weakened. I WILL STAND vied for the lead from three wide on the first turn then retreated. GREY ROGUE raced near the back and
was not a factor.

TAKE HER AWAY tracked the leaders down the backstretch and made a five wide bid on the turn and drove past the leaders in late stretch and drew clear.
WONDERRAND raced slightly off the pace from five wide and took the lead at the three sixteenths pole but was caught in late stretch but stayed on to be
second best. LADY CHERYL'S SONG pressed the pace from the inside to the turn then fell back but made a rebid by cutting the corner into the stretch and
missed the place. HILLBILLY RISEN raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch and moved up on the turn to make a late bid to improve her position.
COAL DANCER vied for the lead from three wide to the top of the stretch and weakened. SHEZAPERFECTDREAM raced near the back to the turn then
moved up slightly on the turn, tipped out to six wide in upper stretch and showed mild late interest. MY LUCKY BREAK raced off the pace from three wide to
the three sixteenths and tired. WIND OF WAR showed little. FIVE LEAF CLOVER sprinted to a pressured lead to mid turn and tired. WICKED SAINT was

Footnotes
THE BOSS SOSS stalked the pace from three wide to the final turn then moved in slightly to engage the leader in the final sixteenths, matched strides but
was able to edge away late to prevail. DOCTORED DEAL went to the front to set the pace through the final turn then tried to fend off the outside rival in the
final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly in the final jumps. BOY CHARLIE saved ground around the first turn then moved between horses at the half mile
marker and moved back inside around the final turn but was empty in the stretch run. REDDINGANDLEE raced off the pace down the backstretch then
made a three wide bid on the turn but finished evenly. SONYA KNOWS BETTER was allowed to settle down the backstretch then launched his bid from five
wide at the five sixteenths pole but flattened out. PITCH AND RUN tracked the leaders from the inside to the three furlong marker and gave way. CATCHIN
DRAMA was off slow and remained back. CHARLIE'S PARADE sprinted away from the gate to pressed the pace to the five sixteenths pole and was done.

leader at the three sixteenths pole, matched strides outside of SPHEROID to the wire and was just up. SPHEROID went to the front to set the pace, was
headed at the three sixteenths pole and matched strides inside of MR. FOUR SEVENS to the wire but was out kicked late. MR B QUIET raced in the middle
of the pack around the first turn then moved up from three wide down the backstretch, made a run at the top two on the turn but was no match. INTO

tipped back inside around the final turn but failed to menace. DEALIN' STELEN was unhurried while saving ground to no avail. STEPHEN'S ANSWER raced

Footnotes
PICKIN ANA GRINNIN went to the front to an unchallenged lead to set the pace and was kept to task in the stretch drive. R T'S GEM prompted the pace
from the two path, couldn't catch because winner too tuff. CRYSTAL D'ORO was allowed to settle near the back then made a four wide bid at the three
furlong marker bot be best of the rest. DIXIE FARMER raced off the pace on the inside, made a mild bid on the backstretch but flattened out. SUE'S LITTLE
ZING saved ground throughout and improved position late. MEGANS MILLIONS was forwardly placed around the first turn and retreated. BLUE RIDGE
QUEEN bobbled at the start but recovered to stalk the pace, made a four wide bid a the three furlong marker but weakened. BITSY C C LIL GIRL trailed the
field around the first turn and made a mild bid on the backstretch but was never a threat. BE A BANDIT raced five wide on the first turn then settled near the
back and was never a factor.

fell back on the turn but made a rebid in the stretch to save the place. GRACE'S SOLDIER stalked the pace from the four path down the backstretch, moved
out to five wide in upper stretch for a rally but was not enuf. ACELA EXPRESS was forwardly placed off the rail through the turn and showed late effort but
was outfinished. KANCANCUTIE pressed the pace from the two path and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole, edged away but was eclipsed in the final
yards to be denied. TERRI GOT A FRIEND was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack on the inside then made a three wide bid on the final turn for a
late run but was too late. BRIDLED UP raced off the pace around the first turn made a rail bid into the final turn and cut the corner into the stretch but was
empy. BELL PEPPER was unhurried and not a factor. OUR HALLIE lost action into the first turn then saved ground to no avail. PIECE OF ME reared
