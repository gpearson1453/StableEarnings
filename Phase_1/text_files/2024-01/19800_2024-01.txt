Footnotes
MYGLORYBEE bumped with an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path into the turn, swung out to the six path approaching the five sixteenths pole,
rallied widest to bid at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MACHO BEANIE prompted two wide, subtly failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart from the
three path entering the lane, sustained a chase to offer a rebid at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked. HARDLY ABLE tracked along the inside, chased in
the two path while hanging on his left lead through the lane, bid for show along with an outer foe at the wire and prevailed. GEORGE ALLEN bumped with
an inner foe upon leaving the gates, set the pace inside of a prompting foe, inched free of that one entering the lane, held through midstretch, but gave in at
the sixteenth pole and got nailed for show while dead-heating for fourth. THE BOSS SOSS chased from midpack in the four to five path, then offered a mild
kick to miss reaching show and dead-heat for fourth. TAMBOURINE STAR made little impact in the five to four path. CHARCO chased three wide, but gave
way in the four path and between horses in upper stretch. STAR REDEMPTION laid off of the pace in the two path and faded.

Footnotes
SONOFASHIP prompted in the four path, vied with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, cleared that one in upper stretch, shifted out before
meeting an inner challenge entering the final sixteenth and held. BRITTANY'S DREAM lacked speed in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the
lane, shifted in and rallied between horses, offered a bid inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole but was kept at bay. BENJI STAR broke slowly, laid off of
the pace in the three to five path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, ran on to vie for show in the closing stages and prevailed. CAUSEWAY
BENNY tracked in the five to six path, chased between horses hanging on his left lead through the lane, vied for show with an outer bidder late but missed.
HE'S JUST LUCKY prompted between the top pair early on, chased those rivals from the three to four path around the turn and kept on. WONDER
WARRIOR got rank after breaking slow, trailed along the inside and rallied up the rail. MIDNIGHT HALO failed to factor. BOBBY TWO SHOT'S pulled
between horses early on, checked among foes at the half mile pole, chased from the two path around the turn, shifted between horses nearing midstretch
and lacked a bid. SPRINGTOWN pursued in the three path and between horses, but gave way. KEV MAN laid off of the pace in the five path, drifted
inwardly in upper stretch and made little impact. ACHROMEDOUTCAT set the pace inside of the eventual winner and in the two path around the turn, then
weakened in upper stretch. JAYDE'S BANDIT chased along the inside, checked leaving the half mile pole and lost position into the turn, then continued to
retreat.

Footnotes
TARIFA took contact from an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four path perched outside of the leader, prompted in the three path down the backstretch
before bidding at the three furlong pole, forged a brief advantage at the five sixteenths marker before getting outkicked by an inner bidder nearing the lane,
sustained a chase while shifting inside of that drifting out passing the furlong grounds, kept on to rebid entering the final sixteenth and drove past.
STANDOUTSENSATION stalked along the inside, bid through a vacated rail at the five sixteenths pole to forge an advantage from an outer TARIFA nearing
the lane, inched clear before shifting out and across that ones path in midstretch, but met her counterpart's inner rebid with a sixteenth to go and was
bested. BA DEE YAH settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked two wide and between horses around the far turn, gained show shifting out to the four
path entering the lane and fended off an outer pursuer through the final furlong. FLOATING BEAUTY broke out and bumped a rival at the start, raced at the
rear in the two to three path around the first turn, then in the four to five path around the far turn and ran on mildly but was denied show. SPIN THE BREEZE
checked back nearing the seven furlong pole to pursue from midpack in the two to three path, chased in the three to four path around the far turn and
yielded between horses entering the lane. LATE NITE LIZZIE raced at the rear along the inside and made little impact. PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD shifted out
at the start, set the pace in the three to two path, got headed between bidders turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
SOSUA SUMMER stalked in the two path, took aim on the clear leader from the three path in upper stretch, gradually closed in to offer a bid passing the
sixteenth pole, sparred through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. JUST MIGHT set a clear pace in the two path, maintained a clear margin through
midstretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge leaving the sixteenth pole, gamely clung to an advantage through the late stages but got nailed at the wire.
MINNESOTA READY laid off of the pace in the four to five path, rallied to bear down on the top pair in the final sixteenth but needed more late. SWIFT AS I
AM racked in the three to four path and gave way. EVAN SING broke a step slow, raced at the rear along the inside and never got involved.

HALL OF FAME stalked along the inside, moved prompt inside of the leader passing the eleven sixteenths pole, came under coaxing to secure inside
position while inching forward to spark a duel approaching the far turn, vied under urging around that bend, gained an advantage nearing the lane, drew off
under driving pressure through midstretch and was put to wraps with seventy yards to go. SWEETALKINGBOURBON tracked in the two to three path,
advanced in the four path around the far turn, ran on while hanging on his left lead go claim place from a tiring foe leaving the furlong grounds, then fended
off an outer pursuer through the late stages. SAN SIRO lacked speed in the three path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, then stayed on willingly
to gain show at the sixteenth pole before being kept at bay for place. NIGHT OUT broke outwardly and was off slow, laid off of the pace in the five path
around the first turn, tucked to the inside entering the far turn before improving position, but failed to threaten through the lane. KISSTHEMOON was slow
into stride, trailed in the three path and passed tired rivals. FUNNYFLAME set the pace in the two path, sparred with an inner prompter into the far turn,
proved no match for that one entering the lane and weakened. RIDE FOR SUL pressed outside of the top pair early on, but chased them entering the
backstretch and readily weakened around the far turn. POPWEISER pursued from the two path but was through early.

Footnotes
GHALIA PRINCESS stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped to take aim outside of the leader entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, failed to gain even
terms through midstretch, yet kept on to sustain the duel in the final sixteenth and narrowly forged an advantage at the wire. MOTOWN DYNAMIC set the
pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge in upper stretch, gamely maintained an advantage into the final sixteenth, but was nailed at the
wire. HARBOR SPRINGS pursued from midpack along the inside, sustained a grinding charge to edge show entering the final sixteenth and held.
BEELIEVE HER tracked in the four to three path before being floated to the five path by an inner rival while inching closer entering the lane, but was herded
wider by that one in upper stretch, ran on to gain show nearing midstretch, but lost that position to an inner foe in the final furlong. OH MY MIA lacked speed
in the two path, shifted out to the four path into the turn, tipped from the five to six path in upper stretch and stayed on mildly. PLUM TRICKY stalked three
wide, pressed two wide around the turn, but yielded entering the lane in the four path before drifting out subtly in upper stretch. YES INDEED broke slowly,
recovered to track from midpack in the five to four path into the turn, inched closer before getting floated back to the five path entering the lane, and gave
way. ABSOLUTE MIRACLE lunged into the outer part of the starting gate when it sprung, pursued from midpack two to three wide and between horses,
then failed to factor. BELLA CRUELLA lacked speed in the five to six path and made little impact. CASBY trailed in the t wo path and was outrun. NEW
WOMAN chased close up two wide and between horses, but wilted at the three furlong pole.

BEE DANCER prompted along the inside before stalking into the turn, split the leaders passing the three sixteenths pole to bid while hanging on his left
lead, forged an advantage before changing over entering the final sixteenth and inched clear. CORNISHMAN bumped with rivals on both sides and dropped
back at the start, trailed early on, advanced in the four path around the turn before fanning to the six to seven path entering upper stretch, rallied to close in
on the top pair late and reached place at the wire. EXPLORATION tracked from midpack in the four path before launching an advance into the turn, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, sparred with an inner bidder leaving the furlong grounds, but was bested by that one then got nailed for place. HIGGINS
BOAT tracked along the inside, took the turn in the two path, tipped five wide and between horses entering the lane, ran on within striking range in upper
stretch but leveled off. LAST ATTACK brushed with an inner rival at the start, set the pace in the two path around the turn, but yielded to an outer pair of
bidders in midstretch. SABI chased in the three path, floated to the six path entering the lane and lacked a bid. AIR IT OUT bumped with an outer rival at the
start, stalked in the three path, bid along with an outer foe turning for home, but chased in upper stretch and faded. CASCADE CRUISER made little impact

CREATIVE CAIRO bumped with an inner rival at the start before being brushed and put to tight quarters shortly after, raced at the rear along the inside,
altered course out from behind troubled rivals turning for home before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, the offered a wide rally to take aim on the
top pair entering the final furlong, drove past them at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. JOIN THE DANCE stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the
leader around the far turn, bid and gained an advantage in the four path entering the lane, led as rivals menaced on either side leaving midstretch, got
bested by an outer bidder entering the final sixteenth and fended off an inner foe for place. LOVELY PRINCESS settled off of the pace in the two path,
launched a rally splitting foes in the three path in upper stretch, progressed to bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked and denied
place. TUFANI laid off of the pace in the three path, but was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe while jostled among rivals at the five sixteenths pole,
then sustained a chase through the lane. TRYINMYHEARTOUT rated at the rear two wide, gained in the five path entering the far turn, bumped an inner
rival while progressing turning for home, straightened into the lane within striking range, but flattened out. SWOONATRA bumped with an outer rival at the

WEST OMAHA tracked three wide, bid turning for home, gained an advantage nearing midstretch and drove clear through the final furlong. PERFECT
SHOT tracked along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, chased behind the leaders and in the two path in upper stretch, split foes in the
three path in the final furlong and edged place late. SISTINA CHAPEL settled off of the pace in the four path, ranged up four wide turning for home, but
failed to change leads and only managed to chase through the lane, then narrowly prevailed for show at the wire. MISS CODE WEST prompted two wide,
vied along with an outer bidder turning for home, proved no match to that one in midstretch, gave way and lost show at the wire. ACCOMMODATE EVA
showed the way along the inside, got headed by an outer pair of pressers turning for home and weakened in upper stretch. NORISKIT NOBISCUIT trailed in
the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
STRONG QUALITY dictated terms via a loose margin in the two path, shifted out to the center of the track leading into the lane, dug in to resist an outer
challenge leaving midstretch and held tenaciously. BEATBOX stalked along the inside, claimed place before shifting out entering the lane, took aim outside
of the leader entering the final furlong, bid and dueled through the late stages but was denied. RISING EMPIRE broke slowly, trailed in the two path, gained
in the five path into the far turn, progressed tucking to the three path around that bend, moved out along with the rest entering the lane, ran on among foes
to gain show in midstretch and held that position. DUKE OF CARTHANIA laid off of the pace in the four to three path around the bends, got floated wide
entering the lane, ran on to offer a mild bid for show in the final furlong but was kept at bay. ENGLISH TAVERN tracked in the three path, chased two wide
and between horses around the far turn, then gave way. PROTONIC POWER laid off of the pace along the inside, lacked a response to urging around the
far turn and tired.

SAUDI CROWN dictated terms with an uncontested advantage in the two path, drew away under strong hand urging in upper stretch, felt a right handed
crop strike leaving the furlong grounds and was geared down with a sixteenth to go. RED ROUTE ONE tracked along the inside, chased while vying for
place through midstretch, edged that position while flopping back to his left lead nearing the final sixteenth and held. HAPPY AMERICAN raced at the rear
along the inside, crept closer in the five path and outside of rivals around the far turn, sustained progress to bid for place in midstretch, but was denied
reaching that position. FIVE STAR GENERAL stalked outside of the leader and from the four path, pursued from the three path around the far turn but
quickly failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, then yielded place between rivals in the final furlong. CONFIDENCE GAME laid off of the pace in
the four path, pursued two wide and between horses around the far turn, and lacked a bid. SMILE HAPPY tracked in the four path, chased outside of rivals
around the far turn, then gave way between foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TRACK PHANTOM showed the way in the two path, led from an outer presser around the far turn, shrugged off that mild bidder entering the lane, drew
clear under a drive and held sway. NASH prompted inside of the pace setter before shifting outside of that one entering the backstretch, pressed from the
three path, came under a drive to sustain pressure with three furlongs to go, but was turned away entering the lane, then kept on well to hold place. LAT
LONG tracked in the three to four path around the first turn, pursued in the four path around the far turn, then chased willingly, flopped back to his left lead
nearing the final sixteenth and was best of the rest. ETHAN ENERGY broke a step slow, tracked in the two path while tugging in the bit around the first turn,
then chased the top pair from the inside around the far turn and weakened through the lane. TIZZY INDY trailed along the inside and made little impact.
CAN GROUP lacked speed two wide and was outrun.
