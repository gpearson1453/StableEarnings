Footnotes
MORNING ANGEL secured inside position to far turn, angled out while full of run and ran on in the final furlong to go well clear at the wire. CELESTIAL
SPIN saved ground to far turn, angled out, led in the stretch while no match to the wire. RIBALDRY (IRE) quickly from the gate chased to far turn, and
weakened to the show spot. CLARA BELLE wide run into first turn while never a real menace throughout. STATE OF GRACE trailed to far turn and only
passed a couple from far turn. DOMITIA LUCILLA took over first turn, led to the half with nothing left far turn. CLASSY DREAM raced between horses on
the backstretch, dropped back readily.

Footnotes
LASERJET was boxed in on the run run down the backstretch and shuffled back, split foes into the far turn and stretch to grind away to the wire. GIRL
GOODBYE speed to the front stayed on to deep stretch but could not last in the late going. PITTORE D'ORO never far back to the half with a steady run for
show spot in the final furlong. FAST N HAPPY steadied along into the first turn with no room, angled out into the far turn while going evenly thereafter.
BOLTS BABE secured good position off rail to the far turn with no response in the stretch run. LIMANI never reached contention throughout.
PLEDGULATIONS had an outside chase to the half but gave way readily from the far turn.

CUSP secured perfect position to the turn, rallied in earnest in the late going while along in time under stout handling. UNCLE WILLIAM reluctant to load,
had a quick start, dueled to stretch, dug in gamely while outgamed in the late going. ACCIDENT had an awkward start with no speed to the turn, angled
widest into the stretch and rallied along nicely to finish up well. FIVE STAR G MAN raced along evenly throughout with no late kick in the stretch.
YANGARRA between duel to the turn saved ground in the stretch but wilted in the late going. BAD BOY FOR LIFE never menaced throughout. PAPA
ALDEN no speed between horses to the turn and could not keep up in the stretch run. FREAKY Z inside speed to the turn but weakened through the stretch
run. STREET FIGHT never factored from the turn. I'M HIM was antsy in the gate, raced between horses to the turn and could not keep up.

VOTE NO was unhurried from the gate, ran on nicely with confidence to the turn, rallied into the stretch, kept on while ridden out to the wire in impressive
fashion. LET'S GO MARK had quick start from outside to the front stayed to the stretch while no match for the winner and well clear of the rest. JOE
SHIESTY chased leaders to the turn with nothing left and settled for the show spot. TAGLIATELLE had an inside run to the turn, angled out into the stretch
with no gain in the final furlong. QUARRYMEN always trailed throughout while seemly overmatched.
