Footnotes
TWEET AWAY ROBIN chased the pace outside LUNITA, overtook that one approaching the sixteenth pole, was under encouragement and drew out.
LUNITA sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, failed to repel the winner and was best of the others. SHINELIKEADIAMOND , a forward
factor along the inner rail, eased out leaving the turn, drifted four wide in upper stretch and weakened. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY , in the two path around the
turn, was taken to the inner rail in upper stretch and passed tired foes. ILLUSION OF HOPE raced along the inner rail on the turn, angled to the three path in
upper stretch and gave way. MY SUPER SALLY , outrun, circled the turn three wide then drifted to the five path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GREAT DAYS AHEAD , between rivals early, steadied briefly nearing the half, dropped in and advance mid turn, came back out three wide and moved up
to engage the leaders in upper stretch, forged clear under a drive in mid stretch and was kept alert to the wire. HAMPDEN LANE prompted the pace while
saving ground, moved through along the inside to challenge soon into the lane, dueled briefly then kept on willingly to be second best. CASINO TRICKS
grabbed command early and set the pace off the inside, had his heels clipped near the four and a half furlong marker, was joined from both sides in upper
stretch, could not kick on with the winner heading to mid stretch and weakened. THE GREAT GAZOO , towards the inside, steadied to avoid a fallen rider
nearing the half mile marker, steadied again avoiding TUNA N STAMPS near the five sixteenths, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. HAP'S
VICTORY steadied off heels early on, raced outside rivals nearing the half, was carried out by a rider less horse leaving the far turn, was floated out again
near the five sixteenths, shifted in some in upper stretch but failed to recover. PRINS FIRE rated close up between foes early then lost his rider when
clipping the heels of the leader and stumbling past the four and a half furlong marker. TUNA N STAMPS , four then three wide prompting the pace outside
CASINO TRICKS, fell when sustaining an injury near the five sixteenths then was euthanized on the track. There was a stewards' inquiry into the incidents
concerning PRINS FIRE and TUNA N STAMPS. No action was taken.

FORGOTTEN GIFT hugged the inner rail, advanced inside LENZMAGNETTA to secure command leaving the turn, opened up in mid stretch and lasted
under pressure. GOLDEN CHARM stalked the pace behind horses, swung to the four path entering the stretch and rallied. DIANE lacked speed, raced
inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. REES , unhurried, drifted very wide turning for home. LENAMAGNETTA showed speed, was kept in the
two path on the turn and gave way. SHE'S ALL MONEY , three deep prompting the pace around the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
A C EXPRESSWAY , well placed settled towards the inside and off of a contested pace, steadily progressed two wide past the three eighths, edged up
behind rivals entering the lane, shifted in to take advantage of an inside path, forged clear leaving the three sixteenths, remained on his left lead and
widened under a drive. CASANOVA KITTEN , four to five wide, took closer order approaching the stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch and churned on
to nab the place. BY ITS ABSENCE was nudged up leaving the chute then emerged in a battle to the inside of RUNNING RIVER, carried that scrum around
the turn then entered the lane two wide while still battling, could not match strides with the winner heading to mid stretch, kept on with effort through the final
furlong and ceded the place late. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY came out at the break bumping a rival, corrected and rated off the pace while saving ground, took
closer order mid turn, angled out three wide nearing the lane, altered well out in the track for the final furlong and continued on trying to the wire. BIG
ROWDY DAN , bumped and in tight at the break, recovered and raced three wide between rivals early, angled in for the drive, made a mild run in mid
stretch then flattened out. TRASH TALKIN LARRY lagged far back, raced three wide into the stretch and got past tired ones. RUNNING RIVER got involved
in a duel to the outside of BY ITS ABSENCE in the opening three sixteenths, sparred on a slim lead nearing the lane then tired through the final furlong.
FORTUNE'S FOOL stalked the duelers while off the inside, failed to kick on under a hearty ride mid turn, faltered in upper stretch, drifted out and was eased
late.

Footnotes
DALINAR broke alertly and immediately went clear, set the pace along the inner rail, remained on his left lead until well inside the eighth pole and widened
under intermittent urging. BRUDER bore in leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside the winner and faded. COME RAIN OR SHINE , pinched
back leaving the starting gate, steadied in traffic near the half mile pole, steadied lacking room near the three eighths pole, raced along the inner rail in the
stretch and finished willingly. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND bore out leaving the starting gate, advanced along the inner rail leaving the turn and drifted out
approaching the eighth pole when tiring. POPS HARPER chased the pace in the three path, swung four wide leaving the turn and gave way. VILALUZ , four
deep chasing the pace, gave way in the drive. SQUARE SLICE , unhurried, was no factor.

JESS'S GYPSY GIRL , four then three wide disputing the pace outside CATCH THE KITTEN, took control near the three sixteenths, drifted in a bit then
widened under a drive. CATCH THE KITTEN moved up to the inside of rivals leaving the chute then engage the winner for the lead, dueled into and around
the turn, could not match strides leaving the three sixteenths, shifted out for the final furlong and kept on with good effort to the wire. ALWAYS FORWARD
settled off the pace and removed from the rail, edged up four wide mid turn, angled six wide for the drive and churned on between rivals to nab the show.
POLICE WOMAN drafted back to last in the opening furlong, dropped in and settled, came off the inside mid turn, swung seven wide for the drive, advanced
outside a host of runners in mid stretch then flattened out late. FASHIONISTA , four wide stalking the embattled leaders, was under pressure into the
stretch, wandered outward despite efforts with the left crop and came up empty. DESTINED TO DANCE rated behind foes leaving the far turn, angled out
into the lane and lacked a bid. MAIL CALL , three wide between rivals pursuing the early pace, stayed in range to upper stretch then weakened through the
final furlong. MARTHARITA , well placed inside, weakened through the drive. HARPER'S DO , two wide between runners with early chase, faltered past the
three eighths.

Footnotes
OXIDE raced forwardly in the three path between horses down the backstretch and around the turn, closed outside PARADISE PRIDE the final sixteenth of
a mile and was up late. PARADISE PRIDE set the pace in the two path, went clear in mid stretch, drifted out, switched to his left lead approaching the
sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. ACE NINE NINE hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace to mid stretch and weakened. EKATI'S VERVE lacked
speed, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, tired. EDDIE THE
GREAT , a brief factor early, gave way entering the turn and steadied on a rival's heels near the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
TENEBRIS relaxed four wide stalking the pace, moved up past the five sixteenths then bid four wide between runners into the lane, battled past the three
sixteenths, gained a slim lead a furlong out, responded to strong handling and eagerly drew out through the final sixteenth. JEOPARDY JAMES , brushed
and off slowly, regrouped and settled off the pace, angled out nearing the turn and commenced a run, quickly gained five wide past the five sixteenths, bid
four deep soon after, dueled on near even terms nearing mid stretch, could not kick on with the winner to his inside but continued with good energy to gain
the place. GOING TO THE LEAD quickly went clear, set the pace off the inside, dug in when joined mid turn, fought on to the inside of three rivals past the
three sixteenths and kept on with solid effort to the wire. BACKNTHEWOODS prompted the pace three wide outside GOING TO THE LEAD, moved to apply
serious pressure mid turn, dueled between foes into the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. MAGIC MULE secured the rail early on, rated off the
pace, eased out past the five sixteenths, shifted further out in upper stretch but lacked a solid finish. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE rated two wide, edged up
outside a rival mid turn then failed to quicken in upper stretch. THE KHOZAN ONE broke inward and brushed a rival, corrected and rushed up, stalked
towards the rail, was under pressure mid turn and faded.
