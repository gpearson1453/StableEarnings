Footnotes
SISTER COUSIN vied for the early lead on the outside, then went on to set the pace on the inside, drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove
much the best. PROBLEMS ABOUND chased the early pace and made a three wide move on the turn but flattened out in the drive, held place award.
GYPSY WANDERER was well placed on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and ran on willingly to best the rest. DANCING BEAUTY was
bumped at the start, then vied for the early lead and then stalked the pace two wide by the half mile marker and dropped back on the turn and weakened.
UNIVERSAL DESIGN broke out and bumped a rival at the start, reserved early, three wide on the turn and swung out five wide leaving the turn but had no
rally. THIRSTY FOR LOVE was settled on the inside and failed to respond.

DIXIE CANNONBALL set a pressured pace and was in the two path on the turn, came four wide off the turn and had a long drive through the lane and
prevailed late to prove best in a gutsy score. HOPE FOR GOLD pressed the winner three wide, made a three wide bid to go on even terms by the quarter
pole, then was floated five wide off the turn, then dueled through the lane but missed late. DROSSELMOON was well placed early on the inside, fell back a
tad nearing the quarter pole, then was slowly gaining late but needed more. NOBLE JON stalked the pace and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but
hung in the drive. MERU was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. AZZARO STEEL
was off slowly, settled back towards the inside, then passed the tiring rivals late. VIOLENT PASS was settled early, three wide on the turn, came five wide
off the turn and had no rally. JETTIN OUT chased the pace on the inside and weakened. POCOPSON STATION was settled back early, three wide on the
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
THROWBACK set a pressured pace on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and responded well to draw off to prove much the best under a hand ride.
DISCO DAISY was well placed on the inside, waited for room and tipped out leaving the turn and had aim but proved to be no match for the winner while
clearly second best. CELTIC REVIVAL pressed the pace in between rivals, then came three wide off the turn and faded, held the show award. LUCKY
BREEZE was rated on the inside, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and improved late, missed show award. UPTOWN SERAPHINA tracked the pace
five wide and weakened in the lane. MY SWEET SUMMER tracked the pace four wide and weakened. EMPRESS PALPATINE pressed the pace three wide
and came four wide into the lane and was empty in the drive. SIMPLE JUSTICE was not a factor. MARPIN failed to menace while wide.

Footnotes
PRACTICAL SENSE was void of early speed, began to unwind entering the far turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, then was guided to the far
outside and closed full of run on the far outside and edge away late under a drive. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was rated early, made a five wide move on the turn
and was six wide off the turn continued willingly but was outfinished by the winner. FAST FREEZE KAZ set a pressured pace early towards the inside, drew
clear by the quarter pole and then faded late, held show award. NORTHWOODS pressed the early pace three wide, then was shuffled back and came four
wide off the turn and ran on to just miss the show award. DAVID'S TUITION was settled early, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out late.
DIAMOND HEIST was settled early from between rivals, then split rivals while making a middle move by the half mile marker but weakened. ROCKIN THE
PALACE was settled early on the outside, made a five wide move on the far turn but weakened in the drive. NIEUWENDYK tracked the pace from the inside
and tired. NECCO was four wide into the first turn and pressed the pace four wide and then was through after a half mile.

BACK EAST was settled early towards the inside, eased out on the turn and came five wide off the turn, then moved in to closed full of run to draw away in
the final sixteenth to prove best, driving. SPORTING THE GOLD vied for the early lead three wide, then made a bid and shook clear off the turn, but was
headed by the sixteenth marker and proved to be no match for the winner late, clearly second best. WATERMELON CRUSH was settled back early,
advanced on the inside on the turn and came three wide off turn and had a late gain to gain the show award. LLOYD tracked the pace three wide and
lacked the needed bid losing the show award late. HE AROSE was taken back early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally on the far outside.
LOUIE'S HEAT was reserved early and three wide on the turn and had no rally. Z MYSTIQUE pressed the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but
came up empty in the drive. GEM DANCER vied for the lead on the inside and faltered.
