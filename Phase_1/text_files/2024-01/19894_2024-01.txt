JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA settled outside, took over on the final turn quickly extending margin then continued to pull away driving. LOST LUGGAGE far back
early inside, advanced very wide and finished strongly for the place. ROYAL PARTY dropped back outside then closed well to gain the show late. TRUE
PHENOMENON stalked the pacesetter outside, was asked for run on the final turn then proved empty in the stretch. CIVIL NOTION led inside, moved clear
before half a mile then faded on the final turn. DIXIE GROOVE trailed for three quarters then passed tiring rivals. COLLECTIVE GOLD saved ground behind
the pacesetters and gave way readily. ONTHISHARVESTMOON forced the pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

MODERN MIDAS chased five wide down the backstretch, bid to the front in midstretch and gradually edged away. ROCKIN FREEBEE far back early,
moved extremely wide on the turn and stretch and closed well. CHIP'S FRIEND made a menacing four wide bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.
CHARGER raced off the leaders between foes and continued willingly. HOMETOWN HERO broke a step slowly, moved wide on the turn, angled inside
through the stretch. BOYS AND BULLETS dropped off the pace outside and lacked a solid rally. DISCO DEVIL alternated for the lead to midstretch and
weakened. BOOM BOOM KABOOM prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and faded. EDDIEMUSH raced wide off the leaders and faltered in the
stretch. GIVE ME MY MONEY urged early along the inside then gave way readily. UPFOR PAROLE saved ground and weakened steadily. MIL
DOSCIENTOS was hard ridden to the front between rivals then stopped abruptly.

MAXIMUS MERIDIUS dueled three wide, took after when ready before half a mile, stayed wide and pulled away to a decisive score. BALI AMOUR far
behind for half a mile, bid inside and finished strongly to gain place. TWILIGHT DANCER was well placed wide behind the dueling leaders then flattened out
in the stretch. SHARP TONES angled very wide on the turn, bid then proved empty late. CAPO dropped back early outside and lacked a rally. RUMAWAY
lagged far behind inside then caught stopping rivals. KELLY'S KIDZ prompted the pace between foes for half a mile and gave way. RUBYS FLASH hustled
to a narrow advantage inside opening quarter and stopped midway on the turn.

and stayed on well in the stretch. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE dueled three wide for command, dueled on the turn, dug in to midstretch and weakened late.
DATHOSS raced close up on the inside, moved up between rivals on the turn, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, dueled and weakened late. QUICK
RETURN raced off the pace, chased inside on the turn, raced evenly in the lane and lacked room in traffic near the sixteenth marker. FATIH dueled
between rivals for the early lead, dueled on the turn and tired in the final sixteenth. JEBOLOGIST was off a bit slow and bumped, raced three wide off the
pace and did not factor. FAST BOB raced two wide off the pace and was outrun. BIG BROWN SHOES dueled inside for the early lead, chased on the turn
