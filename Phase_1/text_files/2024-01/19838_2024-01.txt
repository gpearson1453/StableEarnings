Footnotes
ARMS APRIORITY went to the front, drove clear, was carried out entering the home stretch, came back and drove clear before the wire. SABERFIGHT
pressed the pace, came through on the inside around the final turn, took the lead, drifted out entering the home stretch and couldn't match strides with the
winner late. LITTLE Z void of early speed, made a late inside bid and proved no match for the top two. GOTTEMINABIND lacked early speed, came around
the final turn six wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. CAT B CAUSE pressed the early pace and faded. GYPSY JACKPOT raced near the middle of the
field, came around the second turn five wide, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. MOR KISSES was an early factor, raced outside around the first turn
and faded. ZIPPING MOLLY raced within contention, came around the final turn on the inside and made a steady retreat. BRIDLED UP raced in the middle
of the pack and faded. DARING DARIAN always raced near the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #1 SABERFIGHT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST #7 ARMS APRIORITY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

PRADO'S PRIORITY sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and proved much the best. GRAMI'S BOY raced within contention, came around the
turn on the outside, proved no match for the winner and was just up for second. RUNTODAY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was
outfinished for second. SUEZ void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SEEHOSS raced within striking distance, finished inside and lacked
a kick. UPTOWN HUSTLER raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. LODE OF BLARNEY lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn
and showed little. WESLEYAN pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and faded.

striking distance, made a late bid, racing five wide, finished willingly and missed. LAURI'S WISH pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, racing
between rivals around the final turn and was outfinished by the top two. CLASSIC BET showed early speed and weakened on the inside. SAMMY
