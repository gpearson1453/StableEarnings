Footnotes
AVENTAPP closest in pursuit in the two path entering the turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, put away inner rival in upper stretch and
remained clear to the wire. NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, tracked three wide leaving the backstretch, moved into the two path then
split rivals at the quarter pole, moved out in the stretch and chased willingly through the final furlong but could not reach the winner. DOLLY MAY (IRE)
steered to the inside racing near the back early, trailed while saving ground around the bend, steered out at the top of the stretch and rallied to gain the
show. ANKYRAH got put in tight between rivals early, stalked along the inside, hugged the rail through the turn, ran into brief traffic behind CORPORAL
VIOLETTE (IRE) in upper stretch, altered out into the clear and got edged for the show. RED DIAMOND reserved in the beginning and steered to the inside
then went outside a rival, rounded the bend in the three path, came five wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and improved position. DE
JORIA raced three deep towards the rear then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, navigated the turn two then three wide, ran into traffic and altered out
in upper stretch and failed to menace in the late stages. LEOPARDESS (GB) hit the gate, chased between rivals near the back then moved inside for the
turn, saved ground to the stretch, then tipped out and lacked a rally. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) showed good early foot from inside, pressured by the
winner at the quarter pole, fought into the lane then yielded in upper stretch and gave way. MISS COMMANDER stalked three deep and weakened down
the lane.

Footnotes
FIFTY CINCO took control early while a bit off the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, led two wide through the far turn, put to right handed urging in
the final furlong and drew away. SURE PROSPECT stalked between rivals in the two path, moved over to the rail on the far turn, put in a mild rail bid in
upper stretch, never found the needed late response to overtake the winner but stayed on to outfinish I GOT A GUY for the place. I GOT A GUY forwardly
placed two to three wide around the first turn, took aim three wide entering the stretch, lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch and got edged for
second. TORLEIF stalked three to four wide around both turns, asked left handed entering the lane and weakened. AVIATOR NATION stumbled a bit
leaving the gate, chased four then five wide on the clubhouse turn, remained wide into the second bend, entered the lane three wide and never responded
to urging. NUMBER ONE SON broke a step slow, stalked along the inside, started to weaken on the far turn and tired down the lane. RUNNING FOR COSI
broke a step slow from outside, trailed five, four, then three wide on the clubhouse turn, moved down to the rail on the backstretch, tipped out to the three
path still at the back on the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BRONKO NAGURSKI tossed his head at the start to come away slow, began to climb shortly after, advanced three then four wide around the turn, got
floated out into the stretch while challenging for the lead, lugged in and bumped MORE TRY near the eighth pole, dueled with SNEAK A SMILE while
continuing to drift in, forced the runner-up to steady late and edged away. SNEAK A SMILE tracked along the rail then shifted to the two path at the quarter
pole, cut back inside leaving the bend, launched a bid at the top of the lane and took over briefly, lost command to BRONKO NAGURSKI at the eighth pole,
dueled through the final furlong but got put in tight and had to steady approaching the wire. RHYTHEM ON STAGE laid off the pace on the inside, tipped out
at the quarter pole, angled out further in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. MORE TRY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, bid from
outside at the quarter pole, drifted out into the lane, fought between rivals and got bumped by BRONKO NAGURSKI with a furlong remaining, had his path
taken and steadied midstretch and was not persevered with late. ANTONSEN dueled for the lead from outside, cleared inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole,
challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch, got crowded between rivals in the final furlong and weakened. THANK YOU
HONEY sat off the pace outside a rival, dropped back two wide on the turn and had little left for the stretch run. REMI OR NOT dueled from inside, lost
touch with the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and tired. THE RIDER ABOARD SNEAK A SMILE LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST BRONKO NAGURSKI FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LATE IN THE STRETCH. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INVOLVING THE SAME MATTER AND AN EARLIER INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH RUN. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH BRONKO NAGURSKI LUGGED IN AND MADE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH MORE TRY AND CAUSED SNEAK A SMILE TO TAKE UP LATE,
NEITHER INCIDENT WARRANTED A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ROSE sped clear to take control, showed the way along the inside through the turn, roused and asked left handed with a furlong left to run and
stayed clear to the wire. NOKIE got bumped into outer rival at the start, forwardly placed up the backstretch, coaxed along two wide around the bend,
chased after CRIMSON ROSE determinedly down the stretch but had to settle for second best. IRISH WAHINE got knocked in the hindquarters leaving the
gate, stalked the lone leader outside a rival to the turn, rounded the bend three wide and weakened in the final furlong while holding the show. A NEW
PEACE tracked along the rail into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend and lacked further response. SHERLYN GO GO brushed the gate,
chased five wide into the turn, trailed four wide into the stretch and improved position while failing to threaten. BELLA RENELLA chased four then five wide
on the turn and weakened. KEEN LADY broke out and bumped NOKIE, chased at the back off the inside, went two wide into the turn then angled to the rail
and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
TAPALO vied for the lead between rivals then dueled inside EXPLOSIVELY into the turn, shook free midway around the bend, opened up a comfortable into
the stretch, kept to task into the final sixteenth and coasted in near the wire. BIG GAIN chased along the inside then between rivals into the turn, moved
back to the rail around the bend, finished willingly through the lane but could not threaten the winner. CITADINO bothered from outside at the start and
trailed early, advanced on the inside through the turn, stayed on the fence in the lane and summoned a mild rally to earn the show honors. BOWTIE BOYS
bumped inner rival at the start, raced in range three deep into the turn, ran three to four wide around the bend and lacked a bid in the stretch.
SHARPAZANO broke well and showed early speed between rivals then chased up the backstretch, dropped back a bit when climbing some near the
half-mile pole, took the turn two wide and ran into traffic at the quarter pole, then failed to threaten in the lane. GAVEA broke in and bumped rival, went up to
press inside rivals, lost touch leaving the backstretch, dropped back on the inside then two wide into the lane and tired. DEAL EM got bumped from outside
at the start, climbed early and had to chase from off the pace, took the turn four wide and failed to menace. MISCHIEF MOMENTS raced near the back well
off the rail, eased five wide on the turn, coasted through the lane and eventually crossed the wire before walking off. EXPLOSIVELY bumped with outer rival
leaving the gate, went up to vie three deep early then dueled from outside into the turn, failed to keep up with inner rival around the bend, eased in the lane
and walked off.

Footnotes
RUFF RIDE unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside at the back, made some progress while easing out to the two path on the far turn, angled out in the
lane for a clear run, rallied from outside and took over in the final ten yards. KATERINI stalked from between rivals in the two path, chased two wide into the
far turn, went between rivals again, tipped out into the lane and commenced a bid, took over in deep stretch but was outkicked in the end. CONTROL
FUNCTION rated along the inside, challenged from inside in upper stretch, took over a narrow lead at the eighth pole, dueled into deep stretch and yielded
to the top pair late. ANNIE'S JOY set the pace under pressure on the inside, maintained a short lead into the lane, lost command at the eighth pole and
weakened. STRANGE ADDICTION bothered by outer rival early and steadied briefly, settled off the pace, saved ground through the turns and lacked a
rally. IN YOUR FACE broke well then pressed from outside, kept the pressure on through the far turn, fought between in upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. SHEZMISBEHAVING stalked three deep throughout and tired down the lane.

RODRIGOKNOWS dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead on the backstretch, maintained command to the top of the stretch, responded to right then
left handed urging and gamely prevailed. SPEED GRAZY stalked two into the first turn, steadied early on the backstretch, waited for room behind
RODGRIGOKNOWS on the far turn, gained a clear path and launched a bid in upper stretch, battled in deep stretch but could not get by the winner.
SPIRITUAL ADVISOR dueled from outside early, pressed up the backstretch and far turn, fought three deep in the final furlong and battled gamely to the
wire. KERRY GOLD stalked four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep past the quarter pole, fought four deep late and could not
summon the needed late kick.

Footnotes
JOHNNY DRAMA pressed from outside up the backstretch, took over approaching the quarter pole, put away inner rival entering the lane, urged right
handed with a furlong remaining, led clear into deep stretch and held off the runner-up. PICOTA (GB) sat off the pace outside a rival into the turn, ran into
traffic at the quarter pole, split foes in upper stretch, rallied while drifting in late and could not get by the winner. PALAGIO raced towards the rear two wide
into the turn, moved out to the three path, steered out further in upper stretch and gained the show. SIX MAGPIES (IRE) chased near the back along the rail
into the turn, tipped out exiting the bend, offered a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. DEFENSOR FORTIS tracked from off the rail then angled to
the inside on the backstretch, shifted to the two path around the bend, moved out further in the drive and weakened. NOBEL GARY climbed a bit early,
trailed into the turn next to the fence, angled out and came four wide into the lane, steered out widest in the stretch and improved position.
ADVENTURESOME raced in range outside a rival into the turn, ran two to three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. BIG
JUANITO climbed early and had to chase from off the pace, raced along the rail into the turn, started to climb again around the bend and failed to menace.
MOBE TOWN set the pace under pressure JOHNNY DRAMA to the outside, relinquished the lead to that rival outside the quarter pole, chased the new
leader into the lane and gave way.
