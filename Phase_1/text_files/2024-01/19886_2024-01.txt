Footnotes
NO WAY IT'S TODAY (GB) tracked two wide then got brushed between rivals on the first turn, continued to stalk between foes to the far turn, got put in tight
past the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch, flew late and got up at the wire. CAMERON SLOUGH stalked the leader from outside, moved up to apply
pressure on the backstretch, lost contact with the pacesetter and chased two wide on the far turn before challenging again at the quarter pole, gained the
advantage approaching the eighth pole, put away TAKE CARAMIE in deep stretch but got nailed on the line. TAKE CARAMIE stepped to the front and
controlled the pace under a snug hold early, pressured from outside on the backstretch, cleared outer rival for a bit before being tested again at the quarter
pole, lost command with a furlong remaining and churned on to hold the show. HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) chased two then three wide on the first turn,
continued three deep on the far turn and lacked further response. CANDY ON TOP stalked from inside, ridden along through the far turn, chased a bit off
the rail into the drive and could not produce a bid. IRISH MYTH tracked from inside while making light contact with outer rival on the clubhouse turn, trailed
into the second bend, saved ground through the turn then swung out approaching the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BURAQ'S REFLECTION showed the way three then two wide around the first turn, pressured from inside at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared briefly
before being confronted again by TWILIGHT MOON on the turn, put away that rival for good at the quarter pole, met the bid from BILLY JOE SHAVER in
upper stretch, shook off that rival approaching the sixteenth pole and inched away in a game victory. BILLY JOE SHAVER stalked in the three path through
both turns, challenged from outside in upper stretch but was turned away in the late stages. TWILIGHT MOON trailed from inside early, split foes at the
half-mile pole then challenged the pacesetter from inside leaving the backstretch, lost touch briefly early on the far turn, challenged again midway around
the bend, failed to keep touch with the leader at the quarter pole and chased into the lane, churned on down the lane and held the show. PUDDIN HEAD
JONES broke a step slow, trailed three wide around the clubhouse turn, moved into range on the backstretch, came under a ride three to four wide on the
far turn and lacked a rally. NO SHOW JONES stalked in the two path then moved inside, got put in tight by TWILIGHT MOON and shifted out to avoid the
rail at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the furlong grounds and walked off.

Footnotes
MIRARI dueled briefly from inside then took control on the clubhouse turn, cleared outer rival early on the backstretch, roused on the far turn still on the
fence, met the challenge from BOLT'S BROAD at the eighth pole, dug in under right-handed urging and held gamely. DANCING MO unhurried in the
beginning and trailed in the two path into the first turn before moving inside, moved off the fence into the backstretch, angled out on the far tur and came six
wide into the lane, closed well and edged BOLT'S BROAD for second. BOLT'S BROAD stalked in the two path then moved inside on the first turn, saved
ground behind MIRARI on the second bend, tipped out into the lane, confronted the winner at the eighth pole but lacked the needed final kick in deep
stretch. GOLDEN SKYLINE settled two wide then along the rail, saved ground to the stretch, chased within range with a furlong left to run but finished
evenly late. LADY CLAYPOOLE (IRE) stalked three then two wide, eased out to the four path giving chase on the far turn and lacked a rally. NO NO NO
NEVER (IRE) dueled briefly from outside then stalked the pacesetter, coaxed along two then three wide on the far turn and weakened in the drive.

PRINCESS OF TIME hustled to the front and set the pace under pressure between rivals, lost command exiting the backstretch, regained command at the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared in upper stretch and drew away. WELL FUNDED chased the top trio from outside to the turn, rounded the bend four wide,
finished willingly and edged SHE'S MUY MUY for second. SHE'S MUY MUY pressed the pace three deep up the backstretch and around the turn, fought to
the top of the lane, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished for second. SIDE BY SIDE broke well and raced up close from
inside, moved up to apply pressure inside outer rivals on the backstretch, took over approaching the turn, gave the lead back to PRINCESS OF TIME at the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened down the lane. PLUM CREEK chased in range from inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend and had little left
for the stretch.

Footnotes
THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) vied inside a pair of rivals then inched ahead to set a pressured pace up the backstretch, maintained a short lead through
the turn, dueled with I'M A LUCKY MAN in the final furlong, drifted out and brushed at the sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed. I'M A LUCKY MAN vied
between rivals for a bit then pressed the pace from outside, kept the pressure on through the turn and into the lane, drifted in and brushed with the winner at
the sixteenth pole and could not get by. STOP AND A TRES stalked from inside, moved off the rail into the lane and held the show. STREET HUMOR
traveled near the back early, saved ground through the turn and kept on for a minor placing. MAN OVERBOARD stalked outside a rival then between foes
into and around the bend and could not produce a bid in the stretch. TAKE ACTION vied three deep then ceded command to inner rivals and took a stalking
position off the rail, rounded the bend three deep and lacked a rally in the lane. PAPA TIGER bobbled at the start, settled off the pace, went two wide into
the turn, steered out and came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. QUINCY MARKET traveled inside a rival at the back, exited the bend in the two
path and was not a factor. GOLF DRAMA trailed outside a rival up the backstretch, navigated the turn two then three wide and could not make an impact.

CORNELL vied three deep into the first turn then took a stalking position in the two path outside a rival, challenged for the lead under asking past the
three-eighths pole, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch and maintained a short lead over MALIBU ROCKS to the wire. MALIBU ROCKS vied for
the lead between rivals then cleared and moved to the inside around the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, met the bid from CORNELL

at the start, showed speed inside a trio of rivals then rated along the rail, stalked up the backstretch, continued from the fence before tipping out to the three

IRIDEO (ARG) settled at the back, moved to the rail and went inside rivals on the turn, coaxed along while stuck behind rivals off the rail in upper stretch,
angled back to the inside for a clear path, surged late along the fence and nailed MUCHO DEL ORO at the wire. MUCHO DEL ORO dueled for the lead
from inside then ceded command to HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE), was closest in pursuit in the two path around the bend, challenged from outside crossing the
dirt, put away inner rival in upper stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and got caught on the line. SUMTER traveled three deep near the back early
on, angled out approaching the dirt, came five wide into the lane, moved into range in upper stretch but needed to find more in the late stages. DANIEL'S
MAGIC dropped back off the pace early, saved ground through the turn, roused entering the stretch and moved off the inside, chased between rivals into
deep stretch and finished evenly late. HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) dueled briefly from outside then cleared MUCHO DEL ORO, showed the way two wide then
along the rail through the turn, confronted by MUCHO DEL ORO crossing the dirt, yielded in upper stretch and flattened late. JOHNNY PODRES chased
three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, remained off the rail to the stretch and failed to rally. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) traveled
between rivals towards the rear in the early going, altered out from behind rival crossing over the dirt, steered out further in upper stretch and failed to
menace. STANDING O chased outside a rival then went four wide into the turn, shifted to the three path around the bend then spun four wide into the
stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SWEET HELLO pressed from outside, move up on even terms then took over at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled three then four wide on the far turn,
cleared approaching the stretch and drew off. FLATTERWITHJEWELS tracked in the four path on the first turn, remained wide on the far turn and came five
wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally to earn second but was no match for the winner. SHERLYN GO GO showed early speed then ceded command
and started to climb on the first turn two then three wide, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, went four wide into the far turn, moved into the three path
around the bend, spun four wide into the stretch and kept on for the show honors. ROMAN EMPRESS took control early and set the pace inside SWEET
HELLO early, lost command at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought back from inside to the quarter pole, lost touch with the winner leaving the bend, came two
wide into the stretch and weakened. HOT ROD MAMA lagged behind while saving ground to the stretch and failed to threaten while gaining minor ground. A
BROKEN BREEZE chased five wide into the first turn then angled to three path around the bend, chased two wide then along the rail on the second bend
tired.

Footnotes
GIRL OF MY DREAMS took control early while pressured from MS MCWHINNEY to the outside, maintained command over that rival through the turn,
shook free into the stretch and held well under right handed urging. MOTET chased along the rail to the stretch, finished willingly in the final furlong and
edged NOT A SINNER (GB) for the place honors. NOT A SINNER (GB) chased between rivals, two wide around the bend, tipped out into the stretch, also
finished willingly in the late stages but was outkicked for second. LAUDATORY off slow to begin, settled inside, tipped two wide on the turn, lacked room in
upper stretch, found a clear path and kept on for a minor award. KETONIA (FR) traveled three deep at the back, remained three wide through the turn,
moved out in the lane, bumped with inner rival at the sixteenth pole and improved position. RESPECT THE CROWN ran up on heels early, settled near the
back between rivals, continued between foes in the stretch, bumped with KETONIA (FR) at the sixteenth pole and improved placings. MS MCWHINNEY
prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch and around the turn, failed to kick on with the leader into the lane and weakened. RUNAWAY KITTEN
reserved in the early going and moved inside, saved ground through the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to threaten. COASTAL COWGIRL sat
off the pace outside a rival, angled out and came four wide into the stretch but lacked further response when called upon. SHOP TILL YOU DROP hit the
gate and broke out, forwardly placed 3deep, started to lose ground approaching the quarter pole, got floated five wide into the stretch and faded down the
lane.
