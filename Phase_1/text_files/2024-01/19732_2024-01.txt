Footnotes
LIGHT UP unhurried in the early going, maintained a two wide wide path while not far back through the backstretch run, chased two to three wide heading to
the quarter pole, circled the field and was roused five wide into the stretch, loomed approaching the furlong marker and took command inside of the furlong
pole, held a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, was kept to task into deep stretch and lasted in a drive to prevail. STEIN'S GIRL stalked the modest early
pace, pulled on the rider approaching the half-mile pole and advanced heading into the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch, improved position and
vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was outfinished by LIGHT UP in the final sixteenth but stayed on well into deep stretch and gained second.
BANDEENA sent to establish the early lead, showed the way into the first turn, was engaged into the backstretch run by SHERILINDA and contested
modest fractions with that runner into the far turn, dueled with SHERILINDA to the quarter marker then took a narrow lead into the stretch, battled for the
lead to the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second and held clearly in the end for third.
NORTHERN ROSE settled just off of the early pace, tracked outside of runners along the first turn and raced three wide into the backstretch run, was well
positioned heading to the half-mile marker, gained ground three wide at the quarter pole, tipped four wide for the drive, was outkicked at mid-stretch and did
not offer a late rally. SHERILINDA away in good order, ceded the early lead and stalked into the first turn, advanced to prompt the moderate pace through
the backstretch run, dueled with BANDEENA into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter marker, continued to battle that rival into the stretch,
could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened.

Footnotes
CLASS CODE hustled leaving the start, stalked the pace into the first turn and attended to the modest fractions through the backstretch run, advanced into
the second turn and pressed outside of SHANGHAI MIST heading to the quarter marker, battled SHANGHAI MIST into the stretch and dueled inside of the
furlong pole, took command into the final sixteenth and held in a drive for a determined win. DRAMATIZER allowed to settle and saved ground into the first
turn, maintained an inside path through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the far turn, angled three wide in upper stretch and improved
position at the furlong pole, finished well into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not get by CLASS CODE and outfinished the
rest for second. GRIGORO forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the modest pace three wide into the backstretch run and was well positioned
approaching the half-mile marker, went three wide into the far turn and tipped four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied while widest into the
final sixteenth, could not catch the top pair in deep stretch and held for third. BUSKER ALLIE settled off of the early pace, raced two wide and between
runners into the first turn, was well placed heading to the half-mile marker then lost ground into the far turn, chased two wide into the stretch and improved
position at the furlong marker, closed willingly in the late stages and just missed for third. SHANGHAI MIST sent leaving the start, assumed command and
set the early pace, set modest fractions through the backstretch run, was pressured into the far turn by CLASS CODE, met that bid into the stretch and
battled to the furlong pole, could not hold off oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS settled three
wide into the first turn, rated off of the modest pace through the backstretch run, was guided four then five wide along the far turn, maintained an outside
path into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, offered a mild late rally but did not threaten.

Footnotes
SIR GREYSON was quick to the front and pressured for a furlong, then allowed to go on alone on the lead, with STAR RACER stalking just off the right
flank, opened up the lead when that rival drifted out turning for home then determinedly held that one at bay the length of the stretch just held on at the wire.
STAR RACER broke sharply and vied for the early lead but opted to sit behind SIR GREYSON after a furlong, started a bid from the five-sixteenths pole,
then drifted out on the turn into the stretch, had trouble changing leads but was still gaining, did not straighten out until the final yards, surged and just
missed. MYNUMEROUNO (AUS) was content to settle well behind the top pair, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths pole, loomed a threat passing the
three-sixteenths but could not match strides with the top two in the late stages and just held on for third. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF hit the side of the gate at
the break and spotted the field a head start, bided time near the rear of the field to the turn, started a rally from the five-sixteenths marker, finished willingly
while gaining but came up short for a minor award.

HALO RANDO stalked the decent early pace between runners, advanced into the turn and pressed PARTY WITH PADDY to the quarter marker, battled
outside of that rival to mid-stretch, drew to even terms and dueled into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and lasted in the final strides to
determinedly prevail. PARTY WITH PADDY broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed good early speed while dictating terms into
the turn, set the pace off of the rail heading to the quarter marker, was confronted in upper stretch by HALO RANDO and battled that rival to the furlong
marker, met the bid of HALO RANDO into the final sixteenth, fought gamely into deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest for
second. TENNYSON WAY broke in a step at the start, showed good speed and raced close up to the early pace, came in tight and checked approaching
the half-mile marker, tracked from the inside into the turn, gained ground heading to the quarter pole then came in tight approaching the top of the stretch,
angled three wide and chased the leading pair to the furlong grounds, raced greenly in deep stretch, was not able to impact the top two in the final stages
and held safely in the end for third. MR. DUFF allowed to settle, saved ground into the turn, tipped two then three wide for the drive and improved position at
the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. HOT GOBLIN chased the decent pace from the outside, gained

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR broke alertly, vied for the early lead then ceded to LITTLE CASINO, stalked that runner through quick fractions heading into the turn,
advanced along the bend and pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong pole, kept to
task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted for the win at the finish. THE CALABRESE KID took back off of the
fast early pace, tracked from the second flight and raced three wide into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, shifted four wide for the drive and ran
evenly to mid-stretch, rallied while widest into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch and missed for the win, while besting the rest.
KHAIKY'S COMMAND prominent away from the start, stalked the fast early pace between runners, was well positioned heading into the turn and chased
two wide to the quarter pole, swung three wide for the drive, was outkicked at the furlong marker, could not make headway on the top two in deep stretch
and held clearly for third. LITTLE CASINO hustled away from the start, assumed command and set a fast pace into the turn, felt pressure along the turn
from MY DOMINATOR and was overtaken into the stretch, chased the winner to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. STAND TO threw his
head at the start and was off slowly, settled in the early stages then advanced to track the fast pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and
improved position at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and finished evenly. OUR
EXPECTATION lagged in the early going, saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch,
advanced at the furlong marker and finished evenly in the late stages. BEL RAGAZZO slow into stride away from the start, lacked early speed and settled
off of the fast early pace, went two wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, chased four wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong
pole, offered a mild late rally but did not factor in the late stages. CONTINENTAL UNION chased the quick early pace from the outside, raced four to five
wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.

BROADWAY TIGER broke alertly, assumed command and dictated terms in the early going, was well handled while carving decent fractions into the turn,
drew to a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task under steady urging into the final sixteenth, felt mild pressure in deep stretch and held safely for the
win at the wire. ETHAN'S GIRL attempted to wheel at the start and was away very slowly, spotted the field to begin and chased the decent early pace,
raced two wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, maintained that two wide path into the stretch and continued to advance at the
furlong marker, sustained her rally into the final sixteenth, put mild pressure on the winner in deep stretch and was up for second in the final strides. SHANA
MADEL tracked the decent early pace from the outside, gained ground three wide into the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well into the final sixteenth
and just missed for second. CLUBHOUSE DRAMA showed speed and attended to the decent early pace, chased two wide into the turn, was outkicked into
upper stretch by BROADWAY TIGER, could not muster a final response and weakened. ONE SUMMER DAY hustled away from the start, came under an
early hold and tracked the decent pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and stalked the pace to the quarter marker, was outkicked at mid-stretch,
chased into the final sixteenth and gave way. LOVELY JOSEPHINE chased the decent early pace from the inside, lost ground heading to the quarter pole
and did not factor in the stretch. MY MOTORHOME ducked in leaving the start, attempted to duck into the gap while green early on, spotted the field and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SEA OF LIBERTY got good position from the break, stalked the early pace to the far turn, was set down approaching the quarter pole, produced a nice run
down the stretch under steady handling to win driving. IL CAPITANO was hustled to the front and took command of the early pace, went unchallenged for
the first half mile then got pressure from HAPPY DOES who make an early push near the seven-sixteenths pole, fended off that challenge then dueled with
SEA OF LIBERTY into deep stretch, could not hold off that rival in the final yards but finished well to hold the place. HAPPY DOES broke out and bumped
ROCKTILLYOUDROP then hustled away, was taken in hand before the turn and allowed to settle into stride, came into the backstretch run at the front of
the tracking group, was asked to pick up the pace passing the half-mile marker, went up to engage IL CAPITANO for the lead passing the three furlong pole,
responded when put to a drive down the stretch but was outfinished by the top pair. ROCKTILLYOUDROP moved to the rail when clear before the first turn,
stayed to the inside and advanced as the field moved down the backstretch, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, ran on under steady
handling but could not find another gear when needed. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) broke sharply, showed some early speed then was taken back off the
pace, settling to the rear of the compact field, committed to the inside on the far turn, had to wait behind horses for running room, set down near the
three-sixteenths pole but did not go on and finished evenly. BUENISIMO was floated four to five wide into the first turn, raced on the outside of the trailing
pack to the far turn, tried to mount a rally while still wide through the far turn, went five wide into the stretch but lacked punch and finished one-paced to the
wire. SUGAR BEETS got squeezed a little and took up slightly a couple of strides out, then went three wide through the first turn, was content to settle near
the rear of the tracking group, moved into contention racing two wide through the far turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, flattened out, then was not
ridden out to the wire and was passed by a pair of stragglers yards from the finish.

marker, vied between runners into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by BLETCHLEY PARK in deep stretch and got up for second in the final strides.

turn, attended to the decent pace along the backstretch run and stalked STONE'S RIVER into the far turn, advanced two then three wide and battled for the
lead into upper stretch, took command while drifting out approaching the furlong marker, battled gamely into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep
stretch and just held for third at the wire. HEAT N REHEAT shuffled back a bit on the run into the first turn, took back off of the decent early pace and settled

along the backstretch and was well placed while four deep at the half-mile pole, continued his advance four wide at the quarter marker, swung five wide for

run and improved position at the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and was outkicked at
the furlong marker, could not find more in the final sixteenth and finished evenly. STONE'S RIVER showed good early speed away from the start, vied for

the way into the second turn then came under pressure nearing the top of the lane, battled against oncoming rivals to mid-stretch, fought into the final
sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. SHOT OF A LIFETIME prominent leaving the start, rated off of the solid early pace and tracked into the backstretch

Footnotes
HAVAKASH READY broke out top, seized the early lead, held sway through the turn racing well in hand, repelled all challengers at the head of the lane,
opened up on the field when set down in the stretch and won clear. ADIOS NICANOR was last away and raced at the back of the field early, quickened
noticeably when put into a drive from the three furlong pole, tipped out to the four path into the stretch and responded to intermittent urging with a bold rally
to get up for the place. HE'S INIT TO WINIT settled three wide and well behind the pace in the early running, made a nice forward move through the turn
while still wide, came into the stretch with dead aim on HAVAKASHREADY, finished up well but was unable to reel in that foe and was passed late for
second. HOT ROD JIMMY broke well, chased HAVAKASHREADY to the turn, was set down at the five-sixteenths marker but was unable to keep up with
that foe in the stretch, tired and faded in the late stages. R HEART OF GOLD raced mid-pack to the turn, advanced om the leaders while saving ground
through the turn, loomed a big threat at the top of the stretch but flattened out and finished evenly. LORD FISC came away from the gate in good order but
was unable to keep up with the pace in the early going, dropped back to last before the half, came under a ride on the turn and ran on with some interest
despite having trouble changing leads down the stretch. THECHIEFHASTRICKS raced close up three to four wide down the backstretch, had to be ridden to
keep up with the pace from the seven-sixteenths marker then was outrun down the stretch. UPDRAFT was hustled from the start to no avail, dropped back
to last early then was pushed on to keep contact with the pack was unable to improve through the turn then had little to offer in the stretch.
