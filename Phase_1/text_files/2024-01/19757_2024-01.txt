NICHOLAS JAMES trailed for a half, swung wide, circled his field through upper stretch under mild right handed urging and was along in time. APACHE
pressed the pace along the inside through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the late
charge of the winner. ROCK ON KITTEN stalked the pace two wide into the stretch and finished determinedly three wide. QUICK ENTRY bobbled at the
start, made the lead soon thereafter, set the pace two wide for a half, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened. NEWS BOX stalked the
pace two wide, inched close on the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
FIELDSTONE was bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead two wide just past the half mile pole, set the balance of the pace while getting quick fractions
and won as much the best under confident handling. ERNIE'S MARTINI stumbled at the start, chased the winner and finished clear for second four wide.
RED GUN never far back, finished determinedly three wide. GOLD HERITAGE failed to menace. BARRELHOUSE was no threat. SCRATCHOFF broke
alertly to set the early pace, was headed by the winner after a quarter, kept pressure into the turn and faded late. NAPA DUDE broke inward bumping with
the winner at the start and was no factor.

Footnotes
LAKE SHORE DRIVE always within striking distance, responded readily when set down along the rail, made the lead in deep stretch and proved best under
strong handling while fully extended. ESTILO CLASICO pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, made the lead past the five sixteenths pole, drifted
to the five path entering the stretch, set the pace until the final stages then couldn't handle the winner. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR vied for then lead three wide
and finished with good courage. THE EQUINEST unhurried early inside, altered course to the five path in deep stretch and closed a gap. SEEING RED had
good early speed three wide then faded. SILVER MATT was no factor. GIZMO'S MISSION bumped with ARMOR PIERCING at the start, set rapid pace
until late on the turn then weakened. ARMOR PIERCING was bumped at the start then failed to reach contention. JOYFUL CANDY wouldn't load in the gate
and trailed.

Footnotes
INDY PRINCESS KOKO chased the leader along the inside for a half, altered course to the five path at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly through
the final stages under confident handling and was along in time. TIDAL WATERS away alertly, set all the pace while getting quick fractions and was caught
in the final yards. FLYING BUSINESS chased the pace into the stretch and was outfinished while in the five path. CYBERBURG saved ground into the
stretch and finished with good courage in the three path. WOLF EYES was no factor. MOTHERWELL was no threat. BIRDIE BLUE settled mid pack and
lacked the needed response. LUCKY ROAD had speed into the turn then wilted. NORTHERN JOURNEY was outrun.

TWO GUNS never far back, closed willingly along the rail through the stretch under right handed urging and was along in time. HE'S THE SOUPERWON
vied for the lead along the inside for a half, got through to take command at the top of the stretch, drifted out under left handed urging to the four path then
the seven path and was no match for the winner. ONE MORE RING chased the pace four wide and finished determinedly. GILLIGAN raced five wide and
went evenly. PERFECT WAGER found his best stride late. KOSCIUSZKO chased the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. OVERBEARING failed to
menace. ROYAL MAHOGANY sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the three sixteenths pole then weakened. ANOTHER BREEZE was
no factor. LOCK ON trailed.

Footnotes
TWO BIT KID pressed the pace three wide, matched strides the length of the stretch, dug in under right handed urging and got up by the narrowest of
margins at the wire. FREEDOM RIDER had speed from the start, rallied along the rail to make the lead at the top of the stretch, battled the balance of the
trip and just failed. DOCTOR WU set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. OUT OF CENTS pressed the pace three wide into the
turn then faded. LIMIT UP well placed, went evenly. DISCLOSURE passed tiring rivals. AUGER offered a mild bid four wide on the turn then came up
empty. NINETIES COUNTRY was no threat. DAVID'S GEM vied for the early lead four wide and was through after a half. GOLDEN SPOKE was no factor.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT was outrun.
