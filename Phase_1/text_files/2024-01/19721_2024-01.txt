Footnotes
JANUARY JUBILEE behind the early pace inside, continued to save ground into the turn, slipped through along the rail entering the stretch, took over, clear,
maintained daylight to the finish under steady handling. SUBWAY SUSIE last away, raced well back early as a result, angled out to be four wide into the
lane, rallied willingly to be well clear for the place. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT raced in the second flight early outside, crept closer while five wide midway on
the turn, flattened out in the drive to prove no match for the top two. ADIOS MUCHACHAS narrowly set the pace in the two path, allowed the winner the
inside turning for home, began to weaken when headed by that one. ALMOND FUDGE pressed the issue three wide, gave way late in the turn. MARCO
SUNSET forced the issue up front while between horses for over three furlongs and faltered. CHIP SHORTAGE finished early, fell far back, distanced,
jogged in. CALEB'S BELLA shortened stride soon after the start while outside, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
DOC HIGGINS narrowly showed the way into the first turn, dueled the middle half, put the other speed away into the lane, drew away in the run to the wire
under steady handling. MR WORKS dueled up front outside the winner, proved no match for that one in the drive, clearly second best. STRICKLAND void of
speed, remained well back up the back stretch, rallied along the inside through the second turn, up late for the show. SECRET HONOR broke awkwardly,
raced back early as a result, moved closer toward the inside second turn, chased top two midstretch, flattened, caught for the show. DARIO chased the
dueling top two, had little left for the drive. YOUNG JONESBORO void of speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. SEEKING CHROME
remained back in failing to threaten. LUCKY SUPER NOVA lost footing at the start, remained always back. SMACKOVER LIME in the second flight early,
steadily faded. EIGHT STRAIGHT retreated while racing three wide. TOMMY TRI rank, steadied first turn, gave way far turn, eased stretch, walked in.

Footnotes
GHOST BAYOU forwardly placed along the inside, challenged inside the two leaders dueled, edged away. MY CAJUN LADY pressed the early leader from
the outside, asked along four wide turning for home outside the winner, dueled with that one through upper stretch, could not match that one late while
holding sway for the place. BYZANTINE back off the pace while racing toward the inside, improved while saving ground into the stretch, getting to the
runner up late. ALWAYS SMILING broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch just off the inside, dueled in the two path turn, weakened in the drive.
CUPID'S MUSIC in mid pack while off the inside, lacked a closing response in the drive. TIZ SWEET CANDY last to leave, passed a couple of tiring rivals
while never a threat. MINNIE'S READY forwardly placed while racing in the two path for a half, backed up through the stretch. MISSY PIGGY was always
outrun, trailed home.

Footnotes
JEWELSTOWN away in good order, set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way the middle half, shook clear the final furlong. DESERT WOLF
forwardly placed along the inside, bid closer second turn while continuing to save ground, chased the winner past the furlong marker, shifted out a bit, could
do little with that same rival to the wire, clearly second best. BOOGIE BODE prompted the pace while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. MY
BROTHER KEITH settled off the pace while just off the inside, two path turning for home, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. AIN'T THAT
A KICK off a step slow, void of speed toward the inside, improved position with some mild late interest. ASSET BASIS in mid pack while racing off the
inside, five to six wide turning into the stretch, went one paced to the wire. FIGHT'N READY broke back and failed to menace while racing just off the inside.
LIFE ON THE NILE within striking distance for a half while off the rail and in hand, tired from those early efforts. VINCENZINO raced outside, had little for
the stretch reun. CHROME RUN off a step slow, void of speed, moved well wide for the final turn, six wide into the stretch, remained back. STAR NATION
broke back and was always outrun. MR. COUGAR was finished after a half.

Footnotes
TWENTY TO PARK within striking position toward the inside, called on for run late in the turn, challenged along the rail into the stretch, drew steadily clear
under steady handling. ROCKET SANDERS closest to the leader up the backstretch, moved closer in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive,
clear for the place. PATTON'S TIZZY in mid pack, raced three to four wide turning for home, could do little with the top two, clear of the others.
BERABERABERA void of early foot, improved position toward the inside, no real threat. YAQUI VALLEY broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, allowed
the winner the inside turning for home, began to weaken when headed by that one. STRATO raced in the two path, had little for the drive. GENTLE BEN
raced back and outside, four to five wide in the turn, failed to rally. BO NUGGET off slowly, bothered, raced back, improved slightly while not a factor.
UNNECESSARY TRICKS was not a threat while off the inside. JIMMY mid pack, dropped inside inside in the run through the turn, tired. PALMETTO DEVIL
forwardly placed early while racing outside, began to fade before a half. GET AWAY WITH IT bothered to be off slowly, lagged, fell further pace and was
well beaten at the end.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BAND in the second flight, moved closer by late in the turn while steering out into the three path, dueled upper stretch, edged away under
steady handling. LOVE OF MY HEART lacked early foot, four wide in the turn, challenged outside the winner turning into the stretch, briefly dueled with that
one then could not keep up. SHE'S BULLETPROOF in the second flight off the inside, advanced three wide, challenged and came in the two path while
holding a slight advantage exiting the turn then could not keep up with the top pair. PATTERN BET in mid pack off the inside, three wide into the stretch,
lacked a closing punch. HALAGA fell back to trail, continued to lag turn while three wide, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals through the lane.
MISSYINTOMISCHIEF back off the pace while out in the strip, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. MUSICMANSANDY dueled
early off the inside through a quick opening quarter, inherited a daylight advantage late backstretch and into the turn, offered brief resistance when
challenged midway on the bend then gave way in the drive. LACEY BOSS remained back in failing to threaten toward the inside. DIVA TREVA dueled early
closest to the inside, steadied along the rail just before that quick opening split, moved out, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
PILLBOX lacked speed up the backstretch while between horses, advanced four to five wide turn, challenged outside the leader with less than a furlong
remaining, proved best under firm handling to be comfortably clear at the end. SHANGHAI EXPRESS behind the pace inside, moved closer turning for
home, late bid for the place, gained the nod for that position, not a threat to the winner. HOUSE OF MAGIC forwardly placed, four wide advance far turn,
challenged three wide turning for home showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, caught late for the place.
THERESASILVERLININ floated out at the break, raced in the second flight outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, lacked a closing response.
RIBBONSINHERHAIR back off the pace while between horses and outside the runner up, was going evenly in traffic when forced to steady midstretch,
improved slightly to the wire after recovering. INSIGHTFUL MISS broke back, void of speed while moving outside, four path through the turn, improved
position while finding best stride too late. MY DAMS ATITUDE last to leave, void of speed in trailing toward the inside for a half, passed some tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. GOING THE DISTANCE set or forced the pace while closest to the inside of the first flight, gave way. PUNCHY GIRL
within striking distance two to three wide, faltered. TWIRLING TIGRESS pressed the issue early off the inside, moved to press the issue through the turn,
gave way into the lane and was continuing to tire when bothered in traffic just inside the furlong grounds. HARTLEY broke through the gate prior to the start,
reloaded, broke out, raced back and five wide turn, trailed home.

TIME FOR TROUBLE brush break, raced back toward the inside, two path into the far turn, steered out four wide into the lane to lose ground to the leader,
set down, got to that one late from the outside with some good late resolve. BUCK MOON broke out, brushed, raced back off the pace inside, crept a bit
closer along the inside, waited for room late in that bend, knifed through an open to challenged into the lane, clear past the furlong marker, could not contain
the winner, clearly second best. COMMANDPERFORMANCE squeezed back at the start to be away slowly, moved outside, three to four wide into lane,
improved to finish up best of the rest. FROSTED DEPARTURE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into and through the
final turn, faltered when headed by the runner up entering the stretch. HEYWOODS BEACH went evenly paced while racing off the inside, lacked a closing
kick. ACCIDENTAL HERO lacked speed, was never dangerous off the inside. SANTOS DUMONT forwardly placed early, moved a bit closer in the three
path final turn, gave way in the drive. STRAVA pressed the leader outside, moved closer and challenged second turn, appeared to lug in traffic with a
quarter remaining, steadied then stopped. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH LATE SECOND TURN, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HONOR CAT broke on top, set all the pace in the two path, drew out through the lane while being kept to task. BUSINESS AS USUAL settled off the early
pace inside, asked along second turn, steered four wide turning for home, rallied on the outside to gain the place, not a threat to the winner. LITE IT UP
LOUIE lacked speed, rank, steadied late first turn, encountered some traffic early in the second bend, rallied three wide, missed the place. SCENIC
BEAUTY forwardly placed early inside, moved out, three wide through the second turn, challenged for the place stretch, not enough. PEPPERS
GIRLFRIEND in mid pack early off the rail, dropped to the inside and moved closer second turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened late
to lose several positions. CONTOUR lacked speed, in some traffic far turn, went evenly when clear for the drive. MY FAVORITE GIRL broke back, void of
speed, two path through the final turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA hesitated at the start, lacked speed while
four wide through the first turn, continued back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CHICA ARMA five wide into the first turn, three wide
through the second turn, tired. PACE'S TWO SENSE broke back, was always outrun. WHAT'S HER NUMBER chased the early leader, stopped.
