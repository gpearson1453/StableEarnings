DESERT RULER dueled between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and continued to battle gamely to the wire to get the bob for the
win. RARE JEWEL stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and dueled gamely to the
wire to just miss. MR. SWAGGER bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the three path and chased on to the wire. CHARGING AERO chased the leader on inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around
the turn in the three path and kept on to the finish. CAMPTON dueled on the inside through the early going, continued to battle from the two path and
weakened in the lane. DEEP FAITH raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. MR. BONES

Footnotes
VALIANT EXCHANGE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and dueled to the wire to get up for the
win. A G DIAMOND led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dueled gamely to the wire to just miss. ZINGALES
KING raced off the pace early, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground late. MIDNITE MUSKET veered out
leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and
improved position from there. COLLECTED DREAMS chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished
evenly. RED ROADSTER raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and showed no kick. SUIT ME UP
CHARLIE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the bend
in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. LATIN FORCE trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and never
threatened. KARAOKE raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, angled in to save ground around the turn and made no bid.
EUCLID AVENUE bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the rail up the backstretch, navigated the bend from
the four path and was empty from there.
