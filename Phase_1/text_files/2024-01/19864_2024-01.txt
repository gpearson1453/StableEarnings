Footnotes
HIDDEN LOVE dueled on the front end, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the best. SASSY SPRY raced near the back in the beginning,
saved ground around the turn, made a late rail bid and was a clear second at the wire. SMOKIN MOTION vied for the early advantage, saved ground and
weakened. YOU BELIEVE IN ME lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside, finished wide and passed tired ones. ACESANDDIAMONDS
pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. MODDIE raced within contention, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
GUITAR DOCTOR went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. RISKY PRIORITY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. PEANUT N IKE raced within striking distance, made a bid, while racing inside and was outfinished
for second. MO CREDO void of early speed, came around the second turn on the outside, finished wide, while showing late interest, but was no factor.
THROWIN' SHADE lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a mild bid and finished evenly late. GOLDENLUTE raced within
contention, came around the final turn four wide and faded. JOEY'S LIGHTENING always raced near the back and showed little. BLEEP BLEEP pressed
the early pace, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
I WILL STAND challenged for the early advantage, saved ground, drove clear around the final turn and finished well. BIG ROJO lacked early speed, made a
steady gain, moved up on the outside around the second turn, entered the stretch wide and finished wilingly. SPHEROID pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, couldn't keep up with the top two, but held on for third. VANGILDER void of early speed, had an outside trip, gained ground late and was
outfinished for third. INTO WISHING pressed the early pace, weakened and finished evenly. MACHINEGUNPREACHER raced near the middle of the pack,
made a bid and faded. LOUIS LE GRANDE raced in the middle of the field, faded and was no threat. BIG MONEY MACHINE dueled for the early lead and
made a steady retreat. VIM AND VIGOR always raced near the back and showed little.

SAILOR CHOW raced within striking distance, moved up around the turn, angled out entering the home stretch, made a bid, racing four wide and drove
clear. FEROCITY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, finished inside, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HULEN raced
within contention, came around the turn on the inside, angled out entering the stretch, made a wide bid and was a clear third. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET vied
for the early lead and faded. MCLEAN lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and was never a factor. ELUSIVE WAR dueled on the front end

Footnotes
SPARKIN vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, pulled away and finished well. GILDERSLEEVE void of early speed, came around the turn
wide, made an outside rally and gained ground. MOR BIG LEE raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn wide, made a late gain and finished
willingly. SKIPPA challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. KIT KAT KIDD lacked early speed, improved position,
but was no factor. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE pressed the early pace, weakened and was no threat late. SILKY'S DANCE raced near the back, finished on the
rail and was outrun. A'DEBRIS showed early speed and made a steady retreat. CLASSIC RED RACER raced within striking distance and dropped back.
