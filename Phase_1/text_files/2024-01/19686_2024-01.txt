Footnotes
TIZ TOK showed early speed four deep into the first turn then chased three wide into the backstretch, suffered a minor shuffle early on the far turn, came
four wide into the lane, rallied five deep late and got up. MONTANA hit the gate and came away slow, chased six wide then moved into the four path around
the clubhouse turn, ran three to four wide around the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, challenged in deep stretch and got outclosed by the winner.
ARREST vied for the lead inside several rivals into the first turn then pressed the leader around the bend, raced on even terms up the backstretch, took over
on the far turn, fought with TOKAMAK into the lane, carried a short lead into deep stretch and was run down late. DERECHO DANDY chased two wide then
along the rail, saved ground through the far turn while ridden along, altered off the fence midstretch, bid between in the final sixteenth but got bothered by
ARREST LATE halting his momentum. TOKAMAK up close five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep on the far turn then dueled two
wide into the lane, battled into deep stretch and could not summon the needed final kick. CHICKASAW broke a step slow, chased seven wide into the first
turn then dove down to the rail, advanced along the fence on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, lost his path past the sixteenth pole and could not
regain momentum. TAHOE SECRETS vied three deep into the first turn then stalked three wide around the bend, dropped back two then three wide on the
far turn and tired. RUSTY B CAUSE vied between then inched ahead to take control early, dueled outside a rival up the backstretch, lost command and
chased the new leader past the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the lane. THE RIDER ABOARD CHICKASAW LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
MONTANA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LATE IN THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE VIDEO WAS
INCONCLUSIVE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

the lane, rallied and headed the runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN stalked outside a rival early, inched closer
three deep on the backstretch, bid two wide on the far turn, took over with a furlong left to run, cleared briefly midstretch but was soon tested by the winner
at the sixteenth pole and could not much resistance late. MILAGRE DO SOL stalked from the inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out at the
eighth pole and gained the show. KLEEN KARMA reserved in the early going and steered to the inside, traveled three deep into the far turn, chased three
wide into the lane and got edged for the third. HAVANA ANGEL (IRE) showed early speed to take control, showed the way along the inside to the far turn,
tested by HENNYST CRAZY TRAIN around the bend, maintained command into the lane, lost the advantage in upper stretch and weakened. OUTSIDE

Footnotes
HALO UNCLE stalked three deep into the turn, flanked the leader on the bend then chased two wide past the quarter pole, drew alongside PRINCE
PRANCEALOT again entering the final sixteenth and dug in late to overhaul the runner-up. PRINCE PRANCEALOT cleared quickly from outside and
steered across, showed the way along the rail through the turn, led clear to midstretch, challenged by HALO UNCLE in the final sixteenth and yielded
grudgingly. CATMANSUE came in and bumped rival a few times shortly after the start, chased two then three wide around the turn, then finished willingly
down the lane for a clear third. STAY ON THE FENCE got sandwiched between rivals early, climbed a bit at the back, rounded the bend two wide, tipped
out into the lane but got put in a bit tight between rivals, opted to the outside but could not rally in the final furlong. FACT OR FICTION bumped with outer
rival shortly after the start, chased along the inside through the turn and weakened. MISCHIEFS CAUSEWAY got bumped around and pinched back early,
chased three deep into the turn, spun five wide into the lane, shifted in upper stretch and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE
BEGINNING OF THE RACE, THE STEWARDS MADE A DOUBLE DISQUALIFICATION. THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CATMANSUE FROM THIRD
TO FIFTH AND FACT OF FICTION FROM FIFTH TO SIXTH, BOTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO RIVALS SHORTLY AFTER THE START.

Footnotes
GOLIAD bobbled a bit and brushed at the start, went up take control and opened up early, remained well clear into the stretch on the inside, put to left
handed urging in the lane, unchallenged into the final sixteenth, grew weary late but was able to last. GREAT KING (FR) trailed early on the inside into the
clubhouse turn then moved into the two path, raced outside a rival around the far turn, moved out in the lane, closed well but ran out of time. CROSBY
BEACH sat off the pace in the two path, shifted in to bother rival at the three-eighths pole, saved ground along the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane
and rallied to close the gap on the winner. SANTO DIOS (ARG) brushed GOLIAD at the start, stalked along the rail, drew closer on the far turn and finished
evenly in the final furlong. CASTLE LEOCH traveled along the inside near the back, got put in tight and checked at the three-eighths pole, hugged the rail
into the lane and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH stalked two wide to the far turn, lost ground around the bend and chased three wide into the
drive and faded.

ELWOOD BLUES bumped leaving the gate, chased under coaxing two then three wide on the turn, reached the front with a sixteenth remaining and held
over DESMOND DOSS at the wire. DESMOND DOSS settled inside off the pace, drew closer around the bend, rallied along the fence and missed. GOOD
VIBES ONLY sped clear and moved inward, led along the rail then two to three wide into the stretch, remained clear to the eighth pole but was outkicked by
rivals on both sides in deep stretch. HARD TO FIGURE chased three wide into the turn, five wide into the drive and finished evenly. SUPER CHIEF broke a
step slow and got bumped around at the start, chased from off the pace, went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then angled four wide into
the lane and weakened. PRINCIP got bumped and crowded early, trailed well off the rail early, went four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and had
little left for the drive.

SHADY TIGER tracked four wide through the turn, took aim from outside into the stretch, headed the lead at the sixteenth pole, took over shortly after and
held off the runner-up. TWO BY FOUR settled off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, steered to the inside in the final furlong, put in a late
bid but could not get by the winner. CURLIN'S KAOS raced up close off the inside, bid between rivals at the three-eighths pole, led two wide into the drive,
resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. J DUTTON traveled in mid-pack while widest early, navigated the turn six then five wide, finished willingly
from the middle portion of the track and earned a minor award. FINAL STORM bobbled a bit at the start but still came away quickly, chased outside a rival
up the backstretch, bid three deep at the three-eighths pole, fought between rivals into deep stretch and faltered late. UNCLE CHILLY stumbled badly
leaving the gate, raced along the rail into the turn, steered out at the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the lane and failed to menace.
PETESOLDFASHIONED dropped back early, trailed two wide into the turn, four wide into the drive and was not a factor. VODKA VODKA tracked three
wide into the turn, two wide into the lane and could not offer a response when needed. DANCE MAN broke in then went up to take command from inside,
challenged by pair of rivals at the three-eighths pole, lost command at the quarter pole and faded down the lane.

GOLDENEYE raced up close in the two path to the outside of the pacesetter, challenged SANGER in upper stretch, dueled into the final sixteenth, took over
in the last fifty yards and held over the runner-up. REMOTE bumped outer rival at the start, tracked on the inside, ridden along through the far turn, moved
out in the stretch, surged late and missed. SANGER established the front and controlled the pace two wide then along the rail, roused entering the stretch,
met the bid from GOLDENEYE in upper stretch, carried a short lead to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) took a
bump from REMOTE at the start, traveled on the inside near the back, continued to save ground through the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed
well and rounded out the superfecta. CRYPTO MAN rated in the two path early, tipped three wide entering the stretch and finished evenly. MEGA MOON
stalked along the inside, coaxed into the stretch, lacked room following SANGER through the lane and never gained a clear path. ENAHM saved ground
through both turns at the back, entered the lane two wide and failed to make an impact. ST IGNACIO chased outside a rival at the back, spun three wide
into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and was not a factor. SYNTACTIC traveled three then two wide off the pace on the clubhouse turn, remained two
wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
KOPION away quickly from inside, shifted in leaving the chute but was quickly corrected, set the pace with DON'T BRING CRAZY to the outside, cleared
that rival leaving the backstretch, showed the way along the inside through the turn, then drew off under confident handling. DON'T BRING CRAZY pressed
the pace from outside, chased KOPION two wide into and around the bend, could not make any headway on the winner in the stretch but was clearly
second best. TAMBO stumbled badly at the start, quickly moved into range outside BOSSY BRUIN GAL, took the turn three wide and weakened in the
stretch. BOSSY BRUIN GAL broke a step slow, stalked from inside into the turn, lost ground around the bend, steered out in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES stalked along the rail through both turns, tipped out and launched a bid midstretch, dueled into the final sixteenth, shifted out and
took over late and lasted at the wire. CITY EXILE (GB) tucked inside at the back, trailed on the fence into the drive, closed in but lacked room behind the
leaders midstretch, angled out and bumped DEVILISH DESIRE, surged between and missed. DEVILISH DESIRE stalked outside a rival, lacked room
behind rivals and steadied into stretch, kept to task through the lane while chasing outside CITY EXILE (GB), got forced out and bumped late and finished
gamely to the wire. PETCOFF broke in and bumped, vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, shook free into the lane, challenged by CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES
in the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly late. ASHCROFT attended the pace three deep, remained alongside the leaders through the far turn, lost
touch with PETCOFF entering the lane and kept on through the final furlong. PLAYER B unhurried in the beginning from inside, traveled towards the rear on
the fence, steered out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, drifted in a bit to bother a rival in upper stretch and improved position. SEA OF
CORTEZ (IRE) took a bump at the start, laid off the pace on the inside, ran into traffic on the far turn, tipped out into the lane, lacked room and checked in
upper stretch and could not rally after. KHANTARO D'ORO tracked two to three wide on the clubhouse turn, raced outside a rival up the backstretch,
chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped out into the lane, shifted into the heels of a rival and steadied in upper stretch and weakened. UNCLE REG
vied for command then pressed the leader from between rivals, failed to keep up with PETCOFF entering the stretch and faded in the lane. EXCEL
CALCULATOR raced outside a rival near the back, spun three wide into the lane and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES FOR SHIFTING OUT LATE, CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN CITY EXILE (GB) AND DEVILISH
DESIRE WHICH COST BOTH THOSE RIVALS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
