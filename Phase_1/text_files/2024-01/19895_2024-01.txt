Footnotes
PEQUENA TORMENTA led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and just
held to the wire. SAILING ALONG raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, began a bid from the three path coming around the bend and gained
ground steadily to the finish to narrowly miss. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) chased the pace setter up the backstretch, challenged from the four path nearing the
quarter pole and kept on to the wire. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn and finished evenly. YOUR RINGER stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the six path coming around
the bend and weakened in the lane. VELLA stalked the front runner between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the five path and faded
from there. ELDORADO DREAM bumped with the horse to his inside and was blocked leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, came around the bend in
the three path and showed no kick. GUARDING ELK CAMP trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. THE
REIGN SONG veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced off the pace on the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the
