edged clear late. CHIEF LADY led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch but was caught
late. MISPRINT tracked the pace setter on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the turn and kept on to the finish. PANOLA stumbled
and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace between horses early, came around the turn in the three path, swung wide
into the stretch and gained ground mildly late. NINETYNINECARATS chased the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend
in the two path and weakened in the stretch. LIVING IN STYLE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path
and faded in the lane. KHO KHO bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the rail through the opening stages, saved

Footnotes
EHSAAN bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the
run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground to get up for the win late.
GRAN YACO saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and gained ground late to
just miss. GALLIC CHARM dueled on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and
re-rallied in the stretch to gain ground late. SPINNING HEART raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the far bend and could not go with the winner late but chase on to the wire. ATTRAYANT hopped up leaving
the gate, raced in the two path around the first bend, pressed the pace up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the far turn and in upper
stretch and was outfinished late. TAKE YOUR SEATS (IRE) saved ground early, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came
around the far turn in the three path and made up some ground in the lane while never threatening. ZINGALES KING raced in the two path around the first
turn, dueled between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and weakened in late stretch. WARTIME RECESS missed the break,
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.
REMERTON veered in sharply and bumped with the inside horses at the start, raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside
for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and was empty from there. LONELY RIDE bumped with the horses to his outside
leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and was never a factor.
