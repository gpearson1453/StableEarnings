Footnotes
MODERN DAY ROMANCE was bumped off stride at the break then settled back about the four path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths
pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to take the nod at the wire. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM moved to the inside and
rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole and kept the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled determinedly to eke out the
advantage over CHARITABLE WINDSOR, but was nipped for the win under the wire. The latter stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the
three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. KING OF LUCK
checked off the heels of Ocean Storm leaving the first turn then gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and finished evenly to
improve his position. SIENTE EL AMOR tapered in and stalked two deep, challenged from the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two
deep on the far turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened stride later yards. OCEAN STORM settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up
the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and could only close the gap in the lane. JOOBY DOOBY DOO rated close to the
early pace inside, gave chase past the half mile pole but weakened into the far turn. BURR HILL BULLET bobbled inward and made contact with Modern
Day Romance leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path on the far
turn. HAZEDNCONFUSED rounded the first turn about the five path and never factored.

SUPER MONEY moved to the inside and rated a short lead, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. DREAM OF GOLD saved ground into the first turn, eased out with a bid past the half mile pole and rounded the far turn about
the five path, dug in outside and got up for second later yards. SELES raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced
in the three path on the far turn, dueled through the stretch for third but was outfinished for second. NELLY TOO settled off the rail the first turn, picked up
the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS saved
ground, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then flattened the final sixteenth. SONGTELLER settled just off the
early pace about the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but showed little response. WAY OF APPEAL stalked inside on the opening turn,
picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole but faded readily through the backstretch and was eased the final quarter mile. Sheza Gritty Bitty became
fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
NICK'S LITTLE BOY rated a short lead racing well off the rail, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met midway on the far turn, drifted
toward the head of the lane, dug in under determined handling and just lasted. ALPHA WHISKEY was forced wide into the first turn, picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, came inside the drifting winner leaving the turn, dug in under steady
encouragement and just missed. MINEOLA MIKE was forced wide into the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and drew to even terms about
the three path midway on the far turn, was forced out leaving the turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. CHROME HEIR rounded the first turn
in the four path, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. SIR SMOAK raced off
the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. AKINGISALWAYSKING
raced in the five path the opening turn, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and
showed little more. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND raced in the five path the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and ran wide on the far turn.
STAVANGER was not a factor. DANNY'S WINKSTER saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the
far turn.

Footnotes
FRENCHIES GOLD settled in the four path the opening turn, started her bid past the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved from that point, dueled for
the nod two deep midway on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and edged clear the final strides. SNEAKY LYNK rated close off the rail the first turn,
challenged three wide leaving the three eighths pole and took a slim brief lead toward the quarter pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and dug in
gamely to late stretch before finally relenting. SPARKLEINYOUREYE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but
checked behind a narrowing opening between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and flattened into the lane.
CASTLE OF CAYLEE saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced in the five path on the far turn, then passed
rivals outside. PRINCESS MARGARET steadied lightly leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, but flattened
in the three path on the far turn. PHILMARY CASTLE stalked the early pace two deep, took a slim lead nearing the three eighths pole and dueled from that
point, was met passing the five sixteenths pole and flattened at the rail on the far turn. DIVA ROSE became a bit anxious in the gate and rated close in the
three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened approaching the far turn. MISS ARGENTINA raced in the six path
the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. FREYA'S BLESSING drifted into the opening turn and never factored. VERY VENUS rated
a slim early lead inside, was met approaching the three eighths pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn.
