cued in the three path passing the quarter, dug in from the two path going into the stretch, exchanged bumps with an outer foe thru the final furlong, but held
on to split the win. DEVILMENT broke out at the start, prompted the pace in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, and ran on from the

Footnotes
CALMING SEA set the pace in the two path, drifted out under left-handed urging and brushed STUCK IN MALIBU near the sixteenth pole and dug in
gamely inside of that foe. STUCK IN MALIBU settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner,
was brushed by that foe near the sixteenth pole and could not get past. OKAY FINE chased the pace two and three wide and finished evenly for the show.
CALLAS saved ground off the pace, edged closer two wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch gain. SWEET SENSATION failed to menace while
racing three wide. R AWESOME SAUCE raced up close inside and faded through the stretch. QUEEN DEYMAR prompted the pace three wide, chased in
the two path around the far turn and tired in the stretch. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OFSTUCK IN MALIBU AND A STEWARDS
INQUIRY, CALMING SEA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
