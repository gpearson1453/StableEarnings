Footnotes
COINMAKER dictated terms via a loose lead in the two path, drove further clear in upper stretch and held sway. STAR'S DREAM saved ground off of the
pace, rallied entering the lane, gained place nearing the furlong pole and was second best. LIKE FINE WINE stalked along the inside, chased shifting off the
inside around the far turn, got outmoved for place by an inner bidder in midstretch and held show from an outer rival. TEXAS TIDELANDS tracked in the
four path, chased between horses around the far turn and was fended off for show by an inner rival through the final furlong. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL
brushed an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack tucking from the four to two path around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning for home,
attempted a bid for place nearing midstretch, but hung on her left lead and yielded late. MYLIES STAR stalked in the three path, chased between horses
around the far turn and gave way. SWIZZLECITY laid off of the pace in the three to five path, attempted to circle foes around the far turn to vie for place
turning for home, but tired between horses in upper stretch. KAITLYN'S COURT broke slowly and was outrun. SUPER ET broke slowly and took light
contact from an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the five path and was done early.

rival at the start, stalked in the four path, vied for place with an inner rival turning for home, but yielded late. PAT HAND GIRL bumped with rivals on both

LEAD ME settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, tracked in the three path around the far turn, swung out to take aim from the five path
entering upper stretch, lacked progress while drifting a bit out approaching midstretch, yet straightened and sustained a grinding charge to bid in the final
sixteenth before edging past in the shadow of the wire. I DON'T VENMO tracked along the inside, tipped two wide nearing the lane to take aim between the
top pair entering the lane, pursued them before tipping three wide at the furlong grounds, stayed on to bid along with an outer rival in the late stages, but
missed between horses. SINGLE SHOT pursued from midpack in the four path, stalked from within striking range around the far turn, bid in upper stretch,
wrestled an advantage nearing the furlong grounds, but was bested by an outer late bidding pair nearing the wire. TONTERIA broke as step slow and
brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked shifting two to three wide and outside of rivals around the first turn, bid entering the far turn, led leaving the three
furlong pole, tucked to the inside entering the lane as an outer rival inched closer, got headed by that one outside of the final furlong, yet fought on
thereafter to miss show. VIKING LEGACY pursued from midpack tucking to the inside around the first turn, shifted outwardly in upper stretch and offered a
mild kick. SNAKEBIT stuttered a step at the start, trailed in the three path, lacked a response to urging in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the
seven path in upper stretch and sustained stride to improve position. TACTICAL VISION bumped with an outer rival early on, then saved ground to no avail.
MECKES PRIORITY bumped an inner rival early on while moving to the fore, set the pace along the inside, got headed while inside of a pair of rivals
passing the three furlong pole and weakened. WESTERN STAR took a brush from an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide, got outmoved by an outer
bidder entering the far turn and weakened between horses entering the lane. STIFF DRINK never got involved from the three path.

Footnotes
HALF AGAIN tracked along the inside, picked up stride entering the lane, gained place from outer rivals in upper stretch, took aim outside of the leader
entering the final furlong, bid entering the final sixteenth and edged past. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK set the pace in the two path, drew clear from an outer
presser entering the lane, met an out challenge in the late stages and got bested approaching the wire. COACH KENNY raced at the rear in the two to three
path, inched closer hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed leads at the furlong grounds and produced a late kick to belatedly close in on the top
pair. HEZA PRIORITY broke a step slow, raced towards the rear in the four to five path, ran on outside of foes in upper stretch and leveled off. FIERY
PLAYBOY brushed an outer rival leaving the gates, pressed the leader from the three path, failed to keep pace entering the lane and faded while drifting out
in upper stretch. CHARLI MICHAEL took light contact from an inner rival at the start, chased in the four path and weakened between horses in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
HARD RYE GUY laid off of the pace along the inside, gained inside of rivals in upper stretch, floated out a foe to take aim outside of the leader entering the
final sixteenth and sustained progress to drive past that one in the shadow of the wire. DEVIL'S HARVEST set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure,
inched free of that one around the far turn, held sway through midstretch but was caught in the final sixteenth. LUNAR MODULE bumped with an inner rival
at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied while hanging on her left lead into the final furlong, but needed more to reel in
the leader. MICROPHONE (IRE) tracked in the three path, ranged up to gain place entering the lane, but yielded between horses nearing the final sixteenth.
FLAWLESS RULER laid off of the pace in the three path, drifted from the five to seven path in midstretch and stayed on well late. MY ROMEO LIMA leaned
outwardly at the start, pressed two wide, failed to sustain pressure turning for home, chased among foes while yielding in upper stretch, then steadied when
floated to tight quarters at the sixteenth pole. RUNNING LATE lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. SUMMER LOVER bumped with an outer
foe before steadying out of crowded quarters between horses at the start, lagged behind and was outrun.

Footnotes
PREMIUM broke outwardly at the start, stalked behind the embattled leading pair from the two to three path around the turn, bid three wide in upper stretch,
sparred with an a game GUNNER BAY through the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. GUNNER BAY dueled for the lead with an inner rival around the
turn, disposed of that one as an outer PREMIUM offered a menacing bid, tenaciously battled through the late stages but just missed. INDULGE broke
outwardly, settled off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride tipping to the four path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly while hanging on his left
lead. COMMUNICATION MEMO was floated into an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, shifted out nearing the lane, maneuvered to the
five path in midstretch and ran on late. CHI TOWN HUSTLER bumped with an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead with an outer foe around the turn
and gave way in upper stretch. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was bumped by rivals on either side and squeezed back between horses at the start, lagged behind
into the turn and surpassed a tired rival. SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN chased in the three to four path around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
GILDED RULER brushed with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch, inched away entering the final
furlong and held from an outer bidder in the closing stages. SON OF A BIRCH pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, aimed between the
pace-setters from the three path in upper stretch, split foes in the final furlong, closed in on the leader to offer a late bid but was denied. WESTERN
COMMAND brushed with an inner foe leaving the gates, stalked outside of the clear leader and from the three path around the turn, ranged up to bid in the
four path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a rail-bidder in the process, leveled off and held show late. BATTLE SCARS saved ground well back, then
sustained a rail rally to miss reaching show. PEPPER JACK broke a step slow, trailed in the two path, swung to the eight path entering upper stretch and
stayed on belatedly to miss reaching fourth. PROUD CIVILIAN laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane and ran on
among rivals. FLEET OF HOOF pursued along the inside then lacked a bid between horses. SIMPLE LOGIC broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four
path, floated to the seven path entering upper stretch and lacked a rally between horses. MESA SPIRIT broke half a beat slow, pursued from midpack three
wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane and gave way. MUSICAL SPELL settled off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path into upper
stretch and made little impact. KING OF SONG sped clear, showed the way in the two path around the turn then weakened between bidders at the three
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
HANDSOME HAROLD set the pace in the two path and held sway while hanging on his left lead. CHAD'S FLASHY WAYS tracked in the three to four path,
dueled for place with an inner foe while chasing the clear leader and prevailed for that position. SPEIGHTFUL ONE stalked in the three path, chased
between horses through upper stretch, dueled with an outer foe for place through the late stages but narrowly missed. PUPPETEER stalked along the
inside, chased through upper stretch and yielded. TABLEAUX RESEAUX dropped his rider pre-race, brushed an outer foe at the start, pursued from
midpack in the two path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. SKINNY BOBBY failed to factor from the three path. MUNCLE
lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. CAT COUNTY broke a step slow before being brushed by an inner rival at the start, trailed around the
turn and was outrun. KICKIN CHIP laid off of the pace in the four path and tired.
