Footnotes
TABOO HOO unhurried to the turn, rallied outside and sustained the bid in the stretch to clear in the late going under stout handling to the wire. SQUASH
BLOSSOM broke slow with no speed to the turn, angled widest with trouble in the upper stretch run while blocked and steadied with no where to go, got
clear while coming on too late and probably best. SWEET BABY RAY saved ground to the turn, ran on evenly in stretch for show. BELPERRON raced three
wide to the turn, battled stretch run, no late gain. CASTELMOLA speed between to the turn, could not keep up and faded back. LONG BLACK VEIL failed to
menace throughout. HEAVEN AND EARTH was reluctant to load, rushed to the lead, led to the stretch but emptied out in the final furlong. CAROLINA SUN
chased three wide to quarter pole, gave way in late stretch. HAMMER AND JAMMER could not keep up to the turn and never menaced. GATITA SUAVE
was jostled at the start, inside to turn with nothing left in the stretch.

COURAGEOUSLY never far back with a three wide run to far turn, kept on, clear. CLEAR FOR ACTION had speed to the front, well rationed to the stretch
but settled for place spot while besting the rest. COMMAND CENTRAL secured good position throughout while three wide, ran on for show spot. NOT SO
EASY raced back to far turn with a steady run to improve in the late stretch run. JERICHO EXPRESS inside run while never far back to far turn, stayed on
evenly. LOADEMUPJUSTICE unhurried to far turn, widest run into the stretch to improve. BLUE SKY PAINTER saved ground throughout while never a real
threat. WEEKEND IN COURT had no speed from the gate and never menaced throughout. HIGH POWERED was very antsy in the gate while bobbing
head numerous times before the gate sprung and proved no menace throughout. ARTEMUS EAGLE pulled along inside to far turn with nothing left and
stopped. ESTILO PELIGROSO raced rank into first turn, and never threatened throughout.

Footnotes
CORKAGE FEE secured perfect position to far turn, angled out full of run into the stretch, took over between calls while all out and lasted to the wire under
stout handling. SAVANNAMARIE had no speed, rallied widest past the quarter pole, continued out and ran on in the final furlong but just missed on the wire.
SENSIBLE CHOICE had an inside run to far turn while just off leaders while evenly along for show spot. FOURFIFTYSEVEN inside speed to the front led to
the stretch and stayed grudgingly in the final furlong. WEST COAST SONG unhurried to far turn, rallied along evenly in the stretch run with no late kick
when needed. PEACOCK ROAD unhurried to far turn between horses, with no response in the stretch run. QUEEN LEXI squeezed back with a tardy start
and never menaced throughout. GOLDEN STORM showed speed to the half with nothing left in the stretch run. CHIQUITA REINA had speed between
horses into the first turn, battled to far turn but stopped readily in the stretch run.

Footnotes
REEN CHILE inside speed to the stretch, kept on widened ridden out to wire. BAYTOWN BAMA GIRL good position to quarter pole, rallied along outside for
place. PRIX had a tardy start with no speed to turn, finished well for show. GOLDEN LAKE close up inside to the stretch, leveled off in the final furlong.
LITTLE MUSIC off rail trip to the turn, stayed on evenly in the stretch run. PARLAY CHARLIE raced between horses to the turn, backed out with no late kick
when needed the rest of way. INTERCEPTION never menaced throughout. YEHAWMEMAW shuffled back after the start and never threatened throughout.
DESPERATE TIMES never factored throughout. SILVER MAJESTY saved ground throughout to no avail. LADY ON THE GO bothered at the start and
never close. VIVIS IN FRONT reared in the gate, popped the doors opened prestart, broke through and after an inquiry into the event was declared a non
starter by the stewards.
