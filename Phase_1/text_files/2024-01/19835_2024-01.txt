JACKSON STRONG stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, challenged entering the stretch and
edged clear late. JOYFUL GHOST chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and dueled to the
wire but was outfinished late. PRINCELY GOD led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn and dueled in
the lane but gave way in the final strides. THE GOLDEN ONE chased the leader between horses early, navigated the bend from the three path and kept on
to the wire. GRAND ROCK raced off the pace through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and never threatened. SMASH FACTOR
tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the bend and weakened in the final furlong.

chased the winner home in the lane. MADEFORSUMMER tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept
on to the finish. CHRIS'S MOTOWN GAL raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up from the two path coming around the

leader up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path, swung wide into the stretch and was outkicked from there. BACHELORETTE hopped up
