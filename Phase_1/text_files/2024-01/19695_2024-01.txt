Footnotes
RAINBOW DAY angled in and took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole then rated the pace, drew clear toward the seven sixteenths pole, came
under pressure at the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail and held on under steady handling. RUN ROCKY RUN saved ground on the first
turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in leaving the turn and was gaining well on the winner.
CAIRO BREEZE rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, eased out
entering the stretch and dueled for third. MACHISTO rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five
path on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. LET'S EAT raced in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching
the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path then flattened in the lane. AGAIN WE MEET broke a step slow then bore out entering
the first turn, moved to the inside and gave chase from the half mile pole, steadied off the heels of SOUTHERN SAINT nearing the head of the lane, then
weakened. The latter raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
weakened. J G JETT had a brief early lead and moved to the inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole, dropped back toward the seven sixteenths then
roughed from tight quarters at the rail into the far turn and gave way. Run Cup became fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

DIVA ROSE took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, was pressed clear at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
dug in under determined handling to hold off the stretch challenge of JACKYSINTHECASTLE, who rated close to the pace inside, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, but was outfinished in a close stretch duel. PRINCESS HALO settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out mid-stretch and finished evenly. GLOBAL EMPRESS raced off the rail the
first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. WOODSONG'S CASTLE raced in the four
and five paths the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little in the lane.
LEMONSONDESURPRISE raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
flattened leaving the eighth pole. BLUE MOUNTAIN stalked the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded in the four path on
the far turn. LADY SPARROW showed little response.

Footnotes
STARSTREET rated a slim lead, responded to the challenge of Tunnel Vision leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge two deep on the far turn,
ran clear into the lane and held well under steady stretch handling. AKINGISALWAYSKING settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail into the far turn, was eased to the four path approaching the head of the lane and finished well.
STAVANGER saved ground well off the pace the first turn, gave chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in through
the lane to hold third. SURF CITY GOLD raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four
path and passed some rivals. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND raced off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and came
through the far turn about the five path, then flattened in the lane. SCHMEAR rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. TUNNEL VISION raced with the winner inside, challenged that one nearing
the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but weakened leaving the eighth pole.
