quarter and was steadily handled to hold on. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
steadily improved, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well while gaining on the winner. ROAD SLEW rated a slim lead, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was met past the five sixteenths, dropped back toward the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
flattened in the lane. NET WORTH raced in the five path the first turn then saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn near the rail but angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane and showed little further. DOCTOR PARDO raced with the early pace two
deep, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn. STRONG LIL KOKORO settled off the rail, picked up the chase past the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. AIR MEDAL and MISS YOU AJAX were not factors.

Footnotes
GRAND ESCAPE pressured the pace, was forced inward toward the three eighths pole and raced off the rail through the turn, took the nod three wide
leaving the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. STEVETHEVANDRIVER took a quick lead and angled toward the inside to set a pressured pace,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was met entering the stretch and relented the win, but dueled to take the nod for second. GRAND FIBER
chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then missed the nod in the stretch duel for second. LOADED SNIPER gave chase toward mid track through the
backstretch, raced two deep on the turn then flattened stride mid-stretch. JAZZ MAN DO chased the pace but was roughed off the heels of Grand Escape
approaching the three eighths pole, quickly recovered stride, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened mid-stretch. BUSTIN PIETRE gave chase,
rounded the turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. PROTA gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. THE ILLUSIONIST gave
chase but flattened off the rail on the turn. CAPE LOOKOUT gave chase then flattened in the five path on the turn. The Stewards reviewed and rejected a
claim of foul against the rider of Grand Escape for alleged interference on the turn, lodged by the rider of Loaded Sniper. Also reviewed, was a claim of foul
against both the riders of Stevethevandriver and Grand Escape for interference in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, lodged by the rider of Jazz Man Do,
which resulted in the disqualification of Stevethevandriver to fifth place for the above mentioned interference.

Footnotes
THUNDERHOUSE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was met at the rail through the far turn, but dug in
determinedly to hold off the stretch challenge of LITTLE RICHIE, who raced off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested
even terms two deep on the far turn and remained a close stretch factor. LORD CLANCY rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but showed little further. JUST MURPHY saved ground on the first turn then steadied off the heels of Little
Richie entering the backstretch, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane.
LOVETHEBAND stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the
lane. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn toward the outside and could only improve his position. ALEXANDER
GRADY stalked inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded toward the far turn. COLONIAL ROAD raced in the six path the
opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded toward the far turn. BOUNDTONOONE rounded the first turn in the five path,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

RAGTIME RICHES raced well back from early contention while saving ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved to take over the final
yards. IRISH WARLOCK rated close off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide in the vicinity of the quarter pole, raced
clear on the turn and dug in under steady encouragement through the lane, but was caught in the final yards. HIPPODROME stalked two deep, challenged
toward the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, but flattened into the lane. YOUNG TURK rated the pace inside, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the rail in the vicinity of the quarter pole then faded through the far turn. "The dense fog prevented noting paths
on the far turn".

second the final strides. THEWITCHISGONE settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead about the three path
approaching the top of the lane, dug in under steady handling but was caught while flattening stride inside the sixteenth pole. MISSIONSNINETYNINE
stalked two deep then closed to the lead approaching the three eighths pole and dueled from that point, was met approaching the head of the lane and
flattened inside the eighth pole. AUBURN MILL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was met toward the
three eighths, engaged in close chase from that point, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened from mid-stretch. GOLDEN APPEAL mostly saved
ground. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Thewitchisgone for alleged interference leaving the far turn, lodged by the
rider of Missionsninetynine.

Footnotes
O'CONNER SUNSET stalked the early pace two deep then took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled clear approaching the quarter, widened at the
rail on the far turn and was kept alert to extend that margin in the lane. CAPTAIN CREED rated a slim early lead inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole
and dueled from that point, but dropped back toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES
rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. ALLEN CAN DO
IT stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride in the four path on the far turn. MINISTRY OF MAGIC
settled in the three and four paths on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ROYAL PAIN mostly saved ground. TAP SECRET
settled close in the four path the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.
