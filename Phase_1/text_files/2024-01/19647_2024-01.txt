Footnotes
TRACK TYRANT secured good position to the turn while never far back, rallied in the late going and cleared off in the late going. TAPITBOY quick from
between foes to duel, stayed to deep stretch but outkicked to the wire while gamely holding the place spot. CASSIUS pressed pace to turn from two path
could not keep on in the late going and settled for show spot. TINO chased top pair to the quarter pole, could not go in the stretch with no kick when needed.
I FEELUCKY TONITE slow into stride from inside, raced along evenly, no late bid when needed. FIRE WIRE broke a tad slow and never menaced
throughout. STEAL THE RHODE never a menace throughout. SOLIDIFIED GOLD was through early outside and dropped back readily.

Footnotes
KRISPY RICE secured good position to the turn while perfectly handled, angled in with a burst to go clear to the wire in a good effort. NIGHT LIVIN no
speed to the turn rallied in earnest from quarter pole to wire. JURADICIAL off rail chase to turn, dueled into stretch, could not keep up. SOCIAL MANDATE
outside run to clear quickly, dueled past quarter pole, weakened. LADY HAMILTON failed to respond when called upon from the turn. SKYLERVILLE inside
chase to turn, dueled past quarter pole, weakened stretch. MUSED (GB) tracked trio to the turn with nothing left for the stretch run. ROCK THE NILE broke
a bit tardy and always trailed while never a threat.

Footnotes
DIVINA DULCE between horses to the front, set all pace and held sway to the wire under good handling. MAGNOLIA WIND had a tardy start, no speed to
turn, ran on gamely for place spot. LILY'S HOME rated kindly to the stretch, ran on in the stretch for show spot. CUTE KHLOE bobbled at the start, rushed
to contend to the turn, leveled off. KATE'S CONCERTO never threatened throughout. SALLY BALI broke awkward from gate and never menaced thereafter.
ALEATORY failed to menace throughout. ALWAYS DREAM BIG through early with a steady fade. BOURBON AND HONEY tried to keep up to the turn,
came up empty and gave in readily. NEOLITHIC NATION through early, dropped back and went wrong into the turn and subsequently vanned off following
the race. PER THE KENTUCKY HORSE RACING COMMISSION, MAGNOLIA WIND HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR INELIGIBILITY.

to quarter pole, rallied into the stretch with good energy while coming on too late. P K WOOD exchanged bumps at the start, raced along from the half and
closed the gap late. GUNLEATHER AL had no speed to far turn with a widest run on the wrong lead in the stretch and still closed the gap in the final furlong.
PERFECT PAINTING no speed to far turn with a steady outside run in the stretch run. LIAM THE BRAVE exchanged bumps at the start, raced along evenly
with no response. HUNTINGTON never menaced throughout. BOLSHIE sprinted to the front, stayed on to far turn with nothing left. ENGLISH TIDE off rail
run to far turn with nothing left and faded back readily. J'S NAUGHTY BOY bit tardy from the gate wide run first turn, dropped back. STOP THE SPREAD
chased leader to the half with nothing left and stopped readily.
