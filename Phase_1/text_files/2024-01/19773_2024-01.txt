Footnotes
BOARDWALK QUEEN broke out, brushed rival, pressed the pace, took command around the turn, pulled away and was kept to the task. RUN AWAY
SAMARI raced near the middle of the field, moved up around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FLYING I went to the front,
forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late kick. MISS CHARGE IT raced within striking distance, finished evenly and lacked a rally. PINTORA brushed
at the start, racing near the back, improved position, but was no factor. BELL PEPPER void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was no threat.
KETANJI always raced near the back and showed little. BOSTON BELLE raced in the middle of the field, faded and was outrun. GATSBY'S GIFT pressed
the early, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
FAHAN showed early speed, raced behind the two leaders around the final turn, while racing on the inside, angled out entering the stretch, made a late bid,
four wide and finished strong. ITWASTHISBIG pressed the pace, raced close throughout, took the lead down the home stretch, drove clear, but couldn't
match strides with the winner late. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear
third. MOON TIME lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no real factor. WOOD RIVER raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, improved
position, but was no threat. OXXON raced within contention, came around the first turn on the outside and faded. LO LO'S LAUGHTER showed early
speed, drove clear down the backside, saved ground around the second turn and faded. THUNDERTAKESDALEAD raced evenly near the back and was
never a threat. MAJESTIC MANDATE void of early speed and was never close. CABRO TORO challenged for the early advantage and dropped back.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC WAYS pressed the pace, took the advantage around the final turn, drove clear down the stretch and held on well for the win. MY FRIEND AMY
lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide bid, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. ANOTHER HOT
MESS raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. ANGEL'S MELODY showed early speed, saved ground
and faded. CUTE DINERO QUEEN went to the front, drove clear and faded. AKIANE'S SOLDIER lacked early speed and was never close. LUTIE MO
raced near the back, fell around the first turn and was vanned off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER
VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
DESPEIGHTFUL race in the middle of the field in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. GOOD
BY FAITH unhurried in the early part, made a late wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MISTY RUNAWAY lacked early speed,
racing in the back, made a late rail bid and got up for the show. SPOONFUL OF SUGAR vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and hung down
the home stretch. IDO SOLEMNLY SWEAR raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. LESLIE'S MISCHIEF raced evenly near the back,
finished wide and was never a threat. MIGHTY FLYNN pressed the early pace, made a bid, took the advantage and faded. MARY WHO raced within
contention, faded and was no threat late. INEZ always raced near the back and was outrun. LOW EURO CAT showed early speed and dropped back.
