GRAB THE GOLD set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead nearing the quarter pole and had a long drive and won that battle to hold on
gamely to prove best. CAJUN OCCASION pressed the winner three wide early, made a two wide bid to latch on to that rival and dueled for command
through the lane but just missed. NICK PAPAGIORGIO was rated early on the inside, shifted out by the nine sixteenths and made a four wide move on the
far turn but flattened out in the final furlong. HONORABLE AVENUE was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace four wide, then was three wide
entering the far turn and fell off the front two and moved in to be two wide by the quarter pole and weakened.

the inside, eased out and was three wide by the quarter pole, angled out to the far outside leaving the three sixteenths and had no kick. CRITICAL
THINKING chased the pace on the outside, four wide on the far turn and weakened. COPPERHEAD CREEK chased the pace in between rivals, then fell
back on the far turn and angled in to be on the inside nearing the quarter pole and tired.
