Footnotes
DUTCH MILLS took over just after the start, clear before a furlong, set all the pace in the two path, stayed clear the final furlong under steady handling.
MASTER OF DISGUISE in the second flight while along the inside, continued to save ground turn, moved closer to the winner through upper stretch then
proved no match the final furlong, game for the place. EXPRESS CRUISER away in good order, closest to the winner into and through the turn while
between horses, continued to chase upper stretch,lugged in a furlong out, also proved no match in the late going, outkicked for the runner up spot. LEAD
FOOT in the second flight while racing outside, three wide through the turn, had little left the final furlong. DIFFERENT FLAME off a step slow, raced back
and outside, three wide through the turn, widest in the drive, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. SUPERHERO failed to menace while
racing in the two path. EQUATE was finished early along the inside. HEXCEL fell back soon after the start, trailed throughout while savilng ground.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY NIGHT behind the leaders in the two path, called on for some run turning for home, challenged inside the leader past the furlong marker, proved
best under steady handling. DREAM STREAK in the second group outside, ranged up to challenge in the three path exiting the turn, dueled outside the
winner past the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner late, held sway for the place. ROYAL MEGHAN lacked speed for a half inside after
breaking a bit slowly, steered out three wide when beginning to advance turning for home, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late while outside
that one. SIMONA'S CHOICE forwardly placed along the inside, in some traffic turning into the lane, finished up evenly when clear. INVALUABLE lacked
speed, came four wide out of the turn, improved through upper stretch then flattened out a bit in the final furlong. WINYAH BAY off a step slow, raced back,
angled 3w out of the turn, passed some tiring rivals to better her position. NORTHERN DIAMOND off a step slow, trailed for a half, also passed some tiring
rivals. UNDECODED tired while racing in the two path. KOALA dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. EQUILOVE (IRE) dueled up front off
the inside, stopped through the stretch.

RAGING broke alertly, quickly sprinted well clear, breather late in the turn, reextended advantage past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under
steady handling. SIMOVIC off the pace, dropped inside turn, came in the two path for the drive, steadily getting to the winner late. MILLERS RITE off a step
slow, raced back, angled out four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to be well clear of the others. HAPPY TEARS chased the winner for a half off
the inside, weakened. MUSICAL MAESTRO behind the pace while out in the strip, three wide and in some traffic late in the bend, weakened. KANT
CONQUER ME saved ground while lacking speed, was finished before a half. MACHO VILLA lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn, faded
through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOHEMIAN BO took clear soon after the start, showed the way through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, not threatened in the run to the
wire. ONE TEN STADIUM last away, void of early foot, began to advance early in the turn, steered four wide into the lane, rallied well out in the strip to be
up in time for the place, no threat to the winner. NAVY SEAL in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground turn, shifted out for the stretch,
chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one, nailed for the place late. KING PEANUT went one paced three wide, lacked closing
response. PEACE DOG broke alertly, pressed the pace off the inside, crept a bit closer late in the turn, began to give way soon after, continued to weaken
in the run to the wire. ALLO ENRY remained back while racing off the inside. WILLOW CREEK ROAD within striking distance, moved closer four to five
wide late in the turn, stopped.

when headed by the winner entering the stretch. WYFIRE void of speed, raced three wide while remaining back through the turn, steered out in upper
stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. VIOLENT GIGI lacked early foot, in some traffic early turn, steered out four wide soon after, made
little impact through the stretch. CREEKMORE raced in the second flight while inside the winner, two path through most of the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SHADY EMPIRE broke on top, narrowly set the pace closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed when asked in upper stretch, drew clear while
drifting out nearing the furlong grounds, continued to increase his advantage to the wire. LIGHTNING STRUCK in mid pack early, dropped to the inside turn,
finished willingly up the rail to be up in the final strides for the place, not a threat to the winner. SPEIGHT AND MALICE lacked early foot, asked along in the
two path late in the turn, also closed with good energy, narrowly missed the runner up position. I'M WIDE AWAKE pressed the issue up the backstretch
outside, lodged a three wide bid late in the turn, could not keep up with the winner upper stretch, caught late for the place. ATOMIC TONE broke with the
winner, forwardly placed just off the inside, moved to challenge between rivals turn, faltered in the drive. W W CRAZY void of early foot, three wide turning
for home, improved position while not posing a serious threat. MONEY RUN in the second flight while off the inside, had little for the drive. AIR COMBAT
broke out and back, raced off the pace three wide, mild advance into the stretch, faded through the stretch. CIBOLO back off the pace outside, four wide
through the turn, tired. WALKER'S WIN finished early, stopped upper stretch after coming four wide out of the turn, distanced after losing contact with the
field, jogged in, was vanned off.

Footnotes
SULWE fell quickly back after the start, continued to lag into the turn, swung out five wide turning for home, closed full of run down the middle of the strip to
win going away. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER broke alertly, set the pace just off the inside, continued in the two path to be clear into the lane, extended that
advantage past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, held the place. CHAI TEA in the second flight along the inside, continued to save
ground turn, steered out into the two path exiting the turn, closed with some late interest to be gaining for the runner up spot. LASSIE MY GIRL near the
front while off the inside, three wide into the stretch, came up empty for the final furlong. HAMAZING DEBATE off the pace and the inside, moved closer four
wide through the turn, flattened out in the stretch. SASSY LASS broke back, lacked speed along the inside, continued along the rail into the lane, improved
position through some traffic. HOT SPRINGS BLING one paced just off the inside, three wide exiting the turn, continued in even fashion through the lane in
lacking a closing response. MOCHA KISS also turned in an even effort while racing three wide. SUMMORYA lacked speed, three wide trip through the turn,
made little impact through the stretch. LADY ASTRID raced back off the pace outside, floated out six wide by the winner turning for home, failed to rally.
WAR MUSIC was always outrun while racing four wide. SHUTUP PLEASE forwardly placed toward the inside, stopped through the stretch, trailed home.

MONEY SUPPLY settled off the pace just off the inside through the first turn, continued back, advanced and became prominent in the four path exiting the
final turn, bid, dueled final furlong, proved best. NOTARY settled off the pace off the inside, also advance while four wide midway on the final turn,
challenged late in that bend to gain the advantage, responded when the winner came alongside soon after, dueled, outkicked late. ESCAPOLOGIST off a
step slow, raced back and inside early while saving ground, angled three wide when beginning a rally late in the second turn, finished willingly to be up in
time for the show, not a threat to the top two. BEAR OAK lacked speed, came three wide into the lane when improving, also proved no match to the top two,
caught late for the show. ARDANWOOD broke on top, set the pace off the inside, faltered when headed turning for home. CAMP DAVID within striking
distance along the inside, came up empty for the drive. ROMAN CENTURIAN broke back and never menaced. OUTLIER pressured the leader from the
outside, dueled the middle half, gave way from between horses far turn. SAQEEL was finished after a half.

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL tracked the pace while inside and in hand, continued to stalk into the far turn, called on for some run far turn, challenged along the rail soon
after, showed the way into the stretch while coming off the inside a bit for the drive, clear a furlong out, enough left to withstand the next two in the waning
strides. ICE ORCHID off step slow, settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the four path second turn, fell back off the winner inside the furlong
marker then was trying to get back to that one late while proving stubborn for the second spot. BUTTERBEAN lacked speed early while inside, continued to
save ground second turn, eased out a bit for the drive, finished willingly late to be closing the gap on the winner while missing the place. LOVELY RIDE
broke outward but on top, set a modest pace in the two path, set a soft set of fractions, yielded readily to the winner while allowing that one the inside
second turn, continued to weaken stretch. TIZ A MACHO GIRL prompted the pace for six furlongs in the three path, had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RISING forwardly placed along the inside, steered out three wide when advancing on the leader late in the turn, collared that one from the
outside when straightened for home, came out a bit then drove clear late. SUN THUNDER unhurried in lacking speed for five furlongs, began to creep
closer far turn, came three wide for the drive, finished willingly to earn the place. RIVALRY broke on top, clear early, set an unpressured early pace,
continued to show the way second turn, responded when challenged by the winner turning into the stretch, proved stubborn until late. BEN DIESEL one
paced along the inside, remained within striking distance second turn along the rail, lacked a closing punch. BOLZY settled off the pace in the two path, also
lacked a winning kick when the real running began at the head of the lane. HARLOCAP back off the pace while four wide first turn, four wide in the second
turn, also failed to muster a rally in the stretch. TRACK MATE failed to menace while racing three wide. CANAVALL void of speed, moved a bit slow while
swinging out five wide into the stretch, flattened out. MAGNA TAP off a step slow, remained always back. J J'S JOKER forwardly placed off the inside, gave
way three wide turning for home.
