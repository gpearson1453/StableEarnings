Footnotes
THUNDER ROAD was unhurried around the first turn then moved up from between horses at the three furlong marker and split horses near the sixteenths
pole to drive past to prove best. TOTAL SURPRISE stalked the pace from off the rail then made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late rally.
RUNANDHIDE WIND was well placed down the backstretch then slipped through at the quarter pole to take the lead at the top of the stretch but was
outkicked in the final sixteenth. ONE MORE BABY raced in the middle of the pack from the two path then moved up around the turn to make a late run but
was too late. MESABI saved ground throughout but showed late interest on the final turn but flattened out in the stretch. OXXON was allowed to settle at the
back then steadily advanced through the final turn but failed to menace. FULL OF GLORY shared the command from the two path to quarter pole, edged
away but was overtaken by mid turn and tired. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN raced in the middle of the pack from three wide around the first turn then fell back
on the backstretch and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. LET'S GO RANDOM was forwardly placed to midway through the final turn and gave way. BELLO
CREEDO hustled to the front to share the command from the inside to the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
PEANUT N IKE was allowed to settle on the inside to the first turn then cut the corner to be off the pace on the backstretch then moved up to take the lead
at the quarter pole and drew clear late. NATIVE STAR went to the front to set the pace for a half then was headed at the quarter pole, battled to mid stretch
and gave way grudgingly. RUN ON ACES tracked the leaders from the two path to the final turn then saved ground into the stretch and passed tiring rivals.
DEAL WITH HIM prompted the pace to the first turn the started to fade and failed to menace. R T'S D'ORO was unhurried and never a threat. TOOCAN
DANCE raced in the middle of the pack from three wide to the final turn and dropped back.

HUNTERS GHOST vied for the lead from three wide and took the lead at the three furlong marker but was challenged to the quarter pole and edged away
to draw clear into the stretch. MIAS MOONBEAM was unhurried to the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch and made a four wide bid on
the final turn and dueled down the stretch outside of GETCHA and was up for the place. GETCHA raced six wide into the first turn then stalked the pace
from four wide made a bid on the final turn, dueled down the stretch inside of MIAS MOONBEAM and missed the place. AMERICAIN JOEY raced off the
pace on the inside to the final turn then moved out to two wide in the turn but was outfinished in the stretch. LOUIS LE GRANDE trailed the field in the early
stages, steadily advanced down the backstretch and gave a late run to improve position. FAST VERDICT roused to the front to take a pressured lead to the
three furlong marker and matched strides to the quarter pole but kept on and tired in the stretch. BIG MONEY MACHINE saved ground around the first turn
then made a middle move on the backstretch but failed to sustain the bid. COOLCROSS broke well to press the pace from the inside to the three furlong
marker but lacked room into the final turn and dropped back. MOTATAABEQ showed little.

AMERICAN SMOOTH was allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved out to five wide for a bid at the leaders and ran them down in late stretch to
prevail. MARKS PROMISE rushed up to vie for the lead from three wide around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, moved up and
took the lead at the quarter pole but was challenged by JOLLY TOMMY on the outside to the wire and was out kicked by late closer. JOLLY TOMMY
tracked the leader down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the final turn and matched strides on the outside of MARKS PROMISE and gave way
grudgingly. HEZA PICKLE was allowed to settled through the first turn then started to move up on the backstretch and launched a five wide bid for a late run
but was no match for the dueling duo and the late closer. GRUNT sprinted to a pressured lead and was eclipsed at the five sixteenths pole, tired. KNIGHT
COMMANDER rushed up to press the pace from the two path to the quarter pole and stopped.

Footnotes
SIMPLE SUNDAY rushed up to stalk the pace from three wide then made a four wide bid at the quarter pole to engage the leader at the top of the stretch
and fought gamely to prevail. THE GREY BEAUTY rushed up to race off the pace through the final turn then moved up to engage the leader at the three
sixteenths pole and took a brief lead at the eighth pole, matched strides in the stretch and was out kicked late. BLESS D'SOUTH bobbled at the start and
was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a two or three wide bid on the final turn, angled out to six wide in upper stretch for a late rally. KAPPA
HILL raced near the back to the first turn then steadily advanced from two to four wide around the final turn and gave a late try but was not enough. JUST A
WIN saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack, slipped through at the top of the stretch for a rail bid but was outfinished. ELIZABETH RENEE
raced off the pace while saving ground through the final turn and lacked the late response. T R'S FIRST raced back and showed little. IRON BANNER
tracked the leaders to the three furlong marker and retreated. SADIE'S RANSOM sprinted to a clear lead to the quarter pole but kept on and was collared at
the three sixteenths pole and tired.

DAT GUITAR stalked the pace from the inside to the final turn then made a two wide bid and moved between horses in the final yards to be up in the final
jumps. NEW DESTINY raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn, went four wide at the three furlong marker to make a run at the leader but drifted
out in early stretch and made a late run but was outfinished. WORLD OF HURT was allowed to settle to the final turn then made a two wide bid and angled
out to five wide in upper stretch for the late rally. KAN SHE raced off the pace down the backstretch then made a bid to engage the leader at the quarter
pole and took the lead at the three sixteenths pole, drew clear but was denied late. MOLLI WAY was unhurried down the backstretch then made a rail bid on
the final turn and was empty in the stretch. NOWNOWDANCER went to a clear lead to set the pace for a half then was challenged at the quarter pole and
gave way. EVERLYN'S ANGEL prompted the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and faded. AFLEET CHARLENE raced in the middle of the
pack while saving ground but was not a factor. BEAT THE DOUBLE was unruly in the gate and never a threat.
