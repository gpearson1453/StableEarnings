Footnotes
PINK WHITNEY stalked in the two path, ridden along outside a rival then three wide into the lane, fought three deep into the final furlong and edged away in
the deep stretch. ELLIE MOORE (IRE) rank early chasing along the rail, tipped two wide on the second bend, bid between rivals in upper stretch but got
outkicked by the winner the late stages. NAKOTA (IRE) prompted the pace from outside, moved up on even terms on the second bend, carried a short lead
into the stretch, put away inner rival but was soon confronted by a pair of rivals from outside, relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on for third.
ENGLISH DANGER settled inside, saved ground while ridden along on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. REAL QUEEN settled early
in the two path, asked right handed on the far turn, steered out at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. SPIRIT RULES stepped to the front and moved
inside, set the pace under pressure from NAKOTA (IRE), headed by that rival on the far turn, overtaken into the stretch and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
ARHAM raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter through the early stages, roused on the far turn still giving chase from the two path, drew alongside
IT'S MY HOUSE approaching the eighth pole and wore down the runner-up. IT'S MY HOUSE showed good early speed and controlled the pace from inside,
coaxed along leaving the far turn, asked left handed in upper stretch, clung to a narrow lead with a sixteenth to go and yielded late. REDLINE tracked two
wide outside a rival early off the pace, angled in for the far turn and came under a ride, moved out a bit in upper stretch then came back to the rail in the final
furlong and kept on willingly for third. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH stalked from inside then began to climb and moved off the rail on the first turn, chased three
wide through the far turn, raced within range with a furlong left to run but finished evenly late. EASTBOUND climbed from inside early then settled at the
back, lagged behind through the far turn and was not a factor.

SHIP AND SCAM brushed leaving the gate, tracked inside a pair of rivals from the two path into and around the turn, tipped out to launch a bid in the lane
and drove past CITY OF ANGELS late. CITY OF ANGELS pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader around the bend, took over at the eighth pole,
led into deep stretch but got outkicked by the winner. SAND TO SEA stepped to the front from inside, dueled on the turn and into the lane, lost command at
the eighth pole and yielded to the top pair in the furlong grounds. TOPPERS WAGER broke in and brushed rival, got crowded between foes at the
nine-sixteenths pole, chased three wide and between runners on the far turn, then weakened down the lane. HOT LEGS ROMOLO rank in the early going,
stalked three deep or four wide into and around the bend, then weakened in the stretch.

PHENOM set the pace outside STRESSED up the backstretch before clearing at the seven-sixteenths, crossed over entering the turn, padded the lead
around the bend and powered away when asked. NEW COLLECTION (GB) broke a step slow from outside, dropped back and angled to the inside, saved
ground through the bend, tipped out in the lane then drifted out further at the sixteenth pole and gained the place. STRESSED pressed from inside then
chased after the pacesetter leaving the backstretch, traveled along the rail to the stretch, drifted out in the final sixteenth and got outkicked for second.
ALTERNATE ROCK stalked in the two path, moved out into the lane, floated out at the sixteenth pole and could not rally.

ELTONSINGSANOTHER sped clear and set the tone early, remained unchallenged through the turn while saving ground, roused in upper stretch and drew
off when tapped right handed and was ridden out late. RYDER'S CANDY broke well then took a stalking position four deep, chased three deep into the turn,
entered the lane two wide outside a rival, made light contact with that foe at the top of the lane, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and churned
on to best the rest. WARREN'S PARADICE stalked from inside to the lane, brushed with RYDER'S CANDY at the top of the stretch and got outkicked for
second. BLAZING BARDOT raced up close three deep then got pinched between rivals past the half-mile pole, rounded the bend three to four wide and
could not rally. PLUM CREEK bumped with JAZZY BOO early, chased two wide around the bend and failed to menace. JAZZY BOO broke a bit slow,
bumped with PLUM CREEK early, chased between rivals and two wide around the bend before tiring in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TEEN DRAMA stalked the lone leader outside YOLO CALLS to the stretch, collared the leader past the eighth pole, took with a sixteenth remaining and
lasted over the runner-up. A NEW PEACE broke a step slow and bothered leaving the gate, chased on the inside, got put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole,
shifted out to the two path, angled out in upper stretch, rallied widest and missed. DULCE EMMA tracked two wide to the stretch, moved out, rallied in the
lane but lacked the needed final kick. YOLO CALLS stalked from inside, drew closer around the bend, tipped out with a furlong remaining, looked to bid
between the top pair but lacked room at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out late. GRITTY GIRL sped clear and showed the way early, led along the rail
through the turn, challenged from outside with a furlong to go and yielded in deep stretch. GYPSY LYNN tracked from inside out of range, moved off the
fence in the lane and kept on trying to the wire.
