Footnotes
DIVINELY DIVERSE came out two paths at the start, sent clear on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, opened up in upper stretch and throttled
down by rider late when the race was won. LAMPY had an adventure in this trip, steadied off heels along the inside mid backstretch, tried to hold position
into the turn and floated out and bumped rival into the turn, kept in a tight and uncomfortable position by inside rival entire turn, rider finally had enough and
took up mid turn, regained stride and had to alter inside in upper stretch, implored by rider and easily outkicked rival for second. MISSING MAURICE
allowed to settle and stalked the pace along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, launched bid unimpeded along the rail and edged out outside
rival for show. CATHEDRAL LIGHT tracked pace three wide on the backstretch, heading into the turn, was bumped by inside rival, continued three wide on
the turn, entered lane in the four path, kept to task under urging and edged out in a three way photo. SAN JAC off slow and pushed out at the start, stalked
pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, swung widest into the lane and made belated progress. HELICOPTER PILOT away
well, contended for early lead, ceded lead mid backstretch, chased along the inside on the turn, allowed to drift out late in the turn into the three path, battled
for second until succumbing approaching the final sixteenth and tiring. SMUGGLER'S COVE bumped at the start by inside rival, stalked pace in between,
early on the turn was struggling to keep up, and continued to lose ground rest of the turn, entered lane a galloped along to the wire.

good try. KEVINS WISE CORONA came in/bumped start, missed 3rd. SCORCHER sandwiched start, evenly. DOUBLE A EAGLE sandwiched start, no
menace. NYTRO broke out/bumped start, drifted in, weakened. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW, KEVINS WISE CORONA, WAS DISQUALIFIED
