Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE rated nicely off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run and made a steady
advance into the second turn, raced two to three wide approaching the quarter marker, was roused three wide into the stretch and battled for the lead
heading to the furlong pole, took command at mid-stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drew clear in the end to prevail. GALLANT WARREN
was away a step slowly from the start and was allowed to settle in the early running, maintained a two wide path while unhurried through the backstretch
run, went two to three wide into the second turn and waited a bit behind rivals approaching the quarter marker, rallied into the stretch, split rivals at the
furlong marker and continued his bid into the final sixteenth, closed willingly into deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure the place. BRONZE
WARRIOR close up in the early running, stalked the pace from a two to three wide path into the backstretch run, stalked the decent fractions to the half-mile
marker, gained ground two wide along the far turn, loomed into upper stretch and battled with OH GREAT heading to the furlong pole, was outkicked by the
winner into the final sixteenth and was tagged on the wire for the place, while just holding for show honors. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE tracked the decent
early pace from the outside, went four wide into the backstretch run and tracked the pace to the half-mile pole, chased three to four wide along the second
turn, swung five wide for the drive and improved position at mid-stretch, could not muster the needed late response and was outfinished in deep stretch.
LOOKOUT POINT settled while saving ground early on, made a steady inside gain along the backstretch and into the second turn, tipped two wide for the
drive and continued his steady bid into the stretch, could not find more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. OH GREAT (IRE) broke alertly and was
sent to establish the early advantage, dictated terms while setting decent fractions along the backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn, was
confronted into upper stretch and battled to the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the late stages and gave way. MADE THE TEAM tracked the decent
early pace, was guided outside of runners into the second turn and gained ground three to four wide at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JOHNNY PAYCHECK vied for the early lead with DRUMADOON, ceded to that rival and stalked the decent pace into the turn, got in a bit tight past the
three furlong marker and lost ground heading to the quarter pole, angled three wide nearing the top of the stretch and re-rallied at the furlong marker, battled
for the lead approaching the sixteenth-marker and took command into deep stretch, dug in in the final strides while under pressure from the runner-up and
gamely lasted for the win at the wire. RUTHERFORD paused at the start and was away slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the rear, saved ground
into the turn then came in tight approaching the quarter marker, was blocked into upper stretch and checked in tight quarters past the three-sixteenths
marker, found a seam along the inside at mid-stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, battled with JOHNNY PAYCHECK into the final strides and just missed
for the win, while besting the rest in a good effort. DRUMADOON vied for the lead away from the start, assumed command and set a decent pace heading
into the turn, was pressed along the bend by RANCHO RED and battled with that runner into the stretch, held foes at bay inside of the furlong marker, was
overtaken by the top pair into the final sixteenth and held well for third at the finish. RANCHO RED tracked the decent early pace from the outside,
advanced into the turn and pressed the pace two wide to the quarter marker, battled with DRUMADOON into the stretch and continued to fight while
between rivals approaching the sixteenth-marker, could not muster the needed late response and weakened in the final stages. EL CAPRICHO broke a bit
awkwardly but was away in decent enough order and tracked the early pace from the inside, chased between runners to the quarter marker, tipped three
wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. ANTHONY'S BEST rated off of the decent early
pace while not far back, chased outside of runners along the turn and came three to four wide approaching the quarter marker, swung widest into the
stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong pole and gave way.

Footnotes
TRULY FABULOUS broke well but settled well behind the pace duel, saved ground through the turn then launched a bid with three furlongs to run, tipped
out to the three path for the stretch run, finished strong and held off a late challenge despite drifting out down the lane. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN was not asked
for speed from the break, remained in the clear to the outside through the turn, responded when asked to quicken passing the five-sixteenths pole, swung
out four wide into the stretch and finished well under steady handling and intermittent urging while being floated out by the winner. SUPERSONIC FLYER
broke sharply and dueled with BACALAR as the two opened up on the rest, finished well enough considering the early pace duel but was outfinished in the
final sixteenth by the top pair. BACALAR hooked up in a speed duel with SUPERSONIC FLYER to the inside, battled that rival to mid-stretch then weakened
passing the eighth pole. TEN THE SMART WAY chased the dueling leaders to the turn, came under a ride passing the three-eighths pole but did not
quicken, took an odd step near the three-sixteenths pole as the rider attempted to force a change of leads, lost momentum and was allowed to gallop out to
the wire.

Footnotes
OUTER SUNSET broke alertly, ceded the early lead to PONDERGATING and stalked that runner through moderate fractions heading into the turn,
advanced into the turn and attended to the moderate pace approaching the quarter marker, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, closed nearing the sixteenth-pole
and drew to even terms with PONDERGATING into deep stretch, made a final push just before the wire and bested the game runner-up for a determined
win. PONDERGATING broke in a step at the start, was hustled to show speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, set moderate
fractions while well handled into the turn, led into the stretch and held foes at bay to the furlong marker, dug in when confronted by OUTER SUNSET
approaching the sixteenth-pole, gamely battled into deep stretch, was bested in the final strides and outfinished the rest to be second best. BETTOR BET'R
close up away from the gate, took back and tracked between runners approaching the half-mile marker, was shuffled back a bit nearing the turn and was
guided three wide heading to the quarter pole, maintained that three wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, shifted out and raced
widest into the final sixteenth, closed into deep stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final stages and got up for third at the wire. DESERT RUMBLE
rated off of the early pace and tracked from the second flight to begin, saved ground into the turn then waited for racing room at the quarter marker, found
room into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, gained ground at the furlong pole and came within aim at mid-stretch, could not sustain her run into
the final sixteenth, weakened and just missed for third. AUTISM COUNTS was crowded by a neighboring rival at the start and broke slowly, was void of
early speed in the early stages, was a bit hard to place into the turn and chased three to four wide to the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and did not
factor.

Footnotes
OLD TRIANGLE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and settled two wide into the first turn, was a bit keen into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate
pace to the half-mile marker and was well placed nearing the second turn, gained ground approaching the quarter pole, angled four wide for the drive and
chased into the stretch, rallied while widest into the final sixteenth and responded to urging into deep stretch, vied for the lead in the final strides and got up
at the wire to prevail. COME OUT FIGHTING was prominent leaving the start, assumed command and set the pace into the first turn, was well handled into
the backstretch run and set moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, came under pressure into the second turn and was challenged by CLASSY CITY at
the quarter marker, battled with that rival into the stretch and retook the lead at the furlong pole, dug in while leading into the final sixteenth, was confronted
by OLD TRIANGLE in the final strides and was tagged on the wire for the win, while holding safely for second in a game runner-up effort. CLASSY CITY
hustled away from the start, was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the pace into the backstretch run, attended to the moderate pace to the
half-mile marker, went up and challenged COME OUT FIGHTING into the second turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter marker, battled with COME
OUT FIGHTING into the stretch, lost a bit of ground nearing the sixteenth-marker while continuing to fight, could not muster the needed response in deep
stretch, was outfinished and just held for third. KEEP MOVIN' ON was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from
the outside into the backstretch, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker then was outkicked approaching the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final
sixteenth, encountered a bit of late traffic and just missed for third. PRECEDENT LUKE off a step slowly leaving the start, rushed up and stalked three deep
into the first turn, took back and tracked while well placed through the backstretch run, loomed at the half-mile marker and vied for the lead three wide into
the second turn, was outkicked into the stretch, chased while within aim of the lead into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. HALF THROTTLE allowed to
settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was unhurried into the backstretch run, lost contact along the second turn and did not factor in

Footnotes
AMANOFMYSTATURE was hustled from the break, seized the early lead, opened a length on the field through the turn while traveling well, responded
when set down in the stretch and held all at bay in a solid effort. DUPLICATION broke in sharply and slammed into MAGICISTHEMOONLIGHT, spotted the
field a head start then was taken in hand at the rear of the compact field, bided time and saved ground through the turn then navigated out to the four path
for the stretch run, responded to strong handling and intermittent urging to rally for second. JERSEY BABE broke well and raced near the head of the pack
that was chasing AMANOFMYSTATURE through the early going, moved three wide to challenge for the lead passing the five-sixteenths pole, ran on well
under strong handling but failed to change leads, was unable to reel in the winner and was passed for second in the shadow of the wire.
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE broke outward and was bumped hard by DUPLICATION, steadied and then was slow into stride, rushed up into contention down
the backstretch while racing one off the rail, then had to steady slightly in traffic near the five-sixteenths pole, rebid and was in contention to mid-stretch then
flattened out. RESPOND was away in good order and raced close up early then dropped off the pace a bit, traded a couple of bumps with JERSEY BABE
going into the turn, bid five wide around the turn then swung into the stretch in the six path and finished evenly. DI LAURIAN was off a step slowly then sent
hard for the lead, chased AMANOFMYSTATURE through the turn with several in close pursuit, weakened passing the 5/16, dropped back and was outrun
down the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE got away well and was up in the early mix, raced between horses on the turn then exchanged bumps with
RESPOND going into the turn, tried to mount a four wide rally but was done passing the five-sixteenths pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

NO SECRET broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, carved out modest fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the
way into the second turn then was confronted by a pair of rivals into upper stretch, battled while holding a narrow lead at the furlong marker, dug in while
under pressure into the final sixteenth, held the runner-up at bay in deep stretch and determinedly kept to task in the final strides to prevail. PASS THE
BATON stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path through the backstretch run and stalked three wide into the second
turn, was well placed approaching the quarter pole and was roused three wide into the stretch, loomed into upper stretch and battled for the lead
approaching the furlong marker, vied outside of a pair of rivals into the final sixteenth, gamely battled with NO SECRET into deep stretch and was denied for
the win, while besting the rest. HYDRO FROST was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace into the first turn and attended to the
modest fractions approaching the half-mile pole, kept close attendance to NO SECRET into the far turn then was given his cue and battled for the lead into
the stretch, vied between runners and was repelled into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and held safely for third. BID ON
THE PRIZE was allowed to settle, raced two wide and between runners into the first turn, got in tight entering the backstretch run and checked at the
eleven-sixteenths pole, tracked the modest pace while between runners heading to the half-mile marker, chased two wide to the quarter pole then waited for
racing room nearing the top of the lane, tipped three wide into upper stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the leaders in the final stages.
GRACEFUL MISCHIEF settled leaving the start and saved ground into the first turn, never far back through the backstretch run, maintained a rail trip into
the second turn, swung to the two path into upper stretch to avoid a fallen rival and lost a bit of ground into the stretch, mildly re-rallied in the final sixteenth
but did not threaten in the late stages. INCREDIBLE SHOT settled three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path through the backstretch run
while tracking the modest pace, mounted a three then four wide bid at the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong
marker, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. O B'S tracked the early pace from the inside, was well positioned while saving
ground through the backstretch run, gained ground into the second turn, took a bad step in upper stretch, was pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LEADING THE PACE broke sharply and was sent to the front, was pressed by HOT CAKE to the turn, shook that one off at the five-sixteenths pole, opened
up on the rest when set down passing the three-sixteenths, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and won well clear in the end while hand urged to the
finish. LIFESBEENGOODTOME lacked speed and dropped far back in the early going, was put to a drive with three furlongs to run, tipped three wide for the
drive, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and got up for place honors at the finish. CONEJO MALO broke well but was outrun in the early going, settled
near the rear through the first quarter mile, dropped in towards the rail going into the turn, waited behind horses through the turn then angled out to the four
path for the stretch run, finished well under steady urging and just missed for second. RUNNIN UTE took a light bump from FAR TOO LONG after the break,
steadied, then angled over to the rail to avoid any more interactions with that foe, rushed up the rail to join the early mix before the turn, waited through the
turn then tipped out into the clear for the stretch run, had only the winner to catch turning for home but flattened out mid-stretch. JOEY BRACKETS chased
the dueling leaders four wide down the backstretch, launched a bid under a drive from the three furlong marker, lost ground at the furlong pole, mildly
re-rallied in the final sixteenth but needed more in deep stretch. FAR TO LONG ducked in sharply at the start and bothered RUNNIN UTE, then was outrun
down the backstretch despite the best efforts of the rider, steadied and altered course to the outside near the seven-sixteenths marker, chased two wide to
the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive and failed to threaten in the final furlong. PAKAS SECRET stalked the decent early pace between rivals,
gained ground along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final stages. HOT CAKE broke well and pressed the decent early
pace, kept pressure on LEADING THE PACE while two to three wide approaching the quarter marker, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
