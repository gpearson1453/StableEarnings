in mid stretch. UNDER THE OVERPASS , four deep into the first turn, bumped with IMAGINIZED mid way on the bend, chased the winner, was in the two
path around the far turn and weakened through the stretch. IMAGINIZED , a forward factor in the three path between horses the first turn, steadied when
bumping with UNDER THE OVERPASS mid way on the bend, moved to the inner rail on the backstretch, chased the pace and weakened. NEVER GREW
UP , no factor, saved ground around the far turn then swung wide in upper stretch. TIZAWINNER , outrun, drifted four wide turning for home. TIK TOK
DADDY broke in the air, circled both turns three wide, tired and was eased.

Footnotes
CAVALRY COMMAND broke on top and secured the inside, set a rated pace while handling some outside pressure, responded to firm asking and opened
up leaving the quarter pole, continued to increase his advantage past mid stretch and was kept alert to the wire. BOCA GUY , under a firm hold saving
ground off the early pace, eased out through the backstretch run, commenced a run between rivals while under a ride past the three eighths, angled four
wide approaching the stretch, made a grinding advance through the furlong and just got up for the place. FOOD FOODIE , brushed at the break, prompted
the pace outside the winner, gave hard chase as that one got away in upper stretch, continued on with good effort in the last furlong but was nipped for
second. VOTETHEMALLOUT saved ground in mid pack, was called upon leaving the three eighths, eased out past the five sixteenths, edged up between
foes in upper stretch then flattened out. MAJOR CAM , three wide early prompting the pace, angled in towards the rail through the backstretch run, gave
pursuit past the three eighths, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. LANGLEE AVENUE , brushed at the start, raced off the pace and two to three wide,
was pushed along between runners leaving the far turn, lacked a response leaving the five sixteenths and weakened. APPENDAGE lost ground four wide
through the backstretch run, failed to kick on entering the far turn and faded. SUPERSTITIEUX broke a step slow and never threatened. LONG LIVE NOW ,
hung out four wide through the opening half mile, angled in, failed to go on under a ride leaving the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
LADY CHARLOTTE cleared leaving the chute, dictated the pace while saving ground, was guided two wide entering the lane, opened up under a drive in
mid stretch, drifted out some late and held sway. CLUCK CLUCK edged up inside early to stalk the pace, moved off the rail around the turn and pursued
outside a rival, was floated out to about the four path entering the stretch, dug back in through the final furlong and gamely bridged the gap. CALL
ANOTHER PLAY rated behind rivals into the turn, chased two wide past the three eighths, moved towards the rail into the lane and closed steadily. FEELIN
SO LUCKY , taken to rate early on and dropped inside, moved up into the turn, chased to the inside of CLUCK CLUCK mid turn, started wandering outward
soon after, continued to drift out in the lane and faded. FUNZALO lagged back four wide, circled five wide into the lane but lacked a rally. TINA TINA TINA
broke outward, corrected and raced three deep stalking the early pace, was under pressure leaving the far turn, failed to kick on and dropped back.
KAPATUDE gave early chase two wide and faltered.

Footnotes
ASHLEE'S RING stalked off the rail, was put to a strong ride leaving the five sixteenths, came four wide for the drive, closed in past the furlong grounds,
forged to command in deep stretch then prevailed. CANDY ARCADE settled off the pace and off the inside, was astutely guided towards the inner rail mid
turn, cut the corner into the lane, stayed inside and finished well to just miss. CORA'S CHOICE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, drifted out
under pressure near mid stretch and weakened very late. BABY SOX stumbled at the break and was away last, regrouped and raced far back into the turn,
angled out with some momentum into the lane, worked between rivals near mid stretch and churned on. EXCLUSIVE ROSE , taken in hand early on while
saving ground and well off the pace, stayed inside into the lane and finished with interest. POLICE WOMAN , off the pace and off the inside, circled six wide
into the stretch and offered a slight kick. FLITTER , in tight at the break, saved some ground early, came out around the turn, shifted five wide pursuit in
upper stretch but lacked a finishing kick. BALI HAI rushed up between rivals early, chased off the inside, came four to five wide for the drive and faded.
KENTUCKY REIGN had speed outside the leaders, chased around the turn, raced four wide in upper stretch and weakened. VIXSINZKELTKBANSHE , well
placed inside, angled out under pressure into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch, faded and was eased late.

GOLD DIGGING BROAD sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was under steady encouragement through the stretch. NORTHERN
GLOW , a forward factor along the inner rail throughout, chased the winner and was second best. THE HAUNTED ROOM , four wide the first turn, chased
the pace outside the winner down the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep, remained on her left lead in the stretch and weakened.
SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE , no factor well off the inner rail, swung wide in upper stretch. GUN RUNNIN' GAL lacked speed, offered a mild move along the
inner rail on the far turn then retreated through the stretch. BOSSYNESS , four wide both turns, faltered.

Footnotes
DEEDS OF LOVE , nicely rated off the duel while saving ground, advanced towards the rail past the five sixteenths, angled four wide into the lane,
quickened under some hand urging and cleared a furlong out, was put to left handed asks near the sixteenth marker and dug in to prevail. CHICKAHOMINY
, bumped at the break, raced in range while outside the winner, moved up between horses near the quarter pole, swung out five wide soon after,
straightened and closed gamely. LIQUIDATOR sparred between runners heading to the turn, emerged in a battle outside LASSIE'S NOTION mid turn,
gained a slim advantage in about the three path in upper stretch, ceded to the winner heading to the furlong grounds then faded late. LASSIE'S NOTION ,
bumped at the start, rushed up leaving the five eighths, angled in and bid to the inside of a pair foe foes, dueled to the three sixteenths then weakened
through the last eighth. WHATSYOURBIGIDEA , three deep vying for early command, was under asking trying to keep up mid turn, could not go on soon
into the lane and weakened. ANGEL ART stalked in the clear early on, chased three to four wide mid turn, was fanned five wide entering the lane and
faded.

Footnotes
CHIEF RON stalked the pace outside horses, circled the turn three wide, rallied outside, took command near the sixteenth pole and edged clear. SUMO ,
sent to the early lead along the inner rail, opened up on the turn, drifted off the rail in upper stretch, finished willingly but missed. WHAT DOES IT TAKE
saved ground around the turn, angled out approaching the sixteenth pole and rallied. ONE TEN lacked speed, raced off the rail on the turn, swung to the
four path at the head of the stretch and had a slight rally. PERFECT DAY broke well, showed speed outside the winner down the backstretch, remained in
the two path on the turn and weakened. SPEAK UNITY , unhurried, was no factor.
