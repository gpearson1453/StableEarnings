upper stretch, took a short lead outside the furlong marker, battled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging.
COLLECT FROM IKE stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the advantage with three furlongs to run,
spun into upper stretch under a drive, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong maker, kept on with that foe into the final sixteenth but was
ouitfinished while able to get the place. MEMPHIS settled at the back under some urging, shifted from the two path to the three path early on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly to just get the show. MUDVILLE NINE bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was roused
leaving the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the turn, shifted five wide into upper stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and just missed the
show. SOUTH STREET was ridden along near the back, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.
SCREW LOOSE was taken in hand early then tracked the pace, moved to the lead with five furlongs to run, lost the advantage in the two path at the
three-eighths pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. OPPORTUNITY SET was well placed just off the pace, came under encouragement outside the
half-mile pole, dropped back while inside on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. PINE
VALLEY broke awkwardly and was last away, moved up to get the lead, lost the advantage with five furlongs to run, dropped back late on the backstretch,
fell further back along the rail on the turn and faltered then was also eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
CUPIDS GIRL four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged away under
a drive kept to task. SIMPLE SUGAR prompted the leader from the outside three wide before advancing to take command near the five-sixteenths, came
under threat to the outside and yielded the front before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and
along second best. JACKSON AVENUE chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with seven-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
weakened. WARTAPPED showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths when under
threat to the outside, yielded the front at that station, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. MADDIE'S SURPRISE chased inside early on
before tipping three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five wide three furlongs from home, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.
DIAMOND COLLECTOR chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, suffered an injury near the quarter pole and was placed

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, made a bid between horses at
the quarter-pole, took the lead while coming four wide into upper stretch then shook clear, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best
under steady urging. KILLY START broke in and bumped with a foe then was taken up and dropped back, was urged along on the outside, went five then
six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. JACKIE THE JOKER was bumped at the start, raced just
off the pace while rated, went three while asked wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the
show. MERAVIGLIOSO broke in and bumped with a foe, was well spotted just off the pace, made a bid along the rail with a half-mile to run, took the lead
outside the three-eighths pole, lost the advantage in the two path into the stretch and proved no match for the winner then was caught for the trifecta. DIVA
BANKER was bumped at the start then forced in and off a step slow, moved up under urging near the nine-sixteenths, chased inside on the turn and tired.
MIDTOWN ROSE pressed the pace, chased in the four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, raced between foes near the furlong marker and
weakened. HONORABLE LILLY went to the front, showed the way under pressure, lost the advantage while in the three path outside the three-eighths pole,
spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. OUR LITTLE TIGER was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased five wide on the
turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
LINCOLNVILLE BEACH chased four then three wide advancing given some rein to work with near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive taking narrow command a furlong out, battled on gamely to repel the runner up and prevail at the end. MENDED WE STAND broke out
at the start bumping LOCKBOX, dueled early on from the four path with SILVER FIST to the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn, shook away
from her main pace rival at the five-sixteenths and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, fought on
through to the finish. LOCKBOX got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe and came under hustling, chased five then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. ROJA LIGERA chased six then five paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and kept
on to the finish. BERN ROSEY BERN coaxed from the gate, trading a handful of bumps with SILVER FIST, chased along the inside coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and offered no response. FULIGNI chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no rally. SILVER FIST lunged at the break stumbling when striking the ground and
traded a series of bumps with BERN ROSEY BERN, dueled from the two path down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn until shaken
off with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
MORETHANAFEELING stalked the pace on the inside of a foe, turned up the pressure while outside the leader in the three path on the turn, gained the
advantage outside the quarter-pole, shook clear when asked for his best in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. AMEDEUS MUSIC bumped
with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, was urged along near the back, angled from three to six wide early on the turn and improved for the place.
LOCKE AND KEY broke out at the start, settled just off the pace on the outside, went five wide early on the turn then dropped to the three path near the
three-eighths, moved back to the five path later on the bend and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. SIGNAL CORPS bumped with a
rival a the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path with three furlongs to run, lost the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, moved out behind the winner in upper stretch and tired then just missed the show. HORSE BE WITH YOU raced just off the early pace, was
urged along passing the five-eighths pole then dropped back, moved from the four path to the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. LEO
AND ROYAL tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and tired. AULA was urged along off the pace, went five then four wide on the
turn and failed to respond. NOBLE HUNTSMAN broke a step slow, raced near the back, dropped from six to three wide on the turn, brushed with a rival in
upper stretch and was no factor. SHPILKES dropped back while urged along, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and failed to threaten.
SHARED SUCCESS was well placed early, passed the nine-sixteenths under coaxing, dropped back inside to the two path on the turn, brushed with an
opponent in upper stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
STARSHIP DEFIANT pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead just inside the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear while
put to a drive in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. ROYAL POPPY was urged along on the outside, chased five wide on the turn and
narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. TAMING THE TIGRESS settled at the rear of the field, was urged in the three path on the turn,
dropped to the two path coming to the quarter-pole and improved to just miss the place while clear for the show. DESERT DALLIANCE bumped hard with
rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. DOWNTOWN MISCHIEF chased the pace down the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and tired. STONEWALL STAR bumped hard
with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path
and came up empty. PEAK OF CHIC bumped soundly with a rival at the start then was hustled, moved up to set the pace under pressure from both sides,
vied in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the rail, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenth and capitulated. BANK ON ANNA was urged along off
the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
