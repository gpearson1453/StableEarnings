Footnotes
MOTOR CITY pressed the pace, took the lead around the turn, pulled away down the lane and finished well. WAY OUT FRONT vied for the early lead,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. OOEY GOOEY CHEWY raced within striking distance, made a
mild bid, but proved no match for the top two. UPTURNED BRIM challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and weakened. HE'S ALL
EARS got away slow, racing in the back, improved position, but was no factor. GRACIOUS KAT lacked early speed, racing evenly near the back and was
never a factor. TUSSLING CHARLIE reared at the start, raced in the back, finished wide and was never a threat. CARRY THE FLAG raced near the middle
of the field, faded and was outrun. KONTEEKEE dueled for the early lead, blew the turn and was distanced to the wire.

Footnotes
J C'S IN TOWN raced within contention, moved up around the final turn, made a bid down the stretch and outfinished MIND ON MY MONEY for the win.
MIND ON MY MONEY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner late.
DOUBLE TRAP unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, proved no
match for the top two, but was a clear third. SMOKY TOPAZ raced evenly in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SCARY FAST
SMILE dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and faded. U S NAVY CROSS void of early speed, improved position, but was no
threat. BIG BROTHER lacked early speed and passed tired ones. TEMPRANO pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. REVENIR raced within
contention, came around the first turn wide and dropped back. NOW NOW MAN always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
BLUE RIDGE QUEEN vied for the early lead, saved ground, took command around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. SIMPLE
PLEASURE unhurried in the beginning, racing near the middle of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
TENSAS BERTIE pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. SCRAPBOOK was an early factor, racing
close throughout and weakened down the home stretch. ATOMIC ROSE was fractious in the gates, raced in the rear in the early going, moved up, but was
no factor. SENSE OF FLURRY raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. MADISON'S SCREEN dueled for the early advantage, saved
ground and faded. BE A BANDIT void of early speed and was never close. SPLICER came around the first turn on the outside, trailed the field and showed
little.

TENNESSEE MOON vied for the early lead, drove clear down the backside, was collared by RAIN, around the final turn, put her away, pulled away down
the stretch and was kept to the task. BLESSED ANNA pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but
was best of others. ROSES ARE GRAY void of early speed, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two.
RAIN showed early speed, racing behind TENNESSEE MOON, challenged her for the lead around the final turn, could not keep up and faded down the
stretch. FOUR PRINCESSES lacked early speed and passed tired ones. GIMME CANDY raced within contention and faded. FASTED lacked early speed
and was never a threat.

COOL RIDE sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was ridden out. CAJUN CYCLONE had a tight start, racing near the back, moved up
quickly, pressed the pace, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. WICKED PUNCHES unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside
around the final turn, made a late gain, but was no match for the top two. NOT LIKELY lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a
wide mild bid, but was no factor. HANGIN' TUFF raced within contention, was forwardly placed throughout and weakened late. MATZOH BALL raced in the
middle of the field and put forth an even effort. I NITA WARRIOR broke in, pressed the early pace and faded. KAH NIGH void of early speed, raced outside
around the first turn and was never a threat. ZESTINY always raced near the back and showed little. ROCKING TOBE raced in the middle of the field and
retreated to the rear.
