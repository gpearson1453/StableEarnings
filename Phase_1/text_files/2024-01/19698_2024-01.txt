VILLANITO advanced to the front three wide midway on the turn then held rival safe through the stretch under steady pressure. FREE BIRD BORDO trailed
close up, bid four wide on the turn, loomed a threat could not get by the winner. LUCCA'S LEGACY led narrowly in the two path then faltered in the stretch.
GOLD DILEMMA dueled along the inside then was finished by the top of the stretch. AHUATZI raced close up three wide early then stopped before half a
mile.

Footnotes
MIZZEN MAN vied in the two path, bid inside to the front om the turn and held on gamely. GOLDEN WILDCAT advanced four wide on turn, brushed ribal at
the top of the stretch then was outdueled late. LONG LEGGED BOY moved wide on the turn, brushed runner-up top stretch then weakened late. BOOM
BOOM KABOOM dueled in the two path to the stretch and yielded. HARLEY'S CHARLY lacked speed, advanced outside then flattened out. EDDIEMUSH
dropped back very wide and was never a factor. UPFOR PAROLE led along the inside opening quarter then faded on the turn. ALONZO MOSELY dropped
far behind and was always outrun. STARSHIP GOTHAM lacked speed and failed to respond. WHERESTHEPASSION broke poorly and raced far back
throughout. WHISKEYMAC stumbled at the start, rushed up inside and stopped. Claims of foul by the third finisher against the top two finishers for
interference in the stretch were both dismissed.

Footnotes
LAYTOWN dueled with a narrow lead outside, repelled that challenge and edged away under a drive in the final furlong. MARGIN OF AIR vied with winner
along the rail then yielded in the stretch while easily second best. EGOT A POKER FACE settled just behind the dueling leaders then flattened out. ROAN
MOUNTAIN dropped far behind then advanced inside with late energy. BRILLIANT CHASE raced wide throughout and lacked a response. MAXIMUM
IMPACT trailed for half a mile, moved extremely wide on the final turn while outrun. AHSAD raced off the pace, faded on the final turn and was no factor.
LEMON CREEK LOUIE saved ground off the leaders and gave way readily. MANAYUNK was urged close up wide for half a mile and stopped.
