Footnotes
WILKINSON WARRIOR quickly sprinted clear, was collared into the stretch then gamely held rival safe through the final furlong. INSPECTOR went after the
winner on the final turn, loomed a threat but could not get by. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT saved ground off the pace and continued well for the show.
EXCLUSIVE ORDER trailed far behind, angled wide on the final turn with a mild bid. KEEP DEM TALKING raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter for half
a mile and gave way. LOGAN'S RUNNER lacked speed in the two path and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
MAGICAL MONARCH was bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside, responded when challenged on the far turn, turned back the bid from GOLD
DILEMMA, pulled away, then drew off under urging in the lane. GOLD DILEMMA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, bumped
PRALINEPOPSBOTTLES near the five furlong marker, bid two wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner, then dug in to hold second.
PRALINEPOPSBOTTLES was bumped at the start, tracked inside, then was bumped and forced to check near the five furlong marker, chased on the far
turn and lacked a rally. WONTCATCHHIMTODAY was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, continued three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn
and tired. AWESOME FRIEND raced four wide early, stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn and gave way. JAMAICAN WAR CRY raced off the
rail, off the pace, dropped far back and jogged home. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident near the five eighths marker, the raced was declared official.

then raced in traffic in the final sixteenth. NINJA PRIZE was hustled up to duel along the rail to the stretch and faltered. TAP IN FORMATION earned a
narrow advantage between foes for half a mile and faded.

the pace, pursued the winner to midstretch and stopped. CAUTELOSO chased off the pace and lacked a response. SETTE STELLE raced wide off the
leaders and faltered. PRINCIPE lacked speed and gave way readily. NOMAR'S HOPE hustled to the front inside, was collared at the three eighths pole and
