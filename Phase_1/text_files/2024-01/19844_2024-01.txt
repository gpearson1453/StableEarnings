well placed early, chased the pace on the inside on the turn and then finished willingly but needed more. STARLITE WALKER moved up to press the pace
from the outside, three to four wide on the turn and faded in the drive. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was reserved early, swung out five wide leaving the turn and
had a belated rally. ZIP IT SCOTTY was settled early and three wide on the turn and had no rally. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY chased the pace on the inside

back three wide leaving the nine sixteenths marker, then came again three wide off the far turn and was up to be second best. SIMPLE SOUVENIR was
allowed to settle early, made a inside middle move to be in contention by the half mile marker, then chased the pace on the inside on the far turn and
weakened, bested rest. NAIL POLISH vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace and move to the inside, then was headed on the far
turn and tired. WILL OR WON'T was allowed to settle early, made a two wide middle move and then chased the pace four wide on the far turn and tired.
