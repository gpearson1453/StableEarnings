Footnotes
DEAR LADY within striking distance three wide, ranged up to challenge four wide late in the final turn, edged clear upper stretch, drifted in a bit a furlong
out, held the runner up safe late. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE raced unhurried early while in hand, continued up a snug hold onto the backstretch, advanced and
dropped to the rail when moving to challenge midway on the final turn, briefly dueled with the winner into the stretch, moved out when that one drifted in with
a furlong to run, little in the way of any late gain. ONE MORE KELLY chased the leader in the three path, moved a bit closer far turn, lost some position in
traffic entering the stretch, regained the show spot while not a threat to the top two. STOIC LUNA lacked speed along the inside, steered out four wide
turning for home, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. SUNNY ISLE BEACH went one paced while racing outside. BIG BAD DIVA
last to leave, trailed well back, failed to menace. ENCHANTED NILE sprinted clear to set the pace just off the inside, stopped when headed.

Footnotes
LOCHMOOR outrun in the early going, crept closer in the two path late in the turn, behind some traffic into the lane, roused, full of run in collaring the two
leaders from the inside, quickly clear. MACHO ROCCO broke sharp, set or forced the pace off the inside, vied into the stretch between horses, proved no
match for the winner late, narrowly gained the nod for the place. MAHOMEY settled behind the pace along the inside, two path into the lane, narrowly
missed the place. ATTA PARTY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, closer four wide turn, vied into the lane, held a narrow advantage a furlong
out, faltered in the late going to lose the place. BLAME J D in mid pack while off the inside, three wide into the stretch, went evenly the final furlong.
HOLDING PATTERN broke back, raced four wide through the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. READY SHOES off a step slow, trailed for
a half, steered out four wide, displayed some mild late interest to also improve position. CLASSY SOCKS vied up front along the inside, gave way. REEF'S
DESTINY asked early, remained back in lacked a closing response. MACHO RONNIE off the pace and the inside, five wide through the turn, tired in the
drive. STOMPING HOTROD four wide into and through the turn in the second flight, also backed up through the lane. TWISTED DIXIE off a bit slow,
remained always back.

Footnotes
MASTER OF ARMS broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, shook clear past the furlong marker, kept to task. VALE settled off the pace, angled out to be
four wide for the drive, roused, finished up willingly to be slowly getting to the winner. MAHONEY ROAD tracked the winner from along the inside, steadied
along the rail late in the turn, came in the two path for the drive, went evenly the final furlong. STUD LOVIN chased the winner from the three path for a half,
second flight past the furlong marker, weakened. UNSTABLE PRINCE void of any early foot outside, four to five wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally
while remaining well out in the strip. ASSET BASIS broke back, trailed early, three wide into the lane, swung six wide into the stretch, finished up belatedly.
BIGTIME TEGRIDY saved ground to no avail. PERMAFROST lacked speed, also saved some ground through the turn, lacked a closing response. QUICK
BUCK prompted the early pace four wide, began to fade before a half. CONTRABANDISTA failed to menace in remaining back. SMACKZILLA in mid pack
for a half, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
ROYAL ACT forwardly placed inside, tipped out and moved to engage the leader turning into the lane, roused, bid past the furlong marker, wore that same
rival down under firm handling. THAT KHENNY broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, breather into the far turn, continued to show the way into the
stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late while inside that rival. WHAT A COUNTRY last away, void of speed inside, continued to save ground into
the lane, improved as a result, prove no match for the top two. NOMOREMRNICEGUY lacked early foot, continued to lag final turn, improved through some
traffic. CHISHOLM TRAIL chased the runner up from off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. DREWPOWER lacked early speed three wide,
continued back, five wide turning for home, lacked a serious closing response. MAJOR CONTENDER in mid pack while four wide through the first turn,
moved closer with a mild middle move while remaining in the four path second turn, flattened out in the drive. I'M CRENSHAW ion mid pack while in the two
path, slightly closer upper 3w, flattened out. GEORGIA DEPUTY forwardly placed for a half, began to falter.

Footnotes
SISTER KISSES forwardly placed along the inside, lodged a rail bid midway on the turn, dueled into the lane while remaining closest to the inside, drove
well clear the final furlong. WINGS FROM ABOVE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, allowed the winner the inside turn,
dueled with that one into and through upper stretch then could not keep up. HARTLEY in mid pack and inside, improved into the stretch, failed to muster any
late gain on the top two. THE PRINCESS SAYS pressed the issue early while between horses, chased the top two past the furlong marker then had little left
late. CARTEL QUEEN in mid pack while racing in the two path, three wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. OUR BET lacked speed just off the inside,
was never dangerous. VOW in mid pack and three wide, continued in the three path through the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. SINGING EMMA
last away, remained back. SHELL SHOCK was finished early. SEA PEARL forwardly placed while racing four wide, backed up through the stretch. SWEET
NELLIE was always outrun and finished well back.

Footnotes
MAXIMUS MAGIC broke out, was straightened and dueled into the first turn, continued to alternate up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed into
the stretch, drew well clear under steady handling. PATRIOT HILLS dueled up front inside the winner for six furlongs, proved no match in the drive while
lasting for the place. CRUSADING in the second flight off the inside, getting to the runner up late. RIVETAGE void of speed while four wide first turn,
continued outside, four wide again in the second bend, improved position. HIGGINSVILLE off a step slow, trailed for six furlongs, angled out when beginning
to advance exiting the final turn, finished up willingly while too late. QUEBRANCHO four wide in the first turn, evenly paced up the backstretch, four wide
again through much of the second turn, lacked a closing response. GOLDEN PLATE four wide in the first turn when slow to settle, steered in a bit late in the
final turn, came up empty for the stretch run. COASTAL BRINK floated out break, second flight while four wide first turn, continued within striking distance
on the outside into the final bend, tired in the drive. PET SOUNDS broke back, made little impact off the inside, five wide turning for home, no rally.
SMACKOVER LIME in mid pack early, steadily faded. HONEST OPINION was finished after a half.

Footnotes
MISTER ICEMAN never far back, four wide into the stretch, moved 3w closer late in the turn, clear a furlong out, held late. BOURBON BASH in mid pack
while in the two path, in some traffic into the turn, asked along in the two path late in the bend, angled to the rail and finished willingly to be clear for the
second spot. W W SCOUT'S HONOR forwardly placed toward the inside, also encountered some traffic into the turn, saved ground then angled out a bit,
three wide for the drive, outkicked second, saved the show. SINNER'S SIN broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, weakened for the drive.
HAPPY IS A CHOICE off step slow, lacked speed outside, five wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, lacked a closing punch. UNDERHILL'S TAB
void of speed, swung four wide into the stretch, improved position with some mild late interest. BETTYS CASH pressed the issue up front for three furlongs
then gave way in the turn. PLAUSIBLE DENILE void of speed, dropped to the inside late in the turn, failed to produce a rally. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY
remained back while four down to three wide turn. HEY EUGENE tired while five wide through the turn. TIRICO off a step slow, moved up to race in mid
pack early while three wide, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
CATCHING FREEDOM raced unhurried early just off the inside, continued to track into the far turn just off the rail, steered out four wide late in that bend,
lost some ground to the leaders into the stretch as a result, was set down when straightened for home, accelerated with a late surge out in the strip to win
going away at the end. JUST STEEL light bump break, settled off the pace and the inside, three wide advance into a striking position through the second
turn, bid into the lane on the outside, put a head in front a furlong out, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. INFORMED PATRIOT
raced in mid pack while toward the inside, moved slightly closer along the rail turning for home, moved to the outside, challenged for the place late,
outkicked. GETTYSBURG ADDRESS jostled at the break to be back early, continued to trail, angled out three wide turning for home, mild interest, not
enough for the show. MYSTIK DAN broke out, was straightened to pressure the leader off the inside, lodged a bid between horses second turn, briefly led
between calls upper stretch, faltered from between horses. LAGYNOS took command after the start, set a legitimate pace toward the inside, gave way when
headed turning for home. MO WINNING in a bit tight at the break, rank in the first turn when slow to settle, had little for the drive while just off the inside.
CHAPERONE four wide through the first turn when four wide, continued outside, three wide second bend, failed to rally. FIDGET four wide through the
turns, had nothing for the drive.

positions. MONEYSTRIKE dueled up front closest to the inside, first to blink in the turn. HARD LUCK HENRY unruly prior to the start, raced within striking
