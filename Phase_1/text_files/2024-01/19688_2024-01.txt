with SOPHIA'S PRINCE and held that rival off to the wire. SOPHIA'S PRINCE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving
ground around the bend, bumped with READIER in upper stretch when that rival drifted in, and continued to battle to the finish to narrowly miss.

and kept on in the lane. KADAR INDY bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, trailed the field early, saved ground around the turn and improved
position mildly in the stretch. BARFLY raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the three path and
showed no kick. THE BIG CALICO raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. VICTORY

Footnotes
MY NAME'S JEFF hit the gate leaving it, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn
and held clear to the wire. KAPRIZOV hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the
two and three path coming around the turn and chased on to the finish. HORSESHOE PATSY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position in the lane. CALL EM KARL raced in the middle of the pack between horses early,
swung out to the five path coming around the turn and finished evenly. D LOVER raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around
the bend in the three path and passed tiring horses in the lane. SUPER BUSTER trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path
and never threatened. TIZART tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and faded in the stretch. YOU
BACK chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane.

began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear late. MACHO GIRL tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend and chased on to the wire. STYLISH ANNA led the way on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the
run, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the finish. GRAND LADY INDY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the bend from
the two path and finished evenly. R FIREBIRD pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and
weakened in the lane. MORNING REFLECTION bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around
the turn in the three path and never threatened. APRIL APRIL chased the leader between horses through the opening stages, swung out to the five path for
the run around the turn and faded in the stretch. WEDDING BLISS bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, settled off the pace on the rail for the
run up the backstretch, raced into traffic and stumbled nearing the half mile pole, steadied to save ground around the turn and made no bid. LUCY THE
GOOSE hit the gate leaving it and was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and was
empty in the lane. AUSTRIAN KITTY stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the five path and tired in the stretch.
