Footnotes
ON THE DOT broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, floated out to the four path and was coaxed in upper stretch, and inched away into the final
furlong under a drive. VAYESTA prompted the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into
the lane, and ran on for place. SMART JENNY stalked in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch,
and kept on for show. COLLECTED DREAMS pressed the pace in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, was floated out to the five path
turning into the lane, but began to drift in after the eighth pole while fading. LADY MONIQUE got pinched and had to steady at the start, trailed in the two
path, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, but did not factor. NIPSEY raced off the pace along the inside, tipped outward under a drive around
the turn, but made no impact from the seven path in the stretch. CAJUN DOVE rated in the four path, tipped into the two path and was roused passing the
three-eighths, but weakened from the two path in the final furlong. FREEWAY FAME chased in the three path, shifted inside and was under coaxing going
into the turn, but was no menace.

Footnotes
IN A JAM stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. OSCAR'S WORLD
raced in range two wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn and was clearly second best in the lane. HEARTENED saved ground
off the pace, angled two wide near the quarter pole and rallied to gain the show in the final strides. FOUR TOP raced two wide in midpack, kept on in the
lane and was narrowly outfinished for the show. RAPTURE BAY was bumped after the start, raced off the pace three wide, angled further out turning for
home and improved position. SIMSOUM saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. YANKEE DRUMMER was bumped twice and forced to check
soon after the start, trailed two wide around the first turn, went six wide around the far turn and was never a threat. GOT SUNNY was bumped twice and
forced to check soon after the start, saved ground off the early pace, went five wide around most of the far turn, swung eight wide near the quarter pole and
had no rally. FARM TEAM failed to menace while racing four and five wide. PARAKEET (IRE) chased the pace three wide and was through after a half.
OCALA ROCKET set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. KUWAIT TOWERS broke outwardly, bumped a foe soon after
the start, chased the pace four wide faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
MUSIC CITY STAR set the pace inside, was cued when challenged by an outer foe midway around the turn, rebroke along the rail turning into the stretch,
and drew clear of that outer challenger inside the final furlong. FOUR DAWN laid up close in the four path, bid under a nudge in the three path midway
around the turn, was cued from the two path into the stretch, and kept on, but was repelled passing the eighth pole to place. STARSHIP NALA chased in the
five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, and was one paced in the five path down the lane for show. SIMPLIFY (ARG) prompted the pace in
the two path, but faded in the three path down the stretch. FLAKES bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, but never
threatened in the seven path down the lane. LYNX bumped with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MIGHTY MEKONG stalked the pace three wide, took over near the sixteenth pole and forged ahead. ETENDRE dueled along the rail for a half, put the pace
rival away in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner in the final sixteenth. VALUED CAJUN tracked the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally but
held for the show. CAJUN FOOL stumbled at the start, raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. FAR FROM A STAR had his head turned at the
start, raced off the pace four wide and was one-paced through the lane. WHITE SERIES dueled two wide for a half and tired. PAISAN had only brief speed
inside. MISTER COOPER broke slowly and trailed throughout.

JOE DI BAGGIO rated in the three path, was roused along the rail midway around the turn, cut the corner to take command at the top of the lane, and
kicked away in the two path under a drive. PURE SPEIGHT got fractious in the gate, stalked in the five path, ranged up under coaxing passing the quarter,
tipped out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for place. RAGTIME BLUES bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the
four path, was cued to bid passing the three-eighths, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, and faded to show. VERRAZANOINTHESKY trailed in
the four path, was driven into the stretch, angled out passing the eighth pole, but made no impact. THE LAST FACT bumped with an outer foe at the start,
set the pace in the two path, was ridden into the turn, but yielded from the three path in upper stretch. EARTH chased in the three path, was ridden in the six
path around the turn, and did not threaten. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR tracked in the two path but never menaced.

ADIOS BABE tracked the pace three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes, reached near even terms between rivals near the
sixteenth pole and dug in gamely inside of MAJORY PRYCE to narrowly prevail. MAJOR PRYCE settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the turn,
swung seven wide in upper stretch, closed outside, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole but was narrowly outfinished. GIRVIN GIRL dueled two wide
between foes, led to the sixteenth pole and held for the show. SADIE BEAR saved ground off the pace, bid inside of the pacesetter in midstretch then
flattened out. GITANA saved ground and failed to menace. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA trailed three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and never
threatened. MINXY dueled inside to upper stretch and tired. PRINCIPIA pressed the pace three wide and faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
QUALITY G laid up close in the two path, loomed a threat under confident handling in the three path around the far turn, was roused from the four path into
the stretch, and inched past an inner foe in the closing stages. FREDO set the pace inside, was roused early into the far turn, dug in from the three path into
the stretch, but was edged out by an outer foe to place. RUSE raced off the pace inside, was cued along the rail midway around the far turn, and kept on for
show. AMERICAN DIAMOND stalked inside, was cued midway around the far turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, tipped into the two path
passing the eighth pole, and stayed on. BLAMETHEGOODTIMES was unhurried in the three path early, coaxed along the inside into the far turn, angled out
to the four path in upper stretch, but made no impact. JAMESTOWN raced in midpack from the two path but flattened between foes in upper stretch.
HAKKIMI (CHI) raced wellback in the four path, was coaxed in the two path midway around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch,
but was no factor. CAMILO rated in the three path, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, but did not threaten. MACKILLOP tracked in the three
path, was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but weakened.

TAPIT THREE TIMES stalked the pace two wide, angled four wide turning for home, took over in midstretch and drew off under a drive. REZASROLEX set
the pace in the two path, yielded in midstretch and held well clear of the rest. PAYNTER'S PRODIGY broke slowly, raced off the pace under a hard hold
early, circled five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran on for the show. MAGICSHADOW saved ground off the pace, made
some progress in the two path in upper stretch but could not sustain that run. SEVERANCE saved ground and failed to menace. PIRATE RADIO raced in
range four wide, dropped back nearing the quarter pole then checked leaving the eighth pole. PAPA DO PAPA DO chased the pace five wide around the
first turn and three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. TENTH MOUNTAIN prompted the pace three wide and faltered in the stretch.
FLIGHT CATCHER played no factor while racing five and six wide.

lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. LIFE'S AN AUDIBLE raced wellback in the three path, was coaxed in the four path midway around the far turn,
angled out to the center passing the eighth pole, and rallied for place. WASKESIU had an awkward start, chased in the five path, floated out to the six path
under a drive into the stretch, and kept on for show. MADAME MISCHIEF rated in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the far turn,
was in tight between foes in the two path passing the eighth pole, and mildly stayed on. BUTTERCREAM BABE tracked in the four path, was ridden around
the far turn, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, but flattened late. DANCING N DIXIE bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two

that foe but held well clear of the rest. HERMOSO HOMBRE failed to menace while racing three wide. STEELER MISCHIEF had only brief speed four wide.

Footnotes
TOCAYO settled around the first turn to set the pace along the inside, was confidently handled rounding the far turn, cued from the two into the lane, kicked
away into the final furlong, and held sway. AGATE ROAD rated in the three path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the
stretch, and ran on for place. DEPICTION trailed in the three path, was cued in the two path early around the far turn, angled out to the seven path in upper
stretch, and kept on for show. EDGARTOWN stalked inside, was nudged along the rail into the far turn, coaxed passing the five-sixteenths, but was one
paced in the stretch. FRONTLINE WARRIOR laid up close in the two path, was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, but
faded. WINE COLLECTOR chased inside, but had to steady going into the far turn, and was eased thru the stretch.
