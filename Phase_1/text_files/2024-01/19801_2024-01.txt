Footnotes
BLOSSOMING broke best but ceded the lead to LYINATTHEBAR, stalked the slow pace set by that rival two wide under stout restraint for the initial
half-mile, was let loose approaching the seven-sixteenths marker, pulled clear passing the quarter pole, opened up a bit in the stretch under strong handling
and held off a late bid from HAPPY IS on the outside to prevail. HAPPY IS reserved off the early pace while always traveling well, waited to make a move
until after passing the five-sixteenths pole, responded when given the cue to go on, turned for home three wide and ran on gamely but was unable to reel in
the winner. LYINATTHEBAR was sent from the break, seized the lead on the first turn, slowed the pace down with BLOSSOMING and KERRYGOLD LADY
in close attendance, held sway to the far turn then was unable to respond when BLOSSOMING took command, ran on with good courage but was
overtaken by HAPPY IS for second. KERRYGOLD LADY lunged, stumbled slightly and came away awkwardly at the start, recovered and was quickly up
with the leading group on the turn, stalked three wide down the backstretch under light restraint, then roused leaving the five-sixteenths but did not go on,
came into the stretch on the wrong lead and could not improve. RIVIERA SUNRISE raced three out from the rail mid-pack but not too far off the pace, was
not able to keep up when the pace of the race quickened on the far turn, came under pressure but had little to offer for the stretch run. ENGEE OMBEE
lacked speed, went through the first turn in the three path, continued to chase the field to the far turn, saved a bit of ground through that last bend but was
never a threat.

Footnotes
IMPLICITLY was crowded a bit by a neighboring rival at the start and was off a step slowly, allowed to settle in the early running while not far back, tracked
the decent pace from the outside and was well placed heading into the turn, roused three wide into the stretch and loomed nearing the furlong pole,
confronted GRIT AND CURIOSITY and battled that runner into the final sixteenth, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and kept to task in a drive for a
determined win. GRIT AND CURIOSITY broke alertly, ceded the early lead to SPEEDING STYLE and stalked that runner to the half-mile marker, advanced
into the turn and pressed the decent pace two wide to the quarter pole, battled into the stretch and took a narrow lead approaching the furlong pole, was
confronted by IMPLICITLY inside of the furlong marker and fought with that rival into the final sixteenth, was bested in deep stretch and held clearly in the
end for second. SPEEDING STYLE broke a step slowly away from the start, was hustled to establish the early lead and set the pace to the half-mile marker,
was engaged into the turn by GRIT AND CURIOSITY and disputed decent fractions with that rival to the quarter marker, battled into the stretch, lost position
at the furlong marker, was not able to keep pace with the top pair into the final sixteenth and weakened. MY SUNSHINE broke in a step at the start and
crowded IMPLICITLY leaving the break, raced close up to the early pace while in a bit of tight quarters and checked nearing the half-mile marker, lost
position into the turn and chased to the quarter pole, lacked a response in the final furlong and did not factor.

Footnotes
ARCTIC BREEZE grabbed the lead before the first turn without much effort, was allowed to set pedestrian fractions for a half-mile, shrugged off a bid from
YO BABY at the quarter poll, opened up and won as the rider pleased. YO BABY broke well then took up a stalking position behind ARCTIC BREEZE
allowing that one to dictate the pace with open lengths back to the next horse, kept close to the far turn then launched a bid for the lead from the
five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the runaway winner but finished well clear of the third finisher. UNION HEIRESS was content to race at the back of
the field to the half mile marker, raced three wide through the far turn while launching a rally from the three furlong pole, came into the stretch four wide, kept
on well under handling and won the bob for third. SOLO SOLATAIRE (IRE) was not asked for speed from the break and settled towards the rear of the field,
was content to remain there through the early going then was asked to go on with three furlongs to run, showed some mild late interest but was nosed out
for a minor award. FAR FAR AWAY raced mid-pack in the early running following just behind AGUILA DEL RIO for the first half-mile, passed that one near
the three furlong pole, tried to rally in the stretch but flattened out. AGUILA DEL RIO raced at the head of the rest of the field chasing the top pair, was asked
to go forward towards the leaders approaching the half mile marker, went into a drive near the three-eighths pole to keep up but was unable to do so and
dropped out of it before the stretch.

ROCKET RIBBON hustled to establish forward position leaving the start, tracked the fast early pace from the inside, was well positioned into the turn and
tracked RAMATHORN to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive and loomed nearing mid-stretch, battled with RAMATHORN inside of the furlong
marker, took command into the final sixteenth and kicked clear in deep stretch to prevail. AUTISM PUZZLE bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly,
recovered and tracked the fast early pace from the outside, maintained a three with path to the quarter marker and chased into upper stretch, closed well
inside of the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and outfinished the rest to be second best. RAMATHORN broke alertly and
assumed command away from the start, showed good early speed and dictated terms while clear into the turn, extended the lead while carving fast fractions
to the quarter pole, came back to the field into upper stretch and maintained the lead to the furlong grounds, met the bid of ROCKET RIBBON approaching
the sixteenth-marker, could not go on with the winner into deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. CLEAR THE COAST
was prominent away from the start and chased the quick early pace, ran in pursuit two wide into the turn then chased between rivals heading to the quarter
pole, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. HALF THROTTLE lacked early speed, saved ground into the stretch and did not factor.
ZEN STATE broke in the air at the start and spotted the field to begin, trailed to the quarter pole, swung to the four path for the drive, was not able to make
an impact in deep stretch but did show good late interest.

Footnotes
MAJOR TOM vied for the early lead then assumed command away from the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, was well handled through the bend
and carved out decent fractions to the quarter pole, held a narrow lead over HOT JOURNEY into the stretch and battled inside of that rival to the furlong
marker, was kept to task while holding foes at bay into the final sixteenth, dug in into deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in a blanket finish. HOT
JOURNEY broke alertly and vied for the early lead, ceded a narrow advantage to MAJOR TOM and pressed that rival through decent fractions into the turn,
closely attended the pace into the bend and took a short lead at the quarter marker, battled outside of MAJOR TOM into the stretch and continued to duel
inside of the furlong marker, was held at bay into the final sixteenth and was gamely bested for the win in the final strides, while just holding for second at
the finish. SENOR DEL CAMPO rated off of the contentious early pace and tracked from the inside, was well positioned while saving ground into the turn,
waited for racing room while boxed in at the quarter marker, found a seam into upper stretch then angled three wide approaching the furlong pole,
responded to urging into the final sixteenth and rallied in deep stretch, could not get by the top pair in the final strides and missed for the win and place,
while clear of the rest for the show. RESERVE PROOF broke in the air at the start and spotted the field to begin, tracked the solid pace from the rear in the
early stages, improved position nearing the turn and gained ground four to five wide at the quarter marker, maintained a wide path into the stretch, ran
evenly to the furlong marker while within aim, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. WEE BEASTIE took back off
of the contentious early pace and tracked from the second flight, was guided three wide leaving the half-mile pole and rushed up to press the pace into the
turn, pressed three wide and between runners to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch, chased to the furlong pole and weakened in the final
sixteenth.

Footnotes
RHONDA'S COOKIN was allowed to settle from the break and content to track the pace for the first half-mile, saved ground and waited until the far turn to
make a move, built up some momentum from the five-sixteenths marker, came into the stretch two wide then tipped out another path into the clear, drifted
out a little but rallied strongly under intermittent urging to pass the dueling leaders at the wire. CHURCH HARBOR broke well, secured the rail and was
contesting the early pace when forced to check at the seven-eighths pole, then opted to back off and track the pace from a length or two behind, moved
forward on the far turn and went to challenge FINLEY'S KITTEN approaching the three furlong pole, found that foe tough to get by, exchanged light bumps
as they dueled down the stretch, got a narrow advantage late but was passed on the far outside at the wire. FINNLEY'S KITTEN broke outward then was
sent from the outside to vie for the early lead, secured the lead at the seven-eighths pole after putting CHURCH HARBOR in a little tight, opened up a bit
turning on to the backstretch while racing two off the rail, fended off an early bid to the inside from FRESNO CHILE, tried to quicken away around the turn
and had to deal with a challenge to the outside from CHURCH HARBOR, dug in, kicked away, then battled that rival gamely for the length of the stretch with
both getting passed by the winner at the wire. GETAWAY CHARM came away best but was beaten to the turn, went three wide and tracked the pace from
the middle of the tight pack, bid three wide from the quarter pole but was outfinished down the stretch. FRESNO CHILE was allowed to settle near the back
through the early stages, pulled up into the second position down the backstretch, briefly made a challenge to FINNLEY'S KITTEN but was immediately
rebuffed, bided time inside through the far turn then had nothing to offer in the stretch run. NOSHEWONT lacked speed from the break and was last into the
first turn, settled at the back of the field but not far from the front owing to the slow pace, tried to rally on the far turn but had no response in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS BELLIMBUSTO was asked to rate leaving the start, tracked the fast early pace between runners heading to the half-mile marker and maintained that
position into the turn, swung to the outside for the stretch drive and mounted a four to five wide rally into the lane, loomed at mid-stretch, responded well to
urging into the final sixteenth and closed in deep stretch, took command in the final strides and held in a drive to prevail. BERRY VALLEY sent leaving the
break, engaged with RAFANELLI and pressed that rival through quick early fractions, disputed the fast pace outside of RAFANELLI into the turn and vied for
the lead at the quarter marker, gained command into the stretch and shook free approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task while leading into the final
sixteenth, met the bid of MISS BELLIMBUSTO in deep stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final strides and clear of the rest for second. READY TO
GIG was away in good order, rated off of the fast pace and stalked three wide in the early going, chased two to three wide to the quarter marker then tipped
four wide for the drive, ran evenly to the furlong marker while within aim, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held well in the final strides for third. YOU
GO GIRL was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the fast pace from the inside and saved ground into the turn, shifted two to three wide into upper
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. CITY GLITTER took back off of the
fast early pace, tracked three wide into the turn and maintained a three wide path to the quarter marker, shifted two wide into upper stretch and chased
while trailing to the furlong pole, rallied in deep stretch and showed good late interest. A ROUSING BABE was crowded at the start and lost some early
ground, tracked the fast early pace from the inside and came under a hold approaching the turn, raced in tight while saving ground to the quarter marker,
offered a mild bid at the furlong pole and needed more in deep stretch. RAFANELLI hustled away from the start, assumed command and set a pressured
early pace, carved out fast fractions while contesting the pace inside of BERRY VALLEY along the turn, lost the lead to BERRY VALLEY into upper stretch
and chased that rival to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded.

Footnotes
J D'S RUDE BOY was unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the turn and trailed to the quarter marker, angled out in upper stretch and rallied
approaching the furlong marker, continued to make headway nearing the sixteenth-pole and split rivals into deep stretch, responded to urging and surged in
the final strides to prevail. LOOKIN TO EXCEL was away in good order, rated off of the contentious pace and stalked in the early stages, was well placed
into the turn and gained ground three to four wide at the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong pole, kept to task
while leading into the final sixteenth, was confronted in the final strides by J D'S RUDE BOY and was tagged for the win at the finish, while holding safely in
the end for second. RUNNING ON FIRE tracked the fast early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and improved position heading to the quarter
marker, was roused into the stretch and continued his bid at the furlong marker, ran in pursuit into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and just
held for third at the finish. ACCLIDER was allowed to settle in the early running, was guided three to four wide into the turn and gained ground approaching
the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch and continued his rally while widest at the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and just
missed for third at the wire. TOWN PERFORMER showed speed and was prominent leaving the start, pressed the fast early pace from the inside
approaching the half-mile pole, shifted outside of PETER FLIES heading into the turn and closely attended to that rival nearing the quarter marker, battled
into the stretch and lost position nearing the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch. HARBOR OUTLAW
was asked to rate off of the fast early pace, tracked from the second flight and raced two to three wide into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker,
swung five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster a final response and finished evenly. PETER FLIES assumed
command leaving the start, showed good early speed and set the pace while pressured into the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out fast
fractions to the quarter marker, led into the stretch then was overtaken by LOOKIN TO EXCEL nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final
sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch.
