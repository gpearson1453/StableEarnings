gate, wide first turn, vied three wire no match. JERSEY GOLD claimed the rail with speed to the half, dueled stretch outkicked. ADDISON loped along to far
turn and only improved position late going. SACRED BEAUTY antsy in the gate, tracked leaders throughout with no response. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) was
antsy in the gate, inadvertently popped the stall door pre start and was declared a non starter by the stewards with all money wagered to be refunded with
this entry. MOONLIGHT RAIN never factored throughout. GRAN CHEMIN showed speed between horses to duel to half, stopped readily into the far turn.

TENNESSEE saved ground to far turn, blocked to the stretch, angled out around the crowd and proved tons the best. DANNER sprinted to the front, stayed
to the stretch while drifting out badly to the wire interfering with rival in the late going. BOLT AT MIDNIGHT chased top pair three wide to far turn, stayed on
to wire gamely after a rough stretch run. ANTHEM KING good position to far turn between horses inched along to the wire. OY VEY outside run to quarter
pole with no late response in stretch run. PROMISSIO outside run throughout while never far back, no late kick stretch. SALTED CARMEL close up to far
turn with nothing left in the stretch run. WICKED MELODY awkward from gate while tardy, failed to menace thereafter. HOLD OUT no speed to far turn
while outside into the stretch, no factor. TIZ AVANT GARDE never factored throughout. MR SCATTER chased leader to the half, stayed close to far turn,
stopped. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE LATE STRETCH RUN, DANNER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR
INTERFERENCE WITH BOLT AT MIDNIGHT IN THE STRETCH RUN.
