EMMY'S HONOR stalked the leader from the three path, bid turning for home, led entering the lane in the four path, drew clear in upper stretch and lasted
safely as an outer foe closed in. MAYLEN leaned out at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, angled off a rival's heels and to the six path passing the
sixteenths pole, rallied to gain place a sixteenth from home and gained on the clear leader late. PINK LADY LU SHA tracked in the four path, gained place
in the five path in upper stretch but was bested by an outer bidder at the sixteenth marker. JOCELYN chased along the inside, saved ground and failed to
menace. MISS PEARL HART broke a bit outwardly, showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and weakened
between horses. QUART HIGH broke a step slow, trailed in the two path and was outrun.

VODKA MARTINI broke inwardly, tracked along the inside, tipped three wide launching a rally with three furlongs to go, ranged up to bid in upper stretch
and drew off under moderate urging. CAPTIVATED DRAMA set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge in upper stretch,
gave way yet lasted for place. INDULGE broke a step slow, raced at the rear in the two path, drifted out to the four to five path in upper stretch and ran on
willingly. JULIA'S WARRIOR laid off of the pace in the four to six path and surpassed tired rivals. STARTONAHIGHNOTE chased in the two path before
tucking to the inside into the turn, then failed to menace before tiring. CHI TOWN HUSTLER pressed three to two wide into the turn, then faded turning for
home.

Footnotes
UNANIMOUSLY lacked speed along the inside before moving to a two wide tracking position with five furlongs to go, progressed in the three path around
the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch, drove clear and held sway. GUITARTUITION PLZZ settled off of the pace along the inside, gained in the two
path along with an outer rival around the far turn, reached place whlie chasing that one into the final furlong and held that position. BAYOU JAM lacked
speed in the three path, shifted to the five to six path in upper stretch and stayed on. ARCTIC ROSE was antsy in the starting gate and broke slow, trailed in
the three path then ran on mildly between foes. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER prompted inside of the leader through a quick early pace before shifting outside
of that one entering the backstretch, bid before drawing clear with three furlongs to go, but tired entering the lane, got headed at the three sixteenths pole
and weakened on his left lead. OAK HILL SOLUTION broke outwardly, tracked in the two to three path around the first turn, chased soon after and was
done early. AND FIFTY set the pace two wide before through a hard pace around the first turn, led as his sparring counterpart switched to outside pressure
entering the backstretch, but proved no match to that one with three furlongs to go and readily stopped.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW BINGO transferred light contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, then a path off of the rail around the
turn, pursued behind the leaders through upper stretch, split foes two wide passing the furlong grounds to bid at the sixteenth marker and edged ahead.
TAKE CHARGE WOMAN grazed an outer rival at the start, vied for the lead along the inside, failed to sustain vying position with an outer pair turning for
home, yet kept on to offer a rebid as the leader tired entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked in the closing stages. BREWHOUSE broke a step slow,
trailed along the inside, angled out entering the final furlong, split foes four wide at the sixteenth pole and prevailed for show. SALLY'S SUPRISE settled off
of the pace in the three path, fanned out to the six path entering the lane, stayed on through the final furlong but missed reaching how. BALI DREAMIN vied
for the lead two wide and in the three path into the turn, led as an outer foe applied pressure at the three furlong pole, inched clear at the quarter pole, but
hung on her left lead, was bested by a pair of inner bidders at the sixteenth pole and faltered. ONEROLLOFTHEDICE broke a step slow, recovered to stalk
from the four path into the turn, pressed around the bend, but chased the leader into the lane and tired on her left lead. SPLENDA GAIL was brushed by an
inner rival at the start, chased in the three path and between horses early on, pursued from the four to six path around the turn and gave way.

I DON'T VENMO laid close up along the inside, stalked under snug restraint around the first turn, pursued between horses down the backstretch, tipped to
take aim from the four path nearing the lane, bid in upper stretch and drove clear whlie shifting inwardly at the furlong grounds. VIKING LEGACY was
brushed between horses at the start, tracked along the inside, sustained a rail chase to duel with an outer pair for place through the final furlong and
narrowly prevailed. COCAL pressed the leader form the three path, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival whlie put to subtly crowded
quarters as that one cleared nearing the furlong grounds, kept on to spar for place thereafter but missed. RISING KOTO STAR set the pace inside of a
prompting foe while a path off of the rail, dueled with that one around the far turn, got bested by a wider bidder entering midstretch, sparred for place
between horses through the late stages but missed. AMERICAN DOLLARS rated at the rear tucking to the inside leaving the first turn, then improved past
outer rivals entering upper stretch. CATCHIN DRAMA laid off of the pace in the two path, then five path around the far turn and failed to factor.
INFINITESIMAL remained wide while well back into the first turn, came under urging in the seven path around that bend, progressed in the five path around
the far turn to be within striking range nearing the lane, but emptied out in upper stretch. TACTICAL VISION laid off of the pace in the three path but was
done early. MECKES PRIORITY tracked from the three to four path early on, but faded between horses around the far turn. THE RIDER OF COCAL
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF I DONT VENMO FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE FURLONG GROUNDS. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS
WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

BELEOUT pressed outside of the leader into the turn, dueled with that one from the three path around the bend, gained an advantage exchanging a bump
entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch and lasted from an outer late bidder. SPIRITED BEAUTY broke multiple lengths behind the rest when the
gates sprung, trailed along the inside, picked up stride entering the lane, shifted out nearing midstretch, sustained a rally to take aim on the clear leader in
the late stages but ran out of ground to reel that one in. MICHELLES LIL STAR stalked along the inside, chased the embattled leading pair from the four to
five path around the bend, drifted inwardly in midstretch then improved past a tiring rival. LAKE MARIE showed the way into the turn, sparred with an outer
bidder while remaining a path off the inside around the bend, exchanged contact getting headed entering the lane and weakened. FREE DROP MADDY
tracked in the four to six path then faded while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
PENNICK brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced close up along the inside, steadied subtly into the turn, stalked under snug restraint in the pocket
around the bend, surged to split foes two wide in upper stretch, drew clear nearing the furlong grounds and was geared down in the late stages. TWIRL
AROUND stalked in the five to four path approaching the turn, tucked to press two wide entering it, vied in the three path as an outer foe offered a bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, repelled that rival before being bested by an inner bidder at the three sixteenths pole, then lasted for place. BRUNCH
PUNCH was last away, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, shifted out to the six path at the three sixteenths pole, then offered a late kick to miss
reaching place. REGAL RUMOR laid off of the pace in the seven to six path, chased tucking to the four path into the turn, took aim between horses in upper
stretch, but lacked a bid. TRUE PRINCESS tracked in the four path and between horses early on, moved forward to bid outside of the leaders approaching
the five sixteenths pole, but drifted to the five path while vying nearing the lane, then flattened out approaching midstretch. MYA'S HALO set the pace along
the inside, but got headed moving to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. ANSWER THE CALL chased from midpack in the six to five path into the turn,
but yielded tucking to the three path at the three furlong pole and gave way. CABO COWGIRL brushed an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly in the
three path and between horses, but steadied hard into the turn and quickly faltered.

Footnotes
CANA GRIS tracked from midpack along the inside, took closer order before stalking just off the top pair around the far turn, tipped outside of them entering
the lane, bid in midstretch and drove clear. FIST CITY showed the way along the inside, led before meeting an outer challenge turning for home, dueled but
was bested by a wider bidder in midstretch and repelled his earlier challenger for place. GIANT TUDE stalked in the three to four path, ranged up around the
far turn to bid while tucking two wide turning for home, vied into the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, was turned away for
place and settled for show. EVE EVE saved ground off of the pace, paused before slipping inside of a tiring rival around the far turn, then improved position
entering the lane. COSTA LADY trailed in the two path, advanced in the four path and between horses around the turn, but floated to the six path entering
the lane and failed to menace. CHAPELLETE failed to factor from the three path. SWEET GUITAR stalked from the two path and faded between horses
around the turn. AURORA AUSTRALIS stalked from the four to three path around the first turn, pressed two wide down the backstretch, then weakened
between horses with five sixteenths to go. GIGI'S LUV pursued from the four to six path and faded.
