Footnotes
MAJESTIC GIG away in good order, showed speed in the early stages and set a solid pace while prompted into the turn, carved out decent fractions while
well handled heading to the quarter pole, extended the lead into the stretch, felt late pressure and kept to task in the final sixteenth to prevail. ZOE'S PRIDE
tracked the solid pace from the inside, gained ground approaching the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly while within
aim nearing the furlong marker, tipped two wide into the final sixteenth, closed willingly in deep stretch to pressure the winner, could not get by MAJESTIC
GIG in the late stages and held well in the end for second. CRY ME A RUNNER stumbled leaving the break and was away a step slowly, stalked the solid
early pace from the outside, gained ground three wide along the turn, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds,
rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while holding for third. BOBBY'S GENIE a bit keen in the early stages, pulled on the rider and raced
between runners while not far back at the half-mile pole, continued to be eager into the turn and came in tight while two wide at the quarter marker, angled
four wide for the drive, rallied in deep stretch and missed for third. ALL HALLOWS chased outside of runners, gained ground three wide at the quarter
marker, swung to the five path into the stretch and lost ground nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth but needed more in deep stretch.
GENTLE JULIA chased from the inside and did not threaten. CHRISTINA'S CANDY prominent leaving the break, stalked the solid early pace two wide,
raced close up to the pace heading to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, lacked a late response and gave way.

Footnotes
TOUR QUEEN sent to establish the early lead, set the pace while well handled heading into the turn, extended the lead while carving moderate fractions
nearing the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into the stretch and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, maintained a clear lead into deep stretch and held
sway. LUSMA tracked the early pace while not far back, gained ground three wide into the turn, chased TOUR QUEEN into the stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong marker, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages and determinedly won the nod for second at the finish. SPICE broke alertly, ceded the
early lead to TOUR QUEEN and stalked that runner through moderate fractions, chased TOUR QUEEN to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the
winner into the stretch and battled gamely with LUSMA for place honors into the final sixteenth, was edged for second at the wire and held safely in the end
for third. DORIE MILLER rated off of the moderate early pace, advanced position three wide into the turn, slipped to the rail into upper stretch, was gaining
in the late stages but was not able to reel in the top three. RANDOS LADY settled off of the moderate early pace, saved ground along the turn, tipped two
wide for the drive and did not factor.

Footnotes
TOWN PERFORMER showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, set solid fractions while controlling the pace into the turn, was
pressed to the quarter marker by GONNA GETCHA GOOD then repelled his stablemate into the stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong marker, was kept to
task while on the left lead approaching the sixteenth-pole, drifted in at that station and caused LOOKIN TO EXCEL to take up, recovered into deep stretch
and held in a drive to prevail. TIGER TOO rated off of the solid early pace while not far back, tracked two wide and between runners into the turn, angled to
the four path at the quarter marker and was asked for run into the stretch, mounted a five wide rally at the furlong marker, was closing into the final sixteenth
but could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and won the nod for second on the wire. LOOKIN TO EXCEL bobbled leaving the start and was off slowly,
rushed up in the early going and tracked the solid pace from the inside, advanced position while saving ground along the turn then waited for racing room
nearing the top of the lane, found a seam along the rail into upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, chased TOWN PERFORMER approaching the
sixteenth-pole then took up at that station when that rival drifted in, recovered in deep stretch and was just edged for second at the wire, while holding for
third. GONNA GETCHA GOOD close up to the quick early pace, chased TOWN PERFORMER through solid fractions into the turn and pressed his
stablemate approaching the quarter pole, was steered three wide into the stretch and raced within aim at the furlong marker, could not match strides into the
final sixteenth and weakened. THREEBROTHERS tracked the solid early pace while widest down the backstretch, raced four wide into the turn and lost
ground at the quarter marker, shifted to the inside in upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, chased into the final sixteenth and could not muster
a late response. ACCLIDER stalked the solid pace from the outside, raced three then four wide along the turn, lost position into the stretch and gave way.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT TOWN PERFORMER INTERFERED WITH LOOKIN
TO EXCEL IN DEEP STRETCH AND IN DOING SO, COST LOOKIN TO EXCEL THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. TOWN PERFORMER
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
J AND M EXPRESS had to wait a beat after the break when I'M GONNA SHINE broke in front from the adjacent stall, tracked the two leaders while under
restraint to just past the five furlong pole then was set down to go after the leaders before the three furlong marker, took command at the top of the stretch,
opened up under steady handling and held off a late challenge. I'M GONNA SHINE broke sharply and was first away, then was allowed to settle well behind
the pace, kept to inside and reserved to the far turn, quickened on cue, got a clear path from the inside on the turn to the four path into the stretch, produced
a strong rally down the lane and was rapidly gaining on the winner but ran out of racetrack. CRESCENDO MOLTO was away a beat slow but was quickly
into the early mix, kept to a stalking position behind MISSING PENNY while well clear of the next horse, was content with that position to the far turn, then
went to challenge past the five-sixteenths marker, was joined to the outside by J AND M EXPRESS, was unable to match strides with that foe but kept on to
the wire to hold third. SWEET LAYLA RAE settled well behind the pace through the first half mile, navigated an inside trip through the far turn, had an
opening to run through as the field turned for home but did not go on, then found another gear inside the sixteenth but came on too late. FINNLEY'S
KITTEN broke well, went three wide into the clubhouse turn, remained in the three path for the run down the backstretch, came under a ride passing the
three furlong marker, swung out to the five path for the stretch run and produced a mild rally. FRESNO CHILE broke alertly and was up in the early mix
heading into the first turn, rated a few lengths behind the top pair on the run down the backstretch, then was put into drive from the three furlong pole, came
into the stretch three wide racing on the wrong lead and was unable to improve. MISSING PENNY was sent from the break and easily grabbed the early
advantage, was left unchallenged to set reasonable fractions, came under pressure passing the quarter pole, kept on to mid-stretch but gave way readily in
the last furlong. NOSHEWONT veered out at the start, lacked any early speed and dropped far back early, chased the field throughout and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
BERRY VALLEY showed good early speed and was prominent away from the start, engaged with HIIS REINA and pressed outside of that runner into the
turn, dueled to the quarter marker while carving fast fractions, took command into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, was kept to task
into the final sixteenth and drew away in deep stretch to convincingly prevail. BLUE WILDCAT settled off of the fast early pace and tracked four wide to the
half-mile pole, was well positioned heading into the turn and gained ground two wide at the quarter marker, tipped three wide into the stretch and chased
BERRY VALLEY to the furlong marker, could not make headway on the winner in the final sixteenth and was clear at the finish for second. CITY GLITTER
forwardly place leaving the start, took back to track the solid early pace, raced two wide and between runners into the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch
and gained ground at the furlong marker, was outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. HIIS REINA hustled leaving the
break, assumed command and set a quick early pace while pressured into the turn, dueled inside of BERRY VALLEY approaching the quarter marker, lost
position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. A DIME FOR ME rated off of the contentious early pace and tracked from the inside, saved ground
into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the
late stages and passed a tiring rival in the final sixteenth. GLADRIEL came in a bit tight leaving the start and was a step slow to begin, was hustled to
establish forward position and raced close up to the solid early pace while outside of runners, chased three then four wide to the quarter marker, was outrun
to the furlong pole and tired in the late stages. LADY'S SERMON tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, raced between runners into the turn
and lost position leaving the three-furlong pole, chased three wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
AUTISM COUNTS was bumped from the inside at the break, raced near the front of the tracking group to the turn, launched a bid with three furlongs to run,
came into the stretch three wide and wore down SILVER MATY in the final yards. SILVER MATY broke alertly and was first to the front, ceded the lead to
LEEDSTHESKY passing the half-mile pole, then tracked that one through the turn, moved up to bid for the lead at the five-sixteenths, opened up in the
stretch but was overtaken by the winner inside the sixteenth pole while well clear of the next horse. ANNA'S GIRL broke with the pack but was unable to
keep pace, kept to task while chasing the pack, saved ground through the turn and finished with a late burst to gain the third spot. OOPS AND DOWNS
veered out sharply after the gates opened and took the path of SPORTY NUGGET, then was slow into stride and raced far behind the pace, was last
passing the three furlong marker, had to check slightly at the top of the stretch, responded to steady handling down the lane with a big late run but came up
short. SPORTY NUGGET steadied at the break when OOPS AND DOWNS came over at the start, was unhurried and allowed to settle into stride despite
being distanced in the early going, improved position with a four wide run though the turn, and continued to pass horses down the stretch. MIRAGE CODE
was hustled from the gate and kept under a drive to contest the early pace, was unable to catch the leaders, weakened near the quarter pole and came up
empty in the stretch. BRONZE GIRL broke alertly and was pushed to contest the early pace, dropped out of the duel at the half-mile pole, tried to re-rally
from the five-sixteenths marker but had nothing to offer and weakened. SEATTLE FOG struggled to keep up with the early pace, saved ground to the
stretch and finished evenly. LOVELY BRIDE broke outward after the break and made contact with AUTISM COUNTS, raced with the tracking group through
the backstretch run, steadied slightly at the seven-sixteenths pole, came back on some under urging but was outfinished in the final furlong. MISS PERU hit
the side of the gate at the break and came away very awkwardly, tried to rally into contention under steady handling, made some forward progress on the
turn but had nothing left for the stretch run. LEEDSTHESKY broke well, took over the lead passing the half-mile pole, opened up in the turn, could not turn
back the challenge of SILVER MATY at the five-sixteenth pole, held on into the stretch but was spent from early efforts and tired. ADDY PEARL raced close
up between horses to the turn, began to fade approaching the five-sixteenths marker and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
YES HE CAN forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the fast early pace from the inside and was well positioned approaching the turn, stalked inside to
the quarter pole then angled three wide into the stretch, ran in pursuit of GOLDEN ALE heading to the furlong marker, responded to urging and took the lead
inside of the sixteenth-pole, showed a good late kick in deep stretch and drew clear to prevail. ALEXANDER'S DREAM broke a step slowly leaving the start,
was allowed to settle while not far back and tracked the solid early pace from the inside, advanced position into the turn then waited for racing room nearing
the top of the stretch, raced in traffic into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, found a seam inside of the furlong pole and rallied into the final
sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but closed willingly and won the nod for second on the wire. GOLDEN ALE prominent away from the
start, raced close up to the fast early pace and stalked two wide into the turn, loomed approaching the top of the lane and took command into the stretch,
drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, was overtaken by YES HE CAN inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch
and was tagged for second at the finish, while holding clearly for third. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM broke alertly, rated off of the fast early pace and tracked four
wide to the half-mile marker, maintained a four wide path into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter pole, chased four wide into the stretch, could
not sustain his run into the final furlong and flattened out. BLAZING JAMIE slow into stride leaving the start, lacked early speed and trailed into the turn,
gained ground two wide at the quarter pole then swung four wide for the drive, was outrun to the furlong marker, finished evenly and passed tiring rivals in
deep stretch. MR. STANG chased the solid early pace from between runners, maintained a two wide path while between horses heading into the turn and
gained ground at the quarter marker, chased three wide to the furlong pole, was outrun into the final sixteenth and gave way. BRADY BOY hard sent leaving
the break, showed good early speed and dictated terms into the turn, set fast fractions heading to the quarter marker, was overtaken by GOLDEN ALE into
the stretch, chased to the furlong pole and faded in the final stages. TOP EXECUTIVE chased the solid early pace while between runners, raced three wide
and between horses into the turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker and was shuffled back at that station, dropped back into the stretch and did not
offer a late rally.

Footnotes
TIZ A TIGER squeezed a bit leaving the start and was away a step slowly, tracked the solid early pace from the back, saved ground into the turn and
improved position heading to the quarter pole, angled four then five wide into the stretch and gained ground approaching the furlong marker, mounted a bold
late rally into the final sixteenth, overtook AMANDA ROSE in deep stretch and edged clear in the final strides for a determined win. AMANDA ROSE tracked
the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn, improved position at the quarter marker and angled three wide into upper stretch, loomed at
the furlong marker, vied for the lead with THREAD COUNT and took a narrow advantage heading to the sixteenth-pole, was collared by TIZ A TIGER in
deep stretch and was clear of the rest for second. THREAD COUNT broke alertly, showed good early speed and assumed command leaving the start,
disputed the solid pace with BACALAR and dueled outside of that runner into the run, contested the pace to the quarter pole and shook free into the stretch,
showed the way to the furlong grounds, was overtaken heading to the sixteenth-marker and held for third at the finish. DRAW NEAR forwardly placed early
on, came in tight nearing the half-mile marker and steadied while between runners, recovered and stalked the solid pace from the inside, angled three wide
along the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the drive and loomed at the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with
oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth and weakened. RIVIERA SUNRISE a bit slow into stride away from the gate, chased outside of runners heading into
the turn and ran in pursuit four wide to the quarter pole, swung six wide for the drive and gained ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed late
response and did not offer a final bid in deep stretch. DAWN AT LAST rated just off of the solid early pace, tracked three wide to the half-mile marker,
chased three wide along the turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ENGEE OMBEE came in
tight into the opening furlong, took up and lost position at the five furlong marker, re-engaged and chased two wide and between runners into the turn,
steadied nearing the three furlong marker and chased while trailing to the quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch and improved position two wide at the
furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. LA POPIS prominent leaving the start, came in a bit tight nearing the
half-mile marker and lost position, chased between runners approaching the turn then checked at the three furlong marker, chased three wide to the quarter
marker and could not muster a response in the stretch. BACALAR showed good early speed and disputed the pace with THREAD COUNT, dueled inside of
that rival into the turn, lost position into the stretch and tired in the late stages. TEASPOON OF PEPPER raced close up to the solid early pace, lost position
two wide into the turn, trailed into the stretch and came up empty in the final furlong.
