Footnotes
DORINE'S WILD CAT was pinched and shuffled back at the start, then floated four wide through the clubhouse turn, pulled the rider down the backstretch
into a tracking spot just behind the pace but four to five wide in the clear, was confidently ridden through the turn, cruised up to challenge for the lead near
the quarter pole and sprinted away under steady handling. INFINITE LOVE reserved for a half-mile mid-pack in the back of the tracking group, navigated a
clean trip through the far turn, came into the stretch three wide and ran on well, no match for the winner but well clear of the third horse. AFTER MY OWN
HEART was hustled out of the gate and was able to secure a spot on the rail and a tracking spot right off the flank of LADY OF THE RIVER, stalked that
rival to the far turn, waited for running room along the rail through the turn, looked to get out when still blocked passing the three-sixteenths marker, tipped
out a path approaching the sixteenth pole, then surged ahead to gain third. ZEE PERFECT RUN broke outward and the break and bothered SILVER FLIRT
without making contact, saved ground while racing near the rear of the compact field, made a mild rally from the three furlong pole but did not quicken and
finished one-paced to the finish. SILVER FLIRT tried to avoid ZEE PERFECT RUN when that foe came over after the break but in turn put DORINE'S WILD
CAT in tight, raced near the rear of the field to the far turn, made a mild move three wide on the far turn, came under pressure from the quarter pole then
had trouble changing leads down the stretch and finished evenly. LADY OF THE RIVER stumbled at the start then ducked in, cutting off DORINE'S WILD
CAT in the process, was able to recover and was first into the first bend, got a brief challenge from SHEZA LUCKY CHARM near the six furlong pole, took
command again and led the field to the far turn, came under a ride when beset by challengers near the five sixteenths pole, hung in there to the stretch then
weakened. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM broke well, was close up in the early running the pulled the rider to the lead by the backstretch, remained close to the
far turn then weakened passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
JERSEY BABE hustled away from the start, assumed command and set the early pace, was well handled while carving decent fractions to the quarter pole,
showed the way into upper stretch while in hand and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was confronted by MAJOR TOM approaching the sixteenth-marker
and battled with that rival into deep stretch, dug in while fully extended in the final strides and determinedly lasted for the win on the wire. MAJOR TOM
forwardly placed away from the start, vied for the early lead then took back to stalk the decent pace three wide, was well positioned three wide into the turn,
roused into the stretch and chased JERSEY BABE to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner into deep stretch, battled
to the wire but could not get by the determined winner late and just missed for the win, while well clear for second. DANZ TILL TEN prominent away from
the start, raced close up to the decent early pace and stalked into the turn, chased between rivals along the bend, came in tight and steadied at the quarter
marker, shifted four wide into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top pair in the final sixteenth but held well for
third in the late stages. GORM tracked from the second flight to begin, was guided three wide into the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter marker,
swung four then five wide for the drive and lost ground at the furlong pole, lacked the needed late response but stayed on in deep stretch and just missed for
third. EMPEROROFTHENORTH squeezed at the start and was off slowly, recovered and chased the decent early pace from the inside, was well placed into
the turn and stalked the pace to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, was outkicked at the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. COUNT
ASHER broke alertly, took back off of the early pace and tracked from the outside, ran in pursuit along the turn while three then four wide, lost ground into
the stretch and did not offer a late response. DRUMADOON lacked early speed, saved ground into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
PASS THE BATON was sent aggressively from the break, seized the early advantage, dictated the pace while rating kindly, maintained a clear advantage
through the far turn, responded when set down approaching the quarter pole and drew away from the field despite racing on the wrong lead through the
stretch. DAZZLE THE COMMAND settled well off the early pace with the trailing trio, made a nice middle move through the turn, swung four wide into the
stretch with dead aim on PASS THE BATON, could not match strides with that foe but was a clear second. LORD SHELDON pulled the rider three wide to
race with the early leaders, continued on that trip while tracking close up behind the base, came under a ride from the five-sixteenths, did not quicken but
kept to task and was long for third. BOOMING BERNARDO was unhurried in the early stages and raced with the trio tracking well behind the pace, started
to make a forward move to the outside through the far turn, got blocked, switched to the inside, got clear run into the stretch then flattened out. GIANOLA
broke well but was content to sit second and track PASS THE BATON, started to have trouble keeping pace after passing the three furlong marker, gave
way with a quarter mile to run and had nothing to offer in the stretch. CALCULATED SPIN took up in traffic near the seven-eighths pole, trailed the field
down the backstretch, lacked any response when called upon with about three furlongs to run, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off under his own
power.

Footnotes
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY was sent for and seized the lead from the break, was allowed to dictate the pace and proceeded to slow it down for the run
down the backstretch with the rest stacked up in close order behind, held sway through the far turn always traveling well, drifted out a bit turning for home,
was being challenged by TRIPOLI to the outside and LAMMAS (GB) to the inside but responded when roused and kept all at bay in a gritty effort. TRIPOLI
was content to sit behind and let I'MGONNABESOMEBODY set the pace, held position to the far turn, was asked to go after that rival from the
five-sixteenths, got within a half-length, battled gamely the entirety of the stretch but could not get past. LAMMAS (GB) broke sharply but chose to settle off
the pace and hold the rail, rated kindly down the backstretch, waited patiently through the turn and was rewarded with a huge gap to run through into the
stretch, responded when set down, got bumped by AMERICAN FARMER at the furlong marker then was in a bit tight near the sixteenth pole and checked
slightly but held third. AMERICAN FARMER was allowed to settle from the break, settled nicely in the two path near the rear but only three lengths from the
lead, raced between horses down the backstretch, became boxed in on the far turn, accelerated into the stretch, tried to split horses at the eighth pole,
made contact with LAMMAS (GB) at the eighth pole, checked off heels then swung to the outside and still ran on but was too late. FREEPORT JOE was off
a step slow then shuffled back at the start, settled at the rear of the very compact quintet through the first turn, moved up to the third spot down the
backstretch while still in the three path, went up to challenge for the lead from the five sixteenth and loomed a big threat as the field turned into the stretch,
was set down at the three-sixteenths and ran on well but was outfinished. THE RIDER OF AMERICAN FARMER LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE
RIDER OF I'MGONNABESOMEBODY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S KID got away best and made first run into the turn, went unchallenged on the lead while setting comfortable fractions, was still in hand passing
the quarter pole, rebuffed all pending challenges, sprinted clear when roused, drifted out some in the stretch but won clear. DUST MAKER was last away
and angled over to the rail when clear, made slow and steady progress into contention down the backstretch, bided time through the far turn waiting for
something to open up inside, instead found a seam to the outside and swung five wide into the stretch, was set down and responded with a strong rally
down the middle of the track and was just up for second. TURIAF broke well but caught four wide through the first bend, took closer order down the
backstretch while staying clear to the outside, responded when given the cue to go on upon passing the three furlong marker, got a clean run four wide
turning for home, ran on well under steady handling down the stretch and won the bob for third in a blanket finish. POINT AND SHOOT tracked on the rail
behind the leaders, was content to hold position to the far turn, got a clear inside run into the stretch, was kept to task under intermittent urging but came up
short for a minor award. CHIC SAMARAI was content to track the lone pacesetter from a length or two back, went to challenge from the five-sixteenths pole,
proved no match for the eventual winner, had trouble changing leads through the stretch and was overtaken for second in the final yards. JAZZY LOVE was
outrun to the turn, moved out to the two path for the backstretch run, settled mid-pack, became boxed in on the far turn, was set down but beaten to a hole
in mid-stretch then could not keep up in the late stages. TEN THE SMART WAY came away awkwardly and took up first stride from the gate, then went
three wide through the clubhouse turn, settled near the rear and still wide down the backstretch, came under a drive from the three eighths pole, got floated
six wide into the stretch and flattened out.

GRAMMY WINNER showed good early speed away from the start, engaged with LAST BABY and contested solid fractions with that rival into the turn,
dueled outside of LAST BABY along the bend and carved out fast fractions heading to the quarter marker, continued to battle LAST BABY into the stretch,
shook free inside of the furlong pole, was kept to task while maintaining a clear lead into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from LEADING THE PACE and
held in a drive to prevail in a good debut. LEADING THE PACE away in good order, raced close up to the solid early pace while outside of rivals, lost ground
into the turn and chased three then four wide heading to the quarter pole, maintained a four wide path into the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong
marker, pressured GRAMMY WINNER in deep stretch but could not get by the winner and held clearly for second. FAR TO LONG stalked the solid early
pace from the inside, angled two then three wide at the quarter marker, chased three wide into the stretch, could not make headway in the final furlong and
was outkicked by the top pair in the final sixteenth, while just holding for third at the finish. SILENT REASON slow into stride leaving the start, settled along
the outside in the early stages, chased two wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, tipped four wide into the stretch, found his best stride late
and just missed for third. R BARRACUDA asked for early speed leaving the start, rushed up and raced just off of the solid pace heading to the half-mile
marker, stalked three wide and between runners into the turn, shifted two wide nearing the quarter marker and chased into the stretch, was outkicked
approaching the furlong marker, could not muster a final response and finished evenly. LAST BABY hustled away from the start, engaged with GRAMMY
WINNER in the early stages and disputed the solid pace with that rival into the turn, dueled inside of GRAMMY WINNER heading to the quarter pole while
setting fast fractions, battled into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired in deep stretch. BOLD ENCOUNTER unprepared at the
start, was off slowly and was green away from the gate, lacked early speed and trailed into the turn, swung three wide into the stretch, was not able to
impact the leaders in the final stages but showed good late interest. ONE BOLD BID chased the solid early pace, raced three wide into the turn and lost
ground at the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and did not factor. CRUSHER chased the solid early pace from the inside, raced between
rivals approaching the turn and came in tight at the three furlong marker, lost position approaching the quarter pole, chased from the inside into the stretch
and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TURA LURA forwardly placed away from the start, rated kindly off of the solid early pace and tracked two wide heading to the turn, gained ground at the
quarter marker and was well placed nearing the top of the lane, was roused into the stretch and took command heading to the furlong pole, responded to
firm urging and was kicked clear at the sixteenth marker, felt pressure from the runner-up in deep stretch and was kept to task to prevail. HERSABIGGIRL
squeezed at the start and was off slowly, recovered and was allowed to settle in the early running, raced three then four wide along the turn and made a
mild gain at the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and loomed at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner
in deep stretch but could not catch TURA LURA and was second best in a good effort. RUNNING LUCK rated off of the contentious early pace and tracked
from the outside, raced four then three wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the stretch and rallied at the furlong
marker, could not make further headway in the drive but ran on in the final sixteenth and outfinished LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND to claim third.
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND hustled leaving the start, vied for the early lead then took back to stalk the dueling pacesetters, tracked three then two wide into
the turn and raced close up to the solid pace heading to the quarter marker, chased three wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker,
needed more into the final sixteenth, passed tiring rivals late and was outfinished for third. SHEMAKESCENTS broke in a step at the start and bothered a
neighboring rival, engaged with SLICE OF PIE in the early running and disputed a solid pace with that runner heading into the turn, dueled through decent
fractions while outside of SLICE OF PIE heading to the quarter pole, was carried five wide into upper stretch when SLICE OF PIE drifted at that station, lost
position and chased TURA LURA to mid-stretch, could not find more in the final sixteenth and weakened. SLICE OF PIE broke in at the start and bothered
neighboring rivals, recovered to show good early speed and disputed the solid pace heading into the turn, contested the pace inside of SHEMAKESCENTS
along the bend while carving solid fractions, drifted four wide into upper stretch and carried out SHEMAKESCENTS at that station, lost the lead and chased
to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way. DRESS REHEARSAL squeezed at the start and was off slowly, chased the solid
early pace and came two wide into the turn, maintained a two wide path to the quarter pole, ran evenly into the stretch and could not muster a late rally.
SMOOVE AS SILK off a step slow to begin, tracked the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane and shifted three then four wide into upper stretch, found a seam nearing the furlong pole and split rivals
at mid-stretch, battled his stablemate into the final sixteenth, found more into deep stretch and held the runner-up at bay in the final strides to prevail.

raced four then five wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch and loomed at the furlong pole, was bested by his stablemate in deep stretch
