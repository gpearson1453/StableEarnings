was kept alert in the stretch. MAGNETRON stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail, though, had to settle for second best. SUBJECT TO CHANGE 's rider lost his irons leaving the gate but recovered them in short order and settled in
the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little further. LOKOYA

POLAR WIND settled in the three path, left the second turn outside and started his bid approaching the three eighths pole, steadily improved from that point,
raced in the four path on the far turn and dueled through the final sixteenth to take the nod under the wire. MARK DID IT stalked toward the inside, picked
up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and dueled through the final
sixteenth, but missed the nod under the wire. FIRST HOMESTEAD rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole and
contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. RRACE DAY WARRIOR stalked
from the four path the first turn then saved ground into the second turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, though,
flattened in the lane. BLUEMOON JUSTICE stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but weakened approaching the
five sixteenths. MOON OVER MONTANA was never a factor. HONOR THE FLEET was through early.

TEMPESTIVO settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced at even terms in the three path
entering the stretch, dug in determinedly leaving the far turn and inched further ahead of SISYPHUS, who rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of
Fast Forward leaving the half mile pole and kept the edge over that one through the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met entering the
stretch but remained a factor to late yards before reluctantly ceding. LET'S EAT saved ground, gave case leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the
rail on the far turn, then flattened. FAST FORWARD stalked the early pace then challenged and dueled close from the half mile pole, but dropped back off
the rail toward the head of the lane and weakened leaving the far turn.

the three path on the far turn then dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. MAKINLIMMARGARITAS rated the pace inside, came
under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was caught while flattening
stride later yards. TOUGH ENOUGH stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then
flattened the final sixteenth. LADRO DI FICHI settled off the rail the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn

Footnotes
SING A LULLABYE pressured the pace then took control past the five sixteenths pole, raced clear past the quarter, widened at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled to hold on. COWGIRL ATTITUDE gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and dug in through the stretch to hold onto second while gaining
on the winner. PURE NONSENSE gave chase and steadily improved at the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and finished well at the outside flank
of the runner-up. WINDSOR'S PLAY gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the stretch. CASTLE TOY contested the pace
inside but steadied past the quarter pole, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened. WITNESS THE ENERGY bobbled leaving the gate then gave
chase, eased outward on the turn and entered the stretch about the five path, but showed little further. LINDA'S TAJ bobbled on the chute, steadied while
angling to the outside and was kept in check. ICY STARE gave chase then faded in the three path on the turn. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a
claim of foul against the rider of Sing A Lullabye for alleged interference on the turn, lodged by the rider of Castle Toy.
