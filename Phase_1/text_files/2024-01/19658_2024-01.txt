Footnotes
DONCIC stalked along the rail to the stretch, tipped out and bumped EXULTATION, hemmed in by that rival and lacked room in upper stretch, altered out
into the clear midstretch, surged late and got up at the wire. EXULTATION closest in pursuit from the two path, got bumped by DONCIC at the top of the
lane, drew alongside DEVIL MOON and took over midstretch, inched ahead into the final sixteenth but was run down by the winner in the final moments.
DEVIL MOON sped clear and moved inside, unchallenged to the stretch, tested from outside with a furlong remaining, lost command midstretch and yielded
to the top pair. JETOVATOR off slow to begin, traveled at the back off the rail, rounded the bend two then three wide and finished willingly to close the gap
on the winner. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) broke a step slow, settled inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and could not rally.
INCH got crowded between rivals at the five-eighths pole, stalked outside a rival or two wide to the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
VIOLET STORM tucked inside chasing the top quartet into the first turn, waited for room behind the leader on the far turn, gained an opening and quickly
challenged from the rail at the quarter pole, took over shortly after, kicked clear in upper stretch under right handed urging and drew off under steady
handling. ZZYZX hustled from the gate and fought inside a trio of rivals into the first turn then dueled with MISS KALINE, maintained a short lead to the far
turn, came off the rail approaching the quarter pole to give VIOLET STORM an opening, lost command to the that rivals after crossing the marker, was no
match for that rival in upper stretch and kept on to outduel MIDNIGHT SILENCE for the place honors. MIDNIGHT SILENCE antsy in the starting gate, went
up to vie four deep into the first turn then chased three deep around the bend, continued outside rivals into the far turn, bid three then four deep, fought
three wide into the lane, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and was edged for second. GLORY OF CHROME vied between rivals into the
clubhouse turn then got put in tight and dropped back a bit to chase between in the two path, lost ground on the far turn and trailed while slowly drifting to
the five path and had little left for the stretch run. MISS KALINE coaxed from the gate and fought three deep then outside ZZYZX on the clubhouse turn,
vied three deep at the quarter pole, chased the leaders three wide into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
ZE'BUL broke a bit slow from outside, trailed across the dirt then rushed up four deep, pressed the leader to the turn, chased in the two path around the
bend, fought three deep into the final furlong, dueled outside STREET HUMOR in deep stretch and dug in to prove best. STREET HUMOR chased along
the inside, got put in a bit tight briefly approaching the three-eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and launched a bid between rivals in upper
stretch, dueled inside ZE'BUL late and finished gamely in defeat. TAKE ACTION saved ground through the turn giving chase, moved out in the lane and
finished willingly to earn the show honors. PAPA TIGER took control quickly and moved inside, roused on the turn, cornered nicely entering the lane,
challenged by outer rivals nearing the eighth pole and yielded with a sixteenth left to run. INCREDIBE MO brushed the gate to lose a step, raced up close in
the early going, lost ground two wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, shifted in midstretch and weakened. WESTCOAST GANGSTER forwardly
placed between rivals, got put in tight at the half-mile pole costing him some ground, remained in range to the turn, rounded the bend three deep, drifted in
and was corrected midstretch and failed to threaten after.

TEMBO broke a step slow, chased three wide off the pace into the backstretch, moved to within striking distance in the middle stages, bid from outside with
three furlongs remaining, put a nose in front past the quarter pole, battled down the lane, put away inner rival late and held over the late run from the
runner-up. DIVINE FEMININE sat outside a rival at the back early, moved into range up the backstretch, chased inside rivals into the far turn, tipped out and
came three wide into the lane, chased within striking distance into the final sixteenth and finished willingly to gain late on the winner but lacked the needed
final punch. PACO'S PICO dueled for the lead from outside, cleared inner rival on the backstretch, challenged by TEMBO from outside at the three-eighths
pole, battled around the turn and lost command past the quarter pole, fought back from inside to the sixteenth pole and faltered. NEW EVERY MORNING
dueled inside PACO'S PICO early, failed to keep up with that rival on the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the far turn and tired. MUHAMMAD
ALI (PER) broke a step slow, raced near the back on the inside, dropped back in the middle stages, eased on the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and
walked off.

Footnotes
TOP GUN TOMMY chased between to the turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside DISCO BALL approaching the sixteenth pole and wore
down the runner-up. DISCO BALL broke a step slow then was hustled to the front between rivals before clearing the field, set the pace along the inside and
was roused at the quarter pole, put to right handed urging in upper stretch, continued clear into the final furlong, confronted by TOP GUN TOMMY outside
the sixteenth pole and could not fend off the that rival. PATRON D'ORO chased four deep up the backstretch, got bumped entering the turn, driven three
wide into the lane and lacked a bid. ESTABLISHED raced wide up the backstretch then moved into the three path for the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. JAMMING EDDY stalked outside rivals then started to climb at the half-mile pole, chased two wide through the turn and could
not rally. LAMBEAU stalked the lone leader inside rivals, started to weaken around the bend and faded down the lane. ELECTOR chased three deep and
between rivals under coaxing, drifted out and bumped PATRON D'ORO into the turn, dropped back while climbing three then two wide on the turn and had
little left for the drive. IMPOSSIBLE TASK bumped with outer rival and climbed early, raced two then three wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
VIRAT brushed with KID AZTECA at the start, stalked trio off the inside, chased three deep at the quarter pole, bid four wide into the lane, kicked clear in
upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire. KID AZTECA brushed leaving the gate, settled off the pace, went two wide into the turn, moved to the inside
then swung out at the quarter pole, finished well in the lane but had to settle for second best. LEMON SUSHI vied for the lead between rivals, shifted in and
bumped approaching the half-mile pole, dueled in the two path around the bend, lost command at the top of the stretch, weakened in the late stages, but
churned on to secure third. PAULLIAC (IRE) chased on the inside leaving the backstretch, tipped two wide with a quarter mile left to run, angled out in the
stretch and flattened out deep stretch. KIMMER trailed on the inside, tipped out in upper stretch, improved position but could not threaten for the major
placings. TANGLEDUPINGREY tracked widest up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then spun five wide into the lane
and failed to menace. HABEAS pressed three deep to the turn, asked to keep up around the bend but could not stay on with the leaders, entered the stretch
three wide and weakened. TIGERHON (FR) vied inside a pair of rivals, took a solid bump from LEMON SUSHI nearing the half-mile pole, fought back from
inside through the turn and tired in the stretch run.
