Footnotes
BEACH KITTEN showed no speed to the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished full off run to be along in time under good handling to the wire. LADY IN
HEELS quick inside speed to deep stretch, stayed game and grudgingly gave in late and nailed on the wire. QUIET DAWN unhurried early, rallied out of the
turn while coming on late for show spot. MY TOMMY LEE bobbled at the start, good position to the turn while mildly in the late going. YOGURT raced along
evenly to the stretch while mildly in the final stages. WHISKEY SIS chased leaders to the turn, mild bid in the stretch but folded through the late going. GET
NONE good position and took up chase out of the turn with nothing left in the stretch run. LITTLE LUCERITO sharp break outside, brief speed to turn, gave
in readily stretch. WARIS never menaced throughout. UP IN ARMS bobbled at the start and never threatened thereafter. GO STORMIN GIRL between
horses to the turn, could not keep up and dropped back. HIGH MEADOWS bothered at the start, outrun thereafter.
