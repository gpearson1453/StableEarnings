Footnotes
TWIRLING DERBY came away from the gate in good order, was floated three wide through the first turn, moved up to press the pace still wide for the run
down the backstretch, got even with the pace-setting DESERT DUDE with three furlongs to run, took command at the quarter pole, opened up down the
stretch and easily held clear at the wire. WILL IS CHILL last to go through the first bend, was content to lag for the first half-mile while racing three off the
rail, cruised into contention without much effort through the far turn racing three to four wide, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied under steady handling,
was gaining on the eventual winner but ran out of time. TEX HANLEY conceded the early lead to DESERT DUDE but stalked outside and just off the flank
of that rival through the early going, took up off heels approaching the five furlong pole when in a bit tight, dropped back some then became boxed in trying
to re-engage through the turn, was kept to task, finished willingly and able to gain the third spot. CALI CONQUEST was not asked for speed from the break
and settled along the rail through the first turn, gradually advanced down the backstretch while three wide, was asked to go on approaching the three furlong
marker then came under a drive from the five-sixteenths, was unable to match strides with the eventual winner and finished evenly. DESERT DUDE seized
the early advantage from the break, attempted to slow the pace through the first bend and down the backstretch held a host of potential challengers at bay
through the far turn, quickened when offered a serious bid by TWIRLING DERBY passing the three-eighths pole, came under a ride and was overtaken as
they turned for home and faded down the stretch. POUR ON THE COLE was floated four wide on the first turn then remained wide down the backstretch
one from the rear in a compact field, had to be ridden to keep up through the far turn, still three to four wide, tipped out another path for the stretch run found
another gear mid-stretch and was making up ground in the end. WALKING BOSS was hustled away but outrun to the turn, settled inside off the pace, was
pulling pretty hard down the backstretch and moved up to press the pace before the turn, tried to rally up the rail, loomed a threat at the head of the stretch
but weakened before passing the furlong marker and dropped out of it.

Footnotes
CARDINAL TRICK rated nicely off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and inched closer at the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the
stretch and made a steady gain on ATTA BOY LLOYD, confronted that rival inside of the sixteenth-marker, battled into the final strides, was carried out by
the drifting runner-up just prior to the wire and determinedly prevailed at the finish. ATTA BOY LLOYD was asked for speed leaving the start and assumed
command of the early running, set solid fractions while on a clear lead heading into the turn, extended the lead approaching the quarter marker and was set
down into upper stretch, maintained a clear lead to the furlong pole, was kept to task to the sixteenth marker and felt presure from CARDINAL TRICK into
deep stretch, met that rival's bid and battled into the final strides, drifted out just before the wire and carried out CARDINAL TRICK, was bested at the finish
in a good effort and was well clear of the rest for second. DEO took back off of the fast early pace, trailed into the turn and chased to the quarter marker,
angled out into the stretch, could not impact the top pair but closed well into the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. ALPHABETICAL ORDER
was slow away from the start and raced greenly in the early stages, improved position three to four wide along the turn, continued to be green into the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HOT ROD JIMMY tracked the loose pacesetter in the early stages, raced two to three wide while chasing to the
quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DAWN AT LAST hustled leaving the break, engaged with THREAD COUNT and pressed that rival through fast early fractions heading into the turn, lost
ground entering the turn and chased THREAD COUNT two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly while in pursuit to mid-stretch, slipped to the inside and
closed into the final sixteenth, confronted THREAD COUNT into deep stretch, took command from that rival in the final strides and held in a drive to prove
best. THREAD COUNT showed speed leaving the break and assumed command of the early running, was engaged by DAWN AT LAST and set solid
fractions while pressed by that rival into the turn, shook free along the bend and drew to a clear lead at the quarter pole, maintained a clear lead into the
stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and felt pressure into deep stretch from DAWN AT LAST, was
overtaken in the final strides and just held for second at the wire. AMANDA ROSE tracked the solid early pace from the inside, gave chase two to three wide
approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, finished well into deep stretch and just
missed for second on the wire. MARY MARGARET broke a step slowly leaving the start and raced a bit in tight in the early stages, tracked between runners
to the half-mile marker then was guided outside of rivals heading into the turn, chased three to four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong
marker, shifted widest inside of the furlong pole and found her best stride late. ASSUREDLY hopped leaving the start and was off slowly, recovered and
tracked the solid early pace from the outside, raced three wide into the turn and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, swung five wide for the
drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. DRAW NEAR stalked the solid early pace from the outside,
slipped to the inside approaching the turn, raced a bit in tight midway through the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, chased from the inside
into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not muster a late response and weakened in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
KO SAMUI (IRE) broke well but opted to track the early pace from the rail, continued to race close up to the far turn while always traveling well, waited
inside through the far turn, got a dream trip into the stretch when LITTLE CASINO left the rail open, surged ahead when cued by the rider, opened up and
won handily. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) reserved through the early going while racing three to four wide, moved forwardly down the backstretch and through
the turn then set down in earnest from the 5/16, continued to run on down the stretch, drifted out some to the middle of the track and finished a clear
second. GORDY'S BOY was hustled from the gate to get forward position early, tracked the pace form a length or two behind two off the rail, lost position
heading into the far turn, re-bid from the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch, had to alter course when LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) drifted into the
path, kept on well an gained the third spot. LITTLE CASINO was quick from the gate and first to the turn, pulled hard on the rider who was attempting to
temper the pace, was pushed along when SPROSTON made an early challenge nearing the three furlong marker, drifted out turning for home leaving the
rail wide open for KO SAMUI (IRE), then weakened in the stretch. BROKEN FINGER was content to race at the back of the compact field through the early
going, was still last mid-way through the far turn, swung out six wide for a rally that lacked punch and was unable to improve. SPROSTON was prominent
early while racing three wide, made a bid for the lead on the far turn but was outrun from the quarter pole and faded down the stretch.

Footnotes
ZAZEN tracked the solid early pace from the outside, came four wide into the turn and stalked the decent pace three wide to the quarter marker, was roused
into the stretch and chased BABY KRISTEN to mid-stretch, responded to urging and closed well into the final sixteenth, took command from the game
runner-up in the final strides and held in a drive for a determined win. BABY KRISTEN sent to establish the early lead, set solid fractions while prompted into
the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out a decent pace to the quarter pole, drifted out into upper stretch and held a clear lead at the furlong
marker, came under pressure approaching the sixteenth-pole, dug in into deep stretch, was gamely bested by ZAZEN in the final strides and held well at the
finish for second. TESSA (GB) rated off of the solid early pace and tracked two wide into the turn, came in tight while between runners midway through the
bend and was shuffled back at the quarter marker, regrouped and chased into the stretch, encountered traffic approaching mid-stretch and altered course
for the final furlong, rallied into the final sixteenth and held safely for third in a good effort. MISS UNION rated off of the early pace and tracked from the
inside, saved ground approaching the turn and was well placed into the bend, saved ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, could not muster
a final response in deep stretch and finished evenly. TAMARA MINE hard to load prior to the start, showed speed and raced close up to the solid early pace,
pressed BABY KRISTEN while between runners into the turn, kept close attendance to the pace along the bend, was outkicked into the stretch and chased
to the furlong marker, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN stalked the solid early pace three
wide and between runners, lost position into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FALSELY ACCUSED ceded the lead to LAW ABIDING and stalked that one under stout restraint to the far turn, bid for the lead near the quarter pole, found
that foe resilient but kept on under constant handling and wore down that rival inside the final sixteenth. LAW ABIDING gained the early lead by default and
was left to dictate reasonable fractions to the far turn, had plenty of run left for the stretch run to fend off a challenge from FALSELY ACCUSED near the
quarter pole, held that rival at bay to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. HONOS MAN settled mid-pack behind the pace while saving
ground, waited until the quarter pole to start the bid, swung out to the three path for the stretch run then ran on willingly under steady handling but came up
short. ATTENZIONE saved all the ground, was content to lag at the rear of the compact field despite the slow pace, bided time through the first half mile and
was still in no particular hurry through the far turn, rallied up the rail with a steady finish but came up short. ECOLOGIST settled three wide and a few
lengths off the early pace, held position as the pace quickened into the far turn then was first to come under pressure near the five-sixteenths pole, was kept
to task and remained in contact with the field for the sprint to the wire but was unable to improve.

YES HE CAN broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, controlled the early pace and set solid fractions into the turn, was well handled
while carving decent fractions approaching the quarter marker, was asked for more into upper stretch and extended the lead nearing the furlong pole, was
kept to task into the final sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish to prevail as much the best. LOVE CANDY hit the gate at the start, was away a bit
awkwardly and was off slowly, rushed up to track the solid early pace from the inside, was well positioned into the turn and saved ground to the quarter
marker, chased into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, made a mild rally into the final sixteenth, could not impact YES HE CAN into deep
stretch and held well in the end for second. SUPER BILL showed speed leaving the start and tracked the solid early pace, chased the loose pacesetter into
the turn and went two to three wide approaching the quarter marker, chased YES HE CAN into the stretch and could not make headway on the winner into
the final sixteenth, weakened a bit into deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just holding for third. TRINIDAD was unhurried away from the
start, tracked the solid pace heading into the turn and raced two wide to the quarter marker, angled four to five wide into the stretch and improved position at
the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the wire. ARMA D'ORO rated off of the early pace and tracked outside of an
inner rival to begin, was guided three then four wide along the turn and chased to the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong pole, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and finished evenly. DOO WOP DON allowed to settle in the early running, tracked from the outside
heading into the turn and raced three wide to the quarter marker, trailed to the furlong grounds, offered a mild late rally but did not threaten.

Footnotes
BIG DON'S SMILING showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the break, pressed the pace outside of FORDY G heading into the turn and kept
close attendance to the solid pace approaching the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch, lost a bit of ground nearing mid-stretch then
re-rallied inside of the furlong pole, battled with the game FORDY G into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and held off the oncoming
runner-up to determinedly prevail. JAIME'S COMMITMENT forwardly placed leaving the start, rated just off of the early pace and stalked into the turn, saved
ground to the quarter marker then waited for racing room approaching the top of the lane, tipped three to four wide for the drive and ran in pursuit to
mid-stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, finished well into deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. FORDY G stumbled leaving the start, was
hustled between runners and assumed a narrow early lead, set a pressured pace into the turn and carved out decent fractions approaching the quarter
marker, shook free into upper stretch and was kept to firm urging while leading to the furlong pole, battled with BIG DON'S SMILING into the final sixteenth,
could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and held for third in a good effort. EDDIE CROSSWIRE tracked the solid early pace from the second flight,
went between rivals into the turn and raced in traffic at the three furlong pole, recovered and gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, encountered
traffic into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, found room into the final sixteenth, closed well into deep stretch and just missed for third at
the finish. BRONZE ONE was hard to load prior to the start, tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, was steered three wide into the turn and
gained ground approaching the quarter marker, raced four wide into the stretch and lost position at the furlong pole, lacked a response in the final sixteenth
and flattened out in deep stretch. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH was unprepared at the start and was away slowly, spotted the field to begin and trailed into the
turn, chased from the inside to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and improved position at mid-stretch, was gaining while widest into deep
stretch but could not impact the leaders at the finish. GALOPIN GOURMET broke alertly and vied for the early lead, rated off of the contentious pace and
tracked into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker and chased into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally.
BRANNIGAN lacked early speed, maintained an outside path into the turn, raced five wide into the stretch and did not factor.
