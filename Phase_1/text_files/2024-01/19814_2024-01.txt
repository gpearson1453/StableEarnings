Footnotes
IZE SMILING set the pace in the two path, led from an outer pressing pair around the far turn, shook clear of them in upper stretch then held from a late
challenger. CATHERINE BLAZE bumped an inner rival then an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, tipped out from the three path to
the five path at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to reel in the leader nearing the wire but missed. LILY'S CREED took contact from an inner foe leaving the
gates, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, pressed within striking range around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in
upper stretch, sustained a chase but was outkicked for place by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. PLANTS AND BIRDS raced towards the rear in the
three to four path and passed tired rivals. PRIZE DEBATE bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed the leader from the three path along with an outer
foe, but faded in upper stretch. SECRET MELODY tracked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
DREWMAZING stalked the top pair from the four path, inched closer turning for home but was floated to the six path entering the lane, recovered to rally in
the final furlong, ranged up to the leader in the late stages and gained an advantage at the wire. HOORAY AUSTIN set the pace in the two path, drew clear
entering the lane, held sway through midstretch but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. JACK BOB AND LARRY took contact from an inner rival soon
after the start, pursued from midpack tow wide and between horses, eased the inside passing the three furlong pole, shifted out to the four path to vie for
place with an outer rival in upper stretch, but was outkicked for that position entering the final sixteenth. COACH KENNY laid off of the pace in the five path,
shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and ran on one-paced while hanging on his left lead. RELENTLESS DANCER trailed in the three path and
made little impact. MAGAWILDTIME pressed from the three path into the turn, bur drifted to the five path while failing to sustain pressure entering the lane
and faded between horses. BOULDERING brushed an outer rival early on, laid off of the pace along the inside and never got involved.

Footnotes
TIPSY RUNNER lacked speed in the three to two path into the turn, rallied between horses before tipping outside of rivals at the furlong grounds, sustained
progress changing back to his right lead at the sixteenth pole, ranged up to offer a late bid and forged an advantage at the wire. BIG TROUBLE tracked
along the inside, took the turn in the two path, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch, bid and gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, drew clear
but was caught in the shadow of the wire. ALEXIS ROSE broke inwardly, pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path in midstretch and
stayed on between horses to gain show. MT. MASADA brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside and just off the top pair, bid inside of
them entering the lane, led through upper stretch, but was headed by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds and gave way late. CLEAR VOICE prompted
outside of a rival and in the three path, led in the four path turning for home, drifted to the five to six path while getting headed by an inner bidder leaving the
quarter pole, drifted about while flopping to, then from, his right lead in upper stretch, yet sustained a chase through the final furlong. HUB CITY tracked in
the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and pursued one paced. WILLOWY trailed in the four path, shifted inwardly in midstretch and moved
up. HAUNTRESS brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from midpack in the four to six path and failed to menace. TAMMY LYNN brushed
with an inner rival at the start, then saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. WEC KEAH brushed with an outer foe upon leaving the gates, was sent
forward to set the pace in the two path, got headed by an outer rival with five sixteenths to go, kept on between horses entering the lane, then faltered
among foes in the final furlong. THIS MUST BE LOVE made little impact two wide and between horses. MOR MOR MUSIC brushed with an inner rival at
the start, laid off of the pace in the five to eight path and faded.

Footnotes
JOINT VENTURE vied along the inside, cleared into the far turn, met an outer challenge in upper stretch, got headed in midstretch yet fought back to
prevail. PEARSE broke a beat slow, bumped with an outer rival and was put to tight quarters by an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside,
gained inside of rivals around the far turn, took aim outside of the clear leader entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led narrowly entering the final furlong,
but relinquished the advantage in the late stages and was turned away. KOOPS broke outwardly, stalked the top pair from the four path, chased under
urging around the far turn and kept on to be best of the rest. JOHNNNY'S GAME vied two wide but gave way between horses around the far turn. BOLIVER
was off poorly and shied from an inner rival leaving him multiple lengths behind the rest at the start, trailed in the four path early on, then improved between
horses around the far turn. SPOKEN CODE failed to menace from the three path. FOE pursued from midpack in the three path, then along the rail and
failed to factor. SOCIAL APPEAL leaned outwardly at the start then never got involved. ICE COLD JIMMY was off a step slow and bumped with an inner
rival at the start, lacked speed while hung in the five path and was outrun. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS tracked along the inside but was through approaching
the far turn.

Footnotes
NILES CHANNEL was very fractious in the starting gate, then broke a bit awkwardly, pursued from midpack along the inside, picked up stride shifting to the
four path turning for home, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, led soon after and held from an inner late bidder. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) lacked speed along
the inside, trailed around the far turn, rallied two wide and between horses in upper stretch, knife through and surged along the inside to offer a late bid, but
was denied. SUPER WISE laid off of the pace in the two path, swung to the five path and between horses entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the leader
in the final furlong but needed more. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) was off slow and bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed two wide, advanced in
the four path around the far turn before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, then ran on willingly. OF THE MOMENT led outside of an inner
prompter, cleared that one with three furlongs to go, but was caught by an outer bidder at the furlongs grounds and weakened. CHAOSMOS bobbled a bit
and bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked in the three path, chased on his left lead and yielded between horses. LOOKIN AT BETTY broke
outwardly, bumped a rival and started a contact chain reaction at the start, tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn and failed to
factor. MILLARD'S SMILE took hard contact from an inner rival and was knocked off stride at the start, trailed early on, took the far turn in the five path and
failed to factor. ZULTAN transferred strong contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, prompted along the inside, but yielded with three furlongs
to go and faded. BLURT bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from the three path but yielded between horses turning for home.

COUNT DRACULA vied along the inside, led inside of a pair of rivals entering the lane, shook free in upper stretch and held sway. B FIFTY TWO settled off
of the pace in the two to three path, gained four wide around the far turn to bid entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader thereafter. SIR
EXTON stalked two wide and between horses, awaited racing room around the far turn then chased willingly. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC laid off of the pace along
the inside, pursued in the three to five path around the far turn and ran on mildly. RUNNIN MUNNIN lacked speed in the four to two path, fanned out to the
six path entering the lane and lacked a bid. MIDNIGHT AVENGER tracked along the inside, chased further back around the far turn and failed to factor.
RUNAWAY JOKE stalked three wide, chased between horses around the far turn and yielded. SEVEN ANNIVERSARY set the pace outside of an inner
vying rival, then weakened between horses leaving the quarter pole. KINGSCOTE was slow into stride and outrun throughout.

Footnotes
OCEAN VICTORY tracked along the inside, bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, led at the furlongs grounds, shifted out and held sway. HAMILTON'S
WAY broke out and brushed a foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked in hand two wide and among foes around the far turn, shifted
out to the five path for clear sailing in midstretch, drifted further leaving the furlongs grounds, yet straightened and offered a belated rally for place. ZVEREV
stalked in the two path, got outmoved by an inner bidder in upper stretch, sustained a chase to gain place nearing the final sixteenth but was caught by an
outer bidder late. CABERNAYDO laid off of the pace two wide, swung to the five path entering the lane, floated to the eight path in midstretch and stayed on
late for a minor share. HOPE JOE'S RIGHT tracked three wide and pursued evenly between horses. KING MENDELSSOHN stuttered a step at the start,
saved ground well back then ran on willingly. SUGAR HOOK pursued from midpack two wide, shifted to the four path around the far turn, but was floated
outwardly and yielded between horses in midstretch. MAX IS G MONEY sped clear early on, shifted to the three path entering the lane, but was bested by
an inner bidder at the furlongs grounds and weakened between horses. CELESTIAL JOY (GB) lacked speed in the three path and failed to factor.
DONEGAL DREAMER never got involved from the three path. ULTIMATE VALUE was brushed by an inner rival while off slow and showed little.
