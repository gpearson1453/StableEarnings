the turn and kicked clear. IMPERIALTY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader between horses up the
backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and chased the winner on to the wire. MALIBU BRAD tracked the pace setter on the
outside through the opening quarter, began a bid from the three path coming around the bend and kept on to the finish. D LOVER veered in leaving the
gate, settled off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the lane. UNO UNO bumped soundly with the horse to
his inside at the break, dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and passed tiring horses in the stretch.
KAPRIZOV bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the bend from the four path and never
threatened. DASH TO FINISH veered out and bumped hard with the horses to his outside at the start, recovered to duel on the outside up the backstretch,
raced in the three path around the turn and tired from there. DIGGER BARNS pressed the pace on the inside early, continued around the turn in the two
