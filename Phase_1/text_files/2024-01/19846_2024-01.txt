widest into stretch for show spot. BEAUTIFUL BOLT good position throughout with no late kick in the stretch run. RETROSPECT void of speed to far turn
while only improving position late. RAGGITY SAND no speed to far turn with mild improvement in the stretch run. ANTIHERO never a real menace
throughout. QUEEN RHAENYRA outside position to quarter pole with no late response in stretch. CRUSHED ICE tried to keep up for three quarters, faded
from far turn. ISLANDINTHESTREAM off rail run to quarter pole, flattened out in the stretch run. BRIC A BRAC chased leader to the half, steadily gave in
from the point. RESPECTIVE had a steady fade throughout with little resistance.

EFFICACIOUS quick to the front while well handled throughout, stayed well clear under good handling to the finish. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER unhurried to the
turn, rallied along outside for place, no match. SPOTTY SHOWERS raced evenly throughout and just missed the place spot late. LEMON BOMB never far
back throughout with no late kick in the final furlong. CHIQUITA MOSCA no speed to the stretch, improved position only in final stages. DANSEUR D'ORO
never a menace throughout. MORE THAN A DIVA inside chase to the turn, gave in through the stretch run readily. TALL GIRL never factored throughout.
DELIGHTFUL CAT failed to menace throughout. CHICA CHULA chased between horses to the turn, nothing left in the stretch.

Footnotes
STEP ON IT had an awkward star while going widest around the first turn, rallied along into far turn with a solid run to get up in time on the wire to just win
the head bob.. AMERICAN RAIDER had no speed to the half with a bid in deep stretch while gamely nailed late at the wire. EL CERRITO wide run around
the first turn, pressed pace to deep stretch but outgamed in the late going. HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY good position to stretch, battled on in the final sixteenth.
PURE CANE SUGAR no speed to far turn, ran into fog far turn, continued on late. JARED THE WARRIOR no speed and never in contention from far turn
and stretch. UNUSUAL ACTIVITY good position to the half with nothing left from far turn. POGOERIACH raced along evenly with no kick from quarter pole
to the finish. RED CHEEKS was through after the half and dropped back readily. MONBA QUAKE dueled inside to far turn while used up and faltered in the
lane. PAPA D L brief speed to duel, had faded with little resistance. Extreme fog obscured the quarter pole call turning for home.
