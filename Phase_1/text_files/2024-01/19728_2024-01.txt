Footnotes
TUSCAN SKY hustled from the gate, led early on before being engaged in a duel by HAVE YOU HEARD at the nine-sixteenths while three wide, tucked
inside into the turn and steadily got shaken off, tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge at the eighth pole, came again to take command near the sixteenth pole, then drew clear to the finish. HAVE YOU HEARD four wide in
aim of the front early on, advanced to duel with the aforementioned foe tucking to the two path into the turn, shook off that rival clearing to tuck nearly on
front at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, inched clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was collared near
the sixteenth marker, ran on clear of the rest to be along second best. TRUE CONNECTION chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. AMBITION chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SKYLER'S ARTEMIS coaxed from the
gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. LIVEHAPPY chased just off the inside

Footnotes
PRESIDENT Z pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch, dueled outside of NATURAL
HARBOR in the drive and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CLUBHOUSE was well placed while rated just off the pace, went around the turn in the
two path while let out, swung four wide into the stretch, pursued the leading duo on the outside, gained into the final sixteenth, drifted out late and just
missed while narrowly up for the place. NATURAL HARBOR went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the
turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and just missed while clear for the show. MAGNIFICENT MILE broke a step
slow, was urged along on the outside, moved in with five furlongs to run then was taken in hand behind horses, started the turn in the three path then shifted
five wide, chased on the outside, was driven six wide into the stretch, angled in just inside the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed response. KANT
BEAT THE ROCK chased the pace, saved ground on the turn and tired. BAYOU SPIRIT was urged along off the pace, chased in the four path on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and capitulated. DARK VECTOR was ridden along at the rear, climbed badly near the eleven-sixteenths pole then dropped
further behind, went four then three wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
JUST STEP ON IT went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, moved clear with five furlongs to run, controlled the action while inside
to the two path on the turn, responded well to the challenge of QUIET WISDOM in upper stretch, shook off that foe before the furlong marker and held under
strong urging. LIBERTY CENTRAL was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, moved out in pursuit of the winner in the stretch and finished
willingly to just get the place. QUIET WISDOM settled off the pace, shifted from three to five wide on the turn, gained near the five-sixteenths, chased
outside into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the place while clear for the show. BERNING BEAUTY dropped well behind while ridden
along, went around the turn in the three path, drifted out outside the furlong marker and improved position with late energy. AVA'S UNCLE BILLY was well
placed just off the pace, chased in the two path while between foes on the turn and weakened. HOYA tracked the pace, chased four wide on the turn and
came up empty. HAIR ON FIRE was sent hard from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back near the five-eighths pole then chased the
leader, went three wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SEBA M was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DILLON broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch, moved in outside the furlong marker and capitulated. NEPTUNE BEACH was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the
turn and failed to respond. SAHANATIEN was backed into the gate from the front, refused to break when the doors opened and remained in the gate then
was walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE

pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared at the three-sixteenths, weakened in the late stages while preserving
the show honors. ANTHRACITE chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. DISAPPEARANCE chased five then four wide coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went nine wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. STRONG LIGHT six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide at the head of the stretch, offered no response.

GIN GIN saved ground on the first turn, settled in third position, was asked while two to three wide on the far turn, rallied to make an outside bid into upper
stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, fought outside the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. PRINCESS MAYFAIR
broke out then was coaxed to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, fought on
well in the final furlong but missed while well clear for the place. SHIMMERING ALLURE rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved
out outside the five-eighths pole, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, was urged four then five wide on the far turn and came up empty while best of the
rest. MOST OF ALL was coaxed from the gate, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three then four wide on the

Footnotes
TEN CENT TOWN showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside patiently handled until set down taking the two path into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and drifted out herding his main rival out two paths before edging away from that foe, drifted an additional two paths safely clear
to the finish in the late stages. WARALO chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide for home, dug in latched on to
the outside of the aforementioned foe and was herded out by that rival two paths before being cleared, ran on to chase the winner home altering inwards
late while along well clear of the rest and second best. QUICK TO ACCUSE broke out at the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then
four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. SAFALOW'S MISSION got
bumped at the start by DOC ADVANTAGE due to pressure from KID BILLY, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, weakened. DOC ADVANTAGE got bumped between foes and pinched back at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. AGILITY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. KID BILLY broke out at the start bumping and pinching back DOC ADVANTAGE into SAFALOW'S
MISSION, chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths and tired. PLEASE BE NICE broke out at the start, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from midway on the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WHITTINGTON PARK moved in while settling off the pace, shifted from the two path to the three path early on the turn, moved to the five path near the
three-eighths pole, dropped to the three path nearing the quarter-pole, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole,
swapped back to his inside lead at that point then took the lead and prevailed under strong urging. SILO RIDGE pressed the pace on the inside of a foe,
dropped back with five furlongs to run then moved out, chased three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and willingly earned the place.
CERTIFIED LOVERBOY settled off the pace, shifted from the two path to the four path on the turn, ranged up to make a bid inside the three-eighths pole,
took the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the crop, led under until just before the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while
able to get the show. EXPECTED VALUE broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch
and improved position. MAMA'S GOLD bobbled at the start, went to the front, showed the way on the outside of an opponent, went clear with five furlongs to
run, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat outside the five-sixteenths marker, lost the advantage just inside that marker and tired. PRINCIPE
D'ORO dropped back after the start, settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. CASCAIS moved
out leaving the chute, settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
