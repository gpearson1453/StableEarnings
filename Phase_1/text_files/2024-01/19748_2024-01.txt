BANDSLAMMER bumped by outside rival a few jumps out of the gate, vied for lead in between rivals on the backstretch, continued dueling through the turn,
asked and responded well in the lane and edged away in the final sixteenth. BIG CREEK vied for lead from the jump, continued to hold the rail through the
turn and into the lane, kept on gamely while being second best. CITY OF CHAMPIONS broke in and bumped rival at the start, settled into a good spot off
dueling rivals, continued in hand on the turn and failed to cash in on the good trip, proving no match and saving show money. ECHO ALPHA SIX stalked the
pace along the rail, continued to save ground on the turn and made mild progress in the lane. DR. TROUTMAN off a length slow, stalked pace off the rail,
continued off the rail on the turn and lacked rally in the lane in between rivals. MCWHERTER pressed pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three
wide on the turn, lost ground on midway through the turn and tired in the lane.
