Footnotes
WOOD BE WILD broke alertly and moved clear then remained safe in a steady drive while never seriously threatened. LONG LEGGED BOY dropped back
in the two path then narrowed the gap through the stretch. HARLEY'S CHARLY chased three wide off the pacesetter and flattened out in the stretch.
WEGOTTAGUY raced in closest pursuit and continued well to hold the show. QUICKENING raced four wide off the pacesetter, angled inside rivals in the
stretch and continued well. LUCKY DUDE moved five wide down the backstretch, made a brief bid on the turn then weakened. TIEMPO PERFECTO broke
awkwardly, was taken up inside at the top of the stretch and was no factor. WHISKEYMAC saved ground just off the leaders and gave way in the stretch.

TIZ A SHARPIE reserved off the pace, bid wide on the final turn then edged away in the stretch while kept to her task. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED stalked the
pacesetters three wide, bid to the front at the three eighths pole, could not hold off the winner but finished gamely. KENTUCKY PRIDE lacked speed, angled
out in the stretch and flattened. SUIKO saved ground, was taken up between foes near the three sixteenths pole then angled out to secure room. TONALA
trailed for three quarters, moved wide and passed fading rivals. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE forced the pace for five furlongs and gave way. IYIYI moved clear
inside early, was collared after half a mile and stopped.

wide down the backstretch, rallied and finished willingly to be easily second best. BUCKS ARE MOVING broke very slowly, rushed to contention inside then
tired late. EXCURSION faded to last after quarter mile then came again with some energy. CRAFTY DON forced the pace down the backstretch then gave
way readily. MARISA'S MISSION settled off the leaders inside and weakened steadily. FOREST SURVIVOR set a pressured pace inside and stopped after
half a mile.

Footnotes
BLAZING RED pursued the loose pacesetter, rallied through the stretch and was just up determinedly in the final stride. COLD SHOT sprinted clear for half
mile, was collared in midstretch and battled gamely just missing. JOHN DUTTON advanced strongly outside, poked his head in front late but just missed.
CAPITAL CONQUEST chased outside, bid on the turn then went evenly late. BRONX BOYS moved four wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally.
DANCE CODE lacked speed and was never in contention. PRIVATE CABANA dropped well behind and was always outrun. MCCRAKENS GHOST urged
just off the pacesetter and began weakening on the turn. YO NESSROUNDONKERN dropped back early and trailed throughout.

MARTINI MARTIN settled well back, advanced wide then surged late and moved clear in the final stages. MALIBU STAR rallied on the final turn, led into the
stretch then was caught in the final stages. RICH'S WAY trailed for half a mile, advanced very wide and finished strongly. CONCEALED CARRY dueled
inside, shook loose before half a mile then tired in the final furlong. THE KING CHEEK stalked the pacesetters three wide then proved empty in the stretch.
MY IMAGINATION dropped back under coaxing inside and failed to respond. HELIUM chased in midpack inside and lacked a rally. DIVINE MIRACLE
forced the pace and gave way after half a mile.
