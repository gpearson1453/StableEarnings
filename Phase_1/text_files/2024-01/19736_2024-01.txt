RUNAWAY WYWY tracked clear leader along the rail, continued along the inside on the turn, inherited lead when rival lugged out into the lane, responded
when rival came back and held to win. ABADON sent clear, entered turn off the rail, continued to drift wide throughout the turn, ending up in the five path,
lugged into the lane into the seven path, asked and responded in a game effort to be second best. AROUND THE DIAL stalked pace along the inside on the
backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, asked in the lane and responded to outkick rival and win a photo for third. OBVIOUS tracked pacesetter
two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid in the three path, and outgamed for show money. HOT MEMORIES away
cleanly, not asked and dropped back, stalked pace three wide, continued three wide through the turn, asked in the lane and failed to improve. WATER'S
FOR FIGHTN stalked clear leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, began to weaken late on the turn and rider coasted
