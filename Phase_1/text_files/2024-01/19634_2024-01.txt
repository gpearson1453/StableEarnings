two wide into the stretch and faded late. FINISTERE drifted in bumping rivals at the start, was taken wide soon thereafter then was no factor. HIJACK THE

widened through the stretch to win as much the best while being ridden out. KARAMEL CORN trailed through the first turn, advanced steadily the balance of
the trip outside rivals and finished second best. MARVIN'S EXPRESS was hung five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and went evenly.
NAMBITI chased the pace three then two wide into the stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. TIDE RISING failed to menace. RED COMET was
through after a half. JACK BE FAST away alertly, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, remained a sharp threat into the far turn then weakened.
PLATE IT UP was through early.

Footnotes
SERPA unhurried near the inside, began to close ground on the far turn, shifted three wide entering the stretch, rallied under left handed urging to make the
lead near the sixteenth pole and finished with a burst of speed to win going away. STEP AHEAD chased the pace into the far turn, rallied two wide to make
the lead near the quarter pole, battled until the sixteenth pole two wide and was no match for the winner. ROYAL AIR FORCE was righted at the start,
allowed to settle, loomed boldly along the rail entering the stretch, matched strides until the final stages then was outfinished. MOON OVER DUBAI offered
a mild bid inside rivals on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. TWELVE MINUS ONE with the second flight two wide in the five path down the
backstretch, was through after a half. ELEGGUA had brief speed. RANSAM PAYNTER sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into the
far turn then flattened out.

energetic hand ride to win as much the best. OAXACA chased the winner two wide and was no match while clear for second. THINK IT THRU stalked the
pace three wide and went evenly. LINE DANCER checked between horses entering the clubhouse turn, remained a forward factor along the inside into the
stretch then faded. EXPRESS FASHION failed to menace. CAUSE OF LOVE was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK

Footnotes
SEEKING FREEDOM stalked the early pace three wide, responded under right handed urging and wore down rivals in a game effort. KELLEHER never far
back, dug in through deep stretch four wide and just missed. VERNON'S BEST dueled for the lead two wide and was outfinished in the final stages despite
a determined effort. GHOST OF LONDYN offered a mild bid five wide on the turn then leveled off. ONE STEP ASIDE contested the lead along the inside
until mid stretch then faded. OLLIE'S FOLLY bobbled inward at the start and was through after a half. GO TOTHE PRINCIPAL was through early.
