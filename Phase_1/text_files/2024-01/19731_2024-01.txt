Footnotes
MOMENT OF STARDOM saved ground off of the pace, rallied to offer a rail bid in the final furlong and edged ahead. MI SOLUTION set the pace in the two
path, drifted out approaching midstretch and was bested by an inner rival in the final sixteenth. COMMANDER SCOTT tracked along the inside, took aim
two wide and between horses around the far turn, but was herded outwardly while chasing the drifting leader and held show late. GREAT COOLNESS
tarcked three wide, chased while being herded outwardly approaching midstretch and lacked a bid on his left lead. SCORING DRIVE laid off of the pace in
the two to four path and moved up. CALLINGINTHENIGHT pursued from the three path and lacked a bid. SENATOR CON trailed along the inside, moved
out of last in the three path around the far turn and failed to factor. JOEY'S GAME broke a step slow and was outrun two wide. BATES COURT prompted
along the inside before shifting to stalk outside of the leader entering the backstretch, but faded between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
SACRED SAINT dueled for the lead along the inside and drove clear entering midstretch. C C SENORA hopped slightly and was off a bit tardily, trailed
along the inside, gained inside of rivals in upper stretch, split foes three wide inside the final furlong and ran on to be a clear place. RADIANT REBEL
prompted along the inside, chased after a quarter mile, shifted outside of the leading pair turning for home, drifted to the four path chasing in upper stretch,
yet ran on evenly between horses and narrowly held show. CANA GRIS laid off of the pace in the two path, encountered traffic behind foes leaving upper
stretch, yet stayed on in the final furlong to miss reaching show. BAYOU BERTIE lunged outwardly and was off slow, laid off of the pace in the four to five
path, floated six wide in upper stretch and lacked a kick. EUROSTORM dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but gave way nearing midstretch
and weakened. OUR INDIAN GIRL tracked three to four wide, but yielded five wide and between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CALICOCO set the pace in the three to two path, cleared and shfited out entering the lane, then held sway. DEER CROSSING laid off of the pace in the two
to three path, shfited out to the seven path in midstretch and offered a late kick to gain place at the wire. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF pursued from midpack
two wide and between horses, tracked along the inside approaching the far turn, gained place from an inner foe nearing midstretch, took aim inside of the
clear leader, but flattened out and was nailed for place. COFFEE COUNTY broke outwardly, pursued from the three to two path and ran on mildly.
HUDSON'S TURN raced at the rear in the two to three path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane and moved up. PERRINS trailed along the
inside, then two wide and between horses, fanned to the six path entering the lane and passed tired rivals. TOUCHDOWN JOE pursued along the inside,
but yielded position entering the backstretch, faded further around the far turn, then kept on but failed to factor. REAL CITY SPEED stalked in the two to
three path, chased closest to the eventual winner around the far turn and weakened. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT stalked forwardly in the four path, but faded
between horses in upper stretch.

HIGHLAND FALLS tracked in the four path, bid three wide into the far turn, vied turning for home, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, then held firm
from an outer bidder through the final furlong. BRIGHT SPARK saved ground off of he pace, picked up stride tipping to the four path at the three sixteenths
pole, gained to take aim on the new leader while attempting a bid in the final furlong, but was staved off through the late stages. BANISHING was briefly
antsy awaiting the start, vied along the inside, then with a pair of outer rivals around the far turn, gamely sparred with the eventual winner through upper
stretch, but yielded approaching the final sixteenth. HE'S GOT THIS bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted
out to the four path entering the lane before being floated wider by an inner rival in upper stretch, and sustained a chase for a minor share. EL ORIENTE
(CHI) bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, stalked in the three path, chased between horses around the far turn and faded. RUNWAY MAGIC vied
three to two wide, then between horses around the far turn but weakened in upper stretch. BASELINE BEATER steadied when put to tight quarters between
horses at the start, trailed in the three path and was outrun. MONAASIB pursued form the four path and faded.

Footnotes
CAMARO Z stalked along the inside, pressed two wide into the far turn, bid turning for home, chased his inner counterpart in upper stretch, yet kept on to
rebid entering the final sixteenth and prevailed between horses. ROCK N ROLL BOLT rated well back in the two to four path, got floated to the seven path
while picking up stride turning for home, then sustained a rally to offer a late bid outside of the top pair, but narrowly missed. EL ALACRAN set the pace
along the inside, led from an outer bidder turning for home, shook free in upper stretch, but met that one's rebid in the final furlong and was bested. MILL
STREET pursued two wide, tipped to the five path nearing the lane and offered a mild kick. GOTTA KEEP HIM laid off of the pace along the inside, entered
the far turn in the three path before being floated to the six path turning for home, and yielded between horses. KING OF THE PALACE tracked two wide
and between horses, chased along the inside around the far turn and faded. DEN'S GOOD GRACE pursued along the inside and faded. HOLD YOUR
APPLAUSE stalked three wide but weakened between horses. SHARP SPARK broke in and bumped a rival at the start, then was outrun. CURLIN
GUNNER was bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start and showed little.

Footnotes
BEHEMAH STAR pressed two wide, led in the three path around the far turn, cleared entering the lane and held sway under a drive. HIGHLAND CREEK
stalked along the inside, gained place from an inner rival entering the lane and was second best. BUDRO TALKING trailed along the inside, advanced
between horses two to three wide around the far turn and ran on. COSMIC TRAIN laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed in the three path around the
far turn,, then improved between horses. BLUE CHEESE pursued in midpack tucking to the inside around the first turn, then saved ground to no avail.
PACIFICISLANDTIME lacked speed in the four to five path and made little impact. ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT pursued from the three path and tired.
DRILLING REPORT set the pace along the inside, but was no match for an outer presser turning for home and stopped.

Footnotes
ACTION SEEKER set the pace in the three path, dueled with bidders on either side in upper stretch, then gamely fended off his outer counterpart.
ABSOLUTE COURAGE pressed the leader from the four path, bid in upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong but missed. PATH TO SUCCESS laid
off of the pace along the inside, advanced with five furlongs to go, awaited race room around the far turn before steadying nearing the five sixteenths pole,
took aim along the fence in upper stretch, but was blocked and stymied behind a rival at the three sixteenths pole, recovered and kept on as that hole
re-opened, and edged show late. LIL BRO COOP stalked in the two path, bid inside of the top pair entering the lane, vied into midstretch but yielded with a
sixteenth to go. TARAASHOQ laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then ran on. FABLED RULER trailed in the two path, swung to the eight
path in upper stretch and moved up. RED MOSCATO pursued from the two path and faded. WHISKEY AND EASY tracked in the five path and gave way.
FLAT OUT AMERICAN laid off of the pace in the four to six path, weakened around the far turn and was eased through the lane.
