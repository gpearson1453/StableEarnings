Footnotes
WARDA set the pace in the four path, tipped into the two path going into the turn, opened up in the three path passing the quarter, tipped out to the four
path at the top of the lane, kicked away handily, and won going away under wraps. ISAYSO stalked in the five path, was coaxed in the four path passing the
three-eighths, tipped into the three path entering the stretch, and kept on for place. SCORED chased in the five path, was cued in the four path passing the
three-eighths, swung from the six path into the stretch, and chased on for show. REASSESS was prompted along from up close in the three path, steadied
along the inside going into the turn, driven from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. KHOZANKA broke out at the start, trailed in the three path early
and made no impact from the five path in the stretch. SAND WEDGE raced off the pace in the two path but was no factor from the three path down the lane.
PROBLEMATICA broke thru the gate during the loading process, tracked in the six path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, floated out to the seven
path turning into the stretch, but failed to bid. MI AMORE rated inside but never menaced.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI laid up close outside of the leader in the four path, bid under a nudge in the three path passing the three-eighths, took command passing the
quarter, floated out to the five path while being roused into the lane, inched clear going into the final furlong, and held off an outer foe late. CELESTIAL
GLAZE tracked in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, was cued approaching the quarter, floated out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, and ran on for place. FLOAT ON stalked in the three path, was coaxed along the two path around the turn, and stayed on from the three path down
the lane for show. AMERICAN PURE chased in the six path, was cued from the five path early into the turn, but made no impact. GAME BOY BENNY set
the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, but faded along the inside down the stretch. DOC AMSTER rated in the three path, was driven in the four
path turning into the stretch, but was no menace.

ADMIRAL HOPPER set a clear pace in the two path and widened while being ridden out. TREVESS chased the winner inside down the backstretch, angled
to the three path midway around the turn and finished willingly while unable to make an impression on the winner. PEACH COBBLER raced in range four
wide, could not keep pace in upper stretch but kept on to hold the show. LOVIN MAKES CENTS had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace three
and four wide and lacked a rally. IT'S NORA NOW was outrun inside. GIRLS HOUSE played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
TATANKA settled around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backside, was nudged around the far turn, cued inside of foes turning into
the lane, and dug in gamely to hold on. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY stalked in the two path, waited patiently around the far turn, was roused between foes in the
three path at the top of the stretch, bumped with an outer foe in upper stretch, and ran on for place. SPACE LAUNCH trailed in the two path, was coaxed
along the inside around the far turn, and rallied for show. SMITHWICK'S SPICE tracked in the three path, was driven in the five path around the far turn,
swung from the six path into the lane, and finished evenly. RUNNINGWSCISSORS laid up close in the three path, bid in the four path around the far turn,
was cued turning into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, and flattened out late. THE GREAT OZ rated in the three path, was ridden in
the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but drifted out, and never threatened. ROCK THE STARS chased in the
two path, had to steady in the three path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, was steadied around the sixteenth,
and failed to bid.

CHASING AFTER YOU set the pace in the two path, was cued approaching the quarter, and drew clear into the final sixteenth. MO TOURING raced off the
pace in the two path, was cued along the rail midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. AVATAL
HERO bumped an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, swung out to the eight path turning
into the stretch, and kept on for show. NO ACTION got bumped by an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path, angled out to the six path under a
drive turning into the lane, but was one paced. MOOR STRENGTH prompted the pace in the five path, bid under coaxing in the four path passing the
quarter, swung from the five path into the lane, but flattened around the sixteenth. FLIRTINI stalked in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three
path while trying to bid midway around the turn, and weakened in upper stretch.

ABRUMAR was fractious behind the gate, disputed the pace two and three wide while under a rating hold and edged ahead in the final furlong. CUGINO
saved ground up close early, advanced between rivals down the backstretch, stalked inside around the far turn, bid between rivals in midstretch and was
second best. DEADPAN trailed in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and finished well. NOMOS raced in range two and three wide and had a mild
rally between foes in the final furlong. BEYOND STOKED prompted the pace three wide and faded in the lane. THE PROCESS chased the pace four wide
and was one-paced in the stretch. TYPHOON FURY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. K'S STORM READY dueled inside of the winner and
tired in the final furlong. KATHEEB rated inside, made progress at the rail in upper stretch then was shut off leaving the eighth pole and dropped back under
no further urging. CUBAN THUNDER (IRE) was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SOCIALLY SELECTIVE prompted the pace three wide, took over nearing the five-sixteenths marker, drew off under a drive and was geared down late.
AMERICAN OF COURSE set a pressured pace inside, was no match for the winner in the lane but held clear of the rest. SANDRA D stalked the pace
inside, raced in tight quarters pole around much of the turn, angled four wide leaving the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. EUPHIMA (ARG) chased
the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. TAKE CHARGE CHLOE broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back four and five wide and never threatened.
DRUM ROLL was outrun while racing four wide. SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH pressed the pace two wide between foes and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
IVORY MOON was hustled along to set the pace in the four path, tipped into the two path going into the turn, was cued from the three path into the stretch,
and dug in to hold sway. ALLA BREVE raced off the pace in the two path, was cued along the rail midway around the turn, got stymied slightly turning into
the lane, swung out to the eighth path bumping an outer foe, and rallied for place. CALL ME SPICY chased in the six path, was ridden in the five path
around the turn, and kept on for show. KICK A RHYME (IRE) stalked in the two path, was roused between foes passing the quarter, swung form the four
path into the lane, but was one paced. WORK OF FICTION raced wellback in the four path, fanned out to the nine path under a ride turning into the stretch,
bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, and made no impact. MISS SAKAMOTO bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path, was
ridden between foes in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, but flattened. THREE POLKS bumped with an inner foe
at the start, pressed inside but yielded in the final furlong. GET THE CANDY prompted the pace in the six path, was cued in the three path midway around
the turn, but faded from the five path in the stretch. BOSSY DIVA bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack along the inside but weakened
from the two path down the lane. SHEZA SPITFIRE hopped at the start, trailed in the three path, angled out to the nine path passing the eighth pole, and
was no menace. YA MAR tracked in the five path, tucked into the three path around the turn, but was empty from the four path in the stretch. MY LADY
JAMES bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, had to steady going into the turn, was cued while swinging out to the seven path turning
into the stretch, then appeared to take an awkward step, was eased across the wire, pulled up, and walked off.
