Footnotes
NIKEE KAN stalked in the three path, waited in the two path around the turn, was roused while tipping out to the four path at the top of the stretch, tipped
inwards passing the eighth pole, and inched past an outer foe late. BODACIOUS BREN pressed in the three path, bid in the two path midway around the
turn, took the lead while being roused and floating out to the five path turning into the lane, dug in but drifted in passing the eight pole, lost the lead late, but
held place. ST. PAT'S DAY rated inside, was stymied approaching the quarter, shifted out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show.
FOXY LADY chased in the three path, was roused passing the quarter, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and stayed on. SASSY
MELISSA raced off the pace in the four path, was cued midway around the turn, had to fan widest and was in the nine path at the top of the stretch, and
made no impact. HEIR TO THE ROAR raced wellback in the three path, waited in the two path around the turn, but was stymied and clipped heels with an
inner ahead foe while swinging out to the seven path into the lane, angled back inwards, but was no factor. MAGIC MOONSTAR prompted the pace in the
four path, was roused in the three path passing the three-eighths, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but weakened while tipping inwards.
BUNTY WINDERMERE set the pace in the two path, was pushed along the inside around the turn, but gaveway from the three path in the stretch.

Footnotes
WAR PRINCESS prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn, drew clear the first time through the homestretch, set the pace in the two path
from there, drifted out in the lane and just lasted. I'M A SURE THING settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer at the rail around the far turn,
angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed. VERSIFY trailed through the opening mile and rallied at the rail for the show. AKAYLA (IRE)
went evenly inside. ISOLA (IRE) set the pace in the two path around the first turn, rated inside when the winner took over the first time through the stretch,
angled out to re-bid in the three path around the far turn and weakened in the lane. SETTLING STORM chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a
closing bid.

Footnotes
SLIM MAN set the pace in the two path, was nudged along around the turn, roused while floating out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and drew
clear. HOLIDAY FANTASY rated in the three path, was cued in the two path midway around the turn, split foes in the three path at the top of the lane, and
kept on for place. MAJOR KING tracked in the two path, was ridden between foes into the turn, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, and was one
paced for show. DOUBLE PLAY KING broke out and bumped an outer foe, stalked inside, was driven along the rail into the stretch, but faded. TEPEU got
bumped by an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, tipped out to the six path under drive turning into the lane, but flattened. EXULT trailed along
the inside early and never menaced. NATURE BOY prompted the early pace in the three path, but gaveway passing the three-eighths, and was eased thru
the stretch.

Footnotes
ROSWELL tracked the pace three wide between foes, finished willingly and was up and clear late. FAR AND FEW vied outside down the backstretch,
cleared and angled in entering the turn, set the pace along the rail to deep stretch, switched back to the left lead leaving the sixteenth marker and yielded.
LESLIE'S HUMOR raced off the pace inside, went two and three wide around the turn, found a seam in upper stretch and rallied for the show. NEAT TRICK
chased the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced through the final furlong. VERY PRACTICAL failed to menace while
racing four wide. OVERLY DRAMATIC raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. SWEET MIMI had early
speed between foes, chased two wide around the turn and came up empty. SIPHON CITY GIRL had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
SWEET DANI GIRL tracked in the two path, steadied along the inside midway around the turn, was roused while tipping out to the four path in upper stretch,
and drew past an inner foe in the closing stages. BABY STEPS had a rank start, set the pace inside, was cued from the two path into the stretch, lost the
lead late, but held place. CHARLIE'S WISH had to steady in the two path early, settled off the pace in the two path turning into the backstretch, was cued
passing the three-eighths, driven from the three path into the stretch, and kept on for show. THELASTBULLETSMINE rated in the three path, was ridden
around the far turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, but evened out. BOTH SIDES had to steady along the inside early, trailed in the two path, was
cued in the three path into the far turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and made no impact. TIME PASSAGE broke thru the gate during the
loading process, stalked in the four path, bid in the three path going into the far turn, but weakened from the five path in the stretch. TRACY ANN'S
LEGACY prompted the pace in the three path but backed up between foes around the far turn.

could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but kept on to hold the show. DAZZLING MOVE raced off the pace three wide, spun six wide turning
for home and lacked the needed rally. TAPRIXIE dueled between foes in the three path and weakened in the stretch. QUERENDONA saved ground and

KARAYA laid up close on the outer hip of the pacesetter in the four path, bid from the three path into the turn, took the lead passing the quarter, was cued
while floating out to the five path at the top of the lane, and dug in to hold off an outer foe. EPONA'S HOPE stalked in the three path, took aim under a ride
in the six path turning into the stretch, ran on, but was denied to finish with place. AVELLINO set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path
passing the three-eighths, lost the lead passing the quarter, but held show. SUGAR TREAT raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path
around the turn, but made no impact. MIGUEL'S BELLE stumbled at the start, rated in the two path, was coaxed along the inside around the turn, but faded
from the two path in the stretch. KAITIE KAIT chased in the five path but failed to menace from the seven path in the stretch. TEARDUC was prompted
along from up close in the five path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP tracked in the three path, was coaxed along the inside around the turn, floated out to the eight path turning into the lane, and rallied past
an inner foe around the sixteenth. KING CAB set the pace in the three path, was confidently handled in the two path rounding the turn, tipped out to the six
path under rousing turning into the stretch, stayed on his left lead, and was caught around the sixteenth to place. DANGEROUS RIDE chased in the four
path, was driven in the three path around the turn, angled out to the eight path going into the lane, and was one paced for show. FURIOUS ANGER raced
off the pace in the six path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. MAPTITUDE trailed in the four path, floated out to the six path
around the turn, and never threatened. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN rated in the five path, tipped to the rail early around the turn, but was no menace.
