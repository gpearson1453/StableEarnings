Footnotes
MO TOWN GAL forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the early pace three wide and between runners, advanced into the turn and disputed the pace
two wide at the quarter pole, vied for the lead into the stretch, engaged with I'M A RISQUE GIRL inside of the furlong marker, battled with that rival into the
final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch, determinedly dug in and lasted at the finish to prevail. I'M A RISQUE GIRL tracked the decent early pace
four deep, advanced into the turn and stalked the pace three wide at the quarter marker, mounted a three then four wide bid into the stretch and vied for the
lead nearing the furlong marker, battled with MO TOWN GAL into the final sixteenth, made a final surge approaching the wire and just missed for the win,
while besting the rest. RAUCOUS TIZZY took back off of the decent early pace, raced two wide into the turn, swung four then five wide into the stretch and
ran evenly to the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top pair in the final sixteenth but closed well in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third.
PERFECTLY JULIE sent to establish the early lead, set a decent pace while pressured into the turn, held a narrow lead heading to the quarter pole and
battled into the stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. MARY MARGARET stalked the solid early pace
from the inside, chased between runners into the turn and came in a bit tight along the bend, chased two wide and between rivals to the quarter marker,
angled four wide for the drive, chased to mid-stretch and could not muster a late response. ASSUREDLY broke alertly and vied for the early lead, ceded the
lead to PERFECTLY JULIE and pressed the decent pace into the turn, lost ground along the bend and chased to the quarter pole, maintained an inside
path into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, failed to respond to urging into the final sixteenth and weakened.

Footnotes
TIZ MY PRINCESS allowed to settle while not far back to begin, tracked the moderate pace from the inside through the backstretch run, gained ground at
the quarter marker, came in a bit tight into upper stretch, tipped two wide while advancing approaching the furlong marker, responded to urging and rallied in
the final sixteenth, reeled in PACIFIC ZIP in the final strides and was up in time to prevail at the finish. PACIFIC ZIP showed good early speed away from
the start, assumed command and dictated terms into the first turn, was engaged by BOURBON GLAZE into the backstretch run and set a pressured pace to
the half-mile pole, contested the pace with that rival into the far turn and shook free into upper stretch, responded to urging and drew to a clear lead at the
sixteenth-marker, doggedly lead into deep stretch, felt pressure from TIZ MY PRINCESS and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while gamely
besting the rest. DOWNBURST broke a bit awkwardly and was away a step slowly leaving the start, was unhurried through the early stages and was guided
outside of runners heading into the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, could not impact the top pair in the final sixteenth but closed well late, won the
nod for third on the wire, lost action while pulling up and was vanned off. BOURBON GLAZE asked for early speed, was forwardly placed away from the
start and stalked the pace along the first turn, advanced position into the backstretch run and prompted the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, disputed
the pace with PACIFIC ZIP into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, lost ground to PACIFIC ZIP into the stretch and chased to the furlong
marker, lacked the needed response in the final sixteenth, was outfinished and was just edged for third at the wire. VILLA NOVA prominent leaving the start,
tracked the early pace between runners into the first turn, tracked the leading pair through the backstretch run and maintained a two wide path into the
second turn, chased between rivals to the quarter pole, maintained a two wide path into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, did not offer a
final response and finished evenly in deep stretch. HONORABLE GAL broke out a step at the start, settled three wide into the first turn while not far back,
tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run while outside of runners, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
could not sustain her bid into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch.

Footnotes
RALLY CAT hustled to the lead, dueled through the turn with GOLD RUSH CANDY to the outside, opened up on the field turning for home and responded
to steady handling to win clear. SCHOCHOH broke sharply and was briefly involved in the contest for the early lead, backed off to a stalking position and let
the the two in front battle it out, responded when set down at the three-sixteenths pole, chased the winner to the wire and won the race for second. MR.
CLUTCH broke with the early leaders then dropped back when unable to keep up with the early pace, was prompted to stay close up, came three wide into
the stretch while already under urging, battled with SCHOCHOH down the lane for the second spot, was unable to overtake that foe but finished well clear of
the next horse. R M C HOOK'EM veered inward and made some light contact with FRANKS FIX IT, came under a ride from the outset, took a furlong to get
into a good rhythm, made some forward progress through the turn while racing three wide, checked briefly at the top of the stretch, moved out a path into
the clear and finished evenly while never a serious threat. EMERALD MAGIC bobbled at the break then bumped by FRANKS FIX IT, dropped well behind in
the early going, made a bit of a rally into the turn, carried that momentum into the stretched and passed a couple late. FRANKS FIX IT was slow to get into
stride then rushed up to join the tracking group on the turn, checked just past the seven-sixteenths pole when MR. CLUTCH came over heading into the
turn, struggled to regain momentum for the stretch run and was well beaten. GOLD RUSH CANDY broke in sharply but managed to avoid contact and
quickly corrected and pressed the early pace outside of RALLY CAT, gave way before the quarter pole then had nothing left for the stretch run.

quarter marker, maintained that four wide path into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth, took a
narrow lead in deep stretch and determinedly held in a drive to prevail. KEEP MOVIN' ON came in tight soon after the start, steadied off of heels and was
shuffled back approaching the first turn, recovered and stalked the early pace two wide and between runners into the backstretch, gained ground heading to
the half-mile marker and was guided three wide into the far turn, vied for the lead three wide at the quarter pole and battled into the stretch, met the bid of J.
B. BOOKS heading to the sixteenth-pole, fought gamely to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest for second. OLD
TRIANGLE showed early speed and vied for the lead two wide into the first turn, assumed a narrow lead and set a pressured pace into the backstretch run,
contested moderate fractions with CLASSY CITY heading into the far turn and dueled with that rival into upper stretch, took command approaching the
furlong pole and led heading to the sixteenth marker, was overtaken into deep stretch and held well in the end for third. DIAMOND CONCERTO fractious
prior to the start, broke out leaving the gate and bumped DRUM BUNNY, was unhurried into the first turn and raced two then three wide into the
backstretch, advanced position while outside of runners at the half-mile pole, was guided two wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the drive and ran
evenly to mid-stretch, offered a mild late rally and missed for third in the final strides. IT AINT OVER forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the pace
while saving ground into the first turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the far turn, gave chase to the
quarter pole and re-bid into upper stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final sixteenth and was outkicked. CLASSY CITY prominent leaving
the start, vied for the early lead three wide into the first turn, contested the pace into the backstretch run and disputed moderate fractions to the half-mile
marker, took a narrow lead along the far turn then lost the lead to OLD TRIANGLE and battled that rival into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final

command at the five furlong marker, set contested fractions while well rated to the half-mile pole, carved out moderate fractions into the far turn and was
roused nearing the top of the stretch, shook free from UPSTART YANKEE and was set down at the furlong pole, kept to task into the final sixteenth and
drew clear in the late stages to prevail. UPSTART YANKEE broke alertly and assumed command leaving the start, showed the way into the first turn then
ceded the lead to CHIPPEWA BUD entering the backstretch run, attended to the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, pressed CHIPPEWA BUD
while inside of that rival along the far turn, lost ground into upper stretch and chased CHIPPEWA BUD to the furlong marker, could not make headway on

wide into the first turn, shifted three wide into the backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace while widest heading to the half-mile marker, raced three
wide into the second turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, chased three wide into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, could not
impact the top pair in the final sixteenth and was clear of the rest for third at the finish. MOVIETIME squeezed at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to
settle into the first turn while not far back and maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, was well positioned heading to the half-mile pole and was
steered three wide into the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch. TALISKER BAY

and between runners along the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive and was outrun to mid-stretch, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and tired. HOT

Footnotes
O'BANION (IRE) got away well, was allowed to settle and raced outside in the third pair tracking well behind the leading pair, maintained position through
the turn while saving ground, got a huge hole to run through into the stretch, squeezed through a tight spot along the rail near the eighth pole and surged
ahead under intermittent urging to win. ALMOST SNOW broke sharply at the break then veered outward into the path of WEE BEASTIE, sped away to an
uncontested lead, held sway though the turn, drifted out a little turning into the stretch with a clear lead, ran on well under handling, was passed late to the
inside by the winner but was still clear of the third horse. MY BUCKET LIST was bumped hard by GOOD FOCUS right after the break then pinballed a few
strides later between that foe and COLLECT DIS MONEY, ended up near the rear of the field after recovering, rallied three wide though the turn, responded
to strong handling in the stretch and was along to grab third. RUTHERFORD raced inside of the pair tracking the early leaders, started to run on from the
three furlong marker, came into the stretch in the two path, battled between horses to deep stretch and was outfinished. KEEN HEIR raced outside of
RUTHERFORD tracking behind the leading pair, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, tipped out three wide for the stretch run, had some trouble
changing leads, lost some ground then found best stride a little too late. COLLECT DIS MONEY broke out at the start narrowly missed making contact with
O'BANION (IRE) still came away well then chased ALMOST SNOW through the first half-mile, made a bid for the lead three wide near the quarter pole but
was rebuffed, kept on to mid-stretch then weakened in the last furlong. GOOD FOCUS lunged outward at the start and made solid contact with MY BUCKET
LIST, then met again a few strides out, steadied, then was a bit hard to place while pulling the rider into the turn, steadied again near the seven-sixteenths
pole, lost some momentum and could not make up any ground from that point. WEE BEASTIE had to steady slightly when ALMOST SNOW took the path
after the start, was outrun early, made a little forward progress down the backstretch, then struggled to keep pace through the turn, lost ground and finished
well beaten.

Footnotes
KRISTIN LEE easily seized the lead from the start, was allowed to dictated the early pace, set comfortable fractions, responded when roused at the head of
the stretch and drew off. DEFICIT MAJA got squeezed with contact from both sides after the break, settled mid-pack towards the inside for the early
running, went two to three wide through the stretch then angled out to the four path for the stretch run, responded to strong handling and produced a good
late run to gain the place. SUPER ELLIE came away last and raced at the rear of the compact field to the turn, was set down approaching the quarter pole,
steered to the outside then drifted extremely wide turning for home, was kept to task and closed fast to gain third. BOURBON TIGER was forced wide by
OUTER SUNSET after the break, launched a four wide bid around the turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but was unable to match strides with the
winner and was passed late for a minor award. OUTER SUNSET veered out after the break and forced BOURBON TIGER out to avoid contact, raced close
up down the backstretch three wide, bid between horses turning into the stretch but weakened before the furlong marker. PRINCESS BELLE broke outward
after the break and put DEFICIT MAJA in a tight spot, raced into contention and tracked the pacesetter while holding the rail, came under a ride from the
five-sixteenths and was unable to quicken. DESERT RUMBLE broke in at the start and traded a couple of bumps with DEFICIT MAJA, was pulling hard and
was hard to place down the backstretch, was let loose with three furlongs to run, but had nothing to offer in the stretch and was unable to improve position.

Footnotes
HANKS never far back in the early running, tracked the pace three then four wide along the first turn, took back along the backstretch run and tracked the
solid pace to the half-mile pole, loomed four wide into the far turn, raced five wide into the stretch chased HYDRO FROST to the furlong marker, rallied and
vied for the lead into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. INCREDIBLE SHOT allowed to
settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was unhurried through the backstretch run, chased into the far turn and came four wide to the
quarter pole, swung to the six path into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner
in the late stages but could not reel that one in and outfinished HYDRO FROST to secure place honors. HYDRO FROST prominent leaving the break,
stalked the pace along the first turn while on a hold, pulled on the rider into the backstretch run and assumed command heading to the five furlong marker,
set a solid pace to the half-mile pole and was pressured into the far turn by NO SECRET, shook free of that rival, drifted out into upper stretch and extended
the lead at the furlong marker, held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, was overtaken by HANKS in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just
holding for third at the wire. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF unhurried away from the start, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run and was content to
trail to the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the far turn, shifted to the two path into upper stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, raced in traffic while
sustaining his bid into the final sixteenth, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for third at the wire. O B'S settled off of the early pace, raced three
wide into the backstretch run and tracked the solid pace to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter pole,
continued that bid into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, could not muster a final response in deep stretch and was outkicked. J D'S
RUDE BOY allowed to settle, raced two wide along the first turn and was unhurried through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the second turn and
improved position heading to the quarter pole, swung to the five path into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, showed good late interest but
was unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch. NO SECRET hustled leaving the break, was prominent in the early stages and assumed command into
the first turn, set the pace into the backstretch run then lost the lead to HYDRO FROST heading to the five furlong marker, stalked the solid pace to the
half-mile pole and pressed HYDRO FROST to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, lacked a response in the final
sixteenth and weakened. AMERICAN EMPIRE rated off of the early pace, tracked from the second flight and saved ground into the backstretch run, was
unhurried approaching the half-mile marker, gained ground into the second turn and chased to the quarter pole, tipped three wide for the drive and
continued his bid at mid-stretch, ran into traffic entering the final sixteenth and finished evenly. CONFUCIUS settled while not far back in the early stages,
tracked the pace two wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside and was well placed heading to the half-mile pole, gained ground into the second
turn and chased to the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and weakened in the final sixteenth.
NASHVILLE SKYLINE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and rated into the first turn, stalked the pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run,
tracked the leading pair while between rivals heading to the half-mile pole and loomed three then four wide along the far turn, chased between runners into
the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way.
