Footnotes
CACCIATORE prompted the pace in the five path, took command from the four path while being coaxed early into the turn, angled into the two path entering
the stretch, and kicked clear under a drive. MAIN LINE CIPHER stalked in the six path, was cued in the five path passing the three-eighths, urged from the
four path into the stretch, and held onto place. BLACK FURY brushed with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the three path, surrendered the lead and
was put to ride along the rail early around the turn, faded on his left lead in the stretch, but held show. THIS DUDE A BREEZE raced off the pace along the
rail, was under right handed urging in the two path rounding the turn, but failed to bid from the four path in the stretch. TOP MAVERICK tracked in the two
path, angled out to the five path turning into the stretch, but weakened. DECISIVE PRIDE brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the four
path and never menaced.

Footnotes
KRABI set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe. BULLET VALENTINA raced off the pace three and four wide and was gaining
rapidly late. TRIBUTE prompted the winner two wide, was no match for that foe in upper stretch but held well enough for the show. NUMERIC tracked the
pace three wide and faded in the lane. VACATION SUITE failed to menace while racing two wide. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) was outrun inside. FUNTASTICA
trailed inside.

Footnotes
SKINNY COSMO pulled around the first turn to set an open pace in the two path down the backstretch, drifted way out to the center against right handed
cues to lose the lead in upper stretch, angled back into the seven path passing the eighth pole, and stayed on to get back up in the final sixteenth. CITRUS
BELLE broke out at the start, stalked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, ran on to take the lead while in the three path passing the eighth pole, but
was caught late by an outer foe to place. PRIVACY SETTING (FR) hopped at the start, rated in the two path, was roused along the rail into the far turn,
floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. BONMATI was prompted along in the three path, cued midway around the far turn,
bid from the four path in upper stretch, but evened out between foes late. BUTTERFLY QUEEN broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced off the pace
inside, was coaxed along the rail around the far turn, and finished evenly from the two path in the stretch. SHEILA'S MISSION was out in the five path
around the first turn, raced wellback in the two path, was roused passing the quarter, tipped outward passing the eighth pole, but made no impact. CORRIN
PEAK bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was held up in the three path early but did not factor. VANISHING WISH was out in the six path around
the first turn, chased in the four path down the backstretch, but never threatened. MISS TARISANSOL bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed along
the inside around the first turn, tipped out to the five path midway down the backstretch, but never menaced. HALEY'S HAPPY GIRL got bumped by an
inner foe into an outer foe at the start, was out in the five path around the first turn, tracked in the three path down the backside, but was empty entering the
stretch.

Footnotes
JERRY'S TURN had to check going into the first turn, tracked the pace in the three path turning into the backstretch, was cued from the two path into the far
turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, rallied while tipping inwards passing the eighth pole, bumped an inner foe late, but was up in the final
strides. MISTER ABARRIO bumped with an outer foe at the start, then bumped another outer foe while racing in the four path early around the first turn, laid
up close from there down the backside, bid in the three path around the far turn, ran on but appeared to be hanging passing the eighth pole, got bumped by
the late closing outer winner inside the final sixteenth, and outlasted the inner pacesetter to place. HIGH STAKES bumped with an inner foe at the start, set
the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn, dug in from just off the rail into the stretch, but faded late to show. GENERAL'S DUTY
chased inside, was coaxed from the rail midway around the far turn, tipped out to the two path passing the eighth pole, and was staying on, but got blocked
and had to check late. JEBY bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two path, swung from the four path turning into the lane, but made no
impact. THE MAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, then got carried out to the five path early into the first turn, rated in the four path, was cued from the
three path into the far turn, but never threatened. GOOD RAPPORT bumped between foes at the start, then got bumped by an inner foe out to the five path
and steadied around the first turn, stalked from the five path down the backstretch, but weakened in the four path turning into the lane.
