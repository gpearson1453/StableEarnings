ANTARES showed no speed to turn, rallied in earnest through the stretch to be up in time under stout handling to the wire. GRAPHIC DETAIL tracked three
wide to quarter pole, rallied clear, run down late. COUNTERSTRIKE battled to quarter pole took over, cleared, weakened stretch rail. MY BUDDY B good
position to turn, shuffled into stretch, came back late. NIFTY raced along evenly with no late response in the stretch run. LA BELLEZA NEGRA inside duel to
turn, gave way into the stretch run. LONG LANCE raced between horses to the turn, nothing left for stretch run. GOOD ON YA quick start outside, could not
go on and faded back readily.

Footnotes
MUSICAL NOTE no speed to far turn, rallied in earnest, along in time, clear. HEAVENLY DREAM good position to far turn, three wide run, cleared late, no
match. MIDNIGHT ANGEL three wide speed, clear at the half to far turn, empty in stretch. ICE WATER had no speed and only improved position in the
stretch run. EVOCATION outside trip throughout and moved up in the late stretch area. CHIQUITA REINA tried to keep up for a half, gave in readily
thereafter. TROUBLE WITH SUGAR could not keep up and gave in readily. YAMMY YAMMY BELLA inside between horses to far turn, gave way readily
stretch run. BRIGHT LADY DAY good speed to the half with nothing left from that point, faded. CATALINA NINA good position early on while on empty from
far turn into stretch.
