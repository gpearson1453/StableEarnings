Footnotes
MEMES moved up steadily the opening quarter to join the first flight, vied between foes into the turn, shook off the other speed entering the stretch,
maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. SHADY DAREDEVIL raced in mid pack while well out in the strip, four wide through
the turn, advanced to chase the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, clear for the place. MY BROTHER MIKE void of early foot
toward the inside, angled out five to six wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, continued to show interest down the lane to be clear of the others.
BOURBON ON FIRE back off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, improved position a bit while not posing a serious threat. SECRET HONOR
washy, moved up inside the winner to contest the issue by midway up the backstretch, raced on equal terms with that rival and another foe through the turn,
weakened into the stretch. CADILLAC COWBOY broke on top, set or forced the pace for a half while four wide, also faltered in the drive. NACHO CHROME
unprepared at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained back while steered out six wide exiting the turn, picked off a few tiring rivals after the
issue had been decided. LIGHT HORSE HARRY forwardly placed early while three wide, dropped to the inside turn, tired in the drive. DALTON'S RUTROW
in the main group while well wide in the run up the backstretch, five path through the turn, faded through the lane. MOTOWN COLLECTION made little
impact while racing three to four wide through the turn. MORE MONEY MO saved ground to no avail. DANCIN ROCKET backed up while racing off the
inside.

Footnotes
COLOSI off a bit slow, raced back for six furlongs, swung out four wide exiting the turn when beginning to rally, challenged past the furlong marker, gained
the advantage, proved narrowly best in the late going to prevail in game fashion. HOME VISIT broke on top, dueled through the first turn closest to but not
on the inside, continued to alternate up front the middle half mile, remained the advantage approaching the furlong marker while getting out a bit, proved
stubborn to the end. CITY LEGEND behind the early pace while saving ground through the first turn, continued inside through the second bend, moved out
for room past the furlong marker, finished willingly to be slowly getting to the top pair late. BEAVER HAT chased the dueling leaders out in the strip,
continued to pursue that pair in the three path second turn, crept a bit closer from between horses inside the furlong marker, in traffic a sixteenth out,
finished up evenly when clear late. MOTOWN MUSIC raced in mid pack off the rail, floated out five wide by the advancing winner turning for home, lacked a
closing kick. BIZZY LEGS moved up to duel outside the runner up three wide through the first turn, continued to duel up the backstretch, first to blink when
entering the stretch. MAKE NOISE off a bit slow, trailed most of the way in never threatening. GET BACK GOLDIE off a step slow, stopped after a half to
finish well back.

RUNNINGFORCASH broke on top, showed the way along the inside, shook clear far turn, drew off through the lane, won geared down to be ridden out.
LEGENDARY LORE settled in the second flight between foes, chased the winner into and through the stretch, proved no match for that one, held sway for
the place. HUMOR ME NOW unruly prior to the start, off a step slow, raced back, closer before a half off the inside, continued with mild interest to prove
best of the rest. FETCHS BRAHM in the second group inside, went flat through the stretch to finish up evenly. HOWL YEAH lacked speed early toward the
inside, angled out four wide late in the final turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. UNSTABLE PRINCE in the second flight outside, four
wide through much of the final turn, lacked a closing punch through the stretch. LEVY off a step slow, void of speed four six furlongs, bettered position
through the lane while never a serious threat. ASSUMPTION fell back to trail before a quarter, continued to lag the middle half,improved inside of several
rivals into the lane then flattened out a bit late. TRAFFIC BOSS off a bit slow, never a threat while racing outside. VINCENZINO in mid pack while racing
four wide through much of the first turn, tired from those early efforts. COMMANDER REX was finished after a half. HEIR TO GREATNESS pressed the
winner for five furlongs off the inside, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
BLUE SQUALL lurked behind the leaders while widest of the second flight, closer three wide late in the turn, lost some ground to the winner into the stretch,
got to that one from the outside late, put a head in front and was edging away at the end. LEMON MUFFIN balked at loading, pressed early from the
outside, dueled turn in the two path, shook off that foe into the lane to be clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, clearly second best.
HURRICANE FIRE away in good order from along the inside, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, dueled inside the runner up through the bend,
could not match the top pair through the lane, saved the show. GENEROUS LOVER in the second flight just off the inside into the turn, continued to pursue
through the bend, came up empty for the stretch run. QUEEN CLANCY went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. FEELIN MY OATS broke
on top, quickly fell back and failed to menace. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS off a step slow, raced back, four wide into the stretch, remained back to be always
outrun.

Footnotes
BALL GOWN outrun in the early going along the inside, in some traffic along the rail early turn, steered out four wide exiting the turn, moved out wider still
when straightened for home, finished with good resolve to be up in time. CHASING SHADOWS off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, swung five
wide into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip to be up for the place. MIA BABY forwardly placed along the inside, asked along late turn, challenged
along the rail turning for home, shook well clear past the furlong marker, failed to contain the top pair, remained comfortably clear of the others. TAKING
CHARGE DESI in the second group early while outside, moved closer to lodge a brief bid four wide turning for home, fell back off the leader past the furlong
marker then when flat to the wire. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO off a step slow, raced back, improved position with some mild, belated interest. CHAPARRITA in
mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked a closing kick. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS rank off slow, trailed well back, saved ground into the lane, picked off
some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SCARLET POSITION with the same group outside, four wide through most of the turn, lacked a closing
kick. AWESOME VIEW lacked speed, between horses through the turn, failed to rally when clear for the drive. KOALA prompted the pace for a half from the
outside, backed up through the stretch. DERBY DAY LASSIE broke sharp, soon clear, set the pace toward the inside, gave way when headed in upper
stretch. SPOILED ROTTEN was finished after a half while racing along the inside.

Footnotes
HIT SCENE moved up to take control just after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, dueled into the lane closest to the inside, turned that foe away
late to be edging clear at the ened. HAULIN ICE pressed the winner from the outside in the run up the backstretch, dueled outside that one into the lane,
could not match strides with that same foe late, held sway for the second spot. GOD'S COUNTRY in mid pack early off the inside, dropped to the rail by late
in the turn, roused for the drive, getting to the runner up late. BURLSWORTH pushed in break, within striking distance early toward the inside, moved three
wide late in the turn when creeping closer, lacked a closing punch. ALL GREEN LIGHTS in tight to be off slow, lacked speed inside, improved slightly while
not a serious threat. MACHO STRIKER reluctant to load, within striking distance early outside, four wide into the lane, had little left. EMPYREAL SHADOW
broke out, bumped, four wide through the turn, displayed some mild interest to improve position a bit. IT'S A RAINY DAY went one paced throughout while
racing toward the inside. DEVILS FORK broke in, waited along the rail into the turn inside, stalled, came up empty when clear for the drive. RYNO
WRECKER sandwiched at the break, raced back and outside, tired while four wide out of the turn. YEAGERS STRATEGY remained back just off the inside.
BIG ANDY MORT broke in, bumped, through early, far back.

Footnotes
STELLAR TAP in mid pack early while between foes, continued in the main body far turn, waited behind traffic late in the turn, steered out three wide into
the lane, outside bid past the furlong marker, drew well clear under steady handling. INVARIABLY also behind the early leaders, advanced and challenged
along the rail into the stretch, held a narrow advantage inside the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match in the run to the wire. MUST BE LOVE
forwardly placed just off the inside, chased the leader through the turn, weakened a bit in the drive, narrowly managed to hold the show spot. CARTEL
QUEEN in the second flight while racing outside, continued four wide through the turn, lacked a serious closing response through the stretch. CHELSEA
DAGGER void of speed, moved slightly closer in some traffic late in the turn, improved a bit more when clear for the drive. RACKATAPTAP fell back to trail,
continued to lack speed into the turn, improved inside of several foes into the lane, not a serious threat. MISTER SHARPIE broke alertly, showed the way up
the backstretch in the two path, allowed the runner up the inside late in the turn, began to weaken when headed by that one soon after. ROMAN GIANT
forwardly placed early, took up a furlong in, fell back through the turn then went evenly through the lane. GALACTIC EMPIRE off a step slow, moved up to
race in the second flight well wide, five path through the turn, faded down the lane. HALLOW POINT failed to menace while three to four wide. WARHORSE
WEST three to four wide, tired in the drive. MO CHOCTAW pressed the issue early three wide, stopped abruptly turn, distanced after losing contact with the
field, jogged in.

away slowly, lacked speed off the inside, came four wide for the drive, staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top three. SHE'S NOT A JOKE went one
paced while three wide through the turn. SAFECRACKER SUE lacked speed, came three wide for the drive, came up empty for the stretch run. NO PAY

Footnotes
HAPPY IS A CHOICE behind the first flight toward the inside, moved out slightly to be in the two path into the turn, continued under patient handling through
the bend, split foes when nearing the furlong grounds, bid soon after, edged clear under steady handling. MEDIA MOGUL devoid of any early speed, moved
out four wide by late in the turn, rallied and finished willingly to be clear for the place. BOURBON BASH in the second flight while between foes, raced in
traffic through the bend, came three wide for the drive, proved determined for the show, out enough for the top two. DISTORTED PRO vied up front while
between horses, gradually weakened. WICKED AGAIN in the second flight outside, four wide through the turn, went flat through the lane. B MINOR
forwardly placed early along the inside, in slightly tight into the turn, weakened in the drive. HALMSTAD vied up front while racing three wide into the turn,
gave way in the drive. AFLEET SKY was finished while racing four wide.

Footnotes
NOTARY tracked the pace along the inside, advanced and challenged the leader along the inside, moved out a bit while kicking well clear.
ESCAPOLOGIST back off the pace inside, continued to save ground while improving inside of traffic into the lane, slowly getting to the runner up late. U. S.
ARMY broke alertly, showed the way in the two path through the first turn, continued to set the pace off the inside, allowed the winner the inside second
turn, offered little resistance to that one, chased that same rival past the furlong marker, lost the place late. TRIDENT HIT in mid pack while off the inside,
continued in the two path through the second bend, not enough late for the second spot. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT off a step slow, raced back after dropping
to the inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, improved position while not a serious threat. ALEJANDRO lacked speed while off the
inside, improved position off the inside. UNINVITED GUEST went one paced three wide in lacking a closing response. WINNEMAC AVENUE forwardly
placed while racing two off the rail, had little for the drive. ARDANWOOD four wide when off the pace and through both turns, tired in the drive. ARMAGNAC
was finished early while racing off the inside.
