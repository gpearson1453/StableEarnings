Footnotes
CARLOS PUNCH set the pace, dictated terms in hand via a clear margin around the turn, then held sway while hanging on his left lead under a drive.
MISTER MULDOON leaned into the hind quarters of an outer rival at the start, tracked in the four path, sustained slow grinding progress in pursuit of the
clear leader through the final furlong but needed more to offer a bid. MAGIC MONDAY took bumps to his hind quarters from rivals on either side at the start,
stalked along the inside, smoothly took aim outside of the clear leader turning for home, but lacked a bid and faded. CHARLIE'S CREED lacked early speed
along the inside despite constant urging from the rider, chased two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch
and ran on willingly. RAMMER JAMMER chased along the inside but weakened entering the turn. COME ON COME ON took contact from an inner rival at
the start, lacked speed three wide, entered the lane four wide and made little impact. POINT AT YOU was off awkwardly and bumped an inner rival at the
start, stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. CHILI RED broke a beat slow before
being brushed by an inner rival into crowded quarters between horses at the start, then was outrun four wide. VORTEX broke outwardly and brushed a rival
at the start, dropped back soon after, lagged behind and showed little.

Footnotes
TWN MS MIDSHIP tracked in the four path, offered a grinding charge to bid in the final furlong, inched clear in the final sixteenth and held from an outer
gaining pair. WHAT CAN I SAY settled off of the pace in the two path, drifted to the five to six path in upper stretch, rallied with a late kick in the final furlong
and reached place in the shadow of the wire. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS lacked speed along the inside, picked up stride shifting to the five path and between
horses entering the final furlong, rallied along with an outer rival to bid for place in the closing stages but missed. LOYAL TO THE CHIEF dueled for the lead
inside of a rival, led in the two path in upper stretch, hung on his left lead and drifted out slightly at the furlong grounds, then yielded late. CRYPTO BRAVE
bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked from the two path, attempted a bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, but lacked a punch thereafter. HOT
PATOOTIE took contact from an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride in the two path in upper stretch, but paused
behind traffic committing to an inside charge leaving the furlong grounds and lacked a kick while tentatively slipping through a late rail seam. MACEE
bumped with an inner rival at the start before brushing an outer foe in the aftermath, dueled for the lead two wide, but failed to sustain even terms drifted to
the three to four path in upper stretch and weakened between horses in the final furlong. MYDEALOFTHEDAY broke slowly, lacked speed in the three path,
got floated to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. WHY WAIT chased in the three path as the closest pursuer to the embattled leading pair,
then weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MAU MAU stalked two wide, ranged up to press three wide around the far turn, took aim in the five path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch,
changed over to offer a bid at the furlong grounds, sparred while drifting outwardly in the late stages yet prevailed. FREEDOM FACTOR set the pace inside
of a vying foe, led around the far turn, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, leaned out while meeting MAU MAU's challenge in midstretch, flopped leads
in the process, dueled with that one through the late stages but gave in late. TWOKO BAY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned to the six path
into upper stretch, ran on while getting herded by the drifting eventual winner in the final furlong and reached show at the wire. OPTIMUS KAT toss his head
while rank at the start causing his rider to lose his irons, regained them shortly after before moving forward to track along the inside into the first turn,
pursued two wide around the far turn, chased between horses aiming inside of the leaders through midstretch, edged show entering the final sixteenth but
was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. MALTHAEL settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and stayed on
between horses. HALEYS SAILOR saved ground off of the pace, shifted out in midstretch and ran on mildly between horses. MEN OF KYLE stalked along
the inside, chased around the far turn then lacked a rail kick. LITTLE G T vied two wide, pressed along with an outer rival around the far turn, yielded in
upper stretch, then caved in hand between horses entering the final sixteenth. SILENT POWER never got involved two wide. DEVAMANI (FR) trailed along
the inside, then in the three path around the far turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
DREWMAZING dueled inside of a pair of foes around the turn, shifted off the inner rail entering the lane, inched clear at the furlong grounds as an outer F T
W SLAM took aim, met that one's bid at the sixteenth pole, drifted out and bumped that one in the shadow of the wire and held. F T W SLAM tracked four
wide, sustained grinding progress to bid at the sixteenth pole, vied late but was bumped by his inner counterpart nearing the wire and missed. REVERENT
chased along the inside, vacated the rail turning for home before shifting back to it in upper stretch, and ran on to edge show from an outer rival in the final
sixteenth. ORDER UP dueled for the lead two wide, then between horses around the turn, but hung on his left lead and gave way between the top pair
passing the furlong grounds. HOOSIER trailed in the two path, shifted out in upper stretch and moved up between horses. SKIPPA stalked three wide, bid
into the turn, sparred around the bend, but weakened in upper stretch. OLDER AND WISER laid off of the pace in the three to five path and faded. THE
RIDER OF F T W SLAM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DREWMAZING FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. FOLLOWING THE
OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE SAME INFRACTION, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

in upper stretch and lost place to an inner foe in the final furlong. ROCKSTAR RED tracked in the four to five path and lacked a bid. SAGITTARIUS tracked
in the three path and between horses, chased in the four path around the far turn then tired. REASON TO DREAM made little impact from the three path.

Footnotes
HOODLUM stalked along the inside, bid two wide turning for home and drew off under a drive. MY BARILEY saved ground off of the pace, then ran on
between horses to edge place in the final furlong. YES POINT tracked in the two path, chased in the three path around the far turn, bid for place along with
an inner rival while hanging on his left lead at the furlong grounds but got outkicked. BONUS APPRECIATION laid off of the pace in the three to four path
and moved up. AND FIFTY set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, proved no match entering the lane and weakened.
KENTUCKY PEERLESS stalked two wide but faded between horses around the far turn. KEYS INCLUDED lagged behind and was outrun. ZAICI was
fractious in the starting gate, raced off of the pace in the four path, took closer order down the backstretch, but lacked a response to urging around the far
turn and weakened.

Footnotes
A G'S CHARLOTTE tracked in the two path early on, loomed a danger ranging up outside of the top pair and in the five path around the far turn, bid in hand
with a quarter mile to go, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch and held from her inner game counterpart. SPEEDY DUDETTE set the pace in the two to
three path while feeling outer pressure, met the eventual winner's challenge turning for home, got headed in upper stretch, fought on doggedly through the
lane but failed to regain even terms. FORT POLK laid off of the pace in the three path, launched a rally between horses turning for home and ran on.
WHOLELOTTAMO was antsy in the starting gate then broke slow, lacked speed in the four path tipped to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on. FOR
HARPER trailed in the three path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane and moved up. SNOWBALL saved ground off of the pace but to no avail.
CHEAPSKATE DIVA stalked the top pair from the four path, pressed down the backstretch, came under urging between horses around the far turn and
faded nearing the lane. EVE'S DELIGHT pressed two wide, then between horses down the backstretch but faded entering the far turn. FOLLOW THE
SAINT tracked along the inside under snug restraint, then was through early. STAR MOMENT pursued from midpack in the five to four path, weakened and
was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LACEY'S STAR broke inwardly, tracked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leading pair to bid turning for home, then drew off through the final
furlong. HOT GOLDEN GIRL dueled for the lead two wide, led before an outer rival challenged nearing the lane, proved no match for that one entering the
final furlong and was well clear of the rest. MIA ANTONIA laid off of the pace in the three path and gained show nearing the furlong grounds. LET'S TALK
DIRTY dueled along the inside and weakened around the far turn. STRUMMIN MARY broke a bit inwardly, lacked speed tucking to the inside around the
first turn and failed to factor. WAKE UP DOLORES broke a step slow and steadied out of tight quarters between horses at the start, then made little impact.
PINCHING PENNIES bobbled and broke a step slow, then was outrun. SAINT MARY stumbled at the start, stalked in the two path and was done early.
