Footnotes
CLASSIC DIVA showed early speed, set the pace under some pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when put to the crop in upper
stretch and held under steady urging. GRACE REFORMED was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into
the stretch and finished willingly for the place. DORTH'S SOL DANCER pressed the pace on the inside, was urged along against the rail on the turn, shifted
three wide behind the leader into the stretch, pursued that foe while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and kept on to just miss the place while well
clear for the show. KAYMUS showed speed between horses then pressed the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
weakened. TAVIN showed speed on the outside then pressed the pace, dropped back in the four path for most of the turn, moved to the two path late on
that bend and had nothing left. PRETTY UP was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. ALLEY'S SONG
showed speed between foes, dropped back in the three path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
ALLIED ATTACK went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when asked for his
best in upper stretch and held under steady urging. IRISH TENOR was urged early then well placed just off the pace, chased two then three wide on the
turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. LAST DRINK showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back along the rail
on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. THIS TIME YES was last away then pinched back between horses, saved ground early
on the turn, moved to the two then three path later on the bend and failed to threaten. SAINT GAUDENS dropped off the pace, went three to four wide on
the turn, bumped with a rival just inside the three-eighths pole, moved out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to rally. PALACE BOSS dropped
towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. SOLO EMPIRE broke out and bumped with a rival, settled
off the pace, tugged hard on the bit while keen along the rail early on the turn, steadied some while continuing to pull hard behind foes, moved to the two
path late on the bend, drifted out near the furlong marker and also lacked the needed response. FRATELLINO bumped with a rival at the start, settled off
the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, bumped with a foe near the three-eighths pole and failed to respond. LI'L LANG tracked the pace on the
outside, was given his cue in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated. JANSSEN was urged along on the outside, went five wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.
