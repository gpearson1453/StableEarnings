Footnotes
MOON OVER DUBAI unhurried early, angled to the rail down the backside, saved ground in the turn under an early drive, cut the corner turning for home
and was up in time along the fence in a well handled ride. LEAVENWORTH pressed the early pace to the turn, moved up the inside to battle on the lead
through the turn, shook off the pacesetter and responded well in the lane in a game effort while unable to hold off the winner. NO MORE GUNS stalked the
leaders into the turn, ranged up three wide with a threatening bid turning for home and failed to get by the top pair. LOTS OF MISCHIEF reserved off the
pace and mounted a mild rally passing weakened rivals. DANGEROUS MIND broke awkwardly to trail the field and was one-paced throughout. MY SONG
BABY set a pressured pace to the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch. F F READY OR NOT was not a threat.

MIDNIGHT VOYAGE stalked the pace to the turn, rallied two wide to engage the leader turning for home, dueled through the lane and prevailed in deep
stretch. GUNNER GABRIEL set a pressured pace throughout from the rail, responded when challenged nearing the quarter pole, battled down the stretch
and was second best when out-finished late in the drive. COUNTEVERYBLESSING tracked the leaders while reserved off the pace and mounted a mild
rally to be best of the rest. SHAKE THE FROST prompted the early pace and weakened on the bend. SEEKING FREEDOM was not a threat. RIVERS OF
DENIRO was not a factor.

Footnotes
INSIDE STUNT broke alertly to take command, set a well rated pace, responded when called upon turning for home and drew off through the lane.
POSEIDON'S SON stalked the pace through the turn, cut the corner coming home, angled out in the lane and could not close ground on the winner.
ROCKSTAR RO tracked the pacesetter to the head of the lane and mounted a mild bid from three wide in the stretch. MALIBU CLASSIC reserved off the
pace to the turn, rallied four wide and failed to sustain the bid in the lane finishing evenly. CRAFTY CONQUEST pressed the pace to the quarter pole and
weakened in the stretch. TRIGZ TOO was not a threat. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK was never a factor.

Footnotes
FRONTLINER saved ground while tracking the leaders from the fence, rallied in upper stretch along the rail, waited for racing room in the lane, tipped out
late in the drive and surged to be up in time in a well managed ride. KADESH settled off the early pace under restraint to stalk the pace, mounted an inside
bid to take the lead at the head of the stretch, opened a clear lead mid-stretch and was caught in the final strides. TIDE RISING unhurried early to trail,
made a steady advance to be gaining down the lane in a bid that came up short. CRIMSON ROCKET pressed the pace in the turn from three wide and
weakened in the stretch run. TWICE AS SMART flashed speed to open an early advantage and tired turning for home. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL failed to
menace lacking a late response.

Footnotes
GRAY ROYALITY stalked the pace early, made an inside bid down the backside, lacked racing room, was taken up to settle off the leader into the turn,
angled out to rally three wide on the bend, engaged the leader in mid-stretch and drew away down the lane. CANDY ISLAND set a pressured pace to the
top of the lane, responded to challengers while drifting out in upper stretch, was no match for winner, kept-on through the lane while racing erratically, and
lugged out significantly impeding rival in deep stretch. R THREE ANGELS pressed the pace through the turn, challenged between rivals in upper stretch,
was outkicked by the top pair in the lane and was caused to alter course through the lane avoiding the erratic CANDY ISLAND. LADY JASPER chased the
leaders throughout failing to gain ground. HAPPY BEE failed to menace while showing some late interest down the stretch. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was
not a factor. THE RIDER OF R THREE ANGELS CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED CANDY ISLAND AND PLACED HER THIRD.

SPENCER'S BOY LUNA unhurried in the early going to be at the back of the field, made a steady advance circling four wide on the final turn, engaged the
pacesetter in mid-stretch and pulled clear down the lane convincingly. GOING IN STYLE well rated while setting the pace, responded when called upon
turning for home, battled in upper stretch and held well while no match for the winner. AGNELLO'S DREAM stalked the pace to the far turn, mounted a three
wide bid on the final bend and failed to sustain the rally. STAR ENTERTAINER reserved off the pace to trail down the backside and passed tiring rivals in
the lane. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL prompted the pace to the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. DEACON DOUGIE was well placed for a half mile
and faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
OAXACA set the pace on a comfortable lead, responded when called upon turning for home to open a clear advantage and finished willingly while
unchallenged down the lane. LINE DANCER stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, failed to gain on the winner and held well through the stretch
to be second best. KEEN CONTENDER unhurried for the first half mile to be near the rear of the field and made a steady belated advance in the lane.
MOBIL CHIC prompted the pace down the backside, made a three wide bid on the final turn and flattened out. CROSSED UP failed to menace. SUSHI Q
was never a threat. IZZY'S MONSTER tracked the leaders to be well placed on the far turn and weakened coming home.
