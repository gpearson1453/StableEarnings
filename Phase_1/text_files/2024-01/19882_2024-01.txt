Footnotes
SINCERITO , caught in tight quarters after a slow start, steadied along the inner rail when lacking room near the three eighths pole, remained along the rail
to upper stretch, angled out approaching the eighth pole, closed determinedly and was up late. BUCKIN' DREAMER , sped to the early lead, set the pace
along the inner rail, opened up in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. SUPER NEEDY prompted the pace outside BUCKING' DREAMER and weakened
in the drive. ESTIMATOR ZIGGY lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and had a slight rally. ASPENDOS , in hand between horses entering
the turn, angled to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MANTUA MAN , inside horses chasing the pace around the turn, moved to the three
path in upper stretch and gave way. THE ICE MAN CARLOS bore in on the winner leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in the three path around the
turn and gave way. IMAGINIZED , four deep on the turn, floated out turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
LADY SERENITY took over soon after the break, set a rated pace towards the rail while handling some outside pressure, was guided three wide while
edging away a bit soon into the lane, kept on under a drive and held firm through the final furlong. BRZINA , brushed at the break, gained a forward spot
towards the inside early on, eased out a bit into the lane, shifted back in past the three sixteenths and continued on willingly to be second best. SPEAK
YOUR MIND brushed with BRZINA at the break, prompted the pace two to three wide outside the winner, shifted four wide with pursuit in upper stretch and
kept trying to the wire. BREEZY CONNECTION , off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, edged up past mid stretch, eased out and
churned on. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH , three wide early stalking outside foes, shifted six to seven wide in upper stretch but came up empty. PROPER ATTIRE
, within range between runners into the turn, angled out in upper stretch and faded. ICE CUBE BABY broke a step slow, was hustled up outside rivals, lost
ground four wide mid turn and gave way. BELLA PRIMA failed to keep pace.

STARTSWITHADREAM bore in leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, opened up in mid stretch and lasted under
steady handling. PETINGAS TWIN , in the two path between horses on the turn, eased outside for the drive and rallied. CELTIC CONTENDER bore in
leaving the starting gate, steadied lacking room along the rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail and flattened out. MR. MCMAHON , forced in
after a slow start, worked between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, raced on his left lead and passed tired foes. DAVYJONZ
prompted the pace outside the winner around the turn and weakened through the stetch. DIVINE CHILD hugged the inner rail around the turn and was no
factor. DATS MY PHARAOH chased the early pace while in the three path and gave way on the turn. TASKER , fractious in the starting gate, chased the
early pace four deep and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
PRODIGY DOLL , three wide between runners soon after the break, steadied leaving the five eighths, regrouped and pulled her way forward three wide into
the turn, prompted the pace outside FUHGEDDABOUDIT around the turn, drew alongside past the five sixteenths, responded when asked and took control
leaving the three sixteenths, eagerly kicked away and was kept alert to the wire. TAPPIN JOSIE , in tight between runners near the five furlong marker,
chased three wide between rivals around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and finished up with good energy to gain the place. FUHGEDDABOUDIT ,
four deep vying early, drafted in a few paths when taking over past the five eighths, spurted clear and set the pace two wide past the three furlong marker,
battled to the inside of the winner from the quarter pole to about mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was nipped for the place. HASHTAG LUCKY ,
brushed at the break, came out a bit soon after then corrected, forced the issue to the inside of a rival to the half, chased inside a trio of foes mid turn and
faded. SWEET GRACIE , brushed at the start, was caught two wide between rivals mid turn, angled out for the drive, lacked a punch and gave way late.
ANONYMOUSLY , brushed and in tight at the break, dropped back to last then angled and lost ground four deep around the turn, failed to drum up a kick
while still very wide into the lane and faded.

throughout and was no factor. WHISKEYINTHEJARO raced in the four path on the turn and was no factor. MISTER AGENT raced inside horses on the turn
and was not a factor. LITTLE LANCE worked between horses and faded. BIGDADDYSBOY , four deep on the turn, faltered.

asking, responded when called upon in upper stretch then maintained a comfortable margin while kept alert. IT'S VIPER , well back while saving ground,
eased out to go up between rivals leaving the far turn, swung five wide nearing the lane, straightened away and churned on willingly to be second best.

VIPER in upper stretch then flattened out late. BERKS , away alertly, stalked three wide, was under pressure remaining the closest pursuer mid way on the
final turn, shifted in through the drive and weakened. SHACKLED LOVE , four wide the first turn, raced three deep leaving the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BAY STREET , clear mid way down the backstretch, moved towards the inside leaving the backstretch, was well off the rail in the drive and held sway under
urging. WESTERN LANE , checked lacking room along the inner rail entering the turn, was caught behind horses turning for home, angled to the four path
in mid stretch and closed nicely. GILDA'S GIRL raced in the two path on the turn, advanced into the stretch and flattened out near the inner rail. ROWSIE
EXPRESS stumbled leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and flattened out in the drive. NINJA ABARRIO lacked speed, was in the two path
on the turn, raced near the inner rail in the stretch, altered course outside GILDA'S GIRL near the eighth pole and lacked the necessary rally. THE
HAUNTED ROOM , three deep chasing the pace o the turn, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and weakened. CHICKEN PARM , a forward factor
along the inner rail down the backstretch, faltered on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
MALIBU MOONSHINE lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in upper stretch, was caught behind a wall of horses in mid stretch,
altered course to the five path inside the eighth pole, closed resolutely and was up near the finish. NORTHERN GLOW , in the two path chasing the pace
around the turn, moved to the three path in mid stretch, bid for the lead between foes in deep stretch and just missed. ROYAL WHISPER went clear leaving
the backstretch, was kept in the two path around the turn and through the stretch and gave way grudgingly. I'M GITTIN THERE , a forward factor along the
inner rail, loomed in upper stretch and flattened out. BELLA BETTINA , nicely rated along the inner rail stalking the pace for five furlongs, eased out to the
three path at the head of the stretch, bid for the lead outside horses near the eighth pole and hung. CIRCLE HOME trailed to mid turn, swung to the six path
in upper stretch, moved up a bit in mid stretch and failed to sustain the move. MAVILUS raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in
upper stretch and failed to rally. BROOKLYN GIRL , well placed early, was five deep turning for home, raced on her left lead, gave way and was eased late.
CHAMPAGNE TOAST , very wide on the turn, faltered.

POST TIME , patiently handled for five furlongs, was in the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, moved up between horses in upper, eased
outside ALL THREES in mid stretch, overtook that one and drew off with something in reserve. SEVEN'S ELEVEN , a forward factor along the inner rail for
five furlongs, angled three wide leaving the turn, was no match for the winner through the stretch and passed a tired rival late. ALL THREES , three wide
chasing the pace, gained the lead leaving the turn, remained off the rail in the lane and weakened late. DOUBLE CROWN , a forward factor along the inner
rail entering the turn, gave way turning for home. DEE JAY bobbled at the break, circled horses on the turn, was fanned four wide entering the stretch and
faltered. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY showed speed in the two path for six furlongs and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOSE PERFECT , in the two path chasing the pace for six furlongs, secured command turning for home and edged away under pressure. FLAT OUT
FLYING , angled out to the three path leaving the first turn, remained outside, chased the winner and flattened out on his left lead. BODE'S MAKER lacked
speed, raced in the two path on the far turn and offered a slight rally. WHAT DOES IT TAKE set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead turning for home
and gave way. CURLIN'S MALIBU lacked speed, swung wide in upper stretch and had a mild gain. UNION FLEET , angled in on the first turn, hugged the
inner rail, chased the pace and tired. UNCAPTURED STORM , left at the starting gate when acting up at the break, trailed. There was a stewards' inquiry
concerning the start but no action was taken.
