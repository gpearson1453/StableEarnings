Footnotes
UNCLE EARL broke sharply, set all the pace, was put to right handed urging in upper stretch and drew off to win as much the best under an energetic hand
ride. REINSURE chased the winner along the inside and was no match while well clear for second. WIZARD WILLIE chased the winner two then three wide
into the stretch and faded late. LIGHTNING JACK trailed into the turn, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the seven path. UNCLE KEVIN was brushed
near the half mile pole and had brief speed. OMEGA GOLD brushed rivals from the outside near the half mile pole and was no factor. BROADWAY JONES
had speed into the turn then weakened. GIANT TRICK was brushed near the half mile marker, dropped inside and failed to threaten.

MCGRAW stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the bend to make the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted to the six path under
left handed urging and won as much the best. MONSTER HUNTER trailed early, closed willingly four wide through the stretch and got up for second.
WILDCAT BILL pressed the early pace two wide, drew on even terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole, battled into the stretch then was outfinished.
ONE MORE CHAPTER saved ground and found his best stride late. IT'SGOODTOBESEEN sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace
for a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and weakened late. BLUE MONARCH failed to menace. WHAT A RUSH was through after a half.

Footnotes
SUSHI Q never far back, began to close two wide around the far turn, engage the leader along the rail in upper stretch, was brushed by that one inside the
furlong marker and proved best in a game effort under left handed urging. CHLOES ANGEL pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, took
command, set the pace into the stretch, drifted in from three path to the two path under right handed urging brushing the winner past the eighth pole and just
missed hanging on. CITY SIGNS was in tight at the start, settled well back for a half, rallied determinedly outside rivals in the five path through the stretch
and finished clear for third. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE close up from the start, drew closer four wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then
faded late. GRIZABELLA stalked the early pace three wide, offered a mild bid nearing the top of the stretch then came up empty. CATABOUT had good
early speed then faded. THE LAST APPLE away alertly, set the pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs, kept on into the stretch then gave way
readily. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ also in tight at the start, was through early. J J'S FANCY offered little.

KEEPING SCORE never far back, closed willingly four then five wide through the stretch under left handed urging, made the lead late and drew clear under
a strong hand ride. MUCHO PRIMO away alertly, set the pace off the rail until deep stretch in the three path then was no match for the winner.
SURROUNDER had good early speed inside rivals, dropped back on the turn then came on again late four wide. JUST CHESTER settled, offered a mild bid
along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. CHOCOLATE PHILLING failed to menace. STUNT MAN chased the early pace, improved two wide through
the turn, remained a sharp threat until mid stretch and faded late. PRIMITIVO pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch and weakened late.

Footnotes
ESTILO FAVORITO chased the leader two wide through the turn, took command at the top of the stretch, shook clear past the furlong marker under mild left
handed urging and prevailed under brisk handling. SILVER MATT trailed down the backstretch, began to close ground along the rail into the stretch, shifted
out to the five path for racing room past the furlong marker and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late. SEEING RED stalked the pace along
the inside into the stretch, altered course to the four path inside the eighth pole and finished determinedly. ON HIS TOES unhurried early while outside
rivals, closed a gap late nine wide through deep stretch. BRION sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was
outfinished. CONSIDER ME failed to menace. ARMOR PIERCING was no threat. ESTILO CLASICO well placed, failed to respond. AWESOME ENOUGH
close early two wide, was through after a half.
