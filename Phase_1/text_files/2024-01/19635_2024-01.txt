Footnotes
HASTEN THENCE well placed behind the dueling leaders, took over midway on the final turn and drew clear under moderate urging. KING SWANSBORO
dueled between rivals, was collared again on the final turn, finished willingly while no match for the winner. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE saved ground off
the pace then flattened out in the stretch. COMPLETED STORM settled wide off the pace, moved closer on the final turn then faltered. MCMAGIC advanced
between rivals on the final turn then gave way. INSPECTOR dropped back early and was never in contention. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT trailed early then
passed tiring rivals. FLORIANOPOLIS lacked speed inside and was never a factor. MAX FOSTER flashed speed three wide for half a mile and stopped.
TAKEMETOTHEMOON set a pressured pace early then stopped on the final turn then was eased late. PER THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING
COMMISSION, MAX FOSTER HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO BEING INELIGIBLE TO RUN.

the final turn, reached even terms in midstretch and continued willingly. JEEPER dropped back inside, loomed a threat in the stretch then weakened. RUSH

then re-bid without menacing. NORTH POLE rushed to contention and dueled outside then faltered in the final furlong. BATTUTA D'ORO broke very slowly,
chased inside and trailed throughout.

APPEALINGTOTHE EYE forced the pace outside, took over when ready on the turn, repelled foe in midstretch and edged clear. BRUNO BARBER GIRL
advanced three wide into the stretch, loomed a threat and finished willingly. COLETTE'S SPIRIT chased in the two path, angled out in the stretch, bid then
flattened out. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS hustled to the front moving inside then weakened after half a mile. DIVINE TWIST saved ground off the pace, was in
tight at the quarter pole and faltered. WICKED LADY lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and gave way. RIVER CITY WALKER injured herself in the
starting gate and was ordered a late scratch.

RATIFIED stalked the pace outside, took over into the stretch and drew away under moderate urging. LUNA T lacked speed, advanced wide and closed
well for the place. VANISHING FAITH hustled to the front, was collared by the winner on the turn and yielded. LULI'S DANCER settled close up, was taken
up near the three eighths and again at the quarter pole then rallied well late. BELLA MARIA dropped back early, moved closer inside then flattened out in
the lane. SIRENETTA trailed far behind then passed tiring rivals. XENATOWN lacked speed inside and failed to respond. MORE RANSOM was urged close
up along the rail, steadied at the top of the stretch and faded. PEARLBDANCING flashed speed down the backstretch then gave way readily.
