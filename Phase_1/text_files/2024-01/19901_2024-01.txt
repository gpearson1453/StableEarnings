Footnotes
UNIVERSAL DESIGN was well rated on the inside, moved into contention on the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled out leaving the turn and made a
outside bid and edged away in the final sixteenth to prove best under right handed crop urging. BUCKFAST ABBEY was away alertly to set the early pace
on the inside, was headed nearing the quarter pole, dug in gamely to turn back the bid but was outfinished by the winner, second best. MARTHA'S HEART
prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to duel for command but flattened out in the final furlong, held show award.
DREAMERY was slow into stride on the inside, three wide on the turn and came three wide off the turn and had a late rally. THE LAST JET chased the
early pace on the outside, then was two wide on the turn and had no kick in the drive. GOLDEN BOSS LADY stalked the pace four wide and weakened.
SHE'SACHUBBLEMAKER failed to menace. HASHTAGJILLPOWER was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIMELY PROSPECT stalked the pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and took over off the turn, drew clear and remained clear to the
wire to prove best, driving. ASHAAB was rated along the inside, made a three wide bid leaving the turn to loom boldly, lugged in leaving the three sixteenths
and thenb was corrected and finished willingly to be clearly second best. PRACTICAL SENSE was bumped at the start, reserved early, three wide advance
on the turn, then was up for the show award late. SUSTENANCE set the pace on the inside, then was headed on the turn and tired in the drive, lost show
award late. RETWEET broke outwardly at the start, chased the pace and was three wide on the far turn and came five wide off the turn and was empty.
FREEDOM'S START was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and in between rivals and tired. GALILEE was bumped at the start and
then failed to menace. ROAN FOR THE ROSE was five wide into the first turn and chased the pace on the outside and tired.

LA LUISA pressed the pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then gained a short lead and maintained that short lead to the
wire to prevail under a drive. JUSTICE OR APPEAL set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and then ran on to the wire but was
out-kicked. LIL H tracked the early pace in between rivals, then chased the pace two wide by the quarter pole, angled out nearing the furlong marker and
had a late rally. HIGHWAY QUEEN chased the pace on the inside and cut the corner leaving the turn but had no kick. SUPER DUPER FLY lost iron at the
start, shifted out and advanced wide on the turn and came widest into the lane and had a belated rally on the far outside. PEACH BE WITH Q chased the
pace four wide and faded in the drive. MASKED HEROINE was settled on the inside, advanced and eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane
and had no late rally. KEYSTONE WARRIOR lacked a rally. SCOREBOARD LILY chased the pace on the outside and weakened. THE TIME FOR THIS
RACE WAS FROM THE GATE WHICH IS SET SIXTY FIVE FEET BACK FROM THE POLE.

NEW HIRE was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside nearing the quarter pole, then closed with full of run up the inside to draw away to prove best
under mild urging. WARRIOR'S RANSOM was void of early speed towards the inside, swung wide leaving the turn and closed full of run on the far outside.
ORGANIZED CHAOS set the early pace while clear, then remained clear off the turn while two to three wide and then weakened late while saving the show
award. PERFECT HIDEAWAY was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and rallied well late to just miss the
show award. DOCTOR ABBIE was settled back early, came four wide into the lane and had a belated rally. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR tracked the pace three
wide and came four wide off the turn and faded in the drive. SEEKING THE DREAM tracked the early pace, made a bid two wide by the quarter pole but
weakened in the drive. BOWTOTHEQUEEN chased the pace four wide and then was eased in the lane, walked off.

ROCKIN THE PALACE was taken back early, advanced two wide on the turn and then dropped to the inside and was boxed by the quarter pole, waited for
room and tipped out two wide leaving the three sixteenths and made a bid and edged clear in the final sixteenth of a mild to prove best, driving. SUNSHINE
HARRY rushed up the inside to set the early pace, then turned back bids by the quarter pole to be clear by the furlong marker, then was headed b y the
sixteenth marker and could not go with the winner late, second best. BACK EAST was rated early on the outside, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole
but flattened out in the lane. MIGHTY MINION prompted the pace two wide, made a bid and was between rivals by the quarter pole but faded in the final
furlong. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT tracked the pace three wide and weakened. ABBY'S SPIRIT chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
MELODIA was reserved early, advanced two wide on the far turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn for aim, made a bid and edged clear late to prove
best under left handed crop urging. CRICKET WEST pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn and shook clear nearing the quarter
pole but could not hold off the winner late while staying on to be second best. MIKEY'S JEWEL was settled back early, advanced three wide on the far turn
and came four wide off the turn and had a late rally to gain the show award. KATY THE CAT set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead
leaving the five sixteenths and faded the final furlong. LONDONDERRY was off slowly, then moved up four wide into the first turn, settled three wide, then
dropped to the inside on the far turn and had no rally. RIDGELYSREDHOT chased the early pace on the inside, dropped back on the backstretch and saved
ground on the far turn and had no rally. SWITCHRATTLENROLL lacked a rally. CAR LADY was off a step slow, settled back and had no response.
