Footnotes
DROP DEAD SEXY leaned in and brushed a for at the start, set a clear in the three path and held firm from an outer pursuer. COUNTRY LADY stalked in
the the three to four path, took aim on the leader nearing midstretch, but chased well while kept at bay. ISOLATION was brushed by an outer rival at the
star, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, then chased evenly through the lane. A RUNNIN AFLEET raced at the rear four wide, improved
turning for home to bid for show in upper stretch, but was turned away. MISS KENNEDY chased along the inside and tired. OURS AND THEIRS laid off of
the pace three wide and failed to factor.

Footnotes
CUSTOM BOBBY'S prompted two wide, bid in the four path in upper stretch, led passing the three sixteenth pole before changing leads at the furlong
grounds, then inched clear. TWIRLING ROSES stalked in the three path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, shifted leaving the three sixteenths pole,
yet ran on to gain place in the final sixteenth. UNIFIED REPORT tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch, then surpassed an inner tiring foe for
show approaching the wire. SEVEN SCENTS pursued from midpack in the two path, aim between rivals in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to split
those foes before the hole closed inside the final three sixteenths, tipped out in midstretch and kept on mildly. ROBO showed the way inside of a prompting
foe, got headed by that one at the three sixteenths pole, maintained place in the final sixteenth but faded late. MISTER CHAIRMAN laid off of the pace
along the inside, got a bit keen approaching the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, then failed to menace while inching closer. SUNSHINE
CHARLIE settled three wide, fanned to the six path entering upper stretch and lacked a rallly. BEEALEA broke a step slow while last away, trailed in the four
path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, and was outrun.

Footnotes
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE stalked two wide, bid and gained an advantage entering the turn, led from as the early pace-setter applied pressure around the
turn, cleared that one entering the lane, opened up under a drive and was put to hand in the final sixteenth. HOOSIER tracked in the three path, gained
place in upper stretch and fended off an inner bidder through the final furlong. TOTALLY ADDICTED broke slowly, saved ground at the rear, split foes
through a narrow seam at the three sixteenths pole, ran on well to bid for place along the inside, but was kept at bay. GEM OF CARLOS steadied behind
foes at the half mile pole, shifted in and chased along the inside whilst midpack into the turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane, then held fourth
through the final furlong. REVERENT laid off of the pace in the four to five path and failed to menace. CIGAR VAN lacked speed in the two to three path,
encountered mild traffic behind foes in upper stretch, angled to the six path in midstretch and lacked a rally. THE THREE KS chased in the three to four path
and faded between horses turning for home. INTHEALY broke through the starting gate pre-race, showed the way along the inside before being headed by
the eventual winner into the turn, vied around the bend but weakened entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
VISIONISTA tracked from midpack in the three to two path, shifted out to the five path while delaying a lead change in upper stretch, then rallied to drive
past the leader in the final sixteenth and edged clear. IRONIT set the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, spurted clear from an outer presser
entering the far turn, but hang on her left lead through upper stretch, began to tire while changing over at the furlong grounds and was caught in the final
sixteenth. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA pressed the leader from the three path, chased that clearing rival around the far turn, kept on to close in once again in
the final furlong along with an outer foe, but was outkicked for place entering the final sixteenth. MY LITTLE JEN pursued from midpack in the two path,
yielded position around the far turn, then kept on mildly to gain a minor share. CALAJA stalked along the inside, then chased through the lane and lacked a
bid. CZAR'S BALLERINA broke a step slow before steadying from crowded quarters between horses shortly after, trailed along the inside and moved up.
SIKARA SIKARA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted from the three to five path while inside of a rival around the far turn and failed to menace.
DARLING JOANNA tracked in the three to four path while racing well in the bit around the first turn, then faded between horses in upper stretch.
BEAUTIFUL ENDING lacked speed in the two path, then in the four to six path around the far turn and made little impact.

Footnotes
CANADA'S CUSTOMS tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair while having multiple lengths to find with three sixteenths to go, yet rallied to
bid in the final sixteenth and forged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH stalked two wide, bid in midstretch, led entering the
final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. FOURALIVIA set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole
and yielded. MISS PRIORITY pursued from midpack in the two to three path and among foes around the turn, then sustained a rail chase for a minor
reward. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN was bumped by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace while hung in the five path and was one paced through the lane.
GALAXY THIRTYSIX tracked in the four path and gave way. HALF PAGE broke a step slow before bumping an outer rival at the start, trailed in the two path
and was outrun. SIENNA BREEZE laid off of the pace in the four to six path and failed to factor on his left lead.

AGENT CREED settled off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear in
the final sixteenth. STRAIGHT AND LEVEL set the pace along the inside, held sway in the two path through upper stretch, dug in to resist an outer
challenge at the furlong grounds and was bested late. PIKE PLACE laid off of the pace along the inside, split foes two wide at the furlong grounds to gain
show and chased inside of the top pair late. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD saved ground well back, shifted to the four path entering the lane, tipped to the six
path passing the furlong grounds and offered a late kick. BRIGADE COMMANDER tracked in the four to three path around the first turn, floated back to the
four path in upper stretch and sustained a chase between horses. TREATY stalked along the inside, chased and gave way. MONJID pressed two wide, but
yielded between horses in midstretch. PROFESSOR HIGGINS bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, then further
back and between horses around the far turn, fanned out to the five path entering upper stretch, floated seven wide in midstretch and lacked a rally. GLEN
AIRY lacked speed in the three to four path and made little impact. MAASAI WARRIOR bumped with an outer rival at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHAMPLIN set the pace along the inside, drew clear entering the lane and was ridden out under mild urging. PRACTICALLY DARK broke a step slow,
stalked along the inside, moved forward and shifted out to pursue outside of the leader around the turn, but only managed to chase that one through the
lane to prove second best. EIRIK RIDGE chased two wide, then in the three path around the turn, dug in to resist an inner challenge for show entering the
lane and turned that one away in the final furlong. GOLDENTOWN broke a step slow and was bumped by an inner rival at the start, saved ground at the
rear, bid for show entering the lane but flattened out. GREAT RUNNER was urged along three wide and between horses, then gave way in the four path
around the turn. BETTERA bumped an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace hung in the four to five path and faded.

three sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path in midstretch and stayed on between horses. PRESENT MOMENT (IRE) pursued from midpack in the three
path, tracked within striking range three wide around the far turn, shifted back to the four path entering the lane, ran on to vie for place in the final furlong,
