AMERICAN GRIT saved ground setting the pace in hand and was ridden out to increase his advantage. MOONLIGHTNWINE saved ground while being
allowed to settle in stride, slipped through along the inside and finished steadily for the place. REGULATION DAZED was forwardly placed from the while
racing three-wide and finished well for the show. SUMMANUS prompted the pace to the stretch while racing two-wide and weakened. SARGENT KLINE
dropped well back early and failed to menace. RAAJIN RIBBON broke in a tangle, then raced four-wide on the turn and was not a factor. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS INQUIRY IT WAS DETERMINED THAT RAAJIN RIBBON DID DNOT RECEIVE A FAIR START AND WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER
WITH ALL WAGERS ON HIM BEING REFUNDED.

SILENT DECLARATION was allowed to settle in stride, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the final strides. LAGO DE ORO
bobbled at the start, the moved up to be forwardly placed while racing two-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and just failed to last. THIRSTY KISS was
reserved off the early pace, rallied six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. ATTORNEY LOUIS prompted the pace to the stretch while three-wide and
weakened. HADLEES HONOR was unhurried early while saving ground, checked nearing the eighth pole running up on horses and finished willingly when
clear. CHUMLY broke out to bump with Danny Zuko, then saved ground setting the pace to near the stretch and tired. DANNY ZUKO dropped back after
being bumped at the start and failed to menace.

settle in stride, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. THEUNTOUCHABLEONE was never far back, came four-wide into the stretch and
finished in a steady rally. TIME 'ER TOO vied for the lead with Reign of Speed from along the outside into the stretch and weakened late. REIGN OF
SPEED vied for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly during the drive and tired. MY MAN STAN was forwardly placed while racing five-wide and
went evenly. WITHEE settled in the middle of the pack early, steadied in tight nearing the three-eighths pole and failed to menace thereafter. MY DAD IS
THIRSTY was five-wide early and failed to threaten. ITS KRAKEN TIME was four-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
ALOHA BREEZE saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win with something left. STEPUP saved ground chasing the winner, could not threaten that
one but continued on well for the place. SHELBY GOLD was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild
rally. DRIVEWAY was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. ANNETTE MARIE dropped back while saving ground and failed to
seriously threaten. STICKINITTOTHEMAN failed to menace while racing three-wide.

Footnotes
ABOVE THE STARS saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off without need of urging. GUNNHILD was unhurried early, came three-wide into the
stretch, split rivals during the drive and finished strongly. ZEVA DEE prompted the pace from along the inside, was no match for the winner but held on fairly
well for the show. OUR GIRL ASHLEY was three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. PISTA GIRL dropped back after
breaking a step slow, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. YOUNG LIFE LAURA was off a step slow, moved up five-wide nearing the
quarter pole to offer a mild bid and then faltered during the drive. SHESALILRUNAWAY was forwardly placed for three furlongs and tired.
