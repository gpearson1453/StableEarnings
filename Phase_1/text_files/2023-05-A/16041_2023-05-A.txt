Footnotes
MR CLINE stalked the pace four then three wide into the far turn, rallied to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and edged
clear late under confident handling. FISHING FOR FUN pressed the pace two wide and finished gamely for second. SECRET SANCTUARY went evenly.
THE EQUINEST made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the far turn, remained a sharp threat along the rail until deep stretch then
weakened. SILVER MATT was restless in the gate, broke awkwardly then failed to menace. SOAKING WET also restless in the gate, was no threat. SMALL
BUT FEISTY was antsy in the gate, prompted the pace two wide and was through after a half.

edged clear late under strong handling. POWERFUL PHIL dueled for the lead two wide and finished second best. SWEET LEMON DROP had good early
speed three wide, dropped back on the turn, swung wide and came on again late in the seven path. BABA LOOEY contested the lead three wide into the
turn and faded in the stretch TIDE RISING passed tiring rivals. KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE with the second flight three wide, was carried out to the eight path at
the top of the stretch then lacked the needed response. OHIO EAGLE with the second flight along the rail, moved up on the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
ENERGIZER pressed the early pace two wide, dropped back on the turn, came on again in the six path through deep stretch under left handed urging and
got up in the final strides. CHANNEL FURY gained a slight lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, edged clear and just missed
hanging on. SO DIALED IN raced outside, surged in the seven path late and was narrowly beaten. LAZARUS PROJECT found his best stride late along the
rail. WOODLAND WALK matched strides for the lead three then two wide into the stretch and weakened late.
