HAPPYKIYAY vied for the early lead while in the two path, shook clear into the turn, widened into the lane then held. SNUGGLER jostled between rivals
soon after the start, chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, had aim on the winner while straightening, could not gain on that one but
stayed on well for second best. LIZZSAIDNO unhurried early while near the inside, continued into the lane from the two path and moved up for the show
spot while not a menace. CABIN ABBY pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, chased the winner into the lane then weakened inside the eighth
pole. DARNELL was never a threat while along the inside. GOLDEN HEIST was in the five to the four path through the turn and into the lane and could not
offer a stretch respponse. SEMINOLE MIDNIGHT vied for the early lead while in the three path, chased the winner into the turn then was done near the

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN LOGAN vied for the early lead while in the three path, cleared on the turn, widened to the eighth pole, looked to be a sure winner with a
sixteenth to go, shortened stride late and just lasted. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE was steadied soon after the start when losing his path, settled back, moved to
chase the pace through the turn while in the three or four path, came into the lane from the four path or five path and finished with good energy.
STANDOUTJUSTICE was in the three path through the turn when unhurried, came into the lane from the four or five path and was methodically gaining to
the end. BIG CITY HEAT chased the pace from the two path through the turn, had aim on the leader after straightening in the lane and just needed more.
BUMPY pressed the pace along the inside to the turn, settled back to chase the pace into the lane, was well placed inside the eighth pole but could not gain
and lost positions late. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE was quick early then settled back along the inside and offered a mild gain on the tiring leader. JUST A
NOTION was never a threat from off the inside. PURSUANT never a factor while in the three path. BLAME IT ON MILLER never a menace while saving
ground. WHOSPACKINMYLUNCH trailed throughout while along the inside. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #9 DOUBLEDOJUSTICE AGAINST
THE RIDER OF #10 GENTLEMAN LOGAN FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START OF THE RACED WAS DISALLOWED.
