Footnotes
AFLEET ASCENT stalked the pace, raced four to five through the upper stretch and prevailed late under strong pressure. GALLANT STAR dropped to the
back of the pack early on, raced along the inside down the backstretch around the far turn, angled out through the drive, surged late and just missed.
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, made a two bid near the quarter to challenge for the early, was clear
nearing the eighth pole and outkicked late while racing two to three wide. C'MON VE set his own pace under along the inside down the backstretch ad gave
way in the drive. COMEDIAN settled early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and lacked a bid. SET HUT was slow early on, raced four wide in the
drive and had no response. HONORARIAN raced mid pack early on, saved ground through the far turn and never was a factor.

Footnotes
THROUGH THE CRACKS stalked the early going, moved up from the inside around the far turn and finished well to be well clear under strong handling.
SECRET MOMENT showed good early foot to show the pace while racing just off the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. ABBY DABBY
prompt the early pace from the outside and kept on to the wire. MINT JULIUS pressed the early pace between and weakened late. LACEY'S STAR dropped
back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CABEZA DE TORTUGA was off slowly, raced near the inside and never threatened.
NIKLAUSIA dropped back early and failed to respond.
