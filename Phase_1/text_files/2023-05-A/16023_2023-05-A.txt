Footnotes
I HAVE COURAGE set the pace outside WATCH ME DISAPPEAR , gained a clear lead entering the stretch, was under urging in mid stretch and eagerly
pulled away. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR pulled her way into contention along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, pressed the pace to the stretch, swung
out in upper stretch, remained on his left lead and gave way. MUNNIS PRETTY lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and
failed to rally. LA SANTA CLARA broke slowly, raced in the two path between horses entering the turn and weakened. BESSIE BLUE , three deep on the
turn, dropped back. DANCE DELILAH , along the inner rail around the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
BAD TEMPER rated off the rail, edged up between rivals into the turn, angled out and circled five wide with momentum into the lane, closed nicely under
steady hand encouragement, forged past BALLYKEEN leaving the sixteenth marker and drew clear. BALLYKEEN bore out at the break, corrected and
dropped in some when edging up early, bumped with SAPPHIRE BEAUTY leaving the chute, tracked three wide into the turn, moved outside to engage the
leader mid turn, kicked clear into the lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. PERFORMANCEANXIETY settled four to five
wide outside rivals early, shifted wider on the turn, circled seven wide into the stretch, straightened and found her best too late. RATIONALMILLENNIAL ,
bumped and pinched back at the break, was taken to rate early on, moved up off the rail past the five sixteenths, steadied briefly soon after, shifted in a path
to work between runners then closed steadily in the final furlong. VICTORIAN RIVIERA sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure mid
turn, came two wide for the drive and weakened in the final eighth. IRISH LACE drifted out a bit at the break, corrected and settled while saving ground,
stayed along the rail through the drive, made a slight run near the sixteenth pole then flattened out. FASHIONATTA , bumped at the break, moved up and
chased two to three wide, made some progress into the lane but failed to sustain. HAPPY TAPPY TIM was hustled up to contention, stalked while saving
ground, angled three wide under asking nearing the stretch, chased and gave way. POET IN MY HEART broke inward and bumped with a rival, showed
speed then rated back off rivals, raced between rivals leaving the far turn and faded. HEARDITALL , three deep heading to the turn, angled out and made a
mild five wide run mid turn, pursued into the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. LOTTACLASS LILSASS was outrun. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY , bumped
at the break and then leaving the chute, prompted the pace two wide, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and faltered.

JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and drew out under urging late. TOCAYO broke slowly, rushed
up between horses down the backstretch, prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened late. JUST THE THING , slightly off the inner rail around the
turn, drifted to the rail approaching the eighth pole and had a mild gain late. INCITATUSWAY hopped slightly at the break, circled the turn three wide while
chasing the pace and gave way in upper stretch. MUCHO LOVE , along the inner rail throughout, was no factor. LEE ALEJANDRO fell back.

Footnotes
ISLAND D'LITE , brushed at the break, stalked the dueling leaders leaving the far turn, shifted out and circled five wide with aim into the lane, closed in
under left handed asks, kept on grinding through the final sixteenth and got up late outside rivals. LORD UHTRED broke outward into JUDY'S ARMY,
corrected and quickly moved up to engage GRAND ESCAPE from the outside, dueled around the turn, held a slim advantage four wide into the stretch,
clung to command past mid stretch then stayed on gamely between runners. GRAND ESCAPE drifted out at the break and brushed with RASCALLY
REBEL, straightened and cleared, was joined after a furlong, sparred inside LORD UHTRED into and around the turn, raced three wide inside foes into the
stretch, fought valiantly inside runners through the final furlong and was edged for the place. RASCALLY REBEL , brushed at the break, edged up and
stalked the duel while saving ground, remained inside through the lane but came up empty. JUDY'S ARMY , off slowly when bumped and forced out, raced
wide under asking leaving the far turn but failed to generate the needed response.

Footnotes
FANCEE GRACE C sped to the early lead, set the pace in the two path inside horses around the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home and drew off under
steady handling. SWEET SHUGS , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, was well placed in upper stretch and flattened out. ELLIE VICTORINA
saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and lacked the needed late response. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM dropped back on the
turn, floated to the seven path entering the stretch and passed tired horses. LADY SERENITY , in the three path between horses around the turn, prompted
the pace to the stretch and gave way the final furlong. NAUGHTY NAN lacked speed, swung to the six path turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
LUCCI vied outside I GOT A ROCK while under confident handling, raced on near even terms into the lane, responded when put to some asking leaving the
three sixteenths, shook clear leaving the furlong grounds, kept on under right handed asks and denied BATTLEBUS through the final yards. BATTLEBUS
stalked the dueling leaders while outside a rival, was guided four wide into the lane, moved up to loom in mid stretch, switched over to his left lead with a
sixteenth remaining and continued willingly. INDEFATIGABLE saved ground, eased for the drive and closed between foes to gain the show. MONTAUK
DADDY had speed then rated back off the leaders and saved ground, came out for the drive, chased and lacked a serious finish. W W SPRINGTIME , three
wide, was pushed along past the three eighths, moved up a bit past mid stretch and churned on between runners. BACKWOODS BOOGIE checked soon
after the break, angled four wide into the lane but came up empty. I GOT A ROCK , away alertly, disputed the pace to the inside of the winner, kept up the
fight to mid stretch then weakened in the final sixteenth. BURGEE broke slowly, saved ground while well back into the turn, shifted out for the drive and
failed to menace. FLASHINTHENIGHT hit the gate at the break causing his rider to briefly lose his balance, was bumped soon after, saved ground leaving
the far turn, angled out and came up empty. REUX (GB) , racing without front shoes, was rated off the pace while saving ground, angled out mid turn, came
five wide for the drive and faded. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER , racing without front shoes, was in a bit tight at the break, dropped off the pace and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT CHASE , three deep under urging mid way on the turn, advanced outside MILITARY HOP, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and drew out.
MILITARY HOP gained a two wide lead near the three eighths pole, opened a clear advantage leaving the turn and was no match for the winner in the drive.
CURLIN'S MALIBU lacked speed outside horses down the backstretch, swung five wide turning for home and had a mild rally. SPOTTED BULL set the
pace along the inner rail, lost the lead on the turn and gradually weakened through the stretch. CROUCHELLI swung outside in upper stretch and passed
tired horses. SAVOY , four wide chasing the pace on the turn, gave way. OXIDE raced in the two path between horses around the turn and weakened. ACE
NINE NINE hugged the inner rail, chased the pace for three furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
TOOSWEETFORME had speed outside rivals, moved clear heading to the turn, dropped in and rated the pace, responded to strong asking in the lane and
steadily pulled away. LADY LANCER drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, raced four deep near the half mile marker, advanced three wide mid
turn to take aim on the winner, failed to make headway through the lane but continued willingly to be second best. TIPSY TOURIST , jostled between foes
soon after the break, was shuffled back early then taken to rate, angled out and gained four wide approaching the stretch but failed to sustain in the final
furlong. LOOKING FOR FLARE , bumped soon after the break, prompted inside foes then steadied back out of tight spot near the five eighths, dropped well
back leaving the far turn, swung five wide and faded. DESPITE THE GIN was bounced around soon after the start, moved up then tracked inside into the
turn, eased out two wide to chase past mid turn then weakened. LILY MOR , bumped after the break, raced three wide between foes early, steadied when in
a bit tight near the far turn and dropped back.
