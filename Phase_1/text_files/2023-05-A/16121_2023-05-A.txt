on, then drew clear again on the turn and then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. PADDY'S CROWN set the early pace, then
tracked the pacesetter and then saddle slipped and lost an iron over number fourteen, was able to get foot back into iron on the turn and then finished
willingly but could not get to the winner, second best. ISLAND NATION (IRE) was settled back early, made a mild bid on the final turn and then held the
show award late. THE BUTLER YATES (IRE) was settled early, lacked a solid rally while missing the show award. PROFITEER was settled mid pack and

AWESOME ADRIAN was reserved early, closed on the outside on the turn and drew clear after the last jump to prove best, driving. HUYANA set the pace
while well clear, then was headed nearing the last fence and could not go with the winner, stayed on to be second best. OUR FRIEND (IRE) chased the
pace and lacked the needed rally.
