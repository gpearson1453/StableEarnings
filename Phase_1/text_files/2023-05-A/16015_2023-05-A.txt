MY TWO AUNT JOANS never far back, closed willingly four wide into the stretch, engage the frontrunner at the furlong marker, matched strides to the wire
and proved best by the narrowest of margins under a strong hand ride. BLAST THE MUSIC pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, battled
through the final furlong with the winner but just failed despite a game effort. BON DEUX pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then was outfinished.
ASK THE UMPIRE away alertly, set a pressured pace along the rail for a half, had speed until deep stretch then weakened. BAY DEFENSE failed to
menace. BUILT LIKE TARZAN was through early.

drew clear under strong handling. GO GIRL away alertly, set the pace until mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner but gamely held on for second.
KETTLE KISS never far back, finished with good courage in the three path. DEW IT WITH STYLE was bumped at the start, chased the pace along the rail
and went evenly. BEAUTIFUL LASS broke slowly, was quickly taken outside, drifted out past the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch and failed to
menace. TV TIZ GORGEOUS bumped at the start, was well placed then lacked the needed response. SURE FIRE READY drifted out bumping rivals a few

Footnotes
FUEGO CALIENTE prompted the pace three wide into the far turn, responded under right handed urging to make the lead before the quarter pole, shook
clear before mid stretch and prevailed under brisk handling. CUMBER set a pressured pace along the rail into the far turn, dropped back and altered course
outside the winner to the four path before the eighth pole then finished second best. GILES close up from the start, raced in the four path on the far turn,
drifted out to the six path then finished evenly. UNIDENTIFIED MAN pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs then faded. MASTER OF WAR failed to
menace. DUEL FUEL bumped at the start and was no threat. OPEN OUT bumped at the start and failed to respond. ROSAS WAY showed little. SHELL
FIRE had speed for a half, stopped, was eased to the wire, bled from the nostrils and was walked off.

FABULOUS CLOWN chased the pace along the inside into the stretch, angled off the rail near the furlong marker, surged in the six path under left handed
urging and got up in the final strides. KISS VALENTINA broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch, drifted out to the five path under left handed
urging then couldn't hold off the winner. SECRETS UNTOLD unhurried early, was steadily gaining ground late outside rivals. STARLITESLEW failed to
menace. CHILLVILLE had speed through the turn then wilted. ANIMO STAR was never close.

Footnotes
MOESTER unhurried early, closed willingly five wide through the stretch and got up in the final strides. MIDNIGHT MIKEY stalked the pace into the stretch,
drew on even terms for the lead four wide at the furlong marker and just missed in a game effort. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN forwardly placed from the start,
saved ground through the turn, loomed boldly three wide before the furlong marker and was outfinished in a determined effort. RELISH THE RIDE slow
early, found his best stride late seven wide. BIG TRUCK allowed to settle, closed a gap late eight wide. PAT'S KARMA raced wide and went evenly.
SHANGHAI PRINCE had speed into the turn then faded. CALBOYZEKE was no factor. THEDAYOFTHEGREY made the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace until mid stretch then weakened. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE was no threat. MOBIL SOLUTION was outrun. ZAKARIA matched stride for the
lead two wide until the furlong marker then folded.

Footnotes
RADIANTRITHYM hopped at the start, settled with the second flight between horses two wide, responded with a rapid move three wide to make the lead at
the top of the stretch and finished full of run to win going away. BACKSPLASH trailed along the inside into the stretch, angled out to the five path and rallied
for second. DIVINE MARTHA rushed to contention outside, pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. PRINCESS HALIME with the
second flight three wide went evenly. SHELLEY'S GEM sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then weakened
late. MISS OVER THERE with the second flight inside, lacked the needed response.
