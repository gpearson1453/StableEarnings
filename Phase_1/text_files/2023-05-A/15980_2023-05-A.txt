Footnotes
PROVOCATIVA raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from
the two path coming around the second bend and drew off in the stretch. RIPLEY EFFECT was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane while
never threatening the winner. TIPHARAH raced in the three path early, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, took over to lead the way while
saving ground around the far turn, was caught in upper stretch and chased the winner home from there. C C'S FREEDOM raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the second bend and never threatened. DEESSE saved ground around the first turn, led the
way up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to fade in the stretch. DURA THE EXPLORER
raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and tired in the
lane.

RITABOOK dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle gamely from the three path around the turn and in upper stretch and edged clear
late. ATHENA'S WISDOM dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and dug in
gamely in the stretch, giving way late. HUMOR SENSE chased the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and could not go with
the top two in the lane but kept on to the finish. MY BATON ROUGE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, continued around the turn in the
five path and finished evenly. NOBLE ATTITUDE raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and showed no
kick. NEWYEARSPRESENT raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch.
LAVERN veered in leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

HARPOON HARRY led the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and
held that margin to the wire. GREAT BRITAIN saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the second turn and gained ground late. BARNEGAT LIGHT chased the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far
bend still in the two path and kept on to the finish. CARRONADE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the
inside, saved ground around the far turn and improved position in the lane while never threatening. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH raced in the three path early,
settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and made no bid.

POSEIDON'S SON tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and drew off to the wire. JACKSON STRONG led the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the bend, could not go with the
winner in the stretch and chased that rival home to the finish. CHIQUIRIN raced off the pace early, began to move up while racing in the four path around
the turn and continued to improve position in the lane. EXCELLENT MARK stalked the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile,
continued around the bend in the three path and finished evenly. COMMANDER KEITH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and showed no kick. AWKWARD PAUSE bumped mildly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the
middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA chased the leader on the inside
through the early going, saved ground around the bend and tired from there. AGENT COOPER bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the
middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. CLASSIC FILM trailed the

Footnotes
WINTER'S GHOST raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path
coming around the far turn, raced in tight quarters approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear and dueled to the wire to hold the win. WAR CROSS raced in
the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the second bend and dueled to the wire but could not
get by the winner. GOLDEN TONE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the four path, began a
bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. ARIES REIGNS raced in the five path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, came around the second bend still in the five path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. HEFFNER saved ground around the first
turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, raced in tight quarters and steadied near the quarter pole
and weakened further in the final furlong. EXACTING pressed the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the
two path, was squeezed in tight quarters and stumbled approaching the quarter pole, steadied and faded from there. PIYPA DE LYNDA raced in the two
path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and was
empty in the lane. CUZ raced in the three path around the first turn, continued off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend
and was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE QUARTER POLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE RIDER OF HORSE
ONE, HEFFNER, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE SIX, WINTER'S GHOST, CITING INTERFERENCE AT THE SAME SPOT. UPON REVIEW,
NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
