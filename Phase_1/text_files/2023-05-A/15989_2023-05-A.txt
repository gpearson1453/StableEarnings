Footnotes
ATOMIC CANDY was prominently placed while racing two-wide, moved up to engage Provost nearing the eighth pole, dueled with him from that point and
was all out to prevail. PROVOST saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and held on gamely during the drive. BABY FRANKIE was off
a step slow, then race three-wide and finished in a mild rally. HEY SEQUOIA saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked a rally when
asked. SIERRA MELODY was unhurried early while racing two-wide and failed to seriously threaten. ALPINE HYPNOSIS dropped back early, came
three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

POLACCO saved ground setting the pace, responded when asked and then was fully extended to prevail narrowly. DIRT ROAD RED was allowed to settle
in stride, moved up along the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled out 2-wide entering the stretch and finished fast to just miss. MOSQUITO FLEET
stalked the pace while racing two-wide, was three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. YOU'RE THE CAUSE saved ground while being
unhurried, slipped through during the drive and gained his best stride too late. AFFIRM CHIEF was forwardly placed while racing two-wide but lacked a rally.
PISTOL POWER raced three-wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

G G RULES saved ground while being forwardly placed, slipped through during the drive and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. TED'S
CANDY GIRL bumped with Zaragoza at the start, then was allowed to settle in stride, split rivals nearing the quarter pole while two-wide and finished
strongly. CHEATER'S WALTZ saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole and then held on fairly well during the drive to end
up on even terms with Bossy Pegasus. BOSSY PEGASUS was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and
finished in a late rally to end up in a dead-heat with Cheater's Waltz for the show. FLORA saved ground while being unhurried but lacked a rally when
asked. NOMI LACKEE prompted the early pace while racing two-wide and weakened. ZARAGOZA bumped at the start with Ted's Candy Girl and failed to
