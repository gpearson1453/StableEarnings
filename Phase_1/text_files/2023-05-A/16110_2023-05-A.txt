Footnotes
AWESOME HEIGHTS sat the perfect trip stalking a trio of leaders on the backstretch, continued stalking rivals on the turn, inched forward in hand and
waited for a cue, asked to go three wide and responded, powered away in upper stretch to win convincingly. TIME IS GONE vied inside two rivals for the
lead on the backstretch, continued with rail position on the turn and into the lane, showed little resistance to rallying rival but kept on well in the lane to earn
second. SURPLUS vied in between rivals for the lead on the backstretch, continued in between on the turn, held a slim advantage into the stretch, passed
by outside rallying rival and lost battle for second. EPIC DRAMA bumped twice at the start and squeezed back, settled off the pace and off the rail on the
backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid in the three path and mildly gained to the wire. HOT PURSUIT vied for lead three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, ended up four wide late on the turn and began to weaken, entered lane and offered little while dropping back.
ELUSIVE VIRTUE broke out and bumped outside rival at the start, drop to rear of the field, saved ground through the turn and failed to respond when asked
in the lane.
