Footnotes
DESTINE TO RACE bumped with BEACH WALKIN at the start, opened clear to dictate terms, rebuffed the bid of FOREVER AFTER ALL leaving the
five-sixteenths pole, recleared off of the inside into the stretch, dug in under steady urging and held sway. FOREVER AFTER ALL tracked three deep,
moved up to engage DESTINE TO RACE nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was unable to go on with that one, tacked to the rail entering the stretch and
boxed on willingly to preserve the runner up spot. BACK TO GRIDLOCK stalked the pace, launched her bid four wide, but flattened during the drive and
settled for the minor award. LADY SAMARITAN attended the pace inside, got through but failed to make headway. I HAD THAT ONE TOO was allowed to
settle three wide, angled out near the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a belated improvement. TWO MINUTE LICK contended between horses to the
second turn and weakened. HEART HEADED WOMAN broke a step slow, was bumped soundly shortly after, settled saving ground but lacked a response
when asked. ORIGAMI GIRL was unhurried, shifted out four wide leaving the second turn, was fanned out further in the stretch and was never a factor.
BEACH WALKN broke a step slow and was jostled between rivals, was hung wide thereafter, came up empty on the second turn and retreated. MAGIC
PALACE showed little.

Footnotes
VAHVA tracked three wide, pressed around the turn, bid in the five path entering the lane, led in upper stretch, drove clear as an outer UNDERVALUED
ASSET pursued entering the final furlong, dug into resist that foe's challenge leaving the sixteenth pole, and held sway. UNDERVALUED ASSET stalked
two wide and between horses down the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane to take aim on the new leader from the six to seven path in upper stretch,
sustained a grinding charge in pursuit, closed in to bid passing the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay. SECRET STATEMENT prompted the pace three to
two wide, vied between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by her outer counterpart entering the lane, yielded to the top two while hanging on her left
lead coming to midstretch, yet held show through the late stages. PADMA broke a step slowly while brushing an outer rival, spotted the leader multiple
lengths leaving the chute, laid far back two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and moved up along with an
outer foe. PERSONAL PURSUIT veered outwardly at the start, lacked speed in the four path around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and
stayed on. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH took a brush from an inner rival leaving the gates, pursued the main group from the two to three paths around the
turn, inched closer while fanning to the six path entering the lane, but tucked back down to the four path in upper stretch, and lacked a bid while flattening
out. GROVE laid off of the pace along the inside, and made little impact. ERVADEAN prompted the pace along the inside, backed off to stalk at the half mile
pole, pursued from the pocket around the bend, but failed to keep pace with the leaders after tipping to the three path in upper stretch, and gave way.
UNSUNG MELODY set the pace between horses early on before clearing her inner counterpart passing the half mile pole, showed the way inside of a vying
foe into the turn, then inside of a pair of rivals turning for home, but was headed by them at the quarter pole, and weakened. GOODBYE KYLE broke slowly,
then bore out multiple paths in the early stages causing the rider to take a firm hold, and was detached from the rest thereafter.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' T raced in the two path along the first turn, stalked the early pace, was on the inside along the far turn, shifted into the three path entering the
lane, made a bid in the upper stretch and edged clear in the late stages. BURNING BRIGHT raced in the four path along the first turn while tracking the
early pace, took over command down the backstretch, raced in the two path entering the lane, gave in near the sixteenth pole and yielded late in the drive.
WHISPER NOT (GB) was steadied early on, raced in the five path along the first urn, was in the two path in the far turn, tipped into the three path entering
the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. BULLSEYE BUN raced along the inside in the turns and back early on, shifted into the four path entering the
lane while making a bid, continued the bid down the lane but flattened out late in the drive. POINT ME BY was unhurried early on, raced in the three path
along the far turn, swung out into the nine path entering the lane and improved position. SIEGE OF BOSTON raced in the five path along the first turn,
chased the pace, was in the four path in the far turn, fanned into the seven path entering the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. SKY AND SAND
was in the eight path into the lane and never a threat. COWBOY JUSTICE (GB) was steadied into the first turn, raced in the three path along the far turn,
was in the eight path into the lane and never a factor. WE ALL SEE IT raced on the inside along the far turn, shifted into the three path into the lane.
SUTHERLAND dueled along the first turn, raced in the two path along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane and empty down the lane.
BACKGROUND was never a threat. RUSTLER had early speed then folded up.

Footnotes
HEARTYCONSTITUTION settled in hand, advanced between rivals through the turn and into the lane, split rivals a furlong out, quickened once uncovered
and kicked clear. JUMP INTO THE FIRE broke through the gate, disputed the pace outside, fought on doggedly through a prolonged drive, but was unable
to match strides with the winner. ZAWISH stalked the pace, launched a bold bid four wide, but weakened slightly in the drive and settled for the show. TAKE
A STAND was allowed to settle, angled out five wide and was making up ground late. FANNIE AND FREDDIE settled in hand, tucked in to save ground, got
through entering the stretch, shifted out but went evenly in traffic. GUANA CAY was hustled along in mid pack and failed to make headway. MUSIC
STREET finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. SUNNY ISLE BEACH failed to respond. JAG WARRIOR was hustled along three wide,
but came up empty leaving the turn and faded. NOT SO CLOSE was away alertly, disputed the pace along the inside, was headed leaving the turn and
gave way readily. ROC'S PRINCESS showed little. INTO DISCO was forwardly placed to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SMILE HAPPY pressed outside of the pace setter, vied down the backstretch, dueled for the lead entering the far turn, wrestled an advantage turning for
home, inched clear in upper stretch as an outer ART COLLECTOR gave chase, and held sway safely through the final furlong. ART COLLECTOR shifted
out around the first turn to set up shop outside of the top pair, stalked them down the backstretch, was roused to range up turning for home, spun into the
lane in the five path, gained place at the three sixteenths pole while chasing the clearing leader, and lacked a finishing kick while securing place from an
inner foe. WEST WILL POWER set the pace inside of a pressing rival, sparred with that one down the backstretch and into the far turn, got headed at the
five sixteenths pole as another outer rival closed in, then yielded to that pair in upper stretch. LAST SAMURAI laid off of the pace along the inside, took
closer order along with an outer rival at the five furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with the top trio despite rider's urging around the far turn, yet kept on to
secure a minor placiing. RICH STRIKE trailed in the two path around both turns, then improved inside of a tiring foe in the final sixteenth without making an
impact. MILLIKEN settled off of the pace two wide, inched closer along with his inner counterpart passing the five furlong pole, but gave way with three
furlongs to go, and continued to weaken thereafter.

Footnotes
RED CARPET READY tracked four wide, came to level terms midway through the turn, shook clear entering the stretch, then was fully extended to hold the
resurgent MUNNYS GOLD battled back in the final sixteenth. MUNNYS GOLD set the pressured pace outside, relinquished the lead entering the lane,
fought back with renewed vigor in the final sixteenth but was unable to bridge the gap. ACCEDE attended the pace in hand, launched a bold bid leaving the
bend four wide, but flattened and settled for the show. CONDENSATION was forwardly placed inside, shifted out entering the lane but weakened. OLIVIA
TWIST hopped at the start, brushed the gate to get away poorly, bumped with SABRA TUFF just after the start, moved up along the inside, wheeled out
leaving the turn, came five wide but failed to threaten. SABRA TUFF broke a step slow and was bumped, settled saving ground, but was never a factor.
GRAND LOVE contended between horses through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CARAVEL set the pace two wide before clearing an inner rival nearing the turn, showed the way along the inside while an outer pair applied pressure, shook
away from them once set down in entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, and lasted safely as a pair of rivals closed in late. BAY STORM shifted out
towards open space at the start, saved ground in midpack around the turn, awaited racing room behind traffic in upper stretch, tipped off of the rail in
midstretch, split foes to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, dueled for that position with an outer rival through the closing stages, and narrowly prevailed.
SARAH HARPER took a bump from an inner rival at the start, laid towards the rear in the three path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, rallied
outside of foes with a good kick in the final furlong, bid for place entering the final sixteenth, sparred with an inner foe late, but missed. NEW BOSS broke a
beat slow, trailed along the inside, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch in hopes of rallying between horses, but lacked a kick to do so, altered course
outside of rivals at the furlong grounds, and stayed on late. OEUVRE stalked three wide and between horses early on, moved forward along with an outer
foe to press the pace-setter two wide around the turn, chased the clearing leader while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, held place through midstretch,
but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the sixteenth pole, and gave way. LITTLE JEWEL stalked four wide, took closer order to press three wide
entering the turn, but only managed to chase in the four path in upper stretch before yielding between horses. SALVAJE came out at the start and put an
outer rival to crowded quarters, settled off of the pace in the three path, spun into the lane in the five path, but lacked a rally among horses. MINER'S
QUEEN prompted the pace along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader nearing the turn, chased around the bend, vied for
place in upper stretch, but weakened in the final furlong. MAJESTIC D'ORO bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, then steadied when pinched
between horses soon after, raced far back along the inside while a path off of the inner rail, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, and failed to factor
among rivals. MARGIE'S KITCHEN tracked two wide into the turn, but was coaxed along around the bend, chased in upper stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
PLAYED HARD stalked the pace early, raced in the two path along the first turn, was in the three path along the far turn, shifted into the four path entering
the lane, made a bid down the lane under a long drive, drifted out under left-handed urging, bumped with SECRET OATH in the late stages and prevailed
while relentless to the wire. SECRET OATH was bumped around from between horses into the first turn, settled back along the backstretch, raced in the five
path in the far turn, fanned into the eight path entering the lane, under a long drive down the lane, bumped with PLAYED HARD and just missed in the final
stages. SEARCH RESULTS tracked the pace early, raced near the rail along both turns, shifted into the three path entering the lane, was under a long drive
down the lane back near the rail but did not have enough in the late stages. A MO REAY raced in the two path along the first turn, was in the four path along
the far turn, fanned into the nine path entering the lane while under a rally, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. DESERT DAWN
chased the pace early, raced in the three to four path along the first turn, was in the four path in the far turn, in the five path entering the lane while making a
bid but weakened late in the drive. PAULINE'S PEARL raced four wide along the first turn, was in the five path along the far turn, in the six path into the lane
and faded late in the stretch run. SOUL OF AN ANGEL trailed the field early on, raced in the two path along the turn, fanned into the seven path entering the
lane and improved position. SIXTYTHREECALIBER raced on the inside along the turns and was through after a half. SOCIETY set the pace from the
outset, raced in the two path along both turns and gave way down the lane. CLASSY EDITION was bumped into the first turn, raced three wide in the first
turn, was in the five path into the lane and empty in the stretch. THE RIDER OF SECRET OATH CLAIMED AN OBJECTION AGAINST PLAYED HARD
FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN BUT AFTER REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS THE CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY SUNDAY opened clear to dictate terms, was well handled and gamely led throughout. REVALITA (FR) was allowed to settle, wheeled out five
wide to make her bid, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. MISSION OF JOY settled between horses within striking distance, was caught in
tight and clipped heels leaving the three-sixteenths pole, was quickly back into stride, altered out and over the heels of REVALITA (FR) and continued on
once clear. PAPILIO (IRE) stalked the pace, launched a bold bid four wide, loomed large entering the stretch but weakened during the drive. LIGURIA was
forwardly placed inside, got through but lacked a response when called upon. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE settled saving ground, moved up leaving the turn,
was blocked from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker, tacked out a bit and made a belated improvement. CAIRO CONSORT settled off of the inside,
angled out leaving the final turn, but failed to respond when put to pressure. SABALENKA brushed the gate and was away slowly, was unhurried into stride,
shifted out four wide but passed only the tiring ones. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) failed to respond. FLASHY GEM chased three wide to the stretch and
caved. PRELIMINARY (GB) was allowed to settle, hung wide, came up empty on the second turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS tracked four wide, loomed a danger while pressing the leading trio into the far turn, bid while well in hand turning for home, kicked
clear in upper stretch, met a challenge from an outer on-charging GAMBLING GIRL in the final sixteenth and lasted to the wire. GAMBLING GIRL
exchanged contact with an inner rival at the start, then bumped an outer foe in the opening furlong, settled far back along the inside, gained in the four path
turning for home, brushed an outer SOUTHLAWN while shifting six wide entering the lane, drifted to the eight path in the aftermath, yet offered a rally
outside of foes in the final furlong, closed in on the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, produced a late bid but just came up short. THE ALYS LOOK
snagged the outer half of the gate before bumping with an outer rival upon leaving it, pursued from midpack along the inside, chased the leading quartet
from the four path around the far turn, tipped outside of them to take aim entering the lane, but only offered a mild grind in upper stretch, got outkicked by an
outer foe at the furlong grounds, kept on to vie for show in the final sixteenth and forged that advantage late. WET PAINT brushed with an inner rival at the
start, then bumped with that one in a firmer manner soon after, settled off of the pace three wide and between horses, inched closer in the three path around
the far turn, offered a grinding charge in the five path and between horses through midstretch, tipped inwardly at the sixteenth pole to bid for show inside of
a pair of rivals late but missed. DORTH VADER brushed with rivals on both sides while put to tight quarters at the start, pressed three wide, bid for the lead
between horses into the far turn, vied around that bend, but was outkicked by her outer counterpart entering the lane, maintained place through midstretch,
but lost that position entering the final sixteenth and gradually yielded between horses late. FLYING CONNECTION set the pace along the inside, vied with
a trio of outer bidders around the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. DEFINING PURPOSE stuttered a step leaving the gates, prompted the pace two
wide and between horse, vied among foes around the far turn but weakened entering the lane. MIMI KAKUSHI leaned in at the start, stalked along the
inside while well positioned, but chased the leaders under urging around the far turn and gave way turning for home. WONDER WHEEL nudged an outer
rival early on before being pinched between horses and steadying back soon after, rated at the rear along the inside, then two wide around the far turn,
shifted to the five, then six, paths in upper stretch and failed to factor between horses. SOUTHLAWN hopped a rival's heels while altering course outside of
foes around the first turn, bumped PROMISHER AMERICA in the process, pursued from midpack five wide, was urged along to sustain position around the
far turn but got brushed to the seven path by an inner rival entering the lane, and faded. AFFIRMATIVE LADY shied from inner rivals entering the first turn,
settled at the rear two wide and between horses and made little impact. AND TELL ME NOLIES was bothered by an inner troubled rival around the first turn,
bore wide in the aftermath before settling at the rear in the four path, and never got involved. BOTANICAL broke a step slow while brushing with an outer
rival at the start, then took contact from rivals on both sides in the opening furlong, laid off of the pace inside of foes while in the two path, but failed to
respond to urging around the far turn and faded. PROMISEHER AMERICA was bumped and bothered by an inner rival causing her to be rank around the
first turn, raced far back four wide, dropped back to trail at the half mile pole despite rider's urging and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE CALLING was unhurried into stride, came under a ride into the second turn, worked her way forward four wide, came six wide into the stretch
and wore down her rivals to prevail narrowly. CHARLIE'S WISH settled between horses, came five wide to make her bid, continued on well but wasn't quite
good enough. CURL GIRL opened clear to set the pace, controlled the tempo to the final furlong and succumbed. METAPHYSICAL stalked the pace, made
a bold bid four wide entering the stretch, but flattened in the drive. TOUGH LEGACY settled saving ground, moved into contention after a half, offered a mild
bid leaving the second turn but failed to sustain the drive. GUNS N' GRACES was allowed to settle, angled out entering the stretch and finished with a
belated improvement. STELLAR LADY charged the gate just prior to the start, was allowed to settle into stride, tucked in to save ground, but lacked a
response when called upon. BOSS LADY BAILEY saved ground to no avail. HAYUNEVANO was close up three wide, but came up empty between foes on
the second turn and dropped out.

HUNTRESS FOR HIRE raced back early on, was in the four path along the turn, made a bid three wide entering the lane, drove past the leaders near the
three sixteenths pole and drew away while ridden out to the finish. AMERICAN RETRO tracked the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was
between horses into the lane while making a bid but was no match for the winner and held place in the final stages. EXCELLENT QUESTION raced back
early on, was in the five path along the turn, in the six path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. COPPA GIRL was bothered at the start, raced
in the four path along the turn, in the five path into the lane and improved position. TWIN MISCHIEF was unhurried early on, bumped near the five
sixteenths pole and ran evenly in the stretch. PITCH CLOCK dueled early on two wide, was on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.
KID'S LAST LAUGH was on the inside along the turn, in the three path into the lane while no threat. NO GUILT raced in the five path along the turn, in the
seven path into the lane. CHAINA was in tight nearing the quarter pole. MO HAPPY was a tad slow at the start and never a factor. MUSICAL MISCHIEF
