Footnotes
JAN'S GIRL was unhurried in the four path, circled inner foes under coaxing from the six path around the far turn, took the lead into the stretch, drew clear
while tipping in, and was wrapped up late. GOLDCREST steadied in the two path early around the first turn, tracked in the three path down the backside,
was ridden in the two path around the far turn, and chased on from the three path in the stretch for place. TAORMINA prompted the pace in the four path,
was cued and took the lead in the three path around the far turn, was overtaken by the eventual winner at the top of the lane, and evened out in the four
path to show. ROSES ARE FREE was steadied at the start, stalked in the five path but faded into the stretch. TICKLE MY FANCY had an awkward start,
tugged along while setting the pace in the two path but yielded into the lane.

Footnotes
ASTRAL WEEKS broke awakrdly then came in and slammed TRUPIA into DANELY soon after the start, stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the
five-eighths marker, remained in range three wide around the turn, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole, quickly cleared then just lasted. DREAM OF
BLESSINGS was devoid of early pace, advanced five wide around the turn, closed outside and ran out of ground. DANLEY was bumped after the start,
raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. I FOUND IT set a pressured pace along the rail, yielded near the three-eighths pole and faded
inside. TRUPIA was slammed soon after the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. READY ON THE LINE pressed the pace two wide,
took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, led to midstretch and wilted in the final furlong.

Footnotes
WILDCAT STAR set the pace in the four path, tipped in to the three path around the turn, was roused nearing the quarter, tipped back out to the four path
into the lane, dug in thru the lane under steady urging, and just held on. LAVEAU rated in the two path, was coaxed while beginning to angle out early
around the turn and was in the eight path entering the stretch, rallied while tipping inwards for place, and just missed getting up for the win. MI CORAZON
stalked in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, bid into the lane, and kept on but hung to show. SONGTELLER broke in bothering an inner foe
at the start, raced up close in the three path, was nudged along in the four path around the turn, floated out to the six path into the lane, and finished evenly.
THE MONEY MACHINE got bumped by an outer foe at the start, tracked between foes in the three path but was one paced from the five path in the stretch.
CASTLE BORN was bothered by an outer foe at the start and brushed with an inner foe, raced wellback in the six path but was no factor from out in the nine
path in the stretch. BREAKING BULLET got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack from the four path, but faded around the
six path in the stretch. CRYPTONAIRE chased in the four path but was no menace.

Footnotes
MADEFORSUMMER pressed the pace two wide, took over early on the turn and drove clear in the lane. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER was up close inside,
steadied near the half-mile pole, was shuffled back near the five-sixteenths marker, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on outside to be clearly
second best. SUBTLE FAITH set the early pace along the rail, chased inside around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and held third.
VACATION SUITE raced greenly behind horses early, angled out nearing the five-eighths marker, bid three wide around the turn but faded in the lane. RIA
FORMOSA was outrun while racing two wide. YLANG YLANG played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
MUSICAL DESIGN brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced prominently on the outer hip of the pacesetter in the four path, was confidently handled
around the turn, floated out to the six path into the lane, drifted out while taking the lead passing the eighth pole, and held on. STARSHIP SUNRISE chased
along the inside, tipped out around the turn and was ridden in the five path into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, but just missed to finish with place
honors. PRINCESS BLAKELY steadied early, rated inside, was stymied nearing the quarter pole, coaxed from the two path into the lane, and kept on for
show. MOANAS POWER was hustled along to set the pace in the three path, under a heavy drive from the four path into the stretch, and evened out.
SIENA LADY stalked in the four path, was driven around the turn and tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, drifted out, and did not factor. GITANA
brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path and was no threat in the nine path down the lane. BRAVO ZULU tracked in the three path early
but was no menace.

FOR EVER OURS saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch, closed outside, was rapidly gaining in the final sixteenth until getting
bumped in deep stretch. BALLYHOOLY dueled two wide between foes to midstretch, continue don the left lead in the lane and stayed on well enough to
save the show. BUMBLELICIOUS dueled at the rail to midstretch and weakened. OOPSIE DOOPSIE was up close four wide and faded in the lane. RIGBY
chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. KILLARGUE'S GIRL trailed inside, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked a rally. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF FOR EVER OURS, TRAINWRECK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER stalked in the five path, ranged up under rousing in the four path around the turn, took over under a minor hand ride and was well clear in
the five path at the top of the lane, and geared down in the final sixteenth. SIMPLIFY (ARG) prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path
around the turn, shifted out to the six path into the stretch, evened out, and just held place. DIGNIFIED chased in the four path, was driven in the two path
around the turn, tipped out to the seven path in upper stretch, and finished evenly for show. MUDSHAFT tracked in the six path, was under right handed
urging from the eight path into the lane, but was no factor. PRETTY RACHEL set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead midway around the turn and
faded in the stretch. NO DECAF broke outward at the start and travelled off the pace around the seven path, but did not threaten. WINNING AT EASE
steadied at the start, rated in the five path but was no menace. CAPRIDREY bobbled slightly at the start and was always behind around the two to four
paths.

Footnotes
JOIN THE DANCE set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, drew off in upper stretch and held clear under a
drive. PARIS PEACOCK (IRE) raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and finished well to gain the place. BY ALL MEANS
(IRE) broke slowly, trailed inside, was blocked in upper stretch, swung out leaving the eighth pole and finished with interest once finally clear. PARNAC (FR)
chased the pace two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. LOVE HER LOTS saved ground in range and faded in the
lane. JUMEIRAH failed to menace while racing three and four wide. GATHER AS YOU GO broke sharply, led at the rail early, was wrangled back nearing
the first turn, angled out to prompt the pace in the three path under a firm hold for a half and weakened nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
ARMS brushed with an outer foe at the start, rated in the four path, advanced between foes rounding the turn, took the lead form the six path in upper
stretch, and held sway. FIGHT bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was stymied rounding the turn, angled out to the seven path
into the stretch, and ran on for place. LIEUTENANT STAN got pinched at the start and was prompted along in the three path, bid under a ride around the
turn and led passing the quarter pole, but was overtaken by the eventual winner while in the three path in upper stretch, and flattened in the final furlong to
show. MEXICOFFEE broke in and brushed an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path, was coaxed from the four path around the turn, fanned out to the
nine path into the stretch, and was one paced. GREENPOINT bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was ridden around the turn but
got carried out to the eight path into the lane, and did not factor. JAY'S DELIGHT trailed in the seven path early and never menaced. SECRET SOLDIER set
the pace in the two path, but lost the lead midway around the turn, and gaveway.
