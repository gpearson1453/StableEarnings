Footnotes
HAL'S DREAM was well rated inside in the down the backstretch and into the turn, couldn't find room inside, shifted out two wide, then exploded in the final
furlong to claim the win in the end. DIAMOND GRAND vied from the inside for the lead down the backstretch and on the turn, then dueled with an outer rival
heading into the stretch, inched away to gain the lead but was out finished in the end. MARTIQUE MISS chased the pace while two wide down the
backstretch and into the turn, rallied mid stretch to close willingly in the end. POETIC UNION chased the pace while three wide into the turn, then rallied in
the early stretch to close well but it wasn't enough in the end. SHEZA CAT veered in sharply at the start, then trailed behind the field, was moving up quickly
on the turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. HONEY CREEK vied for the lead while three wide, was under a strong drive throughout the turn,
then gave way in the stretch. SIMPERING SMILE vied for the lead between rivals, was in a hard drive then flattened out heading into the stretch.

Footnotes
BLING BLING BLING pressed the early pace from two wide, took the lead midway through the turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and held the
closer safe at the wire. I'M A COWBOY reserved off the early pace, split horses in the turn to move into contention, angled to the clear down the lane and
was gaining late in the drive. GUITAR BOY stalked the leaders to the head of the lane, cut the corner saving all the ground and finished well to gain the
show. TAPITURE JONES moved up the fence to duel on the lead while setting the early pace, responded when called upon but weakened late in the lane.
MY LITTLE PRINCE rated off the lead down the backside, rallied four wide at the top of the stretch, continued to drift out down the lane and made late
gains. HARD GOLD tracked the pace for a half mile making a mild bid in the turn and flattened out. MY BOY BLING trailed throughout as a non-factor.

CHIEF BRADY sped up the fence to take control shortly from the gate, shook off the challenge of the runner-up at the quarter pole and drew off in the lane
as much the best. DARYLSLITTLEDIABLO pressed the pacesetter to the head of the stretch, continued on well to hold the place in a good effort. STANS
HOME RUN tracked the leaders from the fence, was set to an early drive, kept on while rallying up the rail and just missed the place. CHAMPAGNE
STOOPER well placed early on behind the leaders, was taken wide for racing room nearing the turn and mounted a mild three wide rally. BLING'S
BELLWETHER chased the pace throughout and failed to gain ground. QUARTERBACK DAK trailed to midway in the lane and passed a tired rival down the
lane. RED SUMMERBIRD was never a factor.

Footnotes
MORO MAFIA moved up well down the early backstretch to duel for the lead while two wide into the far turn, continued to dig in gamely in the early stretch
to kick clear in the final furlong and proved best. TEXAS PRADO lead the way into te first turn, then was challenged for the lead by an outer rival around the
half pole, dueled throughout the the turn and into the early stretch but was outkicked in the end and was second best. RED DRAW raced in the middle of the
field while two wide down the first half, then rallied on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. VICTOR VALENTINO was unhurried early then trailed
behind the field into the far turn then rallied late and passed tiring foes in the lane. LEGAL EAGLE raced from the inside throughout and was no threat.
FLY'N SEXY stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, bid mildly on the far turn then tired in the late stretch. SLIM JIMMY settled behind the
field while two to three wide, then bid from the inside on the far turn and failed to rally. MORO LEGEND raced in the back of the field while three wide then
lost momentum throughout and was no menace.

Footnotes
GAMETIME GLADIATOR settled off the pace to race from between horses down the backside, swung five wide at the head of the lane to mount a strong
rally to draw away in the drive. IT'LL DO set the pace under constant pressure to upper stretch, repelled all early challenges but could not hold off the late
closer and proved second best. WHITEROSE JEWEL stalked the pace from three wide the entire trip, loomed at the head of the lane under a drive and
finished gamely. DAWSON CITY raced prominently in the first flight to the far turn, waited behind horses turning for home and finished willingly while failing
to close the gap. KERAUNOS well placed for the first three quarters along the fence, saved ground and closed with a late inside bid. NERKY ROSE raced
three wide the entire trip and failed to close ground. WILD WING dropped back to near the rear of the field leaving the first turn, swung out for the drive and
showed late interest. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ slow early to be at the back of the pack and made a mild rally late in the drive. ANOTHER JOURNEY well
placed for the first half mile and gradually gave way coming home. PROPERLY CONNECTED pressed the pace from the rail to the quarter pole and faltered
late in the stretch.

PRINCE RAMA stalked the pace while four wide, then rallied in the early stretch to duel with an inner rival in the final furlong and was up just in time to
prevail. PINKY RING BLING lead the way down the backstretch and into the turn, was confronted by an outer rival in late stretch and was out finished in the
end. MORNING SNOW stalked the pace while two wide, then rallied heading into the stretch but came up empty in the end. TOTALIZER chased the pace

Footnotes
ANNA B pressed the pace to the top of the lane, burst clear by an open margin in upper stretch and finished gamely to prevail. JUSTCAUSEICAN tracked
the dueling pacesetters while well positioned and finished full of run to be second best. HAILEY'S JEWEL reserved off the lead in the early going, made
steady progression down the lane to pick up the show. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER slow early to be near the back of the field, circled coming for home and
finished with a belated rally. SKYSPEIGHT dueled on the lead to upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN awkward leaving
the gate tossing his head about, dropped to the rear of the field and showed late interest passing tired rivals. PERSONAL ISSUES went evenly never posing
a threat. J M SKY CLASSIC rushed up to duel on the lead, battled to the top of the stretch and tired in the lane. CRANKY SHEILA dropped back entering
the turn and finished as a non-factor.
