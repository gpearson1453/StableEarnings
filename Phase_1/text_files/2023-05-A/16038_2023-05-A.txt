Footnotes
ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN showed speed early and sent out for the lead, took control of the pace while saving ground, maintained comfortable fractions
was able to go wire to wire. MAGGIE'S RETURN settled off the pace in hands early on, then started to gain ground and pain momentum after the half mile
marker, continued to gain ground as she circled the field in the turn, set her sites on the leader and gamely tried to run ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN down in
the stretch but couldn't get there in time and too second place honors. SUMMER IS HOT broke and settled along the fence in a stalking position while being
mid pack, saved ground and waws cued at the three eighths pole where she responded and starting gaining on the leaders, once she entered the stretch
she started to drift out badly and ran flat. CUSTOM GUITAR was off a step slow, traveled out into the six path and stayed clear, launched a bid at the three
eighths pole, circled the field through the turn and was driven into the stretch but to no avail. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH stalked the early leaders from the three
path, raced in between horses, edged out a bit at the half mile pole, and faded. MOODY RAFAELA stalked the leader from the four path, gave way.

Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT vied for the lead was able to take the lead and attend the pace while saving ground, and drew off in the stretch uncontested for the easy
win. TURN ON THE MAGIC raced off the pace early while saving ground, angled out at the five sixteenth pole to launch bid, set sites on the leaders and
was encouraged into the stretch and down the lane finished strongly but it was not enough today. MEDITATE stalked the leader from the three path until the
middle of the second turn, launched a bid and challenged the leader leaving the turn, battled for a few strides and looked like a winner, then gave way in the
stretch. TEMPRANO made no impact. WAR COUNT broke awkwardly and was not a factor. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) was no menace.

PRADO'S PRIORITY vied for the early lead and took control of the pace while racing from the three path, continued with pressure from a set on the inside,
out ran that set and was met with a challenge from an outside bidder, was able to repel that rival and drew off gamely. LUNAR MODULE settled on a loose
rein in the four path, was cued at the three eighths pole where he responded with a quick turn of foot was able to clear the rest of the field and challenged
for the lead by the five sixteenth pole, battled into the furlong grounds but had no final kick and had to settle for second today. FIESTY FIST vied for the
early lead and was pushed to stay forwardly placed, gamely raced in between to other foes driving for the lead, was not able to keep pace with the early
leaders into the stretch, but maintained position for third through the rest of the race. HOSTILE AFLEET was allowed to settle of the pace while racing in the
five path, was asked to move up at the half mile marker, continued to gain ground while still in the five path, built up momentum into the stretch, launched a
bid at the quarter pole, where he found his best stride but had to much work to do. CREOLE CHARLIE hesitated at the start and made no impact.
MORRICONE vied for the lead early was pushed to maintain forward positioning from the rail, and tired early.

Footnotes
EAGLEOVERTHEMOON broke for the seven post position very sharply, was fast into the the first turn and had to go five wide, settled into a set of three at
the six furlong pole, these three set the pace until the half mile marker, when EAGLEOVERTHEMOON shook one of the inside threats, she shook the other
challenger at the three eights pole, where she drew off and dazzled with a brilliant performance for the win. CAJUN ACES matched strides in between two
other competitors for the first half mile, while racing in the three and four path, kept on with the eventual winner until the three eighths pole then gave way.
SHE'S TAKIN OVER stumbled terribly at the start, got herself balanced, was given time to find her stride while running along the rail, had a ground saving
trip and was able to pass tired rivals in the stretch. SUE'S LITTLE ZING vied for the lead, pushed to maintain her forward position, hooked two other rivals
for half of a mile tired. TRACK QUEEN raced mid pack, off the pace and faded in the stretch. GRAEME'S DEAL showed little.

Footnotes
NONEYA settled into the middle of the field very early on but then started gaining ground with every stride as she worked on the rail, took command by the
half mile marker, continued to save ground and drew off in the stretch where she drifted out a bit but she was so much the best it did not make any
difference, was able to win convincingly and put forth a game effort. LAKE MARIE vied for the early lead was sent and took command of the fractions until
she was collared at the half mile marker by the eventual winner, continued to race with conviction but was second best today. CANADA'S CUSTOMS was
off a bit slow, moved up into contention while in the four path, was ready to launch a bid going into the turn and had to check, then had no kick after that.
DROP DEAD SEXY showed natural speed early on, raced in the four path willingly on a loose rein, maintained a forwardly placed position, was cued at the
three eighths pole and launched a mild bid but to no avail. SPEEDY DUDETTE raced four wide and made no impact.

Footnotes
KINGOFBROKENHEARTS settled off the pace and race near the back early from the six path, was encouraged to advance and responded with a nice turn
of foot, through the turn and was kept to task through the stretch and was able to catch the early leaders late and take the win. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN
raced off the pace from the four path, was challenged by rivals from the inside and outside, through the turn and into the deep stretch, where he repelled
both of those challenges but was caught late by a rival closing on the far out side, had to settle for second best today but still ran a game race. CLEAR AS A
BELE broke a step slow, angled out six wide, launched a wide bid and challenged for the lead, was in a four way battle but gave way in the stretch. FORTY
THREE was off the pace early and ran even. TWO B vied for the early lead, set the first fraction along the rail, steadily faded after that. CHROMPTON was
never involved. ORDER UP was mid pack ea, moved up into contention at the quarter pole and faltered.
