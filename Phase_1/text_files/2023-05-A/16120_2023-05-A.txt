MONIKER broke out, set the pace, was under pressure late and held on gamely. WATFORD held a good position, got through along the rail on the turn,
went willingly to the wire but couldn't get by the winner. RYDERS UP went four wide on the turns, closed steadily and got up late for show. DAN WHO was
never far back, raced outside, rallied five wide on the turn, threatened for the lead, didn't have enough late and was caught for third. CLUE stalked the pace,
rallied three across into the turn to loom a threat, had little left and fell back. GOLDEN CARACAL chased pace, challenged between horses along the
backstretch, fell back and was checked on the turn and stopped. WHO'S ON THE RUN broke in and was steadied at the start, fell far back to trail and was
not urged late.

dropped back and finished second best. REALLY A STORM was never far back, raced outside, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed to earn
show. WE WANT ANOTHER was void of early speed, found her best stride late and was gaining for third. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE saved ground to the turn,
angled out, swung nine wide and failed to rally. QUEEN MYSTIC was off slowly, saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn, shifted out and lacked a bid.
SPARKLE IN THE SKY broke awkwardly, bid inside entering the stretch and came up empty. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE raced wide and was through early.

pace to the second turn, was outclosed and no match for the winner. CARMON'S DANCE pressed the pace to the second turn, leveled off and held for
show. LITTLE SAMURAI lagged early, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. SHAKE RAG was unprepared at the start, broke
out, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. SHORT POCKETS was not a factor. RUN LIKE KATE stalked the pace to the second turn and tired.

Footnotes
MONEY LENDER bumped at the start, was unhurried early, saved ground, angled out, rallied turn, swung seven wide, closed and wore down his rivals to
get up near the wire. TEQUILA challenged three across on the backstretch, dueled for the lead, inched clear late and was caught in the final strides.
CLOWN OIL vied two across, hung late and held safely for show. JON L was sent to the front to vie to late stretch and faltered in a good effort. RIO HATO
raced mid pack, bid and didn't have enough late. EVIL ROCKS showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. TOM'S MOON bumped and was
squeezed at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. QUANTUM BULL was not a factor. EL GRAPPLER veered out at the start and was outrun.
ABRIERWIN bumped at the start and was outrun in a wide trip.
