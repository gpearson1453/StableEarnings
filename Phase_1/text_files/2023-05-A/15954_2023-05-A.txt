wide, took over leaving the quarter pole, led to midstretch and was clearly second best. CATATUMBO LIGHTNIN dueled inside to upper stretch and held
well enough for the show. REDJACK dueled two wide between rivals to upper stretch, faded in the lane and was vanned off. MOUSEFAST failed to menace
while racing three wide. SEIZE THE BREEZE chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. DRAMA'S GOLD played no factor while racing two
wide. PRESTON MURRAY trailed outside. PER RULING #2023-031317 FROM THE FLORIDA GAMING CONTROL COMMISSION, CORPORATE

Footnotes
STILETTO HEELS broke well and set the pace inside, was under a nudge around the turn, cued to open up from the two path into the lane, and driven
clear. CHEROKEE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was hustled along from up close in the three path, bumped with the same outer foe into the turn,
was in the four path at the top of the stretch, and held place. SCOOTALOO bumped with an inner foe at the start, was prompted along in the four path, then
bumped between foes into the turn and steadied just after, was under coaxing from the six path into the stretch, angled inwards and kept on to get up for
show. AMIDST WAVES stalked in the five path, bumped with an inner foe into the turn, was under urging while tipping out top the seven path into the lane,
but evened out. MY SWEETHEART DANI chased along the inside but was no factor from the three path in the stretch. MISS ATHLETIC reared at the start
and always trailed.

Footnotes
LEE ANN'S WARRIOR raced prominently in the six path, bid from the four path around the turn, sustained that bid and was in the five path at the top of the
lane, drifted out under left handed urging but stuck a head in front passing the eighth pole, and inched away late. ASSERT DOMINANCE stalked in the five
path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, ran on to get up for place late. GRAND PLAYER rated in the three path, was under coaxing while
shifting out to the five path into the stretch, angled in just past the eighth pole, and kept on to get up for show. LOST A LEGEND bobbled at the start, set the
pace in the two path was ridden along while tipping out to the four path into the lane, fought on under steady urging but lost the lead just before the eighth
pole, and was caught on both sides late to miss minor rewards. SIR KAHN had his head turned at the start, broke slowly, and always trailed.

STERLING HARMONY stalked the pace in the two path, tipped three wide in upper stretch, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole an drove clear.
EIGHTNINEGO set a pressured pace in the two path, was no match for the winner late but dug in gamely for the place. BEGANINGREENPOINT dueled in
the three path and was outfinished. SMOOTH MOTION chased the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. ATTENTI MANDATORY lagged
in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ROCKY CHITU chased the pace four wide and faded in the drive.

GLIDER bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, ranged up around the final turn, swung out to the seven path at the top of the lane,
angled inwards while drawing alongside the pacesetter to bid passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. MEGACITY set the pace in the two path, was ridden
along the inside into the stretch, lost the lead just past the eighth pole, but kept on to hold place. BEMMA'S BOY bumped with an outer foe at the start, was
unhurried in the three path, lost ground to tip out under coaxing around the final turn, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, and ran on down the center
for show. SWING LOW rated in the three path, was under urging from the four path entering the stretch, but got stymied and brushed with an outer foe
passing the sixteenth pole, and was unable to factor. SURROGATE raced up close while under a hold in the three path early, was driven in the two path
around the final turn, but flattened in the stretch. SHADIZAAR trailed in the four path early, tipped out to the five path down the backside, advanced outside
of foes and was in the six path turning into the lane, drifted in and brushed with an inner foe passing the sixteenth pole, and weakened. BAILADOR stalked
in the two path but was empty along the inside into the lane.

SOUPER LEGACY stalked the pace two wide early, pressed down the backtretch, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear while drifting out
under right-handed urging in upper stretch and widened. SMART STRIKER raced off the pace two and three wide and ran on to gain the place late. J P
HELLISH set the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole and kept on well enough to preserve the show. UNCLE ARMANDO failed to
menace while racing three wide. VALIANT AVENGER played no factor while racing two and three wide. APOCALYPSO chased the pace inside and came
up empty in the lane. PLUMA ROJA was outrun inside. KEANU steadied at the start, raced in range three wide and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
BIG MARTINI broke in and bumped with an inner foe, pushed the pace in the three path, was driven around the turn and stuck a head in front passing the
quarter, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, gradually drifted in against left handed encouragement and brushed with an inner rival in the final
sixteenth, and held on. HAPPY RUNNER broke out and bumped an outer foe, set a contested pace in the two path, was headed around the turn, lost the
lead and was under left handed urging into the lane, fought on from the rail into the final furlong, but was in tight and brushed by an outer rival in the final
sixteenth to place. DANZIG CHIPS broke slowly, stalked in the three path, was coaxed rounding the turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, flattened
out in the final furlong, but held show. VANISHING INTEREST chased in the five path, was cued right handed midway around the turn, tipped out to the
seven path into the lane, finished evenly, and just missed getting up for show. JACKSON'S WEBB trailed in the two path but never threatened from inside
down the stretch. CHROME GHOST tracked inside but was empty from the four path in the stretch. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND OBJECTION
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF HAPPY RUNNER, BIG MARTINI WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING INTO THE PATH OF AND
BRUSHING HAPPY RUNNER IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH COSTING A CHANCE OF BETTER PLACING.
