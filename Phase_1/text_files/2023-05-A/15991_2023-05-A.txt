Footnotes
QUEENSCABALLO gained the early lead and inside position going to the first turn, was challenged by and then cleared by P R ODDS SETTER in the far
turn but rallied back well in the lane from outside to be going clear at the end. P R ODDS SETTER prompted the pace outside the winner to bid and edge
clear through the far turn then could not withstand that one late. ZIBBY TOO moved three and four wide to gain position in the far turn but could not threaten
the top pair. JUDGE ON THE RUN saved ground and failed to mount a rally. SING CHARMER SING chased the pace three to four wide then tired from five
wide into the lane.

THUNDERSTORMACOMIN rallied inside rivals about the three path going to the far turn, bid into the lane and outhustled LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT late.
LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT tracked the lead pair four wide to bid into the far turn then was outfinished by the winner through the lane. BER MIS BOY moved up
three and four wide going to the far turn, angled in nearing the lane but could not threaten the top pair. BUY NOW was on the pace three and four wide to
the far turn and weakened into the lane. WENT HOME saved ground and lacked a rally. WHISKEYSPENT was along the inside and tired. WANTABE was
on the lead about the three path after drifting out leaving the first turn, took back off the lead and soon bolted to the outside fence in the far turn then hurdled
a fence in the chute and ran off into the barn area.

SANCOCHO (MEX) stalked the pace in a closely grouped field four to five wide, moved in through the far turn to rally up the rail in the lane and slipped
through late to be up nearing the wire. FAYETTE WARRIOR made the pace on a short lead racing out about the three to four path then could not contain
the winner late. TIGER THE MAN was with the lead group four wide and could not produce the needed late bid. JIMBO'S BIZ settled in reach of the pace
three wide, angled out in the far turn to move five wide into the lane but could not threaten late. KING OF ANYTHING saved ground and lacked a solid
closing bid. MASTERPIECE DAY was six and seven wide in the first turn, remained wide in the far turn and the lane and weakened. MY TRUE REWARD
was with the lead group three to four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
PERVASIVE settled off the pace three or four wide, moved to challenge going to the far turn outside the lead pair, bid turning for home and edged clear late.
SUEZ saved ground back off the pace to the far turn, angled out nearing the lane to rally five wide and closed to just gain the place. AKHNAS saved ground
in reach of the pace, angled out into the lane and rallied but was outnodded for the place. LITTLE TOE angled out to challenge on the lead through the
second turn, continued to late in the far turn and came up empty in the drive. OH SNAP tracked the pace from three wide and weakened. STREET N SOUR
made the pace on a short lead racing out from the rail and weakened. GOD'S PICK was not a factor. SILVER MAKER was always back three wide.

Footnotes
WAGER NO MO stalked the pace racing out from the rail, moved three and four wide to bid into the final turn and edge clear nearing the lane then held safe
late. SCOOTER'S BOY settled back off the pace three wide, rallied four wide through the last turn and continued well in the lane but could not reach the
winner. SHWEET PERSUASION was on the pace four wide to gain clear into the second turn and continue about the three path, made the running to the
last turn and came up empty in the drive. G'S TURN stalked the pace in good position inside but weakened. STAGE DOOR angled out to move three and
four wide going up the backstretch but lacked a solid closing bid. FAKE SOLUTION followed the pace three wide and weakened. YHA YHA was three and
four wide in reach of the pace and weakened. GAINER was in reach three to four wide for a half, dropped back going to the far turn and pulled up nearing
the lane but walked off under his own power.
