Footnotes
ICE CUBE BABY broke a step slow, recovered and was under firm rating three wide and between rivals, steadied back off foes nearing the turn, angled out,
came back to advance four wide into the stretch, sustained under a drive, took command outside rivals inside the furlong grounds and drew clear. STORM
RATE , between foes early, secured the inside and disputed the pace leaving the far turn, backed off rivals past the five sixteenths, came back along the rail
in mid stretch and churned on willingly to gain the place. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN took command soon after the start, set pressured pace between rivals
leaving the half mile marker, battled to the inside of THAT'S SOME KISS into the lane, stayed on between runners leaving mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. THAT'S SOME KISS , four wide outside rivals advancing into the turn, vied three deep leaving the far turn, gained a slim lead past the five
sixteenths, maintained a tenuous lead leaving the furlong grounds then weakened late. MYSISTERNANCY , forwardly placed to the inside of runners early
on, was shuffled back near the three eighths and dropped back to last, swung out for the drive and found more through the final furlong. FIVECOMMATWO ,
between rivals past the five eighths, chased off the rail mid turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TULCHAN stalked the pace two wide down the backstretch, secured command mid way on the far turn then steadily drew off while ridden out. MARYLAND
MOON four wide the first turn, chased the winner while three wide on the far turn, was no threat to that one in the drive but willingly held the place.
NORTHERN RYE , in the four path entering the first turn, was patiently handled down the backstretch and on the far turn, swung outside in mid stretch and
had a slight rally. RECTOR chased the pace, moved out entering the stretch, lugged in in upper stretch and flattened out. NORTHERN TICK TOCK , in
close quarters while in the three path entering the first turn, was not a factor. STELLAR LUTE , jostled into the first turn, raced four wide the far turn and was
not a factor. CURTEIS , outrun, raced widest on the far turn. MONEY ROOM , shuffled back soon after the start, was jostled entering the first turn then was
not a factor. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS set the pace along the inner rail and weakened on the far turn. GOLDEN WILDCAT , five deep entering the first
turn, was outrun. An objection by the rider of STELLAR LUTE against NORTHERN TICK TOCK for alleged interference entering the first turn was not
allowed.

Footnotes
NASHVEGAS saved ground while not too far back, crept up along the rail approaching the stretch, slipped through continuing progress past the three
sixteenths, took over with a furlong to go and drew out under a steady drive. BERNIE'S ON FIRE , away alertly, was rated back off the hustled leader
leaving the five eighths, moved up and engaged from the outside leaving the far turn, dueled into the stretch, took a slim lead three wide in upper stretch,
wandered outward near the furlong grounds, corrected soon after, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. CALL ME MAESTRO broke outward corrected
and edged up three deep to stalk the pace, shifted wider in the drive and came back on with good energy. PELOTA broke a step slow, saved ground while
outrun early, eased out for the drive, edged up between foes leaving mid stretch but needed more. TOM TERRIFIC chased in the clear, raced three wide
nearing the quarter pole but failed to make an impact. LOADED SNIPER was hard sent to a clear lead, dropped in to set the pace, was joined leaving the far
turn, sparred past the five sixteenths, came off the rail into the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded.

HERE AND NOFURTHER , off slowly, raced in the two path between horses around the turn, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, took
command near the eighth pole then drew off. A THOUSAND IDOLS hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch, was no match for the winner but
held the place. BUBBA CHROME disputed the pace two wide around the turn and gave way in the drive. MARCUS JUNIUS saved ground around the turn
while chasing the pace, swung outside in upper stretch and weakened. DA BEERS ON ICE stumbled leaving the starting gate, was no factor and raced
along the inner rail most of the trip. CUP MATCH , checked in tight quarters about a furlong after the start, advanced three deep on the turn and faltered in
the drive.

behind foes in upper stretch, altered to the rail leaving the quarter pole, moved through to the inside of two rivals to take over a furlong out, spurted away
under right handed asks soon after then eagerly widened under a mild drive. LADY JEAN stalked the pace, shifted four wide into the lane, bid to challenge

swung out very wide for the final furlong and finished well. RAISE YOUR GAME saved ground off the early pace, eased out in upper stretch, edged up
between runners leaving mid stretch then was out kicked late. KLAYTON'S KANDY , four wide with pursuit, circled into the stretch but lacked a serious
finish. CANADIAN GINGER steadied soon after the break, recovered and moved up in hand while saving ground, slipped through to engage the leader then
take over in upper stretch, briefly went clear, was taken on from both sides in mid stretch and weakened through the final sixteenth. BATH AND TENNIS

RESPECTFULLY was hustled up outside rivals leaving the five eighths pole and gained a forward spot, bid four deep leaving the three eighths, wrested
command from PROPER ATTIRE leaving the three sixteenths, kicked away inside the furlong grounds and held sway while kept to task. FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO , two wide and off the early pace, swung out very wide leaving the three sixteenths, finished up with good energy and earned the place.
BRZINA rated off heels soon after the break, advanced four wide into the stretch, chased on her left lead leaving the eighth pole, switched over to her
correct lead for the final sixteenth and churned on. A GIRL NAMED JAC broke slowly, raced well back while saving ground into the turn, stayed inside into
the stretch, eased out then back in and offered a mild kick. MY LOVELY GIRL rated in range and off the rail, bid three wide between rivals leaving the three
eighths, sparred to the head of the lane, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. PROPER ATTIRE rated close up along the rail, slipped through
leaving the far turn and poked a head in front, battled inside a pair of rivals into the lane, ceded command heading to mid stretch and gave way. LA FAMILIA
sped clear early while two wide, was hooked from both sides leaving the three furlong marker, chased the dueling leaders into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
THOMAS SHELBY , confidently handled while attending the pace outside YOUNGEST OF FIVE, moved on near even terms leaving the far turn, sparred
under rating into the lane, responded when roused inside the quarter pole, spurted clear soon after, braced for an outside threat from GALERIO, kept on
resolutely under a drive and held firm. GALERIO , well placed three wide just off the embattled leaders, was under coaxing mid turn, circled four wide into
the lane, ranged up to loom a solid presence in mid stretch, continued with good energy but was kept at bay. ONE TEN settled outside rivals, was under
pressure three deep mid turn and got past a fading rival for the show. YOUNGEST OF FIVE took over leaving the chute, set a pressured pace towards the
inside, came off the rail dueling into the lane, continued with effort past mid stretch then weakened in the final sixteenth. BOBBY G edged up inside nearing
the far turn and stalked, failed to kick on under asking past the three eighths and retreated. SOUTHERN DISTRICT stumbled at the break, moved up into
the far turn, chased between rivals mid turn, lacked a punch into the lane and dropped back.

Footnotes
BUNKER HILL , reserved between horses down the backstretch, raced in the three path entering the far turn, moved to the four path entering the stretch,
closed steadily and was up late. ARROGANT RIDER lacked speed, raced outside horses down the backstretch, was very wide turning for home, rallied late
and bumped with ELFUEGONASBRILANTE approaching the finish. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE , along the inner rail entering the far turn, eased out for the
drive, rallied between horses and bumped with ARROGANT RIDER when drifting out in the late going. INSPIRED IRISH prompted the pace outside
SCORESTOSETTLE down the backstretch, disposed of that one leaving the far turn, opened up in mid stretch and weakened late. EMOTIONAL RESCUE ,
never far back, showed a mild, late move. SCORESTOSETTLE set a slow pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. MOONSET stalked the
pace down the backstretch, was well placed three deep leaving the far turn then faltered the final furlong. STARSTREET raced between horses most of the
trip and lacked a rally. LONG RAP SHEET lost ground both turns and faltered. POINT US HOME , outrun, was eased.
