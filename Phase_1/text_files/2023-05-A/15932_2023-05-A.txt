Footnotes
BLAME TERI hesitated at the break, advanced from outside, began to angle in nearing the bend, took the turn in hand, widened command in the lane and
received mild urging late. W W VALID vied for the early lead outside DART ATTACK, angled in at the seven-sixteenths marker, moved clear for second on
the turn and was clearly second best. DART ATTACK contested the early pace from inside, was checked when her path was compromised at the
seven-sixteenths pole, altered out some and ran evenly the rest of the way. PRINCESS RULER was a brief contender between horses but faded from path
three on the bend. PRINCESS MAE prominent just outside PRINCESS RULER on the backstretch, also gave way on the turn. The rider of DART ATTACK
lodged an objection claiming interference from W W VALID into the turn and W W VALID lodged an objection alleging interference from BLAME TERI near
the seven-sixteenths pole. After their review, the stewards did not uphold W W VALID'S interference claim but disqualified the latter for interference to DART
ATTACK and placed W W VALID third.

Footnotes
READTHETRANSCRIPT stalked the early speed from outside, took the bend four wide, gained the lead when asked at the top of the lane, opened up under
hand urging and maintained control under confident handling. ORBITAL STARR never far back, advanced from path three on the turn, altered outside
WILDWOODS DREAM upper stretch, rallied belatedly the last eighth but swept past CAMARGO for second with sixty yards to go. CAMARGO disputed the
pace just outside STORMIN EL PRADO, could not stay with READTHETRANSCRIPT in the stretch and began to wear down in the waning yards.
STORMIN EL PRADO displayed early speed from inside but began to yield after three furlongs. INDEFENSIBLE was a brief factor but faded from inside on
the bend. WILDWOODS DREAM advanced between horses to vie for the lead three wide nearing the turn, began to falter leaving the turn, fell midsretch
and was vanned off.

of the others. FRONTANA bumped from the rear at the break, failed to menace while saving ground, passed inside tired ones upper stretch, leveled off in
the late going but narrowly held his position. CITY POSITION chased from just off the inside, angled out upper stretch, squeezed through between horses to

SWISHAWISH prominent from inside, was boxed in behind MAJESTIC ATTACK into the turn, steadied soon after, altered out three wide, engaged A
MERRY HEART into the lane, battled that one under nearly all hand urging and shook free inside the final sixteenth. A MERRY HEART pressed the early
pace, went for the lead two wide on the turn, had the advantage nearing the quarter pole, was challenged from outside into the stretch, fought gamely but
did not have enough left in the waning yards. EMPTY HOLSTER crowded from the rear at the start, raced in contention from just off the inside, altered
outside SWISHAWISH upper stretch, took over third, could not close the gap on the top pair but was easily best of the rest. MAJESTIC ATTACK was sent to
a clear early lead, challenged from outside on the bend and began to yield leaving the turn. W W TRAFALGAR broke a bit outward, was steadied, soon
forwardly placed from inside but gave way leaving the bend.

Footnotes
BIG SALLY shared the early lead outside NAPABIT, took over when asked leaving the bend, drew clear under urging and was kept to task to the waning
yards. NAPABIT broke on top, disputed the pace from inside, did not stay with BIG SALLY upper stretch, altered outside the latter with a furlong to go, could
not close the gap on the leader but proved easily second best. LUTION chased from inside, swung out five wide for the stretch run and gained third in the
waning yards. MISS MIA bumped solidly shortly after the break, moved toward the inside with four furlongs to go, came off the rail slightly for the stretch run,
edged ahead for third, fought inside REBA ATTACK to keep her position the final eighth but was outfinished for show money. REBA ATTACK was hustled
along and taken toward the outside early on, in path three on the bend, floated out further entering the lane, dueled for third but did not have enough left in
the late going. GOLDICAT bumped, forced in and squeezed between rivals briefly after the break, was checked, altered her path twice on the backstretch,
three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning widest for the stretch run and finished evenly. BLUE EVEN SCORE was away somewhat slowly and failed to
menace in a ground-saving trip. GABRIELLA ATTACK lugged in just after the start, bumped solidly with GOLDICAT and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BERNIE LOMAX rated in the second flight from outside, went for the lead on the bend, took the advantage with two and a half furlongs to go, angled in
leaving the turn, gradually drifted out as he drew off in the lane and maintained full control under steady handling. FASTNFURIOUS unruly in the gate, took
a clear lead from inside nearing the end of the first furlong, was challenged on the turn, could not stay with BERNIE LOMAX leaving the bend but kept
second under urging. CHEEKERS in contention early, failed to keep up widest on the turn, lacked a significant stretch bid but got up for third in the waning
yards. INSIDE THE CIRCLE broke on top, was soon in the second flight between rivals, came into the stretch three wide and slowly wore down for the drive.
KANITHAPPEN chased from not far off the inside and had no late bid. VALIANTLY DISCREET awkward at the break, was prominent from inside for three
furlongs but gave way soon after that.

Footnotes
LICHITA broke on top, shared the lead from between rivals, gained the rail into the bend, floated out some leaving the turn, moved clear under a drive in the
lane and maintained control while kept to task to the wire. MY MORNING GAL in contention early between rivals, was four wide on the turn, forced out to
stay clear of ONERY ANGEL upper stretch, rallied in the late going and took over second with seventy yards left. ORNERY ANGEL prominent just inside
MY MORNING GAL, stayed in path three on the bend, drifted out upper stretch, kept a straight path inside the last eighth, closed the gap on the leader in
the late going but lacked the needed late kick. HELEN MAE'S SONG soon vied for the lead outside LICHITA , could not stay with that one leaving the turn
and gradually wore down deep stretch. ROMANTIC BEAST caught in traffic shortly after the break, was settled, two wide on the turn, swung out to path four
entering the stretch, lodged her bid, altered in a for a clear path with a sixteenth left and continued to close the gap on the front runner in the late going.
WILDCAT BOBBIE widest of all throughout, failed to menace. PALACE MAGIC in tight from inside early, dropped back nearing the bend, advanced just off
the inside on the turn then leveled off for the drive. RARE ACTION ATTACK showed little. ABBMAR gradually angled toward the rail as she raced in
contention on the backstretch then gave way from inside on the turn.
