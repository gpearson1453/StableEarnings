Footnotes
TWO JET fell back after breaking with the field, moved along while being asked midway through the turn, angled out three wide turning for home, closed
with good resolve to be in time while widest of the first flight at the wire. GOLD PLUS away in good order, cleared before a quarter along the inside, dueled
midway from the turn through upper stretch, headed past the furlong marker, failed to contain the winner at the end, battled back in game fashion to annex
the place while continuing closest to the inside. EXPECT A DANCER broke on top, chased the runner up the opening quarter, moved up to duel with that
one in the two path, put a head in front approaching the furlong grounds, also failed to hold the winner safe late, outkicked for the second spot while
between rivals at the wire. SISTER SEEK within striking distance early outside, floated out to be four wide by the winner exiting the turn, went evenly to the
wire in lacking a late response. MALLY'S MONSOON last to leave, failed to menace. MYSTIC CREED was finished early while racing well wide.

Footnotes
LONG ARROW settled off the pace, asked along turn, moved out a bit for the drive, outside bid, took over, drew off while drifting in. SABER STORM broke
alertly, cleared soon after while in the three path, continued show the way through the turn well off the rail, briefly responded when confronted by the winner
when straightened for home, proved no match the final furlong, clearly second best. OUT MAKING TREBLE raced in mid pack while outside up the
backstretch, four wide when still in the second flight turn, flat through the lane, best of rest. UNBRIDLED PULPIT last to leave, void of early foot, steered out
widest for the drive, improved position while finding best stride too late. PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER prompted the pace inside, closest by midway on the turn,
had little left for the drive. C. F. CONGRESS chased the pace for four furlongs off the inside, retreated through the stretch. CARLOS'S MAMA remained
back in failing to threaten. MISTA VALENTINE stopped after a half, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
BOURBON DAY close from the start, dueled up front in the two path through the first turn, continued to alternate for the advantage into the far turn, set
down entering the stretch, kicked strongly clear to be much the best. UP N GONE behind the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued to
maintained contact with the leaders the middle half, lodged a bid for the second spot in midstretch, no threat to the winner while holding sway for the place.
CREEKSIDE broke on top, set or forced the pace along the inside, continued to duel the middle half, could not keep pace with the winner through the
stretch, outkicked for the second spot. HE GOTS TO GO behind the first flight while racing outside, gout out, six wide into the lane, went evenly to thge wire.
BOLT FROM ABOVE off a bit slow, steadied early, raced well back, picked off a tiring rival or two while never a factor. SPICE OF MY LIFE broke back and
made little impact. LORD HELP ME bothered early while four wide into the first turn, remained well back.

Footnotes
FORT BONZ off a step slow, lacked speed near the back, continued to lack speed into the far turn, came five wide for the drive, steered out sharply aroung
a rival approaching midstretch, lugged in badly when continuing to advance past the furlong pole, was righted, closed with good determination to be up in
time with a surge at the wire. MR ELVIN within striking distance, continued to save ground while heading up the second flight in the final turn, tipped out
three wide turning for home, bid past the furlong marker, led late, could not hold off the winner, clearly second best. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS six wide into the
first turn when parked wide, angled in a bit to track the pace up the backstretch, outside bid into the lane, held a slight lead a furlong out, weakened in the
late going but managed to save the show. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER in mid pack while racing off the inside, roused three wide for the drive, went one paced to
the wire in lacking a closing response. MONITOR MILLS broke well set a pressured pace along the inside, gradually faded in the run to the wire. TIN
DELAY broke back, lacked speed for six furlongs, improved position through some traffic while not dangerous. HOPE FOR CHANGE void of speed,
remained back into the lane,passed tiring rivals while also never posing a serious threat. GOTTATAKEHIMTO steadied in traffic through the first turn,
settled, came five wide into the lane, failed to rally. GENERAL EISENHOWER in the main body well out in the strip and five wide first turn, raced five wide
through the second bend, failed to muster a closing kick. STONE ALLIANCE pressed while four wide early first turn, continued to apply pressure
backstretch, gave way. FOLLOWING A STEWARD'S INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
STARBUCK LUCK with the pace from the start after breaking on top, edged out to a larger lead by late in the turn, extended that advantage through the
middle part of the stretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. BOURN pressed the issue up the backstretch three wide and between horses, chased
the winner into and through upper stretch while remaining inb the three path, coming late to close the gap on the winner late. PUZZLING PRIORITY last to
leave, lacked speed in trailing, improved inside of several rivals entering the stretch along the rail, continued while encountering some traffic past the furlong
marker, also closing the gap on the winner late, not enough for the place. LAURIEANN prompted the pace while four wide and between horses into and
through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. FIRE OF GOLD vied between rivals outside the winner for three furlongs and began to weaken. BIND ON
EARTH pressed the issue up front while widest of the first flight, six to five wide into the turn, also gave way when the real running began turning for home.
SUMMERTIME BANDIT forward in some traffic early, steadied from between horses with a half mile remaining fell back and lacked a bid. CRESCENT
LACE within striking distance, five wide into the turn, checked up in tight quarters, fell back and did not recover.

Footnotes
JAMAICAN ME in the second flight outside exiting the chute, asked three wide turn, bid between horses into the stretch, edged slowly clear under continued
firm handling. PEANUT N IKE forwardly placed outside, four wide when within striking distance turn, challenged outside the winner into the stretch,
outkicked by that one late, clearly second best. SILVER CHALICE reluctant to load, broke well, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, offered brief
resistance to the top two upper stretch, proved no match for that pair the final furlong, narrowly lasted for the show. DEMON HUNTER chased the leader out
of the chute toward the inside, fell back a bit through the turn, went evenly through the stretch to miss the show. R T'S D'ORO lacked speed, raced four wide
through the turn, displayed some mild interest to improve position slightly. PERFECT STRIKE in the second flight up the backstretch while between horses
and inside the winner, gave way after a half. INSPECTOR ED made little impact while racing toward the inside. K V TARGET last to leave, raced well back
and outside, four to five wide exiting the turn, failed to rally. OLE STUD MUFFIN fell back, trailed while five wide through the turn to be always outrun.

Footnotes
HALF PAGE outrun early while outside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, late push to be in time and edging clear late. DEBBIES
PASSAGE away in good order, duel up front through some quick early fractions, put the other speed away into the lane, well clear past the furlong marker,
could not contain the winner while drifting out late. BUILDING HOME broke well, raced closest to the dueling leaders into the turn, continued to pursue that
pair through the bend, lacked a significant closing response, narrowly held the show. MUCHMORETHANREADY broke back, lacked speed off the inside,
began to move four wide midway on the turn, continued with good energy the wire while too late for the show. SHESABEAUTYDANCER dueled up front
through those quick early fractions, first to blink entering the stretch inside. LONESHILOHSPECIAL went one paced while three wide in lacking a closing
response. CHICKIETOWN STAR last away, never threatened. SHO NUFF fractious in the gate, raced in mid pack early, faded. CUSTOM DESIGN in the
second flight early, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
ST JOE in the second flight outside outside, came four wide for the drive, outside bid with less than a furlong remaining, brushed late, up late to prove
narrowly best. HARD KINGS lacked speed up the backstretch three wide, moved out, five wide into the lane, rallied, late surge to be in time for the place
spot late. HALF CRAZY forwardly placed, raced three wide through the turn, bid between rivals late, fell back, came back for the show. CHECKULATER
pace inside, continued to show the way through the turn, extended bit late in the turn, lugged out late and faltered. ASTROLOGY WONOWON broke out,
asked for run in the turn, asked in the two path turn, improved position. GONE SOLUTION pressed the issue early, fell back a bit past the furlong marker,
steered in and went flat to the wire. CHIPEEE fell well back after the start, continued to lack speed through the turn, improved through traffic while racing a
bit greenly. COUNT ON RAIN forwardly placed in the two path early, dropped inside late turn and tired. ANGOLA VACATION devoid of early foot, steered in
stretch, failed to menace. UNCLE CHAN mid pack outside, five to six wide turn, faded. WILD FIST was never close. MAGIC BIND last to leave, back and 4w
late turn, lost action into the lane, distanced stretch, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'S INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP
STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
