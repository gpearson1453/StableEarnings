Footnotes
SWEET HEIDELBERG away quickly in the beginning, pressed three deep around the first turn then outside the leader on the backstretch, inched ahead at
the quarter pole, put away the runner-up shortly after and powered away under hand urging. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE was antsy in the gate, stumbled at
the start then went up to take control inside a pair of rivals, showed the way up the backstretch with SWEET HEIDELBERG alongside, dueled around the far
turn but could not kick on with the winner past the quarter pole and churned on to secure second. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER pressed from between early,
chased the top pair up the backstretch, dropped back to last on the far turn while along the fence, churned on through the lane and regained the show
honors. BUSKER ALLIE was unhurried in the beginning and trailed three then two wide around the first turn, moved in then back out in the middle stages,
rounded the far turn three wide, failed to summon a rally and lost the show.

Footnotes
RAIN DIVA sped clear from outside then crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, spurted away in upper stretch and remained well clear under hand
urging and being flagged with the whip. SAILING ALONG broke a step slow, raced at the back four then five wide on the turn, rallied for second but never
threatened the winner. HILLSTONE MARTINI was closest in pursuit from the two path, lacked a bid when called upon and was beaten for second.
DRIZELLA was off slow in the beginning, moved up into range outside rivals, rounded the bend four wide then spun three wide into the lane and failed to
threaten. CROWN KITTEN stalked the pace from inside, asked right-handed nearing the stretch and weakened. TIZ A MASTER broke well then chased the
pacesetter from off the rail, took the turn three wide and also weakened. RIGHTEOUSLY popped his head up to make contact with his own rider at the start,
chased along the inside into the turn, bobbled slightly at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch, moved out at the top of the lane and
could not rally.

YOUTEYOURHONOR broke well then ceded control to PROFESSORS' PRIDE and moved to the outside, bid two wide around the turn, dueled down the
lane while drifting out and dug in the final sixteenth to edge the runner-up. PROFESSORS' PRIDE broke well and went up to take control early, cleared and
crossed over, met the bid from YOUTEYOURHONOR on the turn and was asked at the quarter pole, dueled down the stretch while drifting out and yielded
grudgingly. MISS FIA tracked three deep then off the rail, took the turn three wide then spun four wide into the stretch and gained the show. FLAT OUT JOY
stumbled leaving the gate, moved into range up the backstretch, inched closer from inside on the turn but lacked room behind the leader midway around the
bend, continued to give chase from the rail into the stretch, then steered out and was outfinished for third. ROCK THE BOURBON was off a bit slow,
climbed on the backstretch while trailing the field, rounded the bend three wide and failed to menace. SPLICER broke a step slow, chased between foes
then moved into the two path, lost ground through the turn and tired.

INDULGE stumbled badly leaving the gate, rated between rivals in a stalking position, entered the lane two to three wide, angled out into the clear in upper
stretch, rallied four deep and proved best in the final sixteenth. DESERVEDLY showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail moved out to the two
path on the bend and was challenged by rivals on both sides, maintained command into the stretch, moved clear from those rivals with a furlong to go but
was soon challenged by INDULGE, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to and stayed on to secure second. QUICK BUCK broke in and bumped rival,
raced up close outside the pacesetter, bid three deep on the turn, remained close through the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick.
TRUSTY RUSTY stalked the pace early on, launched a bid inside the leader around the bend, continued along the rail through the lane, then altered to the
outside of DESERVEDLY at the sixteenth pole and could not summon the needed late response. BIG HAT WILLIE took a bump from outside at the start,
stalked three deep then four wide into the stretch and finished evenly late. SPIRITIST tracked four deep in the early going, spun five wide into the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
CLOUSEAU set the pace inside TALKLESSWORKMORE for six furlongs, shook free at the top of the lane and drew away in the furlong grounds. OUBABE
stalked the pace from inside then two wide, continued in the two path around the far turn, angled in at the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly for
second best. TALKLESSWORKMORE pressed the pace from outside to the top of the stretch, could not stay with the winner at the top of the lane and
flattened to third. SHORTMAN stalked three wide around the clubhouse turn, moved up outside the top pair leaving the backstretch, asked three deep on
the far turn but weakened in the lane. WORSE READ SANCHEZ got put in tight between rivals and had to take back briefly early, chased along the inside
then two wide, saved ground while starting to weaken on the far turn and had little left for the drive. J T'S WATCH tracked four wide on the clubhouse turn,
took the second turn three wide and came up empty.

WYFIRE stalked the pace up the backstretch, bid inside into the turn, took over at the three-eighths and cleared around the turn, opened up under right and
left -handed urging and held safely to the wire. KANT BEAT THE ROCK stalked widest up the backstretch, bid four deep early on the turn but could not
keep up with WYFIRE around the bend, kept to task through the lane and finished a clear second. DONCIC broke inward at the start, chased on the inside
then moved off the rail, went two wide into the turn, steered out and entered the stretch five wide, came in upper stretch and lacked a rally. LAW ABIDING
stalked outside a rival, put in a mild bid three deep on the turn but quickly lost touch with the winner on the bend and tired. MARKS HIP sped clear early to
establish the front, was challenged from both sides into the turn, lost command at the three-eighths pole, dropped back on the turn, eased in the lane and

Footnotes
STARSHIP DEFIANT stalked two wide early, began to pull on the backstretch and went up to take the lead outside a pair of rivals, dueled around the far
turn and into the stretch, put away inner rival approaching the eighth pole and held safely in the end. TIZZY TWISTER tracked two to three wide through
both turns, moved out in the lane, rallied and got up for second. ACT OF SERENDIPITY sent for the lead from inside and dueled into the first turn, cleared
into the backstretch, lost command approaching the half-mile pole, chased the leaders leaving the backstretch and round the far turn, kept on through the
lane and got edged for second. RACE JUDICATA dueled outside a rival into the first turn, ceded command around the bend, moved up to vie between rivals
approaching the half-mile pole, dueled inside STARSHPI DEFIANT into and around the far turn, fought to upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong.
SENSIBLE MOVE chased from inside, coaxed along to move closer in the middle stages, lacked room past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out then back
in on the far turn, steered out into the lane and lacked a rally. ROSE HARBOR was off slow to start, tracked three deep or four wide on the first turn, moved
up alongside the top trio in the middle stages, dropped back three wide on the far turn and came up empty. POINT AND SHOOT stumbled leaving the gate,
went five wide on the first turn, remained off the rail trailing far behind and never got involved.

Footnotes
ROUBAIX was a bit erratic early, dropped back and was taken out wide into the clear, chased five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around
the bend, steered back out into the stretch, flew late and and inhaled the runner-up to win going away. ORGANIC was off a bit slow in the beginning then
went up vie inside rivals, inched ahead to take control and set the pace under pressure, moved clear around the turn, opened up in upper stretch, started to
weaken in the final sixteenth and got run down by the winner. GOLDEN MICROPHONE vied for the lead then pressed between rivals up the backstretch,
remained alongside the leader into the turn, lost touch past the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and kept on for a clear third. ANNIE'S
HOPE chased along the inside into the turn, exited the bend two wide, steadied in upper stretch and churned on to round out the superfecta. SMOOVE AS
SILK came away a bit slow, raced near the back two wide around the bend and improved position through the lane. SQUARE FUN showed brief speed four
deep then dropped back to chase out of range into the turn, angled from the four path down to the inside around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and
flattened. MAGIC GAME sat off the pace, drifted out on the turn and in upper stretch, eased in the furlong grounds and walked off. BEAUTIFUL WORLD
was off slow and broke out, trailed up the backstretch well off the rail, took the turn four then three wide and failed to make an impact. SIT LOOK AND
HOPE vied three deep then pressed the pace up the backstretch, failed to keep up with inside pair into the turn, dropped back around the bend three to four
wide and tired.
