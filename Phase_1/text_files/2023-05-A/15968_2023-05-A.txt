RABBIT TWENTY TWO contested the pace inside ANGIE'S REVRAC while about the two or three path, edged clear into the far turn then held that one at
bay late. POPS GIRL ALEXA moved inside going up the backstretch, rallied through the lane but could not run down the winner. QUALITY BOW stalked the
pace three and four wide, continued outside in the lane and made a mild late run. EVIE moved inside going up the backstretch but had no rally. FLYWHEEL
EFFECT was always back racing outside. ANGIE'S REVRAC contested the early pace three wide and tired. PRAIRIE FIREBALL saved ground and was
always back. RETRO RITA stumbled and unseated her rider at the break, then went riderless and was rounded up following the race by outriders.
