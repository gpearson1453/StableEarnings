Footnotes
DAAHERS BULLY raced up the fence to take control early, set a well measured pace shaking off challengers in the turn, opened a clear lead in upper
stretch and held the closer safe. LOUIS LE GRANDE rated of the pace at the back of the field, moved up on the turn to lack room at the quarter pole, angled
to the clear at the top of the stretch and closed well to gain the place. TEXAS TITAN stalked the pace from the rail to the quarter pole, cut the corner to rally
down the lane, failed to significantly gain on the winner and was out-finished in final strides to just miss the place. SHANGHAI'S DREAM pressed the leader
to make a bold challenge at the quarter pole and flattened out in mid-stretch. ONOMATOPOEIA raced just off the pace down the backside, circled three
wide to loom boldly in the turn and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
THETRUTHISTHETRUTH pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, then dug in gamely and edged clear in late stretch to prove best. CARPE
HORSESHOE chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and on the turn, came out three wide in the upper stretch to rally and closed belatedly
for the place position. SHACKLELACKALACKA set the pace from the inside then held on well throughout the turn and into the early stretch then gave way
to outer rivals and was best for show. TAY TAY'S BABY raced behind rivals while two wide, then rallied in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end.
TIZ HOPPIN settled back along the inside throughout the first half then bid in the upper stretch but came up empty in the end. GIRONA chased the pace
while two wide then rallied on the turn, drifted out five to six wide in the stretch and was no threat. TOTAL MALICE bid mildly from the thee path down the
lane and on the turn and was no threat. FROSTY FLIRT raced behind the field throughout and did not rally in the end.

TRUE AND READY broke very sharply to quickly take a clear lead, lugged out down the backside to the five path, worked his way back to the rail under
rider correction and widened his advantage when called upon in upper stretch. OZZIES WINGS Y G settled early off the leaders, rallied in the turn splitting
horses in the two path and finished willingly down the lane to be a clear second best. TOO MUCH DREAMING stalked the leader through the turn from
between horse, was set to an early drive leaving the three-eighths pole and finished evenly to hold the show. HE'S CHARMING trailed the field to the top of
the stretch and showed mild late interest. SPECIAL MEMORY tracked the pace setter from four wide and failed to respond when called upon for the drive.
TOO INTIMIDATING stalked the pace for a quarter mile and faded.

Footnotes
HALE'S ANGEL lead the way from the start, cleared the turn and held sway until the end to prove best. FOR FUN moved between rivals to bid from the
inside on the turn, then angled out four wide in the stretch to surge to the wire and prove best for second place. MY GOLDEN BLING stalked the pace from
the two path, then rallied entering the stretch and was in gamely bid but was out finished for second place in the end. THINKITASADONATION stalked the
pace while thee wide, was in under a steady drive on the turn, menaced in the stretch to close willingly in the end. STORMIEIS BLUE settled back along the
inside into the turn, then rallied in the early stretch to close well in the end under a strong drive. STAN'S GOLDEN PATH chased the pace from the inside,
was urging on the turn to rally in deep stretch but it wasn't enough in the end. MY BABYS GONE settled back while two wide, then came out five wide on
the turn to rally in the late stretch but it was too little too late. IGNIS raced while three wide then rallied on the turn but came up evenly in the stretch.
SUMMER CAT raced four to five wide throughout and was no rally. WOO HOO raced while three wide mid pack then faded throughout and was no rally.
PAISLEY CROSS was moving up four wide, was in a hard drive throughout the turn, was used up and tired in late stretch.

Footnotes
SOMEBODY IN TEXAS took the lead entering the first turn, set a well rated pace, dueled down the backside and far turn repelling several challenges and
persevered in a very game effort. CLASSIC RUNNER unhurried in the early going, rallied up the fence in the turn, cut the corner and closed willingly to gain
the place. DISCOVERY PEAK reserved in hand for the first half mile, called upon approaching the three-eighths pole, set to a long drive while circling five
wide and was gaining late in the stretch to just miss the place. PERFECT TOM tracked the pace to the far turn, rallied four wide to loom up at the head of
the lane and hung in the late going. LOOPY DUDE stalked the pace from three wide between horses throughout and gave ground in the stretch. PIONEER
TOWN raced up the rail to be close up in the first turn, checked off the pacesetters heels late in the first turn, angled out to move up to duel on the lead to
the quarter pole and tired into the lane. IMMA BLINGY LAD bumped hard by rival leaving the gate to be off stride, dropped back and was never a factor.

WOHLGEMUTH patiently handled to be in hand near the rear of the field, waited behind a wall of horses through the far turn, angled out at the top of the
stretch to the six path and closed with a rush to be up in time in a well handled ride. SUMMER LOVER reserved in mid-pack to the far turn, moved willingly
through traffic to be gaining on the pacesetter in the lane, garnered that one in the final fifty yards only to be caught by the winner in the final strides. EVIE'S
PRINCE slow early for the first half mile, made an early sweeping four wide move through the turn to open a clear lead in the lane and was out-finished in
the final strides to just miss in a good effort. STRICTLY CONFIDENT tracked the pacesetters down the backside from the rail, had to wait for racing room
late on the turn behind the slowing pacesetters and finished well when in the clear. WITT AMERICA well positioned in striking distance throughout and
lacked a response when called upon for the drive. BIG WAVE JAMES trailed for the first half mile, rallied in the far turn six wide to threaten and flattened in
the lane. SEEKING SPLENDOR raced mid-pack between horses to the far turn, was squeezed between rivals entering the turn checking back to last and
re-rallied in the lane. ACCRUAL prominently placed down the backstretch, faded in the turn and passed tired rivals in the lane. SUPREME CAPO broke
alertly to take the early lead, dueled on the front end to the quarter pole and tired. CRAZY RIDGE pressed the pace into the far turn and gradually
weakened. MAYAN moved up three wide leaving the first turn, dueled on the lead to quarter pole and gave way tiring in the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY GOT MOVES was well rated while chasing the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters, then dug in gamely to split rivals in the early
stretch and then edged clear in late stretch and held on grudgingly to prevail. GLITTERARY tracked the pace in the early stages while two wide, then came
out five on the far turn to rally in the stretch and closed belatedly and shared the show prize in the end. GET SERIOUS tracked the pace from the three path
down the backstretch, was moving up on the turn to vie for the lead from the four path at the quartier pole, then continued to menace gamely to close strong
for the place prize. TAHITIAN BREEZE settled along the inside while saving ground down the backstretch, was moving up while four wide on the far turn,
angled out six wide in the early stretch and closed willingly in the end. TUDELA chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied gamely
on the far turn to challenge for the lead between rivals in the early stretch then gave way in the end. MINNESOTA NICE raced between rivals heading into
the firs turn, was in tight, then steadied slightly in the early backstretch, continued to track the pace in the middle of the field into the far turn, then came out
four wide to bid in the stretch but came up empty. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY race in the middle of the pace while four wide down the backstretch, was in a
hard drive throughout the far turn to vie for the lead between rivals heading into the stretch, but was out bid and gave way in late stretch. VEILAZIG raced in
the middle of the field along the inside, then bid on the far turn and needed more in the end. MORO LINGERIE raced behind the field throughout the course
and was never a factor. SUPER EMPIRE was in a long drive to lead the way into the first turn and into the second, was used up and faltered in the stretch.
