Footnotes
STAY AND SCAM vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, inched clear inside the eighth pole, continued under a drive while drifting out a couple
paths late and lasted. KATE'S CONCERTO was in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, angled off the inside into the four path into the lane then
gained momentum after straightened and was closing in. HOLD MY CROWN vied for the lead two wide through the turn, continued on near even terms with
and eighth to go then weakened. TEXAS MELODY raced in the four path through the turn and lacked a response. ALWAYS DREAM BIG drifted into the
gap at the start, trailed the field into the lane and never factored. ABSCONDER pressed the pace three wide into the turn then was done nearing the quarter
pole.

Footnotes
CORNINGSTONE was unhurried while off the inside, swept past four wide through the turn, was well clear into the lane while dropping into the two path,
widened to the eighth pole and continued to extent the advantage while under minimal urging late. CHIMES chased the pace along the inside, was passed
by the winner in mid-turn, continued on to be clear for the place spot. PANTALONES ENFUEGO chased the pace from between rivals into the far turn, bid
with the winner in mid-turn, could not keep up with that one into the lane then settled for the minor share. BRODY MO raced along the inside down the
backstretch, hustled up along the rail to be a contender, lost his path, then steadily weakened. CATCHAFALLNSTAR was well back while in the two path
and moved up to pass tired ones. SHARP LIFE was never a factor while near the rail. SHES MY TREASURE hustled to the lead while in the three or four
path through the first turn and was done once headed on the far turn.

Footnotes
LEAD PERFORMER set the pace from the outset while in the two path, continued on a clear lead into the lane, was still clear inside the eighth pole then
was all out to the wire to hold the runner-up safe. RIBALDRY (IRE) chased the winner from the two or three path through the turn and into the lane, was
asked for more outside the eighth pole and was closing in to the wire. MORNING ANGEL saved ground into the far turn when unhurried, angled three wide
into the lane and finished with good energy to be up for the show spot. NIGHT KISS was in the three or four path through the far turn, bid into the lane from
the four path, moved closest to the top two with an eighth to go then could not sustain the bid while losing the show spot. MISS GOODBAR raced four wide
through the far turn, came into the lane from the six path and stayed on to register a mild gain. BALLOT INITIATIVE raced along the inside through the turn
and into the lane and offered a mild gain. DALTON'S LOVE was in the three path through the turns and into the lane and showed belated interest. SWIFT
TEMPLE was off the rail through the turns, came into the lane from the eight path and never factored. BICKERMENTS bid three wide through the turn and
tired after entering the lane. SIGNATURE STREET chased the pace from along the inside and was empty entering the lane. AMORADA chased the pace
from the three path and was empty in late turn.

the wire. MAS ORO led outside of the winner, was clear on the turn and gave way in the stretch. STARLITE RUN stalked the early pace in the four path,
then gave way in the stretch. JACK THE BIRD was impeded at the start, raced unrushed while three wide, angled to the rail at the three-eighths pole, bid,
then faltered. INFINITY'S WARRIOR bore in at the start. MR NEGATIVITY stalked the pace in the four path before fading in the stretch. IMPLODING

Footnotes
MONEY WAR set the pace while on a clear lead, continued clear into the lane, maintained his largest advantage with an eighth to go then was all out to
hold the runner-up safe. DRAMA CRITIC settled off the early pace while off the inside, bid three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path
with aim on the winner then steadily gained to the wire. SCENIC JUSTICE shuffled back along the inside, trailed into the turn, angled into the six path for the
drive and finished full of run. BAYOU CHROME was bumped at the start, settled back, raced in the three path through the turns and offered a mild bid from
mid-track. MAMBA FOREVER raced in the two path throughout when never far back then needed more through the lane. SAILOR'S CHANCE was never a
serious threat while near the rail. CIVILRIGHTSLEGEND saved ground into the lane and weakened. JUSTICEOFTHEPEACE chased the winner into the
lane and was empty turning for home.

Footnotes
DELIGHT was shuffled back while along the inside down the backstretch, came off the rail in late turn, angled into the eight path and finished full of run to be
clear at the end. RAVELLA was unhurried while off the inside, bid four wide through late turn, came into the lane from the seven path and rallied from
mid-track. POSTNUP was three wide and between through the turn, came into the lane with aim on the leaders then got outfinished by the top two. POLKA
POLENTA set the pace on fast fractions into the lane then was very weary the last eighth. COVENANT LADY chased the pace from the three path into the
lane, had aim on the top ones into the lane then leveled out. CASCADE PARK trailed after a half while along the inside then offered a belated gain along the
inside. CALIFORNIA ANGEL was in the three or four path through the turn while well back, came into the lane from the eight path and lacked a response.
MADEMOISELLE NOVA raced in contention through the far turn when in the two path then tired. TASWEYA chased the hot pace from the two or three path
through the far turn then was empty turning into the lane.
