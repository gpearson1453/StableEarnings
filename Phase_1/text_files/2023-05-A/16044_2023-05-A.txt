Footnotes
BACKSTAGE BAMBI was steadied when her path narrowed midway on the backstretch, altered outside MIDNIGHT SOCIETY, engaged that one on the
turn, battled on even terms in the lane, brushed with MIDNIGHT SOCIETY briefly inside the last eighth and edged ahead in time. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY
soon had a clear lead and gradually angled in, was challenged from outside on the bend, fought gamely in the stretch, brushed briefly with BACKSTAGE
BAMBI after entering the final furlong, lacked the needed late kick but was clearly second best. THAT'S A BIRD hustled along early, stayed in path three
taking the turn, drifted out some under left-handed pressure upper stretch, held a straight path the last eighth but finished evenly. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER
moved to the outside for a clear path after a furlong and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD DREAMER rated on the front end from outside, was let out into the bend, put to urging in the lane, steadily widened command and was kept to
task to the wire. TENSE vied for the lead briefly from inside, came off the rail some on the turn, was all out between rivals in the stretch and lasted for the
place. MOON PIES IMAGE void of early speed, saved ground taking the bend, angled out three wide for a clear path upper stretch, showed a willingness to
run late and got up for third. DRAGONFLY KISSES prominent between horses early, did not keep up from path three on the turn, lost ground fanning widest
for the stretch run and also showed a willingness to run the last furlong. SHINE DOWN in contention early, advanced from inside on the bend then ran
evenly the last quarter mile. JEMEZ FALLS chased just outside MOON PIES IMAGE, swung out to path four entering the lane and had no late bid.
DEWSHINE soon trailed and steadily faded from the rest of the field.

LAYTON THE DAY was quickly clear of the rest, put to urging in the lane, lengthened command and was kept to urging to the waning yards. WINDIGO
SPIRIT raced closest to the leader from between rivals, was all out from path three in the stretch and narrowly held the place. GEORGE'S VISION boxed in
early, progressed between horses on the turn, lost ground fanning to path six for the stretch run, rallied belatedly but moved clear for third. WARNING
LABEL prominent just outside WINDIGO SPIRIT, raced evenly the last eighth. HE'S A FINE MAN gradually progressed from inside to vie for second upper
stretch but leveled off in the late going. SAFE hesitated at the break, chased from just off the rail, angled out six wide upper stretch for a clear path but had
no late bid. HIGH LIFE AGAIN failed to menace in a wide trip. K T'S JILTED GROOM was away slowly, rushed up to contention from between horses but
faded four wide on the bend. Due to a timer malfunction, the five-furlong fraction is unavailable.

TWO COOKIE RULE settled off the rail, picked up his pace on the bend, lost ground fanning out to path five for the drive, rallied, took the lead nearing the
sixteenth marker and was drawing off late. ALPINE GHOST raced closest to the early speed, came into the lane from path three, lacked a serious bid but
caught CRANKSHAFT for second near the wire. CRANKSHAFT broke on top, was soon challenged from inside, moved ahead when asked upper stretch,
was clear briefly inside the final furlong, could not hold back TWO COOKIE RULE soon after, began to wear down in the waning yards and was outfinished
for the place. NOT AGAIN JACKIE soon trailed from inside, angled out through the bend, came into the stretch from path four and only made up minor
ground. TEE BURNS hesitated at the break, rushed up from inside to contest the pace but began to wear down upper stretch.

Footnotes
D' YANK was kept close from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, was carried out further into the stretch, rallied under mostly hand urging, angled in
beside M LITTLE TIPSY inside the last furlong and drew off the final seventy yards. MY LITTLE TIPSY set a pressured pace from inside, floated out to path
three into the lane, lengthened his lead slightly but did not have enough left deep stretch. YABA DABA DOO gradually progressed along to the rail loom a
serious threat with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. PRINCE OF MAYHEM prominent between rivals, floated out to path four into the lane, weakened
for the drive but was easily best of the others. LINE OF DENHAMS void of speed, was two wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and only
passed between tired ones. IT'S BELLAMY TIME was an early factor but faded three wide on the turn. R H SMOAKEM pressed MY LITTLE TIPSY from just
outside but gave way for the drive. CRAPS SHOOTER hesitated, broke outward, was quickly pulled back in line, saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
SEMINOLE BEACH broke alertly, was settled off the pace from outside, let out three wide on the second bend, responded to urging in the lane, took the
lead inside the last furlong and maintained full control under a mild drive. VIOLENZA D'ORO rated just off the early speed, was asked after a half mile, took
the lead two wide with a quarter mile to go, edged ahead upper stretch, could not hold back SEMINOLE BEACH inside the final eighth but was clearly
second best. EVERLOVINGHAND was sent to a clear early lead, showed the way in hand from inside, was challenged on the second turn and gradually
wore down in the lane. IRISH DECLARATION settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, came off the rail some for a clear path on the second bend,
advanced three wide to midstretch then leveled off. YOU'RE IN COREY gradually angled in as he moved to contention on the backstretch, swung to four
wide into the stretch and gave way. MAC PANDOWDY chased from outside and steadily faded after a half mile.

Footnotes
BASEBALL POLITICS stalked the early speed from between rivals, floated out to path four entering the lane, took over inside the last furlong and drew
away from UPBEAT MELODY the final sixteenth. UPBEAT MELODY broke on top, was hustled clear and steadily moved to the inside, was challenged from
outside nearing the end of two furlongs, edged ahead into the stretch, was no match for BASEBALL POLITICS the final eighth but lasted for the place under
steady handling. TONYS MORNING LINE settled well back early, was just off the rail on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run, began his bid,
gradually angled out inside the last eighth and took over third from between horses in the waning yards. MEDAL OF FACT prominent from outside, lost
ground four to six wide through the turn then gradually leveled off for the drive. DUST DANCER pressed the early speed from inside, altered out some for a
clear path midway on the backstretch, engaged UPBEAT MELODY approaching the end of a quarter mile but began to flatten out when straightened in the
lane. FULL MAGAZINE raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch, gradually angled out through the turn and gave way from path five in the
stretch. RED LABEL was away slowly and always outrun in a ground-saving trip.
