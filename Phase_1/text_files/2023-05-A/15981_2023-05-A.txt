Footnotes
WHAT A WAY TO GO settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards. AMAZING
FLYER was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter but could not resist the winner
from over the top. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW was forwardly placed early while racing from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and gave way in the drive. MISS CONTINENTAL was off a step slow, lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SWIVEL
HIPS was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. MISS MANDAUE set a pressured pace
while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. MUCH ABOUT ONE was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a
factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

prolonged drive and just missed. SARGE'S SERMON lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished
fastest of all. BLUES RAPPER was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn, checked nearing the quarter and finished evenly late.
FAST GALLITO checked nearing the three-quarter pole, settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed rally. PHOENICIAN GHOST checked
nearing the seven-eighths marker, chased the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage nearing the half, vied, steadied nearing the quarter and
weakened. HARBOR THUNDER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. IMPASSIONED CLAIM sprinted clear soon
after the start, responded when challenged nearing the half, vied and weakened after going five furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CAPITAL JOKE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by BET ON DAD nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with
that rival, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire. LEGALLY REDDY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and finished with good late energy. DODGER BLUE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated
bid. BET ON DAD was away in good order to press the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with the winner
and gave way in the drive. BIG VANILLA bobbled at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. SPORT
COAT checked at the start, lagged early, raced off the rail and failed to rally. DIXON TUFF settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.
MANDELA EFFECT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CIDSTAYINURLAINE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held gamely late when headed.
SHESAHEATWAVE was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, led but could
not hold the winner safe late. A THOUSAND DREAMS settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with good courage.
DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to gain late.
LUCKY STEPPER raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. PIPER ROSE showed no early speed,
saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. SHOE GAME broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing
four-wide and weakened after going a half. WORKIN NINETOFIVE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SAVONA was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off through
the lane with complete authority. SAL GAL pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival but stayed on well in the drive
to hold the place. FLATTER ME ZEN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to
gain late. TEXAS WENDY settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and found her best stride late. SEAHAWK MARY was off slow,
lagged early, raced eight-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. BOUGIE LIKE NATTY pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave
way through the final furlong. COURAGE OF BELLOCQ raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. KIMBERLY'S
DEVIL was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BOLD VOYAGER sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by THE GREEN CRUSADER nearing the five-eighths marker, vied with that rival
through a prolonged drive and proved best. THE GREEN CRUSADER chased the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
five-eighths marker, vied with the winner but could not get by that foe in through a vigorous drive. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) showed no early speed,
raced five-wide through the second turn and rallied late. COASTAL WATERS lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished
with good late energy. CLUB MESQUITE was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. MR NAVIGATOR
was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
