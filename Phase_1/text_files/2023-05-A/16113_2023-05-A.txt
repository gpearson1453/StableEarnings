Footnotes
SCARAMANGA (IRE) rated nicely, saved ground on the hedge, stalked the pace until approaching the last fence, roused and drew even at the last fence,
and was driven out in the stretch. SNAP DECISION assumed control of a conservative pace at fence three, led till the final fence, was challenged by
SCARAMANGA at the last fence, finished game but was outrun in the stretch. SCORPION'S REVENGE (IRE) settled in the back early, made a move two
from home, gave chase but could not gain ground on the leaders. ASK PADDINGTON (IRE) settled mid field, made a late bid, gained ground but was no
match for the leaders. NOAH AND THE ARK (IRE) traveled wide, pressed the pacesetter three from home, challenged two from home and led briefly, but
weakened in the stretch. CITY DREAMER (IRE) settled in the back from the start, made a late gain before the last, then flattened in the stretch.
MORTLACH (GB) led the first two fences, settled into third position, then tired on the final turn. REDICEAN (GB) ran evenly and tired on the final turn.
