THERE GOES MY HERO broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the
final turn, battled for the lead into the stretch from the inside of DEANARROW, and prevailed over that rival in the closing stride in a determined effort.
DEANARROW tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, battled for the lead
from the outside of THERE GOES MY HERO entering the lane, and continued with a stretch long battle to just miss. BECKAS BOY unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for a
share. THREE DAY BENDER away well and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and

clear advantage through the final turn, and continued to widen her advantage through the lane under confident handling. MISS THE HYPE broke sharply

racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove best
of the rest. DANCING WITH LIL unhurried early after breaking well, and trailed the field in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the

SHAMRA broke sharply and steadied sharply from between rivals entering the first turn, before dropping into a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied
smartly two wide entering the final turn, tipped three wide leaving the turn and quickly overtook KAY'S KITCHEN in mid stretch and drew clear late as much
the best. AMANDA settled off the contested early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to finish on even terms with KAY'S KITCHEN for the place. KAY'S KITCHEN away well and dueled for
the lead from the outside of TAM TRICKY entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, was no match when collared by SHAMRA in mid stretch, and finished from along the rail in the
drive to end up on even terms with AMANDA. INDYGOGOLD unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid three out from the rail
entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing three wide in the drive. TAM TRICKY away alertly and vied for the early lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn from the inside of KAY'S KITCHEN, was unable

WE B THREE hopped at the start to get away slowly, and settled at the back of a compact field entering the backside, rallied two wide from between rival
through the final turn, collared SOLARITY soon after entering the lane, and inched clear of that rival late to prove best. SOLARITY broke sharply and stalked
the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, collared the pacesetter while mounting a two wide bid entering the final turn, assumed
command entering the lane, but was no match when tackled by WE B THREE in mid stretch, but finished gamely to prove second best. RUN LOLA RUN
away well and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and finished
evenly two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. BELCARRA PARK away alertly and sprinted to a clear lead through the first turn and into the
backstretch, dictated the pace in the run to the final turn, was collared by rivals entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
JUST MISTY hesitated at the start to get away slowly, and shifted in towards the rail while being chased away from the gate, angled four wide in the run to
the first turn to gain a tracking trip entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of BETTER WITH TIME entering the final turn and quickly
assumed command, and proved to good. DRILL BABY DRILL away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early leaders while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for the place. BETTER WITH
TIME broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, was no match when
tackled by JUST MISTY entering the final turn, but battled on gamely from along the rail to garner a share. OKANAGAN GOLD away well and stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, continued to save ground through the final turn, and finished evenly
from along the inside in the lane. BEST ONE YET unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. CLASSY LEGACY settled well off the leaders while racing two out from the rail
entering the backside, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and was being eased over the final furlong.

Footnotes
ISLAND LIVING away well and tracked the pacesetter two out from the rail entering the backstretch, took up the chase two wide approaching the final turn,
took the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and inched clear in the closing strides to prevail. LILSISTERLEE away alertly and cleared the field in the run
to the first turn to assume command, controlled the pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, battled through the final turn from the inside of
ISLAND LIVING, was overtaken entering the lane, but battled back gamely from along the rail in the lane in a valiant effort. SHESBOURBONONICE broke
sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail through the final turn, tipped three
wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to get up for a share. STAR FINALITY was off a step slow and was squeezed between rivals to get away
poorly, chased three wide into the first turn to gain a striking position while settling off the early pace, rallied with interest three out from the rail through the
final turn, but hung late while unable to overcome her troubled beginning, and finished on even terms with PRINCESS HANNA. PRINCESS HANNA settled
off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the final turn, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the
stretch drive to finish on even terms with STAR FINALITY. STOLO SPIRIT was fractious prior to the start, was devoid of early speed while trailing the field
into the first turn, was always well back and showed little.
