Footnotes
BEST VIRGINIA became a bit edgy in the gate then rated close off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch, dueled at even terms from the three eighths
pole, contested the far turn two deep and dug in determinedly to inch clear of HANDSOME JOANIE later yards. The latter drew clear leaving the three
quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
dueled gamely to mid-stretch before relenting. HERETODAYGONMANANA came away awkwardly then steadied, rated close to the early pace inside,
closed to the heels of Handsome Joanie nearing the three eighths pole, angled out and gave chase past the pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then
flattened the final sixteenth. MY SISTER PAM rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far
turn and flattened in the lane. TENNIS TAP rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. WEST VIRGINIA PAM settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened. WOODSONG'S CASTLE showed little response. DIXIE YODELER raced off the rail on the first
turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. HOW IS SHE rounded the first turn about the five path,
left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch.

HE IS BONAFIDE pressured the early pace inside, was steadied at the rail off the heels of Wayne's Hope past the three eighths pole but recovered stride
quickly, took the lead two deep approaching the top of the lane, raced clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to widen. DANCIN IN DUBAI was
bumped leaving the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path, left the turn wide but finished well to take second the final strides. D
TACHYON exchanged contact with Just Go With It leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, dug in leaving
the turn but was nipped from second in the final strides. WAYNE'S HOPE drew clear while tapering toward the inside and set a pressured pace, rounded the
turn near the rail, was met approaching the eighth pole, dropped back leaving the pole and weakened the final sixteenth. STRONG MAGIC chased inside,
rounded the turn at the rail and flattened in the lane. BARB'S PRIDE chased, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. KING T'CHALLA
ducked in at the break and made contact with Dancin In Dubai then bobbled, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the six path on the turn and
weakened in the lane. JUST GO WITH IT exchanged contact with D Tachyon leaving the gate and saved ground. TANELEER engaged in close chase
through the backstretch, raced off the aril on the turn and weakened in the stretch. TEMPTING MOMENT became edgy in the gate and never factored.

steadily handled in the stretch. MY FLICKER rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the half mile pole and raced close in the three path on
the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and just lasted for second. AZZURRA raced well off the pace in the three path on the first turn, gave chase into
the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in through the stretch and just missed second. ALPINE MOON saved ground off the pace on
the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced boxed at the heels of Complete Surprise at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly through the lane.
LACE REVOLUTION saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled out
leaving the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. COMPLETE SURPRISE rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was
met at the rail approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the stretch. HASHTAG LUCKY took a brief early lead then stalked off the rail on the first turn,

Footnotes
SPARKLING SHIRE saved ground off the pace, closed the gap from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead at the rail nearing the quarter and was steadily
handled to widen through the lane. OBOY rated close off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail,
cleared second past the eighth pole but was no match in the lane. SPEIGHTY SENSE took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside
to rate the pace, dug in to the challenge of Voice Of Now leaving the nine sixteenths pole, cleared that one toward the three eighths but was caught
approaching the quarter and weakened. MY SLICK NICK settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the six path and finished evenly to improve his position. FLASH OF DAY became unsettled and hopped at the break, stalked from the three path
on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened stride. BIG REDWHITEBLUE raced well off the
pace in the three path on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the seven path and showed little in the lane.
VOICE OF NOW rounded the first turn about the four path then challenged two deep from the nine sixteenths pole but dropped back at the three eighths
and faded in the four path on the far turn. ARMOR PIERCING showed little response. BAL ROBINSON raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase past
the half mile pole but faded through the backstretch. REAL RAMBO saved ground.
