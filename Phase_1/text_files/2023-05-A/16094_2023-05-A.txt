Footnotes
COLONEL BOWMAN was coaxed along off the pace, started the turn in the two path then angled five wide while roused, remained five wide through the
turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to blow by the leading duo coming to the furlong marker, drew away under a solid hand-ride to near
the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. LOST IN ROME settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch and improved for the place. HEIR PORT was away alertly, showed the way under pressure from the outside, dropped from the two path to the rail
early on the turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole, fought under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was
clear for the show. ALCOOLS broke out and was away very awkwardly but with the field, chased the pace on the inside of an opponent, raced in the three
then two path on the turn, shifted six wide into the stretch and tired. RAGTIME BLUES was taken in hand while put in tight early, raced under some urging
while off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty then narrowly slipped by the fallen foe outside the
sixteenth-pole. SCILLY CAY was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated.
REED KAN pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, fought outside of
a foe under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the furlong marker, sustained an injury to the right foreleg at the
sixteenth-pole and fell then was vanned off.

Footnotes
PAROS settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go before tipping back to the two path three furlongs from
home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced swinging four wide into upper stretch, rallied to collar the front a furlong out, dug in under a
drive and gamely prevailed to the finish. BOLD JOURNEY chased three then four wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch taking over command straightened away, lugged in slightly, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on inside to the finish
while clear to preserve the place honors. ELUSIVE EDGE coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside from just off the pace down the
backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and then got put on pause in traffic in behind THREE ZERO as PAROS went on by outside at the quarter pole,
tipped out right after that rival went by and went three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. SOULMATE three wide in pursuit from just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch offering up a mild bid, weakened in
the late stages. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and weakened to the finish. THREE ZERO coaxed from the gate directly to the front, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift
splits, came under challenge from a host of rivals nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch yielding command straightened away,
then weakened to the finish. LORD GATLING coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and weakened. SILVER SEEKER hustled from the gate, prompted the pace from the outside three to four wide down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FORTY TWO ACE darted in quickly in front of the field while going to the front, reached the two path before going a sixteenth of a mile, showed the way
down the backstretch, dictated terms in the two path around the turn, responded well when shaken up into upper stretch, maintained a clear advantage
while kept to the task into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while best. CENTAVO broke a half-step slow then was taken in hand while forced in,
settled off the pace, moved in near the five-eighths, gained along the rail on the turn, raced just behind the leader late on that bend, shifted out behind that
foe outside the quarter-pole, came three to four wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was clear for the place. BLU GROTTO dropped
back while showing no speed, went three then two wide on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then moved further out and was along for the
show. HANG TIGHT was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, settled at the rear, raced inside to the two path for most of the turn, shifted three
then four wide late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NORGAY moved out while following the leader, was urged along in
the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. CUMBERLAND BLUES broke a half-step slow then was taken in hand while
having his path taken, angled in early towards the back, saved ground on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and failed to respond. CHEEKY
TICO had his path taken at the start, raced on the outside in the second flight, was urged five wide on the turn and faltered. MIDNIGHT WORKER was
restless in the gate, raced in the second flight down the backstretch, dropped back four wide on the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
COLLOQUY prompted the pace three wide between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch taking over
command just inside the quarter pole, then drew clear under a drive kept to task. FROMANOTHAMUTHA chased four then three wide down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place
honors. MANDATORY forwardly placed from the start just off the inside, advanced to take over seven furlongs from home, showed the way in hand under
pressure from a pair, had one of those rivals back off midway on the turn and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun two to three wide at the
quarter pole and into upper stretch getting displaced inside that station, dug in under a drive weakening in the late stages while well clear of the rest for the
show honors. LIL BRO COOP six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
and advanced on the front, swung five wide at the head of the stretch and tired. MACH ONE broke out at the start and on top and was wrangled by the rider
in correction, raced briefly seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked steadily to the two path near the five furlong marker, went three wide into
the turn and tucked to the two path when moving around and backing away MAGICAL WAYS midway on the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. BREADMAN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. MAGICAL WAYS bobbled at the break, led briefly before easing off to prompt the pace outside a pair four then
three wide, was in aim through to the three-eighths pole when suddenly retreating, lost ground through the latter portion of the bend and went five wide into
upper stretch, then got eased home through to the finish.

RED KNIGHT was taken under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path under snug restraint, was reserved with cover at the rear, moved
closer near the nine-sixteenths, traveled three wide around the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied outside to get the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. SOLDIER RISING (GB) was reserved under restraint in the two path, shifted three wide late on the final
turn then was roused, chased the leaders in the stretch and finished with good courage to just get the place. STRONG TIDE established a forward position
early while in hand, rounded the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole then took a short lead into upper stretch, battled on even terms for the advantage while between foes into the final furlong, fought on into the
final sixteenth and was outfinished by the winner then just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. HOWE STREET was rated just off the pace
on the inside, drafted behind foes on the far turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, came out into upper stretch, chased behind the leaders into the
final furlong, moved out from behind those foes nearing the sixteenth-pole and also finished with good courage but just missed the trifecta. WARREN POINT
(GB) was loaded with a loading blanket and a blindfold, kept the blindfold on while waiting on the start, had the assistant starter remove the blindfold as the
latch was sprung, came out awkwardly while leaning out against the gate and was off a bit slow, traveled three wide under stout restraint around the
opening bend, was reserved outside but with the benefit of cover, advanced after being removed from cover near the five-eighths pole, was let out three
wide on the far turn, gained to make a bid nearing the quarter-pole, fought on even terms for the lead into the final furlong, vied into the final sixteenth and
was out-kicked then just missed the minor awards. CHANNEL MAKER went to the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was asked a bit with
three furlongs to run then roused for more outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, fought inside of two foes into the final furlong, kept
on well to the finish but was also out-kicked. VERSTAPPEN was reserved under a hold on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick. VALUE ENGINEERING went three wide on the first turn, was rated outside but with the benefit of cover, went around the far turn in the two
path, was roused late on that bend and came up empty.

ARCANGELO chased inside briefly before tipping out to the three path down the backstretch seven furlongs from home, went four wide through the turn
advancing on the front put to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, continued four wide into upper stretch and got on near even terms before taking narrow
command three-sixteenths from home, came in to look BISHOPS BAY in the eye near the eighth pole after that rival got brief separation taking to the two
path, dug in head to head widening away from the rest as a pair and was corrected off of that foe before making contact when displaced from command a
sixteenth out, battled gamely back to near even terms and got the nod on the wire. BISHOPS BAY pressed the pace of ASMODEUS from the outside four
paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, took over the front with five-sixteenths to go and spun three wide into
upper stretch set down for the drive confronted to the outside by ARCANGELO, dug in taking to the two path straightened away and was narrowly headed
with three-sixteenths to run, dueled through to the finish widening away from the rest of the field in tandem with his main rival taking back command by
nearly a half length a sixteenth out, then fought on gamely to the end but lost the bob on the line. HENRY Q five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong while
safe to secure the show honors. CLASSIC CATCH three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch
and weakened. GO SOLDIER GO broke a beat slow getting away last, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish.
SUMMER CAUSE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.
ASMODEUS showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from the presence of BISHOPS BAY perched to his outside, tucked inside into the
turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded. GAME
CHANGE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MAMA BANNED ME was unhurried in the two path down the backstretch, went two then three wide between foes on the turn, swung five wide into upper
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. YOUR MISSION was last to commence then taken up off heels, steadied
slightly at the rear leaving the dogleg, was reserved under a tight hold at the back, circled the field while moving four to five wide on the final turn, rallied to
the lead into upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken while able to get the place. MIRACLE MIKE was reserved near the back, took an
awkward stride or two inside the five-eighths pole, went two then three wide while in some traffic on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, moved
out while gaining inside the furlong marker, loomed a major threat into the final sixteenth, steadied behind foes late then altered course and finished willingly
for the show while losing his best chance at victory. WAR PRINCE settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, tucked into the two path
then drafted behind the leaders on the turn, gained to make a bid between foes coming to the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a
drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. BARRY THE BUILDER settled on the inside of a foe, nudged his way out while advancing at the five-eighths
then took a short lead at the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, leaned out a foe into the final furlong
and weakened. SILENT RUNNING settled on the outside near the middle of the field, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.
FLUORESCENT BAY was reserved on the inside, saved ground while roused on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to rally. FAST
STUDY was away awkwardly, settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ACADEMY
CHOICE broke out and bumped with a foe, followed the clear leader, was bumped lightly near the nine-sixteenths while moving closer, came under urging in
the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and capitulated. WAFLR settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MICHAEL LEIS broke near the back of the field, settled towards the rear, went three early on the turn,
moved to four then five wide later on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. TUNNEL VISION was bumped at the start, went to the
front then showed the way with a clear advantage, shortened stride nearing the nine-sixteenths then lost the advantage, vied inside of a foe while along the
rail on the turn and stopped. MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA STEWARD DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
CANDY MAN ROCKET showed speed on the outside then dropped just off the pace, stalked the leading duo in the three path on the turn, was asked late
on that bend, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, took a short advantage while remaining on his inside lead at the furlong marker and inched clear
under strong urging while continuing on the inside lead to the finish. TWISTED RIDE was hustled from the gate, showed in front early, lost the lead near the
nine-sixteenths, vied outside from that point then in the two path on the turn, gained a short lead coming to the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner at the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to hold the place. STAGE LEFT broke a half-step slow then
dropped back, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the show.
DRAFTED bumped with a foe at the start and was off a half-step slow, moved out while settling off the early pace, raced inside early on the turn then shifted
three wide later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BEREN bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled,
moved up to get the lead near the nine-sixteenths then vied inside of a foe, raced inside on the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter-pole, battled under a
drive into the final furlong and gave way. MR PHIL settled just off the pace on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to rally.

BOSS OF ALL was hustled from the gate then settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then rallied on the
outside, closed strongly into the final furlong, drifted in and bumped the runner-up while taking the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then edged away under
good handling. CENTRAL SPEED pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took a short lead near the five-sixteenths, was asked for
her best in upper stretch, led under a drive while still on her inside lead into the final furlong, was bumped by the winner while being collared outside the
sixteenth-pole then switched to the proper lead and was outfinished while able to get the place. LINARITE settled off the pace, tucked into the two path for
the run around the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and improved for the show. FOLLOW THE FED settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and also improved position. GEORGE'S VICE was rated while well placed towards the front, saved ground for most of the

the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MA MI JO DREAMS settled between horses, went three to four wide on the
turn and failed to rally. NEVER PERSONAL brushed the outside of the gate at the start, settled just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn,
dropped back five wide into the stretch and capitulated. CAIAROSSA bumped with a rival at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths,
lagged at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. IRISH EMPRESS took a right turn at the start
and hit the gate then bumped with a foe while off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went around the turn in the two path and never reached contention.

faded. SARAH'S DIALED IN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled well back on the outside, dropped well behind while faltering on the
turn, floated well out in the course late on that bend and was eased in the stretch but walked off.
