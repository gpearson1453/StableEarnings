Footnotes
MR. MOX settled close in the three and four paths on the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead four wide on the
far turn and dug in under steady handling to take over the final strides. JOHNNY SWISH settled off the rail between horses on the first turn, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, took the lead past the eighth pole, dueled briefly clear but was caught in the final strides. MI GUSTO ES
took the lead while tapering toward the inside and rated the pace, was met at even terms past the half mile pole, recovered the advantage nearing the three
eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail but was caught past the eighth pole and flattened later yards. SPRING THE BEAST stalked from the four path the
first turn, challenged leaving the half mile pole but dropped back toward the five sixteenths, raced in the three path on the far turn and flattened in the lane.
GOT FLOFFY raced with the pace two deep, challenged from between horses leaving the half mile pole but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths
and flattened on the far turn. WE B SHACKIN saved early ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened while wide on the far turn.
SHOULDA HAD IT rounded the first turn about the six path, was never a factor and raced in the six and seven paths on the far turn. CHARITABLE SPENNY
settled inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR rounded the first turn about the
five path then steadied from between horses at the three eighths pole.

rounded the far turn at the rail and was moderately handled in the upper stretch, then taken in hand the final sixteenth. WAY LUCKY saved ground off the

dug in to clear second late yards. WAVERLEY became a bit anxious in the gate and raced in the four path on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then relented second late yards. CHANTILLY MOON (PER) settled off the rail the first turn, eased out
leaving the turn and gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but flattened stride. SISTER SPIRIT rated close inside on
the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened while drifting on the far turn. COWGIRL HOP raced well off the pace and showed little
response. PRINCESS MIA ROSE came away awkwardly, set the early pace inside entering the first turn, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave

Footnotes
DIVINE FASHION settled inside on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, circled horses six wide
on the far turn and dug in with a burst of speed through the stretch to get up at the wire. ACADIAN GIRL raced with the lead then took over and rated the
pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final
strides. TEQUILA FOG raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was outfinished in
the duel through the stretch. DAT DARES GOLD rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on
the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. RED QUEEN steadied while hitting the rail into the first turn and settled off the pace, picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. KALENJIN settled off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. GOLDEN SWEETS had a brief early lead then
stalked on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the three path of the far turn but weakened leaving the turn.
TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened. CHINA CAT was never a factor.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE BREEZE took over leaving the three quarter pole and moved to the rail into the first turn, came under pressure approaching the three eighths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and held on under steady stretch handling. IRISH SAMURAI became fractious in the gate, raced in the three path on
the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, circled in the four path on the far turn then came between horses mid-stretch while dueling for second.
CURLIN'S DOVE stalked from the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and dug in to take third
under the wire. SPUNKY ZOEY rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path,
relented in the duel through the stretch and was nipped from third under the wire. JACCACI rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened mid-stretch. FORT ZANNA raced well off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out past the eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. LADY WHISTLEDOWN raced well off the early
pace in the three and four paths, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. RIGHT TO
ASSEMBLE saved ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened. PRETTY SPECTACULAR rounded the
