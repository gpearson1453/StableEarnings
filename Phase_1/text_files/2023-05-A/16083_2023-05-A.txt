Footnotes
CONFER was unhurried in the three to four paths, tipped inwards to the two path and was roused into the far turn, advanced between foes and floated out
to the six path while taking aim at the top of the lane, stayed on to bid while drifting in passing the eighth pole, and inched past an inner rival in the closing
stages to win. FAR ABOVE stalked in the four path, bid under a nudge from the three path early around the far turn, took a narrow lead and was urged from
the five path into the stretch, ran on while drifting in into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. LA DAME DE FER bumped with an
outer foe at the start, tracked inside, swung out to the four path into the stretch, and kept on for show. BULLET VALENTINA bumped with an inner foe at the
start, set the pace in the two path, shifted inside and was put to a ride when challenged early around the far turn, was cued left handed from the two path at
the top of the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole. QUEEN ROCKET rated in the five path but was empty entering the lane.

GOTTA LIKE HIM set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. CLASSIC BOURBON stalked the pace from the
rail, angled to the three path near the quarter pole and was slowly gaining on the winner. CAN'T BE BROKEN prompted the winner three and four wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and was no match for the top two. W. P. CADET chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. FLORIDA STAR
was outrun while racing four wide. JOE IRISH broke awkwardly and steadied at the start and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
SEQUIN LADY tracked in the three path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, took the lead while in the six path at the top of the stretch, opened up
while tipping in, and held sway under a drive. LOVIN MAKES CENTS stalked under a hold along the inside, shifted out around the turn and was coaxed
from the six path entering the lane, and ran on for place. TREVESS had a rank start and trailed in the two path, tipped out around the turn and was driven
along while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. FLYING BLACK prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path
around the turn, but flattened while back in the four path in the stretch. OAXACA set the pace in the two path, was roused early around the turn, but yielded
in the stretch. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS LOOKED AT THE START OF TREVESS, AS IT WAS DETERMINED SHE HAD A
FAIR START.

SHE KNOWS IT ALL was off a bit slowly, made a quick three wide bid while trying to get out around the turn, took over near the five-sixteenths, quickly
cleared, drifted out badly in the stretch and held safe as the rider took a strong hold of the left rein through the final sixteenth. SHARP PIPPA was bumped
after the start, raced off the pace three wide and rallied for the place. FOR THE THRILL stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane.
SHOW ME LOVE chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. SPRINT BREAKER was bumped after the start, saved ground and never
threatened. PINK PARTY PANTS had brief speed inside. VIMISOFA set the pace in the two path and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
VELOCE stalked inside, tipped out to the three path and bid into the far turn, took a narrow lead passing the quarter pole and was in the five path at the top
of the lane, was herded out by the inner pacesetter who tried to battle back, but held on gamely. OFFICER COUNTRY set the pace inside, was headed by
an outer foe around the far turn, lost the lead passing the quarter pole and was in the four path entering the stretch, dug in and battled back while drifting out
passing the eighth pole, could not get back up, but held on to place. EDEN PARADISE rated in the two path, was nudged along inside of rivals around the
far turn, cued from the two path into the stretch, kept on to bid into the final furlong, but hung to show. PREFECT tracked in the three path, was roused into
the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, was carried further out by an inner foe, and evened out late. SILENT CHAOS travelled inside
around the first turn, settled off the pace in the three path down the backstretch, was roused between foes in the three path early around the far turn, but
was stymied in the five path in upper stretch, had a seam nearing the final sixteenth, but did not factor. UNLEVERAGED bumped with an outer foe at the
start, raced in midpack around the five path, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, but was empty. SUMMER SHANDEE bumped with an inner foe at the
start, raced wellback in the five path but did not threaten. VALID EXCHANGE had an awkward slow start and always trailed from the three to five paths.

HELLO SUCKER set the pace along the rail, angled out turning for home and just lasted. SIR GOOSA was rated back around the first turn, stalked the
winner two wide, slowly gained through the lane and just missed. NETWORKING raced off the pace two wide and rallied between foes to gain the show.
PARADISE DRIVE raced in range inside, bid inside of foes in the stretch but was outkicked. BLUE SOLDIER raced in range three wide and lacked the
needed stretch kick. DONTKISSDAMINISTER failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SPY TOWN was unprepared for the start then lunged and
trailed throughout.

AWESOME PIC raced up close in the five path, took over under a nudge approaching the quarter, opened up from the five path into the lane, and was
driven out. GIRVIN GIRL chased in the six path, circled inner foes from the five path around the turn, and kept on from the six path in the stretch for place.
OLGA raced prominently in the four path, took the lead in the three path early around the turn, but was quickly overtaken by the outer eventual winner, and
faded in the stretch for show. TAP'ER LIGHT stalked in the three path, was ridden around the turn and in the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened.
CHASING SILVER raced off the pace in the two path but did not threaten from the seven path in the stretch. HIALEAH HOTTIE led in the two path early but
gaveway around the turn.

Footnotes
QUEEN KARIMA set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. OAK STREET BEACH stalked the pace inside, tipped two wide near the quarter
pole, was no match for the winner and held on for the place. CINDYLOUWHO broke slowly, raced well back two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and
ran on for the show. DANCING DEB chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. FELINE was bumped near the half-mile marker, prompted the
pace three wide and faded through the lane. COMPASS FIRE pressed the winner two wide down the backstretch then steadily faded. REGARDS was
fractious in the gate, hit the gate, saved ground and never threatened. LONGING FOR MINTS was reluctant to load, came out and bumped FELINE midway
down the backstretch and was through early.
