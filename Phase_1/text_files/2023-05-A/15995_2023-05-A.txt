Footnotes
BANKER'S HOURS got bumped by an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was under coaxing in the three path around the turn, bid while
swinging out to the six path into the stretch, drifted inwards against left handed urging, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and held sway. GONE NUTS
broke in at the start and bumped an inner foe, chased from out in the six path, was under a nudge in the five path around the turn, fanned out to the seven
path into the stretch, and ran on for place. TORETTO set the pace in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path approaching the quarter,
floated out to the four path into the lane, tipped inwards, but evened out going into the final furlong to finish with show. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) rated in the
two path, was ridden from the three path into the lane, but was one paced. EXALTED CHARM raced off the pace in the three path but was no factor while
out in the seven path down the stretch. LUNAR ROCKET had an awkward start and trailed in the two path early, was driven along while tipping out to the
five path into the lane, but did not threaten. FORTY FLASH was prompted along in the two path but faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
HONOR D LADY was brushed by an inner foe just after the start, stalked in the four path, was ridden around the far turn and fanned out to the seven path
into the stretch, stayed on to bid while being herded out into the final furlong, and drew past a pair of inner foes in the final sixteenth to win. OCEAN CLUB
brushed with an outer foe just after the start, raced up close while under a hold in the three path, bid early around the far turn, floated out to the six path into
the lane, ran on to sustain that bid while drifting out into the final furlong, but was outfinished by an outer foe to place. VIOLET GIBSON (IRE) rated in the
three path, was driven around the far turn and in the five path at the top of the stretch, kept on while tipping inwards, and was up for show. TIME PASSAGE
set the pace inside, was challenged by an outer foe and roused from the two path around the far turn, tipped out to the four path into the lane, drifted out
while clinging to the lead passing the eighth pole, but yielded late. LADY AZTECA had her head turned and was brushed by an inner foe at the start, moved
up along the rail around the first turn and tracked in the two path down the backside, was under right handed urging from the rail around the far turn, but
flattened from around the three path in the stretch. SHERLYN GO GO brushed with foes on both sides after the start, travelled in range between foes in the
three path, but was empty in the two path entering the stretch. SHE'S A JOY brushed an outer foe at the start and was always behind around the five path.

to the seven path into the lane, ran on to bid while being carried slightly outward into the final furlong, and hung for place. SHORT CIRCUIT bumped with an
inner foe early, was unhurried out in the five path, tipped into the three path around the far turn and was ridden into the stretch, and ran on inside of rivals for
show. MONEY FACTOR tracked in the four path, was driven in the two path around the far turn, but flattened out in the five path down the stretch. RUBYSA

UNIFIED WEEKEND trailed in the two path early, commenced a rally while under a ride inside of foes in the three path turning into the lane, continued the
rally and bid into the final furlong, and was up in the final sixteenth. ENGLISH PAINTER chased between foes in the four path, was under coaxing while
angling out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on for place. ELUSIVE EMPIRE broke thru the gate, stalked in the three path, ranged up around the far
turn and bid from the seven path into the lane, evened out late, but held show. ARTICO tracked in the five path, received right handed cues early around the
far turn, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and stayed on but missed getting up for minor placings. GLIDING AFLEET set the pace in the three
path, was roused while shifting in to the two path around the far turn, floated out to the five path into the lane, but yielded in the final eighth. EASY AS A. B.
C. prompted the pace in the five path but gaveway into the lane.

WINNING FACTOR settled off the early pace while racing four wide, cruised up in the three path around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch and held
clear under a steady drive. UNIFIED CONQUEST raced in range two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, had aim outside of the winner and was clearly
second best. DREAM OF A DAY was off the pace while racing three and four wide and was along for the show. VELOCE failed to menace while racing two
and three wide. SILENT CHAOS trailed inside, went five wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. DRILLOMATIC had his head turned at the start,
saved ground and never threatened. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) set a clear pace in the two path and faltered after six furlongs. PERFECT CUT chased the pace
inside and came up empty in the lane. MARISA'S MISSION played no factor while racing two and three wide. MOON OVER MONTANA was outrun while
racing four wide. EL SOCIO chased the pace three wide and stopped nearing the quarter pole.

SENSEI LAWRENCE chased in the five path, ranged up under a ride around the turn and bid into the stretch, took the lead before the eighth pole, and held
sway. ROUGH ENTRY bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three path, was roused in the four path around the turn, tipped out to the six
path into the lane, and kept on to split place. POSITIVE REVIEW tracked in the six path, was ridden along to take the lead in the four path midway around
the turn, lost the lead while in the two path in upper stretch, evened out, but held on to a share of place. MAGIC ECLIPSE rated inside, was ridden along
while tipping out around the turn and in the seven path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly. SMOKIN BOW bumped with an inner foe at the start,
trailed in the three path, angled out around the turn, but did not factor from out in the nine path down the lane. FROSTED ARMOUR prompted the pace in
the two path early but was empty entering the stretch. UNIKEE set the pace in the four path early, but lost the lead in the three path around the turn and
gaveway.

Footnotes
SWAN LAKE set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch and held held clear under a
drive. BOPPY O raced in range three wide and stayed on to gain the place without threatening the winner. PEOPLE FORCE saved ground in midpack,
raced three wide between foes around the far turn, waited briefly for room near the three-sixteenths, angled out nearing the eighth pole and ran on to gain
the show. HARUKI prompted the winner three wide and weakened in the lane. ORDINARY saved ground and failed to menace. SEA HUNTER (IRE)
chased the pace two wide early and from the rail around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. COSMIC SPECULATION was up close inside and retreated
through the lane. TICKING lacked early speed, raced three wide around the first turn, was bumped repeated down the backstretch, went four wide around
the far turn and had little left for the drive. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND veered out at the start, raced off the pace outside, was getting out and bumping a foe
repeatedly down the backstretch, checked near the three-eighths pole and retreated.
