Footnotes
UNCLE HEADLEY was crowded at the start, raced outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, drifted in and drew clear late. MONGOLIAN BEE went
four wide entering the stretch, altered course near the eighth pole and closed well to earn place. PRIZE FIGHTER set the pace with a clear lead, faltered
past the eighth pole and held for show. BUREAU was slow early, angled out in the upper stretch and finished well. GALLANT BUCK came out at the start,
chased the pace and lacked the needed late response. VERRAZANOINTHESKY saved ground, was checked along the rail on the back stretch and put in a
steady effort. MODIFIER was carried out at the start, slow early, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. BRUCE BANNER was not a factor. I'M
YOUR CAPTAIN raced close to the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail and came up empty.

EMPIRE BUILDER set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead to win handily. SILVER QUARTERS broke in, was unhurried early and raced in
the back, rallied on the turn, went widest in the drive and was no match for the winner. GITA'S LAD raced close to the pace along the inside, bid along the
rail on the turn, shifted out and failed to rally. BABA'S BOY was slow early, put in a steady effort and improved position. WISE VERDICT raced close to the
pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn and gave way. SOUL COAXING raced close to the pace while three across, flattened out and
dropped back. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was unprepared at the start, pressed the pace to the turn and tired.

SALLY'S SUPRISE veered out at the start, pressed the pace, assumed command between horses on the turn with a short lead, drew away late and held off
the late charge of PACIFIC VIEW. PACIFIC VIEW showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back, came again, angled out late, surged and was
gaining late. TWICK OR TWEAT set a pressured pace to the turn, flell back, continued in a steady effort and held for show. LADA KALINA was carried out
at the start, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn and fell back. SONG OF AMERICA was carried out at the start, ran up behind horses and
was checked on the backstretch, continued willingly, bid and hung late. MISS MIA improved position in a steady effort. THE SCORE IS EVEN ducked in at
the start and was outrun. DILLYDILLY DIAMOND distanced the field.
