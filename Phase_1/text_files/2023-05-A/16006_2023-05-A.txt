Footnotes
CLOUDY TIMES settled inside the dueling leaders, slipped through at the top of the lane and edged clear driving. GETAWAY PALACE alternated for the
advantage inside, led in midstretch then weakened slightly in the final furlong. THEARCHERORTHEPREY chased outside, raced wide throughout with a
gradual late gain. CULPA BLANCO was urged close up inside, faded on the turn then came again while no threat. JAVA'S LUCKY LADY vied between
rivals then outside to the stretch and faltered. WAHINE MEANIE dueled three wide for half a mile then gave way. THENDARA'S LOST lacked speed wide
and was never in contention. CHOOSELOV dropped back early and trailed throughout.

and drew clear under urging. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY tracked on the inside, moved up along the rail on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch and was clear
for the place spot. PEACH BE WITH Q stumbled at the start, vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, dueled with the winner in upper stretch and
weakened. NANA'S BOOPA raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside. MISBEHAVING LADY was outrun early,
moved up at the quarter pole, steadied slightly in upper stretch and closed belatedly. PRINCESS EMMA JO chased outside and tired. SMARTY PANTS
SANDY vied three wide early, then chased and faded. VEGAS WILD CAT was fractious in the gate, vied between rivals for the lead, then chased and gave
way.

Footnotes
RUNNINGFORHOME was well placed inside the dueling leaders, moved out advancing on the final turn then clear through the final furlong. GRIT'N'GRIND
lagged far behind, split rivals in the stretch with good late energy. EXCURSION angled inside early, continued to save ground, loomed a stretch threat but
flattened out. KITH set a pressured pace inside, lost the lead into the stretch and yielded. DRONE SWARM lacked speed racing outside and was never a
factor. MY TRAIN forced the pace outside to midway on the final turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SAINT MARCO pressed the pace early on, then stalked outside, bid on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and prevailed after a long drive. JAA
MODE tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled through the final furlong and dug in gamely inside to
the finish. TUANIS set the pace on the inside, dueled into the stretch, dug in between rivals in the drive and weakened late. HORNBEAM raced off the pace
inside, advanced on the turn and closed belatedly outside. BIRD RULER raced two wide off the pace, continued two wide on the far turn, angled out and
finished evenly. JAY'STALKER stumbled at the start, raced three wide early, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and gave way. ZIPPER
ZAPPER raced off the pace inside and did not factor. STARSHIP GOTHAM raced three or four wide off the pace and gave way.

THESEGUYSGOTGAME dueled inside in a four way contested early pace, dueled with JOHN DUTTON on the turn, responded when roused, put away that
rival at the eighth pole, pulled away under urging and was in hand the final yards. JOHN DUTTON dueled four wide early, dueled outside of the winner on
the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and then came up second best. CLASSIC UNION raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, rallied
mildly and bested the others. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA raced off the rail, off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a
rally. GUN COLLECTOR raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. COLES CONUNDRUM dueled three wide for the
early lead, chased three wide on the turn and faded. LITTLE J P dueled between rivals for the early lead, gave way on the turn and jogged home.
