Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART broke sharp and was reined in to have a good outside tracking position, waited to pounce with three furlongs to go, assumed
control easily at the two furlong marker and drew away at will down the lane. TOO MUCH VINO was off a touch slow after the break, settled four deep down
the backstretch, circled outside picking rivals off around the turn and had a good closing kick to be second best behind a dominant winner. CELTIC
REVIVAL was away alertly to set the pace in the early stages, headed outside by the winner midpoint on the turn, offered little resistance on the rail and
stalled at the furlong marker while holding on the the show award. MORE GELATO travelled three wide near the rear at the half, was ridden for more
between horses midway on the turn, shifted out widest for the drive in the five path and finished up evenly for a minor role. CHROME'S ANGEL was eager
with runners on either side four furlongs left to go, put in an early move inside at the seven sixteenths pole to be in good position for a share at the top of the
lane and levelled off with an eighth to race losing a placing. DELILAH'S REVENGE was allowed to settle at the back inside entering the turn, saved ground
and offered a mild turn of foot on the rail through to the quarter pole and could not be a factor running on the fence to the finish line. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN
tracked inside under a snug hold with a half remaining, was shuffled back some entering the turn racing between foes, could not match strides with the field
five sixteenths from the line and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
JAB rated three wide off the early lead, was asked to pick it up at the three-eighths and responded by swiftly moving between runners with eyes on the
leader, took over at the top of the stretch and quickly drew clear, was given just mild urging late once safely in front. TRILLING SONG tracked from inside,
came out in upper stretch, ran on to get up for second. DIOSA CATRINA moved clear and shifted in setting the pace near the rail, was no match for the
winner and lost place in late stretch. HIGH TREASON was outpaced early bringing up the rear, advanced inside rivals in upper stretch then came out and
kicked on well but too late. NEOLITHIC NATION brushed lightly with a foe at the start, made an early move outside runners four wide to get closer contact
with the leader and within striking distance heading into the turn, could not sustain the effort and flattened out. PICK A PENNY veered in badly at the break
then switched out and moved up two wide, came out four to five deep for the drive and failed to rally. MERITAMEN was held up in behind runners mid-pack
along the inside and fighting the rider's restraint somewhat while clearing the gap, came off the rail about midway on the turn, failed to rally. VICTORIA
ELIZABETH got away well despite a minor brush at the start but soon dropped back in the early going, put to urging five then six wide on the turn outside
runners, tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HALAGA set the pace loose on the front end down the backstretch, continued unchallenged through the turn, still held comfortably at the furlong marker and
held safe at the the finish while tiring in deep stretch. LADY BREW settled outside in mid pack at the half, rallied four wide between foes at the top of the
lane and showed some grit with rivals on either side to win the place battle at the wire. GAYELETTE chased the lone speed throughout, showed some good
energy down the stretch to fight on and win the three horse battle for the show award when they hit the line. ME AND MY SHADOW reared at the start
trailing the field out of the chute, took closer order down the backside running with the pack, offered a three wide bid outside foes at the quarter pole and got
a little leg weary in the five path late losing out on a three horse photo for third in a good effort all things considered. SHE MAKES A POINT rated in midfield
on the rail down the backside, saved all the ground running on the turn and lacked a closing kick on the fence in mid stretch, was inching closer to the
leaders but needed more to factor in the end. HELLUVA HOLIDAY raced at the back with a half mile remaining, lost touch with the field at the quarter pole
and was not persevered with through to the finish line. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF #4 ME AND MY SHADOW WAS DEEMED TO
HAVE RECEIVED A FAIR START

BEDAZZLE ME settled inside foes but off the rail in the second group behind the leader, began to advance three wide on the turn, was strongly urged
through the lane and got up late. MAP broke sharply and went straight to the lead to dictate terms on a clear advantage while shifting in, extended the
margin willingly around the turn, was well clear turning for home and put to urging but was caught late. DOMER ALLURE raced inside at the back early after
breaking just a tad slowly, moved forward inside on the turn coming out two deep to pass a rival on that bend before moving back in, shifted out in
mid-stretch and ran on willingly but was no match for the top pair while clearly best of the rest. DANISH DYNAMITE lacked early speed, saved some ground
advancing inside a rival near the rail on the turn, shifted three deep coming to the quarter pole then angled out further at the three-sixteenths for room, ran
on to get up for the minor award. KNOTTY AND NICE got away slowly, raced outside foes at the rear, entered the turn three deep, swung eight wide and
showed some late interest. HOLIDAY WITH AMY raced outside rivals mid-pack three to four wide through the turn, went evenly and made no bid. SMOKEN
CHLOE was forwardly-positioned in pursuit of the leader two to three wide, faded in late stretch. LEADING FORCE chased from between runners mid-pack,
retreated. ARUBA (IRE) was forwardly-placed tracking inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
SOUPER RUSH set the pace down the backstretch, continued up front uncontested running on the turn, was still all alone at the furlong marker and began
to weaken late but opened up enough early to hold off the closer at the line. JAMIESTA broke out at the start, stalked four deep in midfield in the early
stages, rallied three wide at the quarter pole to loom the threat, raced on the wrong lead to the wire under left handed urging and was gaining belatedly but
could not get there in time. MIDNIGHT ARKLE had no speed early and was relegated to the rear, three eighths from the finish was hard ridden to close the
gap on the leaders, still could see them all as they entered upper stretch and began his rally at the furlong marker showing good late energy to close in
capturing third. BOXER BRIEF chased the winner in the beginning stages of the race, could not make an impression on the leader three wide at the top of
the stretch and faded late losing the show battle just before the wire. MR NARCISSISTIC stalked between horses two wide in the beginning, put in a mild
turn of foot three wide midpoint on the turn to be in the hunt for a small share as they rounded into the stretch and made little impact running to the finish.
STUBBORN STREAK settled near the rear inside down the back straight, steadied mildly behind runners nearing the half to trail, was in range with others
three sixteenths left to run and could not fire between foes to pose a challenge for a minor share. DRAGON'S KEY tracked mid pack on the rail, had a good
inside position midfield around the turn and offered little run, fading on the fence for the drive to the line.

Footnotes
SHEBATOWN settled off the pace inside, saved ground early on the turn but gradually moved out leaving that bend to come three wide to the top of the
stretch, ducked back near the rail and bid inside taking the lead just outside the seventy-yard mark and got the nod. TACHYON SPEED tracked from inside,
came out and took aim on the leader, took over just outside the sixteenth pole but was outfinished by an inside rival while keeping on strongly as a game
second. UNIFIED FRONT bumped the inside rival at the start, moved forward to force the pace from the nine-sixteenths, dueled outside the leader before
taking charge about the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked while best of the rest. DREAMS AND SCHEMES was bumped at the
break, raced in the back half of the field advancing some two to three wide and between foes into the turn, came out for the drive and ran on evenly. LADY
XI lacked early speed, raced wide early, moved out from four to seven deep turning for home, ran on mildly. SPRING HIGH hit the gate and was away
several lengths slowly, brought up the rear, fanned seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GENEVA chased from outside a rival in behind the
leading pair, went three to four wide on the turn dropping back, faded. YOU GOTTA BE got away alertly moved clear and set the early pace while shifting in,
was joined by an outside foe who challenged for the lead at the four-and-one-half, dueled inside that one, was overtaken nearing the five-sixteenths and
asked for more but had no late response and gave way.

Footnotes
GAMBLE'S SILVER was sitting near the back comfortably watching the race unfold down the backside, began to rally between runners with a quarter
remaining, switched leads nearing the eighth pole finding another gear and closed in deep stretch with a flurry to mow down the leader in the last jump.
SPEED TRAP rated patiently, just sitting off the early frontrunner outside down the backstretch, assumed command easily midway on the turn, opened up in
upper stretch and was worn down by the fast closing winner in the final jump at the wire. SPIDER BELLE was unhurried from the start and could see the
field at the half, waited behind runners through the turn, looked for a seam in the four path as they turned for home, angled in to the rail at the furlong marker
and closed up the fence to be a non threatening third in the end. DIAMOND CRUSH set the fractions for the first half, when engaged outside could not find
more to resist the challenge as they turned for home and gave way between foes the final hundred yards to settle for a minor share. STARLIGHT RIDGE
stalked in mid pack three wide entering the turn, continued racing three wide making up little ground around challengers with a quarter left to go and levelled
off in the six path running to the line. JILLI MARIE stalked in the middle of the field on the rail at the half, was nudged along to keep her inside position
racing through the turn, contended four wide between foes at the top of the lane and faltered in mid stretch.

Footnotes
TITO'S CALLING settled last but one shifting in early and rating off the pace, advanced two to three wide on the turn, came in a bit in upper stretch, bid
inside foes taking the lead past the furlong marker and quickly drew clear. NORTHERN PASSAGE attended the early pace from outside, dropped back
heading to the turn then launched an advance outside five wide, made a mild bid nearing the eighth pole, could not kick on with the winner but kept on to
hold the place. SOUPER SINCLAIR pressed from between rivals early then outside three deep on the turn, had the lead in upper stretch, was overtaken in
mid-stretch but kept on well. FORTYFIVESEVENTY settled between runners in the second flight, moved out three to four wide on the turn beginning to
advance, came out in mid-stretch for room and showed good late stride. FOXY DIVA was unhurried at the rear, swung six wide into upper stretch, shifted in
a bit in the lane and had late interest but was too little too late. ROYAL BLUSH raced outside off the pace moving out from four to six wide on the turn, came
into the stretch racing seven to eight deep and needed more. NO MORE DIAMONDS was coaxed forward, set a pressured pace in the two path, weakened.
MAKES SENSE TO ME was forced in at the break, pressed the early pace inside, came up empty. TARA LUNA broke a bit awkwardly and inwardly, tracked
in behind racing in the second flight, failed to threaten.
