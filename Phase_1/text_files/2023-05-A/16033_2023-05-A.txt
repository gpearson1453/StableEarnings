Footnotes
PASSION BELLE prompted the pace while racing two-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off to win with something
left. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY was forwardly placed from the outset, followed the winner into the stretch while splitting rivals, could not reach the top one but
was clearly second best. INDIAN FIREBLOSSOM saved ground while being unhurried, angled out three-wide during the drive and made up some ground
late. TIME IS PRECIOUS was prominently placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T broke in, then was allowed to settle in
stride, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RAISE OUR FLAG was off a step slow, then was in tight early and failed to menace thereafter.
PEGGY B FAST saved ground setting the early pace and tired when headed. SHORT POCKETS was not a factor while racing three-wide.

DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage. SAGANAKI
chased the winner throughout while racing two-wide, could not reach that one but continued on well for the place. ILOVEHER broke in to bump with Dandy
Money, then was allowed to settle in stride, rallied three-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. BEVERLY WHO was unhurried early, came
two-wide into the stretch splitting rivals and finished in a mild rally. CANDIED JOULE saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked a rally when
asked. INDIAN AFFAIR broke out to bump with Dandy Money and failed to seriously threaten. DANDY MONEY was bumped from both sides, then dropped
back and failed to menace. DYNAMIC WOMAN was in tight along the inside during the first turn and was not a factor after that. SIGRID was close up early
and gave way.

Footnotes
SEXY DEXY saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. CERVEZA chased Sexy Dexy while saving ground, angled out to offer a bid
entering the stretch, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best. PIRATE JUNCTION was off a couple steps slow, then was unhurried, moved
up along the outside on the turn and showed interest late. JUST CALL ME KEN was reserved off the early pace, angled out for the drive and went evenly.
OMACHE KID saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride but failed to be a serious factor. DISCREET TIGER was prominent early while racing
two-wide and tired. TEQUILA TIME was forwardly placed early while three-wide and gave way. BEAR DEN dropped well back early, was pulled up and then
was walked off following the race.
