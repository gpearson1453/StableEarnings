Footnotes
HARPES HILL with the pace from the start while three wide, vied between rivals through the turn and into the stretch, bit tight nearing the furlong marker,
spirited duel late closest to the inside, found more in the waning strides to prove best in game fashion. TWOFEXUSNEXUS last away, moved up to contest
the pace four wide into the turn, three wide when holding a slight advantage into the lane, dueled outside the winner to the wire, outfinished, well clear of the
others. JOSIE'S PRIORITY moved up inside to also contest the issue early, continued to race with the lead pack while saving ground turn, weakened final
furlong. TRUE CRIMSON fell back to trail after the start, saved some ground turn, steered out past the furlong marker, found some late energy to be gaining
for the show spot. ALL COUNTRY broke with the winner, raced with the pace while between horses for three furlongs and gave way.

best under firm handling. THE CALLING STONE took over soon after the start, set the pace under restraint along the inside, responded when challenged
second turn, late duel inside the winner, proved stubborn to the end. WORLD OF HURT fell back to trail after the start, angled out four wide in the final turn,
widest in the drive, along for the show. UNIFIED LOVE pressed the runner up off the inside, advanced and challenged that one second turn, briefly vied
between the top two into the lane, fell back, dropped in a furlong out and continued to weaken. GEAUX VOTE in the second flight for a half, fell back after

Footnotes
ATALANTA ASTERIA broke in and a tad slow, outrun for five furlongs, began to advance far turn, angled out four wide turning into the stretch, closed with
good energy to win going away well out in the strip. ZIPPING MOLLY broke alertly, set the pace while toward but not on the rail, continued to show the way
up the backstretch, shrugged off a couple of rivals turning for home to garner a larger lead, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the
place. LOVE CREED tracked the pace toward the inside, moved a bit closer along the rail late in the final turn, steadied when attempting to slip through
along the rail, weakened through the stretch. SHEEZA PRIORITY prompted the runner up from the outside, continued to race closest to that one up the
backstretch, lodged a brief lead in the three path turning for home and faltered. SADIE'S PORT settled off the pace, moved a bit closer along the inside far
turn, flattened out in the drive. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY forwardly placed early off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half, fell far back, distanced
after losing contact with the field, jogged in. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ZIPPING MOLLY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MY MAN LOUIE forwardly placed while racing off the inside, came three wide out of the turn to lose some ground to the leader, set down, late surge to win
going away late. CREEKMORE raced back off the pace and the inside, roused, steered in upper stretch when advancing, moved all the way to the rail,
flattened out a bit late but managed to gain the nod for the place. COROT broke with the leaders, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other
speed to be clear by upper stretch, continued to lead until late, could not contain the winner, lost the nod for the place at the wire while outside the runner
up. LODE OF BLARNEY lacked speed outside, four wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. FAREWELL TIME broke alertly, dueled up front in the two
path, continued to alternate through the turn, first to blink entering the stretch. THE FEATURE off a step slow, trailed throughout in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
SCHNELL with the pace from the start, dueled into and through the turn off the inside, shook off the other speed when entering the stretch and kicked well
clear. QUANA DUDE lacked speed for a half, asked along midway on the turn, swung out five wide turning for home, finished willingly to be well clear of the
rest, no threat to the winner. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked a closing punch, saved the
show while not a match for the top pair. BROAD DECISION last to leave, void of speed outside, raced four wide through the turn, improved position while
not a serious threat. LT. BONURA vied up front while between foes up the backstretch, fell back into the turn, had little left for the stretch run. PRAY IDE
SING broke alertly, narrowly set the pace for a half along the inside, gave way. CUSTOM KAT made little impact in remaining back. I'LL RAISE YOU within
striking distance for a half, faltered in the drive. GOLDEN PASSAGE was finished early, trailed home.

ZERO POINT ZERO broke on top, set the pace along the inside, shrugged off nearest pursuer when straightened for home, clear to the wire under steady
handling. APRIORITY GIRL pressed the winner from the outside, could not match that one in the drive, fully extended to save the place.
BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR void of speed, raced three wide through the turn, getting to the runner up late. ASTRO FLASH broke behind leaders, raced
within striking distance for three furlongs, had little for the drive. MAEMAEMAY refused at the start. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

TRANQUILLA outrun in the early going, raced three wide into the turn, four to five wide exiting when beginning to rally, rolled by the two leaders under a
brisk left handed crop to be clear at the end. REQUITE THE EFFORT broke very sharp to be immediately clear, continued to show the way through the turn
and into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late while proving determined for the place. CHUCHI in the second flight outside, shifted out a bit to the
two path turning for home, lodged a bid outside the runner up with a furlong to run, outkicked by that one for the second spot while also no match for the
winner. RUN DREAMING one paced off the inside, came three wide for the drive, continued evenly to the finish in lacking a closing kick. KRAZY KATIE
within striking distance out in the strip, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing punch. JAX'S STARRY BRIDE lacked speed, was floated out six wide into
the stretch, failed to muster a rally. TOUCHING ACES veered out at the break, trailed throughout.

ALEXIS S outrun in the early going, rolled up five wide into contention exiting the turn, kicked on strongly to be well clear at the end in a sharp effort.
DOUBLE EDGE SWORD within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, inside the winner entering the stretch, proved no match for that one in
the final furlong, edged clear for the place. HALF FULL broke alertly, set a pressured pace up the backstretch and through the in the two path, came in a bit
to tighten up FAHAN slightly with a furlong to run, narrowly saved the show over that one late. FAHAN forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save
ground into the lane, steadied along the rail in midstretch, altered course to the outside after recovering and finished willingly to narrowly miss the show.
RELIC HUNTER with the early pace between foes, fell back into the turn, three wide when behind the lead pack turning for home, steered out, finished up
mildly. COPTER bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to force the issue up front for three furlongs then gave way. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
