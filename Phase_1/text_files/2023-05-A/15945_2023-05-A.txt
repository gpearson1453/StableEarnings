along in time. UNDERCOVER LADY hopped at the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch then couldn't handle the winner. CONDUTTORE chased
the pace along the inside into the far turn, shifted out at the quarter pole, drifted to the eighth path entering the stretch and finished determinedly. MAY
