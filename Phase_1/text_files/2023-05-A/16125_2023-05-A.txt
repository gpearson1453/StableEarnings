Footnotes
A REAL JEWEL pressed two wide, led turning for home, inched clear in upper stretch as an outer RACETOTHEFINISH pursued, and held sway safely.
RACETOTHEFINISH stalked three wide, took aim on the new leader in upper stretch, but only managed to chase her home while proving second best.
RELIANT was briefly fractious in the gate, then broke out and bumped a foe at the start, lacked speed in the two to three path around the turn, fanned to the
six path at the three sixteenth pole, and stayed on to reach show entering the final sixteenth. LADY GOLDSTART set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got
headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole and subsequently weakened. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA hopped slightly before taking a bump from an inner
foe at the start, rushed forward between horses at the five furlong pole, then chased along the inside around the turn and gave way. DOCS SEVEN bumped
with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but faded. HIGH SPEED bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates,
raced midpack in the four path around the turn, and tired on her left lead. TILTINGATWINDMILLS trailed in the three to four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
MISREAD laid close up along the inside, patiently awaited racing room behind the pace setter around the turn, got through while grazing the fence in upper
stretch, took over soon after and was ridden out through the final furlong. ROYAL BLOOD set the pace, but offered little resistance to an inner rival's bid in
upper stretch, and remained clear of show. THE PRINCESS SAYS stalked two wide, yielded to the top two while in the three path in upper stretch, then
flopped back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth and narrowly lasted for show. GOLDYS LOCK laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five
path entering the lane, and stayed on to miss reaching show at the wire. CRIMALDI tracked in the three to four path around the turn and faded. HURRY UP
HANNAH chased from the two path and made litle impact. MY BLUE VALENTINE broke a step slow at the start and showed little.

Footnotes
MY UNCLE LEON set the pace along the inside, drew clear of a pressing foe at the five sixteenths pole, opened up in upper stretch, flopped back to his left
lead while shying from being shown a right handed crop entering the final sixteenth and held sway safely. NOISES OFF tracked four wide, gained place
entering the lane, and was clearly second best while hanging on his left lead. PEEK bobbled very slightly soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the two
path, tipped four wide at the three sixteenths pole, stayed on between horses while hanging on his left lead to gain show at the furlong grounds, then
changed over to his right lead nearing the final sixteenth and fended off an outer bidder for that position late. EARL OF DASSEL trailed in the three path,
gained between horses turning for home, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on late but did not have enough to reach show. PATROLMAN
bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the three path, tipped to the five path before inching closer turning for home, and ran on mildly
between horses. DREAM FORCE tracked two wide, chased the leaders around the turn and gave way. FIREBALL FUN bumped with an inner rival at the
start, stalked three wide and faded between horses. SIX MISSIONS pressed two wide, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole and caved through the lane.
SATURDAY LONG LEGS lacked speed in the five path, but was through with three furlongs to go and eased thereafter. GOLD FRANC (IRE) stalked along
the inside, but weakened nearing the half mile pole and was done early.

LIKE A SALTSHAKER vied for the lead three wide, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole and drew off in upper stretch. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH
leaned out and bumped an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly three wide and among foes early on, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, and rallied
to gain place in the shadow of the wire. HOT PASTRAMI took a bump from an inner foe at the start, dueled two wide and between horses around the turn,
proved no match for his outer counterpart in upper stretch, shifted ground outwardly nearing midstretch, but lost place to an outer bidder late. SANTA
CRUISER broke a step slowly before an inner rival took away his path, trailed, spun into the lane three wide, rallied while splitting rivals in midstretch, and
ran on well for a minor reward. DARK HEDGES dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes around the turn but gave way in upper stretch. BLACK STORM
tracked five to four wide and failed to menace. BRAVO BRAVO got antsy in the gate awaiting the start, broke outwardly as his outer counterpart came out
slow, laid off of the pace four wide and between horses early on, altered outside of rivals before taking the turn in the five to six path, but faded turning for
home. FIRERY TALE chased two wide and between horses but faded. MALIBU TIME chased along the inside, but steadied while weakening at the five
furlong pole.

DUAL MONARCHY settled far back three wide, gained in the five path turning for home before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, sustained a rally
on his left lead while lugging in slightly, bid in the final furlong and forged an advantage at the wire. GLEN AIRY laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted
to the three to four path while inching closer around the far turn, split the main group approaching midstretch to gain an advantage at the furlong grounds,
but was naild by an outer bidder at the wire. MARTY'S MAGIC bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, and chased well but did not have
enough. FUJIN tracked two wide, ranged up four wide around the far turn, bid in the six path entering the lane, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in
midstretch. MAD HUSTLE pursued from midpack along the inside, then chased along the rail while hanging on his left lead. ABSOLUTE COURAGE stalked

two wide, shifted out in upper stretch, and moved up in the final furlong. COACH PETRO bumped with an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the

Footnotes
ENCHANTED NILE shifted outside of the leader leaving the chute, prompted two wide down the backstretch, gained an advantage into the turn, showed the
way in the two path around the bend as an outer MIRTH'N MERRIMENT applied pressure, yet drew off in upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire.
MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in the three path, ranged up outside of the leader around the turn, but failed to keep pace
in upper stretch and remained well clear of show. DONYA KNOW IT chased in the three path, but proved no match for the top pair before securing show.
MUSIC AMORE stalked along the inside, checked lightly entering the turn, tipped two wide soon after, but lacked a kick between horses in upper stretch.
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN set the pace in the two path, got headed by an outer rival entering the turn before tucking to the rail, and faded through the lane.
PISTOL transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start and failed to factor from the three path. KIMBERLEY DREAM took the turn in the
five path while off of the pace and never got involved. GIN N SIN took a bump from an inner rival at the start and got outrun in the three path.

Footnotes
SALUTE THE STARS stalked along the inside, awaited racing room from the two path around the far turn, tipped inwardly to bid inside of the leaders in
upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds, drifted out while meeting a pair of outer challenges entering the final sixteenth, and held firm.
ESCAPOLOGIST bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked behind the leaders from the three path around the far
turn, took aim in the five path in upper stretch, grinded away to offer a bid at the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay. REDEEMER tracked from midpack in
the four path, ranged up turning for home to bid entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival coming to midstretch, kept on along with an outer foe
to bid once more entering the final sixteenth, but lacked the needed punch while put to tight quarters in the late stages. BASELINE BEATER was bumped by
rivals on both sides while put to tight quarters at the start, lagged behind in the three path, launched a gain while fanning to the five path entering the lane,
bumped an outer rival while shifting seven wide in midstretch, and leveled off. REALLY GOOD prompted the pace two wide and between horses into the
first turn, backed off to track around that bend, tipped three wide down the backstretch, ranged up to the leader while under rousing turning for home, vied
between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked before weakening at the furlong grounds. BABY BILLY laid off of the pace in the two to four paths,
fanned to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. OUR DREAM RYE'D lacked speed in the two path, gained in the five path around the far turn,
but flattened out in the seven path entering the lane, then took a bump from an inner rival at the furlong grounds. BLACK APPLE lacked speed in the three
to five paths and made little impact. CLEAR THE AIR tugged to prompt the pace three wide entering the first turn, struck the fore before tucking to the two
path entering the backstretch, met a pair of outer challenges entering the lane, and faltered in upper stretch. TIGER PAW (IRE) lunged inwardly while rank
at the start, prompted the pace in the four to three paths around the first turn, but weakened two wide and between horses entering the far turn.

Footnotes
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER dueled for the lead two wide, showed the way around the turn, shook free of an outer challenger in upper stretch, and held firm
from pursuing foes through the late stages. HAPPY JACK took back once put to crowded quarters at the start, raced towards the rear in the four to five path
around the turn, picked up stride while shifting inwardly nearing midstretch, rallied in hopes of bidding inside of the leader late, but ran out of ground whiie
gaining place at the wire. BRON AND BROW stalked three wide, bid entering the lane, but was turned away by the pace-setter in upper stretch, chased that
foe well thereafter, but was nailed by an inner rival for place at the wire. BOURBON HEIST pursued from midpack in the two path, tipped to the five path
entering the lane, produced a grinding charge while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over approaching the final sixteenth, and stayed
on well. MINNESOTA READY lacked speed in the five path around the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and ran on evenly. UNDER OATH
broke a step slow, stalked from the two path, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a bid before fading. TEXAS RED HOT raced at the rear in
the five to six path, spun into the lane in the eight path and made little impact. UNPREDICTABLE BAY tracked in the four path, but was outkicked while
floated to the six path entering the lane and gave way. TOP OF THE CHARTS dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but yielded turning for home
and weakened through the lane. DRIVE FOR FUN lacked speed in the three path and tired along the rail entering the lane.

MOREAU stalked along the inside, took aim in the four path entering the lane, bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear in the final sixteenth. CHIRON vied
three wide, led turning for home, cleared in upper stretch, met an outer bid at the furlong grounds and got bested a sixteenth later. SMILE MON broke
slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path, then stayed on between horses to gain show at the furlong pole. TIZ WICKED STRONG was jostled between
horses at the start, saved ground far back, improved in upper stretch, but failed to split rivals while blocked at the furlong grounds. REDEMPTION TIME
tracked two wide and between horses, but was floated to the five path entering the lane and gave way. TRUMPTASTIC dueled for the lead along the inside,
but was headed turning for home and weakened in upper stretch. SHERIFF RONNIE bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path around the
turn, and failed to menace. BRIGADE COMMANDER bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed three wide, but faded after being floated to the six path
entering the lane. PURSUIT OF POWER tracked five wide, but weakened while fanning seven wide entering the lane. GILDED CRAKEN dueled for the lead
two wide and between horses, but wilted turning for home.
