SPIRIT OF WINDSOR raced with the pace two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over. MR
CHANCE ROMANCE in the final strides. The latter raced with the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Spirit Of Windsor from the seven sixteenths pole,
contested the rail on the far turn, dueled gamely to the finish but relented the nod in the final strides. SEATTLE SAILAWAY was shut off shortly after the
start then saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came along for third. GET OFF MY
CLOUD stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. ORANGEBURG saved
early ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE ducked in
shortly after the start, rounded the opening turn in the three path and showed little response. ROCKET'S CASTLE settled off the rail on the first turn, showed
no response through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the far turn but was eased mid-stretch and vanned off sore.

Footnotes
REDWHITEANDTACOS ducked out and made contact with Kobe's Girl leaving the gate then moved to the inside and rated the pace, was given rein leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn then only flagged in the lane. PRUSSIAN BLUE rated close inside, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. TOUT ENSEMBLE saved ground, bid past the seven
sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. IF THEN exchanged contact with Decisive Cause
leaving the gate, raced in the three and four paths on the first turn then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path but drifted into the lane and flattened stride. HELLUVA LADY broke awkwardly and was bumped outward and into Decisive Cause, raced off the
rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. I B NASTY was not a factor. GOSSIPING hesitated at the break, raced in the four
path on the first turn and showed little response. KOBE'S GIRL was bumped outward and into Helluva Lady leaving the gate then stalked two deep, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and weakened. DECISIVE CAUSE exchanged contact with If Then leaving the gate
and was slammed sharply by Helluva Lady shortly afterward, left the first turn outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
TURTLE DOVE was firmly rated to set the pace, kept the edge over Lovetheband leaving the seven sixteenths pole, pulled briefly clear past the five
sixteenths, raced near the rail on the far turn and held on under steady handling. BAD LINEAGE rounded the first turn about the six path, left the turn
outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in through the stretch to take second under the
wire. LOVETHEBAND stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but
relented to the winner and was nipped from second under the wire. ZIGGY STARDUST settled off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
raced in the three path on the far turn and relented in the duel through the stretch. DR RENDEZVOUS flipped in the gate which necessitated a late rider
change, settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. CRUISE ON
BY raced well off the pace inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then eased outward toward
the head of the lane and showed little more. CHARITABLE WINDSOR stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then
faded in the four path on the far turn. LAST OF BAD BOYS showed little response.

Footnotes
MACHEN'S RIDGE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and
dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. HIS ROYAL G bore out on the opening turn, recovered stride approaching the three eighths pole,
raced close in the three path of the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. NOTION TO TAPIT saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. A FAREWELL YODEL saved
ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. BOP
MARLEY stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, but dropped back
toward mid-stretch and flattened later yards. LEG UP raced three wide on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail and showed little in the lane. ROLL DEM BONES was carried out into the first turn but corrected course midway through the turn, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. ROCK FILE was never a factor. STRINGFELLA was carried wide on the
opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BABY BULLDOG was not a factor. The Stewards posted the inquiry and disqualified His
Royal to ninth place for carrying rivals wide on the first turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN KEY was hustled clear and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, his rider lost his whip entering the
stretch but held on well with an aggressive hand ride. STRONG FIBER chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in to clear second later yards.
PENGUIN POWER chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn near the rail, relented second mid-stretch but held on for third. BUBBA GRUMP
angled to the outside to give chase, raced in the five path on the turn, left the turn outside and ran evenly in the lane. JEFFERSON NATIVE exchanged
contact with BLACK CANDY leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in range of the lead in the three path on the turn but flattened stride inside the eighth
pole. The latter exchanged contact with Jefferson Native leaving the gate then gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the three path and
flattened stride in the lane. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN chased the early pace toward mid track and showed little in the lane.

pace and raced close in the three path of the turn, but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. BESTLA was bumped outward and into Supersnake
leaving the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. COWGIRL

through the turn but flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL chased, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and passed some
