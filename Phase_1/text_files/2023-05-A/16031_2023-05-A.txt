ALBAYAADER (IRE) bobbled leaving the gate, stalked two wide into the turn, waited behind the top trio around the bend, angled outside the leaders at the
top of the stretch, drew alongside with a furlong to go and proved best in the final sixteenth. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES prompted the pace from outside then
vied between rivals around the bend, took a narrow lead into the stretch, battled to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late. SHE'S GOT A WAY was
up close early three deep, battled three wide through the turn, fought to deep stretch and faltered late. ICE QUEEN chased outside rivals then angled to the
inside leaving the backstretch, saved ground inching closer on the turn, moved out in the lane but lacked room from upper to midstretch, steered down to
the inside with a sixteenth to and finished evenly late. DENDERA stalked three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then lacked room from the
quarter pole to the top of the lane, angled out in the drive and lacked a rally. REAL FIRE was off a bit slow, chased four wide into the turn, moved into the
three path around the bend, tipped back out into the lane and weakened. BALI DANCER set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, vied inside a pair
through the turn, lost command into the stretch, remained close into the final furlong, lost her path at the sixteenth pole and weakened.

SPOILED ROTTEN stalked in hand to the inside of the pacesetter early, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, split the top pair in upper stretch and drove
clear. BACK ON THE STREET stalked off the rail, bid two wide past the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, fought with SPOILED ROTTEN into the
final furlong and was outkicked in the late stages. PARCO climbed early behind rivals, ran up heels approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, ridden along the
rail through the turn, angled out in the stretch and gained the show. RUN FOR MY HONEY tracked two wide into the turn, came three wide into the stretch
and failed to respond in the lane. BLURSDAY was fractious in the gate, took control early and set the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail through the
turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened after. IT'S SAUL RIGHT chased at the back under coaxing, navigated the turn three then four wide and
came up empty.

Footnotes
MI HERMANO RAMON settled inside early then moved into the two path for the clubhouse turn, tracked two wide through the far turn before angling four
wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top trio and got up in time. WIZARD OF WESTWOOD bobbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly and went up to
clear the field, controlled the pace on the front end to the far turn, pressured from a pair of rivals with a quarter mile remaining, maintained command into the
final sixteenth and got nailed by the winner. ESCAPE ARTIST rated in the three path, challenged three deep with a quarter mile remaining, finished willingly
through the lane but lacked the needed late kick in the deep stretch. GAME TIME stalked from inside behind the pacesetter, saved ground through the far
turn, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a slim opening midstretch but had the hole close in the final sixteenth halting any late momentum. MALIBU
COAST pulled while up close in the two path early, was closest in pursuit into the far turn, bid two wide at the quarter pole, fought between into the stretch,
then flattened in the furlong grounds. EASTBOUND was a bit rank first time through the stretch, chased four then three wide at the back on the clubhouse
turn, trailed three wide into the second bend, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
KISS MY KAT stumbled a bit leaving the gate, went up to set the pace with CARELESS STAR to the outside, cleared that rival on the turn, showed the way
along the inside into the lane, inched away in upper stretch under hand urging, was urged mildly with the right hand in deep stretch and held safely. NEVER
SWAY stalked two then three wide, put in a late bid from outside but was not enough. TEEN DRAMA stalked the pace from inside into and around the bend,
put in a mild late bid in the deep stretch and gained the show. BIG BELL was off slow from outside, raced three wide near the back into the turn, moved into
the two path briefly before steering out and entered the stretch four wide, kept on through the drive and earned a minor award. ROSES R BLUE was off
slow took a bump from outside leaving the gate, trailed inside then moved to the two path, angled four wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
CARELESS STAR pressed the pace from outside, chased the winner two wide around the bend, asked right-handed into the lane and flattened out.
TROJAN WAY broke in and bumped rival, saved ground off the pace and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SILVER SURFER (GB) stalked the pace from the fence, waited behind the leaders on the far turn, gained an opening entering the stretch, quickly challenge
inside the top pair, took over past the eighth pole, cleared briefly with a sixteenth to go and held late. BALLADEER was closest in pursuit from the two path,
bid two then three wide leaving second bend, fought three deep into the final furlong and got outkicked by the winner. RECKLESS SPIRIT raced two wide
then moved to the inside while near the back on the clubhouse turn, went between rivals leaving the backstretch and had to check entering the far turn,
swung five wide into the stretch, put in a late bid and missed the place. COALINGA ROAD angled to the inside quickly while dropping back, remained inside
to the far turn, swung out late on the bend and further out to be widest in upper stretch, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. TROPICAL
TERROR settled inside, moved out on the far turn and came three wide into the stretch, steadied in upper stretch before angling down the inside and kept
on to improve placings. SUBSIDIZE tracked in the two path, steered out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, took aim four deep in upper stretch
and lacked the needed late kick. ANMER HALL set the pace ono the inside, challenged by outer rival at the quarter pole, resisted to the eighth pole, then
relinquished the lead to the winner and weakened. BLETCHLEY PARK broke a step slow, raced three then two wide off the pace around the first turn, went
three deep into the second bend, dropped back to last and moved into the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DEVIL BE ME stalked the top pair up the backstretch, loomed around the turn before offering a bid three deep exiting the bend, cleared in upper stretch and
drew away. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME was off slow to begin, advanced up the backstretch and two to three wide on the turn, lacked room into the lane,
brushed with outer rival in upper stretch and gained a clear path, then finished willingly but was no match for the winner. BIG BET JAFINSAFA was off slow
and trailed early, advanced from inside then two wide on the turn, shifted back to the inside at the top of the lane but lacked room and had to throw the
brakes on, altered out and finished determinedly to gain the show honors. COWBOY MIKE tracked outside a rival early, three to four wide on the turn,
brushed with inner rival in upper stretch and flattened in the drive. CAROL'S COMIC broke well then dropped back early, took the turn two to three wide,
angled out in the lane and improved placings. IMPERIAL HORNET was off slow and lost path leaving the gate, chased five wide into the turn, moved into
the four path around the bend, tipped out in the drive and lacked a rally. NEVER NOT ONCE raced in mid-pack off the rail into the turn, spun five wide into
the drive and weakened. MY RANSOM chased four then three wide around the bend and failed to menace. BAILEY'S BUDGET bumped leaving the gate,
went up to duel for command from outside, fought through the turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. BIG BABY stalked the pace
from inside, lost some ground on the turn, found traffic at the sixteenth pole while not in the hunt late. TOM HORN dueled for the lead along the inside,
battled around the turn and vied inside a pair of rivals at the top of the lane, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. DADDY'S QUEST hit the gate
and bumped inner rival at the start, got crowded between rivals up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the inside around the bend
and came up empty.

FAST BUCK set the pace under pressure from inner rival to the turn, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole and moved inside, held a comfortable lead into the
final furlong and held safely under a drive. STANDING O sat off the pace, took a bump from outer rival after crossing the dirt, steered down to the inside, got
boxed in on the turn then bumped with outer rival exiting the bend, finished well through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. HARBORED
MEMORIES was up close early three deep, chased the leader two wide around the turn, failed to produce a bid in the furlong grounds but stayed on to
secure third. DESMOND DOSS got bumped twice and had to take up in the beginning, raced three wide into the turn then had to alter out around trouble
rival midway around the bend, steered back inward on the turn, summoned a late rally and rounded out the superfecta. MUCHO DEL ORO raced up close
three deep then had to steady early when losing path, chased two wide around the turn, bumped with inner rival entering the lane and flattened out. ONE
FLEW SOUTH bumped twice leaving the gate, bumped with inner rival after crossing the dirt, chased four then three deep on the turn and flattened. DON'T
SWEAR DAVE pressed the pace from inside, lost touch with the leader at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. SAMBURU (GB) bumped and
had to steady in the beginning, raced two wide into the drive, moved out in the lane and was not a factor. RESPECT THE CODE bumped leaving the gate,
lost his path crossing the dirt, tracked three deep into the turn, got put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole and faded.

Footnotes
LOVESICK BLUES dropped back early then advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, drew closer around the bend and bid three deep at the quarter
pole, drifted to the rail in the furlong grounds and held safely in the end. DIVINE ARMOR tracked off the rail, went two wide into the turn, got boxed in
around the bend, shifted four wide into the clear entering the stretch and finished willingly to gain on the winner late. ESCAPE ROUTE forwardly placed from
inside early, coaxed along past the five-sixteenths pole then had to pause behind the leader, altered out in upper stretch then altered out again midstretch
and kept on to gain third. DISCO BALL set the pace under pressure early, held a short lead along the rail through the turn, lost command into the stretch
and weakened. MURRAY raced outside a rival at the back, asked while angling out around the bend, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.
KINGDOM HEART pressed the pace from outside, fought between into the lane and faded. KAHUNA MAGIC raced along the rail at the back into the turn,
eased out around the bend and trailed five wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NINEELEVENTURBO bumped into the first turn, started to tug the rider along around that bend and backstretch, tracked outside a rival, lacked room on the
far turn, angled four wide into the clear entering the stretch, dueled into the furlong grounds and drove clear. SO I'M TOLD stalked two wide early, moved to
the three path to take aim at the top pair leaving the far turn, gained command in upper stretch, lost command past the eighth pole and kept on to secure the
place. TALLIS bumped leaving the gate, chased along the rail then bumped with outer rival into the first turn, remained inside through the second bend,
lacked room in upper stretch, found room in the final furlong and finished willingly from inside. DERECHO DANDY dropped back early, had to alter wide into
the first turn to avoid troubled rival, steered back inward around that bend, went two wide into the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, produced a mild
rally and rounded out the superfecta. FROST ALERT bumped leaving the gate, got put in tight along the rail and checked shortly after, altered around
troubled rival into the first turn, settled off the pace in the middle stages, went two to three wide around the far turn and kept on through the lane.
GOLDENEYE dueled for command along the rail into the first turn, inched ahead to take control around the bend, headed again past the quarter pole, lost
command in upper stretch and weakened after. NUMERO DIX (GB) was off slow to begin, altered wide around the first turn, trailed on the inside to two wide
on the far turn and passed tired rivals. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS stalked in the three path early, ran three then four wide on the second bend, got floated out
into the stretch and weakened. THIRTY FOUR COUPE dueled three wide into the first turn then pressed the pace around the bend, kept the pressure on to
the far turn, raced on even terms again past the quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. KO SAMUI
(IRE) bumped leaving the gate, raced between rivals early and bumped when put in tight and clipped heels unseating the rider in the process, was
eventually caught by the outrider following the race and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INOLVING THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE
FIRST TURN AND RULED THAT KO SAMUI (IRE) CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
