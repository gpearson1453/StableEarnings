Footnotes
LIVE AID angled in setting the pace, vied to midstretch and edged clear while kept to a drive. QUASAR engaged the winner outside on the then weakened
in the final furlong. ANGINETTI moved inside on the turn then rallied mildly for the show. KENAI COOL dropped back early then offered some energy
outside while no threat. MS. MALEVOLENCE prompted the pace between rivals down the backstretch and faded. EXCITABLE LADY stalked inside the
dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch and proved empty. FALL CAMPAIGN was urged off the leaders early and gradually weakened. J J LOVES BILLY
broke slowest and was never a factor.

on. PENANCE raced three or four wide off the pace, moved up on the turn, came five wide into the lane, commenced a late rally outside and was closed the
gap quickly the final yards. BLUNT FORCE chased on the inside, rallied inside in the stretch drive and was gaining late. ADHWAA raced two wide off the
pace, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly between foes. FAST INTENTIONS raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly in the three path.
REITERATE chased three wide, advanced on the turn, rallied in the stretch and was outkicked. KNOCK OUT KID raced three wide off the pace and did not
factor. THE BIGGEST ONE chased between rivals, chased on the turn and gave way. PER RULING #24010PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING

ESCANDALO saved ground, bid to the front at the quarter pole and pulled away driving. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO lagged far behind early inside, angled
out in the stretch rallying and narrowed the gap. COLLEGE TRY trailed for half a mile, advanced inside, was in a bit tight at the quarter pole then finished
well. COUSIN MARIE prompted the pace outside and continued willingly in the stretch. AZTEC QUEEN dropped off the pace three wide and failed to rally.
GLADIATORA lacked speed outside and gave way readily. QUEENPIN set a pressured pace, shook loose into the far turn then stopped in the stretch.

LULINDA'S HEART threw her head after the break and was away awkwardly, trailed the field, moved up inside on the turn, came two wide into the lane,
rallied on the rail, finished well and was along late to win going away. SWEET LILLY FACTUM raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the turn,
rallied outside, moved to the front passing the furlong marker, edged away, then yielded to the winner. TWIRLING WIND raced off the pace between rivals,
angled out entering the stretch, rallied mildly outside and got up for third. POWWA OF LOVE vied outside for the early lead, took over on the turn, dueled to
midstretch and then weakened. DON'T TELL FRANKIE raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn and had no rally. YELLOW DRESS vied for the
early lead, then stalked, chased on the turn and faded. FROSTED WILD RIDE vied inside for the lead, chased on the turn and gave way.

DRENA'S BULLET rated inside, split foes to the lead midway on the final turn then quickly pulled away while kept to the task. SCREEN SAVER settled off
the pace between rivals then rallied to gain the place. DISTRACTANDATTACK set a pressured pace inside, lost the lead on the final turn and weakened.
RELISHMENT chased four wide off the pace and lacked a solid rally. SAMURAI SAINT trailed for half a mile then passed fading rivals. MUCHO MACHO
EDDIE forced the pace outside for five furlongs then weakened. MIRACLE SILVER reserved off the leaders inside and never a factor. OFF THE MEDS was
fanned very wide into the first turn, raced close up and stopped.

JARLIAN stalked the pace outside, took over midway on the turn, moved clear and just lasted. ENRAGED settled off the pace outside then made as gradual
late gain and just missed. MANAHAWKIN lacked speed, advanced outside and was up for show late. POSITIVELY AWESOME angled to a clear lead inside
then was finished before half a mile. SPLITZVILLE trailed to the stretch then caught fading rivals. MAGNETRON raced just off the leaders outside then
began fading on the turn. NINE TOE JOHNNY was in tight inside at the nine sixteenths pole and gave way. TRADERS LUCK was unruly and injured at the
gate and ordered a late scratch.

Footnotes
EARLY EDITION settled behind the dueling leaders, bid inside on the turn, swung wide advancing into the stretch then surged away in the final furlong.
CENTRE COURT CHAMP vied for the advantage between rivals, led at the quarter pole, dropped back briefly then came again for the place. SHERO
moved up quickly inside, angled out on the turn, led narrowly in midstretch then tired. IN MY OPINION lagged far behind then offered some late energy
while no threat. HEY MAMALUKE vied inside rivals to the stretch and faltered. MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE steadied in tight early then was never a factor.
DECO STRONG lacked speed four wide down the backstretch and was no menace. GOLDEN TABBY vied between rivals early, eased back into the far
turn and faded. AKEMI earned a narrow advantage in four wide duel opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

sixteenth, gained late and was just up at the wire. NORLANDER pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the turn, put a head in front, drew clear
passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely and was nailed in the final jump. RUN FOR KARL chased two wide, then three wide on the turn, rallied three wide
into the stretch, bid at the eighth pole and was outkicked. JSK PHARAOH'SREIGN was bumped at the start, pulled early on, eased back off the pace,
chased on the turn and finished evenly. IT'S A PITY was bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and tired. STORMY FIRE trailed
on the inside, saved ground on the turn and improved his position through the lane. CAYMAN'S SECRET raced off the rail, off the pace and gave way. POP
