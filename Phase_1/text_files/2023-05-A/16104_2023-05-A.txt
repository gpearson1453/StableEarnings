Footnotes
BIG DON'S SMILING assumed command after an alert beginning, cleared to the rail and set a decent pace into the turn, was well handled through
moderate fractions on the turn, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure from the oncoming runner-up and kept to task in the final stages to
prevail. G'S LAST CHANCE hopped leaving the break and was off a step slowly, recovered to be not far back from the decent pace heading to the turn,
raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker, was roused three wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong pole, closed well in deep stretch, put
mild pressure on the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. BRONZE ONE forwardly placed in the early running, pressed the decent pace into the
turn and kept close attendance to BIG DON'S SMILING along the bend, chased the winner to mid-stretch, tired in the final stages and was well clear at the
finish for third. PRACTICAL BID asked for early speed leaving the start, settled just off of the decent early pace while saving ground, lost position at the
quarter marker, was outrun to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. GATO NEGRO chased the decent early pace, raced two wide between runners along
the turn, lost ground at the quarter marker, was outrun in the stretch and did not factor in the final stages.

Footnotes
EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER settled off of the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, was well
placed into the second turn, roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed at mid-stretch, took command approaching the sixteenth-marker and
drove clear under firm handling in the final stages. WALKING BOSS unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced at the
half-mile pole, raced two wide into the second turn, waited a bit for racing room at the quarter marker, slipped to the rail heading into the stretch, was full of
run approaching the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and closed willingly in the final strides to secure the place.
BRONZE WARRIOR hustled to establish the early lead, set a solid pace into the backstretch run, rated kindly through moderate fractions to the half-mile
pole, showed the way to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and held foes at bay to mid-stretch, was overtaken by EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER
nearing the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished by WALKING BOSS for the place in the final strides and held safely at the end for the show. MY SUNSHINE
settled off of the quick early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile pole, maintained a rail trip to the quarter
marker, advanced in upper stretch and came within aim at the furlong grounds, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked.
COOLCROSS took back off of the solid early pace, advanced along the backstretch run and raced within aim at the half-mile pole, was well positioned while
three wide into the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, could not sustain that bid in the final furlong and gave way in deep stretch. KIWI'S DREAM
(AUS) forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the solid pace along the first turn, advanced on the pacesetter along the backstretch run, maintained his
position while two wide approaching the quarter marker, dropped back in the drive and tired in the final stages.

WORK TO LIVE broke alertly, was asked to show early speed and established the lead into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run,
maintained a comfortable lead to the quarter marker, raced in hand to the top of the lane, kept to task to deep stretch, drew to a clear lead in the final stages
and held sway at the finish. PERSUASIVE LIPS forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, maintained her
position while two deep on the second turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds while within aim, could not make headway on her stablemate in deep stretch,
was outfinished in the final stages and held for the place. SHEZAGHOST tracked the decent early pace, raced two wide into the backstretch run, slipped to
the rail nearing the half-mile pole, maintained her position to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed late response and was
outkicked, while clear of the rest for the show. MOMMA MOCCA was allowed to settle early on while never far back, saved ground into the backstretch run,
was steered three wide into the far turn, gained ground approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole and flattened out in the final stages.

marker, battled with her stablemate to mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong pole and edged away in the final stages to prove best. ANNA'S
MUSIC showed good early speed and dictated terms into the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, came under pressure from DOLCE GHOST in
upper stretch, met that bid to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with her stablemate in the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch to secure the place.
ALFONSIA chased the decent early pace from the inside, gained ground at the quarter marker, was angled three wide for the drive, continued to gain
ground approaching the furlong marker, slipped back to the inside inside of the furlong pole, lacked the needed late response and was outkicked by the top
pair, while clear of the rest for the show. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE settled off of the decent early pace, improved position on the turn, slipped to the rail and
gained ground at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run in the final stages and flattened out. MOJAVE PRINCESS chased the decent early fractions
while outside of rivals, was steered four wide into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. WINSOME ROSE a bit slow into stride early on, raced four
wide into the turn, slipped to the two path heading into the stretch and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO SHINY showed good early speed and established the lead into the first turn, set decent fractions into the backstretch run, was well rated to the
second turn while holding a comfortable lead, was challenged at the quarter marker by FEELING FLUSH, turned that rival away in upper stretch and was
set down for the drive, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch, was confronted again by FEELING FLUSH inside of the sixteenth-marker, dug in
while fully extended in the final strides and lasted for the win. FEELING FLUSH forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the decent fractions through the
backstretch run, advanced on SHE'S SO SHINY nearing the quarter marker, was repelled in that effort and chased SHE'S SO SHINY into upper stretch,
re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, made steady headway on SHE'S SO SHINY in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and just
missed for the win, while holding safely for the place. BIG FAME crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, raced
outside of rivals into the backstretch run, made a steady gain to the second turn, maintained her three wide path to the top of the lane, was gaining in the
final furlong, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and held safely for the show at the finish. TIZ A TIGER settled in the early stages while not far
back, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, rallied in upper stretch, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked in the final
stages. LIGHT UP a bit keen in the early running, took back off of the decent pace and raced between rivals into the backstretch run, maintained her
position to the second turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed four wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong pole, could not sustain
that run through the final stages and gave way.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE prominent into the first turn, attended to the decent fractions through the backstretch run, stalked STORMIN GALILEO to the second
turn, was roused at the top of the lane, overtook STORMIN GALILEO and was set down for the drive, drew to a clear lead inside of the furlong pole, was
kept to task to deep stretch and was ridden out in the final stages to be much the best. NIGHT PROOF unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the
backstretch run, maintained his position to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive, was full of run nearing mid-stretch, could not match strides with the
winner inside of the furlong pole, ran on in deep stretch and held for the place. SIPPIN N KISSIN was forwardly placed in the early running, raced three wide
along the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, lost ground three wide on the far turn, was steered four wide into the stretch, lacked
a response in the drive, passed tiring rivals in the final stages and just missed for the place, while clear of the rest for the show. ACCLIDER settled just off of
the decent early pace, raced two wide into the backstretch run, was well placed to the half-mile marker, raced within aim to the quarter pole, was coaxed
three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and lacked a response in the final stages. STORMIN GALILEO was asked to show early speed
and established the lead into the first turn, set decent fractions into the backstretch run, was prompted by AUSPICIOUS STYLE into the far turn, held that
foe at bay to the quarter marker, was overtaken by AUSPICIOUS STYLE in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. STATE OF THE UNION broke a step
slowly, settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, raced two wide through the backstretch run, maintained that two wide path to the second turn,
made a mild advance into upper stretch but could not sustain that bid through the drive and did not threaten.

Footnotes
LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM close up in the early stages, tracked the fast pace into the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, made a steady gain on
EVENEREVENWORSE in upper stretch, drew to even terms with that rival inside of the furlong pole, dueled to deep stretch under firm handling and
determinedly won the nod on the wire to prevail. EVENEREVENWORSE showed speed and dictated terms early on, set fast fractions while well handled
through the turn, held a comfortable lead into upper stretch, raced in hand to the furlong marker, was confronted by LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM inside of the
furlong pole, met that bid to deep stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth and was gamely bested at the finish, while clear of the rest for second. SAINT
IVES stalked the fast early pace, saved ground along the turn, was angled three wide for the drive, made a mild gain at the furlong pole, closed in deep
stretch, could not catch the top pair and held safely in the end for third. HEY MATE chased the fast pace from the rail, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was gaining
inside of the furlong pole but could not reel in the leaders in the final stages. NEWPARK (IRE) prominent in the early running, came in tight in the first
furlong, became a bit rank and took up at the half-mile pole, chased the fast pace three wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch and offered a mild rally
in the final furlong. CREATIVE PEAK lunged leaving the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be close to the fast pace heading into the turn, lost
ground while three wide on the bend, was coaxed four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. DR PESCADO
lacked early speed, raced two then three wide to the quarter marker, rallied in the late stages but was unable to threaten at the finish.

Footnotes
CANDY'S CLONE stalked the decent early pace, raced two wide between rivals into the turn, chased the leaders to the quarter marker, was roused three
wide into the stretch, loomed at mid-stretch, vied for the lead with MISS UNION at the furlong marker, showed a good late kick to shake free from the
runner-up and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. MISS UNION rated just off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn, angled four wide
into the stretch drive, was full of run approaching the furlong pole, could not keep pace with CANDY'S CLONE in deep stretch and was outfinished, while
besting the rest. ZAZEN bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the decent pace into the
turn, raced a bit in tight entering the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, re-rallied at mid-stretch, lacked the
needed response in the final stages and was outkicked, while holding safely for third. TAMANTARI stalked the decent early pace, lost ground while three
deep on the turn, was steered four wide into the stretch and lacked a late response. LADY'S SERMON chased the decent early fractions, was steered three
wide into the turn, slipped to the rail heading into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. DULCE EMMA prominent early on and pressed the decent pace
into the turn, kept close attendance to HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN to the quarter marker, vied for the lead with a host of rivals in upper stretch, chased while
still within aim at the furlong grounds and tired in deep stretch. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while pressed into the
turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
SWALL stumbled slightly at the break after making light contact with GADDING, then was rushed to the lead to duel outside of TESSA (GB) and FIVE
O'COCKTAIL, was always traveling well, responded willingly when asked to pick up the pace past the three furlong pole, disposed of FIVE O'COCKTAIL at
that point then battled a game TESSA (GB) in the stretch, finally got the better of that rival passing the furlong marker then drew off to under a hand ride.
TESSA (GB) broke well and was part of the early speed duel racing on the inside, continued on through the turn battling gamely with SWALL, held on well to
the furlong grounds but was outfinished by the winner but well clear of the third horse. GADDING was off a bit slow then tracked the field through the first
quarter mile while staying in the clear to the outside, made a strong move through the turn under a strong hand ride and continued to run on through the
stretch to gain the third spot. STORMY ROUGE broke alertly but was taken in hand and backed off the early speed duel, was let loose with a half mile to
run, entered the stretch on the wrong lead, lugged in a bit in mid-stretch and finished evenly. HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) off a beat slowly then rushed up to
join the early mix, lost some ground to the leaders through the turn but kept to task and managed to hold position to the finish. SWEET LAYLA RAE broke
well but was outrun despite the best efforts of the rider, settled mid-pack while holding the rail position down the backstretch, lost more ground through the
turn then mustered a moderate rally under strong handling but was unable to make an impact. BOBBY'S GENIE broke well then sat just off the speed duel,
was asked to go after the leaders passing the half-mile marker, made a mild move through the turn but stalled at the top of the stretch and finished up
one-paced. FIVE O COCKTAIL broke sharply and was the middle of a three-horse speed duel through the early stages, struggled to keep up passing the
three furlong marker and weakened in stretch. OUR KENTUCKY ROSE broke out at the start, fell well behind early, made some forward progress through
the turn while under a drive then hand nothing left for the stretch run while racing a bit greenly in the lane. UNION HARBOR broke out sharply at the break,
throwing the rider off balance, spotted the field many lengths, chased the field to the turn and did not factor.
