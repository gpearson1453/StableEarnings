CHEER UP vied for the lead with WUMPMUG in opening stages, battled on into upper stretch, dug in determinedly, took a clear lead at the furlong marker
and prevailed under a driving finish. ACELA EXPRESS tracked the embattled trio in early stages, launched a four wide bid turning for home, steadily
advanced through the lane but could not reach the winner in time. WUMPMUG dueled three deep for the early lead, fought on with CHEER UP into upper
stretch, could not match strides nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. FEELSSOGOODINLOVE vied then continued up close for the lead around the
turn, cut the corner and continued in strong contention then came up empty mid-stretch. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS raced off the early pace, swung four wide
entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. SHY RUNNER raced off the pace, came two wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

LAWLESS JOHN set a pressured pace then vied for the lead around the turn, battled on into upper stretch, found another kick in reserve near the furlong
marker and edged away. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH raced off the pace along the inside, given cue two wide entering upper stretch, steadily edged up closer
but could not reach the winner. FRANKLYGREAT was not too far back early on, angled two wide and got in a bit tight midway around the turn, hustled up
along the inside heading into the lane, briefly held a slight lead then flattened out. ESPE'S GUY raced in contention tracking the early pace, launched a bid
near the quarter pole, continued in contention entering the lane then ran on evenly in the final furlong. TAP ON BY pressed the pace in opening stages then
dueled around the turn, could not move on with the leaders past upper stretch and flattened out. ONE SOCK BILLY ranged up four wide into closer
contention mid-way around the turn, swung wide into the lane, continued along the outside and needed more for impact. MACH SWEDE sat off the early
pace, came three wide into the lane, angled out wider in upper stretch and failed to kick on. LET'S ROCK N ROLL showed brief interest then steadily

sixteenth left to run and edged away. REDNECKERTHANYOU set a pressured pace, led the way into the stretch, continued to battle on with a slim lead
then got denied late. WARREN L raced off the early pace, edged up closer around the turn, came four to five wide into the lane and gained a share. LEAPIN
TY MAN tracked the early pace, continued in contention four wide into the lane then evened out in the final furlong. LATE FOR LUNCH hopped at the start
and came away a step slow, saved ground then shifted three wide turning for home and lacked a rally. EVIL KNIEVEL lacked speed, raced in the back and
lacked a needed rally. ROWDY RAY raced in range heading into the turn, hustled up turning for home but had no late response. BIG PINES SANDY raced
off the early pace, hustled along four wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. STAR OF MINE tracked midpack along the inside, cut the

Footnotes
CALL ME Q raced up close three wide entering the turn, launched a four wide bid turning for home, dug in under pressure and drew clear.
JUSTASTROLLIN vied for the lead around the turn, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch, could not move on with the winner nearing the
furlong marker and held place. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD raced near midpack, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, moved up into close
contention and stayed on for a share. SAY IT NICELY raced in range through middle stages, swung five wide into the lane and needed more for late impact.
CASEY'S LAW raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into stretch run, came in a path a furlong out and failed to kick on. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL
got bumped at the start and raced off the early pace, swung five wide turning for home and lacked a needed rally. SUCCESSION settled off the early
leaders, hustled along four wide into stretch run and failed to make an impact. C R INSTA GATOR raced near midpack, continued in range upper stretch
then gave way. A BRUSH OF LUCK showed little. GONE WITH THE FINN vied for the lead around the turn and had nothing left in the lane.
