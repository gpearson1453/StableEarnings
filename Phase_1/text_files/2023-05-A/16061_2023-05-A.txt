Footnotes
FROSTY THE GIANT pressed the leader from the outside entering the turn, bid nearing the lane, led in upper stretch, and drove clear at the furlong
grounds. WEST SARATOGA chased along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch before bidding for place along with an outer rival at the sixteenth
pole, and held that position from that one thereafter. PATCH O'BRIEN chased from the three path, then stayed on in the four path to bid for place entering
the sixteenth pole along with an inner foe, but was for place denied by that rival late. FIVE STAR RUN lacked speed in the two path around turn, improved
inside of rivals in upper stretch, and ran on. DUNPHY set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, and weakened
on his left lead. FIVE O' SOMEWHERE broke slowly, gained midpack position along the inside entering the turn, shifted out entering the lane, but lacked a
bid. INNOCENT MAN took mild bumps from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to five path, and failed to factor. IMPERIAL THUNDER
bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from off of the pace in the five to six path, and made little impact. MIDNIGHT STORMY broke slowly and never
got involved from the five path. NUEVO AMANECER steadied soon after the start when an outer rival took his path, then saved ground far back to no avail.
NOBLE GENTLEMAN broke a step slow, and was outrun in the three to four path.

Footnotes
CLOSING ACT broke a step slowly, tracked two wide and between horses around the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, then sustained a grinding
charge to bid in the closing stages and edged ahead. FOOLISH FRONT FIFI brushed with an outer rival in the early stages, chased along the inside, rallied
with good energy three wide and between horses entering the final sixteenth, sparred with an outer rival late, but got outfinished. KRICKLE pressed outside
of the top pair, sustained a chase to bid along with rivals on either side in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by them. TOO FAST FOR YOU set the pace
along the inside, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was overhauled in the final sixteenth. APRIL CLOVER prompted the pace two wide,
chased the clear leader in upper stretch, and gave way in the final furlong. YOU'RE KITTEN ME backed out from between horses entering the lane, and
failed to factor two wide. GIRLS WEEKEND veered outwardly while off very slow, was urged along in the four path around the turn, and tired in the six path
in upper stretch. BELLA VALENTINA brushed with an inner rival early on, and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
TELL ME WHEN set the pace along the inside, and held well from outer chasers through the lane. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY laid closer up along the inside
while pulling under stout restraint leading the chute, steadied along from the eleven sixteenths pole to the nine sixteenths pole, stalked along the inside
around the turn, tipped to the three path to take aim outside of the leader entering the lane, but failed to progress on that one through the final furlong, and
held place late. GHOSTLY GIRL tracked two wide and between horses, but retreated to trail passing the three furlong pole, tipped three wide turning for
home, rallied inside of foes in upper stretch before shifting out at the furlong grounds, and stayed on but did not have enough to gain place. FRIGID LADY
laid off of the pace four wide, spun into the lane in the six path, and lacked a bid. MEAN SUE tracked three wide, came into the lane in the five path while
between horses and weakened. CHARLEE MAE pressed two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
LAZARUS stalked three wide, bid entering the lane, and edged clear. ISOCLINE set the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the lane, and gave
way yet held place. CROSSING was taken back leaving the chute, chased from behind the leaders around the turn, and ran on thereafter without enough to
reach place. LITTLE MAN CAN laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then was one paced. BODONTKNOW lagged
along the inside and never got involved. PERFECT THUNDER pressed two wide and between horses, then weakened nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TIBERIUS MERCURIUS vied for the lead two wide, led narrowly in hand around the far turn, then sparred with his inner counterpart through the lane via a
long battle, and won the nod at the wire. HARLAN ESTATE set the pace inside of a vying rival, was roused while headed around the far turn, gamely
prolonged the war through the lane, but narrowly lost the head bob at the wire. VINTAGE PRINT tracked three wide, chased outside of the embattled
leading pair around the far turn, then failed to gain through the lane and held show. DASH ATTACK pursued from off of the pace two wide and between
horses, tipped four wide in upper stretch, and offered a mild kick. VIVAR laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, eased back to trail leaving the
nine sixteenths pole, swung out six wide approaching midstretch, and stayed on. FOUNDER saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. TOMMY BEE
stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, and weakened. FENWICK STATION got a bit crowded between horses soon after the
start, settled off of the pace while hung four wide around both turns, then tired between horses after being floated five wide in upper stretch.

PRINCESSTAPITURE dueled for the lead two wide, drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, and held sway safely late. LA CUMPARSITA lacked speed four
wide around the turn, then stayed on in the six path to gain place leaving the sixteenth pole, and was slowly but belatedly gaining on the leader.
INVALUABLE chased the dueling leaders from the three path, pursued from the five path while failing to keep pace with the clearing eventual winner in
upper stretch, bid for place entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked shortly after. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI lacked speed two wide, chased between
horses in midstretch, attempted a bid for show inside of INVALUABLE late, but did not have enough. LI'L GRAZEN dueled for the lead inside of the eventual
winner, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole, shifted outwardly in upper stretch, but continued to weaken between horses. EVERYOTHERWON chased
along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
GIANT GAME set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of outer pressers around the far turn, and gamely held a margin from TIWANAKU
through the lane. TIWANAKU pressed two wide and from between horses, vied around the far turn, sparred through the lane while not quite at even terms,
and was kept at bay. THE PRINCE'S SPUR stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn, failed to keep pace between horses in upper stretch, and held
show. BOLZY tracked four wide, then chased while dueling for show through the lane, but was denied that position. O CAPTAIN laid off of the pace three
wide, attempted to inch closer five wide around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. PRINCIPE D'ORO stuttered a step at the start, was keen to
place behind the leaders early on, settled into stalking stride down the backstretch, vacated the rail around the far turn, then lacked a rail rally after tipping
back in. COUSIN LARRY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and failed to factor. SPIN WHEEL was slow into stride and made little impact.
MASTER GAME was taken in hand after a step slow at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked along the inside, got slightly keen while well handled behind the leaders around the first turn, tipped to the four path to take aim
outside of the pace setter turning for home, bid in midstretch sparking a duel and edged ahead. CARMICHAEL pressed two wide, vied down the
backstretch, cleared at the three furlong pole, dug in to resist an outer challenge in midstretch and was bested. UNINVITED GUEST tracked outside of the
top pair from the five path, then lacked a bid before reaching show late. STONEVICIOUS set the pace along the inside, gave way at the three furlong pole,
then lost show late. LONG CROW trailed in the two path, failed to respond to urging in the six path around the far turn, and failed to factor on his left lead.
