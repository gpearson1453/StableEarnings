late under steady handling. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN showed good early foot to set the early pace but was no match for the winner in the drive. ANGEL OF
VERDUN stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and raced evenly late while racing three deep. LAKE RUNNER
was bumped, shuffled at the start, raced near the back early and had no late rally. SHE'S MY PRIORITY stalked the pace from the inside and weakened.
MISSGREELEY'SSONG dropped back early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and lacked a bid. KEHRON'S CREED tracked the early leader while
racing just off the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
FLASHY MEG tracked the early leader from the outside under a hold, asked through the far turn and finished well to edge clear late under strong handling.
WUPKAR showed good early foot along the inside, challenged through the far turn, dug in near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly to Flashy Meg late.
FIRST I'VE SEEN raced mid pack early on, moved up three wide at the quarter pole, angled out to race from the far outside in the stretch and finished
gamely. SNOWBALL settled early on, moved up outside through the far turn, swung wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. THAT'S MY MAMA raced
off the early going, raced from the outside in the lane and raced evenly late. MYFRIENDSAWINNER void of early speed, raced near the inside and failed to
respond. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN stalked the pace from the inside and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
DIAL UNCLE JOEY showed good early foot three deep from the outside foe foes, took command and was well clear late while under steady handling.
SACRED NATION was unhurried early on, moved up from the outside in the stretch and rallied gamely for the place positiion. MIDNIGHT CROWN stalked
the pace, raced five wide past the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly late. STRAY CAT STRUT vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened in
the drive. REGINALD AURELIUS took up sharply at the break and never menaced. CUSTOMIZED SPACE was off a step slow, rushed from the inside to
contention, tired readily and was eased up on late to race far back.
