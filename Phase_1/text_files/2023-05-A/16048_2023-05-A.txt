NAMBITI drifted out at the start, was allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide through the stretch between rivals under left handed urging and got up in
the final strides. PRIVATE DRIVE away alertly, set all the pace under pressure along the inside and just missed hanging on. JACK BE FAST with the
second flight inside, split horses two wide through the stretch and was steadily gaining ground in a determined effort. KID RUSSELL pressed the pace two
wide until deep stretch and was outfinished while three wide. TIGER TRAIL offered a mild bid four wide on the turn then leveled off. BIG OHIO was in tight
at the start, trailed while settling wide then closed a gap late in deep stretch. DYNAMITE CLOUD loomed boldly three wide on the turn and into the stretch,
drifted five wide and weakened late.

MR. BOUMA trailed down the backstretch, closed with a rush two wide under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. SCRATCHOFF pressed the
pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path, inherited a clear lead before the furlong marker and just missed hanging on. FLAWLESS CAT never
far back, finished with good courage four wide. AZTEC advanced along the rail through the turn, shifted out to the six path losing ground then came on
again late. CONSIDER ME bore out at the start and went evenly. PRIVATE CONNIE was outrun. GIACOMETTI had good early speed along the rail then
faded. WARHORSE WEST sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch along the inside then was used up.
