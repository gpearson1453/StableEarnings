Footnotes
RHYTHMIA was well rated in mid pack through the first circuit, then moved forward and made a bid to draw clear on the far turn and down the hill, then
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. DRUID'S ALTAR (IRE) was allowed to settle throughout, made a bid on the far turn and finished
willingly, second best. BLACKSTAIR ROCCO (IRE) vied for the lead and jumped well throughout, could not go with the top two wide staying on well to hold
the show award. THE BUTLER YATES (IRE) was reserved early, then offered a late rally for the minor rewards. SHAKA was well placed through the first
circuit, then made a bid to vie for command before weakening. ADJUTANT (GB) tracked the front runners and lacked the needed rally. REAL FACTOR
chased the early pace and weakened. VINCENT VAN GOGO vied for the lead and then tired and left the course after the fifteenth jump, walked off.

FASHION LINE set the pace and was well rated throughout drew out on the turn and then drew off in the lane to prove much the best while being kept to
crop urging. CITY OF GRACE tracked the winner early, made a bid on the second circuit, but proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best.
MASTER SEVILLE was allowed to settle but lacked a rally. INLE was reserved early and failed to threaten.
