Footnotes
COMPTONS HOUSE unhurried in the early running, advanced along the backstretch run, made a steady gain along the second turn while three wide,
rallied three wide into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong pole, reeled in BEA MISCHIEF inside of the sixteenth-marker and drew clear under hand
urging in the final stages. BEA MISCHIEF allowed to settle in the early running, improved position along the backstretch run, came within aim while three
wide on the far turn, took command at the furlong marker, ran on the left lead to deep stretch, was collared by COMPTONS HOUSE inside of the
sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. THE RIVER MANGITA settled while not far back in the
early going, saved all of the ground to the second turn, came in tight at the quarter marker, lacked room into upper stretch, could muster the needed
response in the late stages but ran on in the final furlong to secure the show. BIKINI NATION stalked the decent early fractions, maintained a three wide
path into the backstretch run, inched closer heading to the half-mile pole, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, led briefly in upper stretch, was
overtaken by BEA MISCHIEF heading to the furlong pole and weakened in the final stages. ACHROMATIC forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the
decent pace into the backstretch run, raced close to the pace to the second turn, lost ground at the quarter marker, was outrun into the drive and gave way
in the final stages. BLAZIN BAE sent leaving the break and dictated terms in the early stages, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under
pressure nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off rivals entering the stretch run and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CHEEKIEST unhurried in the early stages, never far back through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide in
upper stretch, advanced nearing the furlong marker, responded to urging inside of the furlong pole, confronted JERSEY SUNSET nearing the
sixteenth-marker, battled with that foe to deep stretch and found more in the final stages to prove best. JERSEY SUNSET assumed command leaving the
break, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, held a comfortable lead to the quarter marker, was set down in upper stretch,
met the bid of CHEEKIEST nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled with that foe to deep stretch, was outfinished in the final stages and was clear of the rest
for second. ISABEL LUDLOW settled off of the moderate early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run, was roused three wide along the far
turn, came four wide into the stretch, ran on the left lead to the furlong pole, stayed on the wrong lead to deep stretch and was outkicked in the final stages,
while holding safely for third. SWEET BLUSH forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, kept
attendance to the pacesetter while two wide to the quarter marker, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, lost ground while in tight quarters approaching the
furlong pole and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
ANGI'S THIRSTY prominent in the early going, was asked for speed into the turn and set decent fractions into the bend, extended the lead while well
handled at the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead while kept to task to mid-stretch, was kept to steady urging to the sixteenth-marker and was hand urged
to the finish as much the best. LAURA BRANIGAN showed early speed and stalked the decent pace in the opening stages, dropped back on the turn, saved
ground into the drive, re-rallied in the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final stages and was second best in the end. GETAWAY CHARM chased
the decent early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, lacked the needed response in the stretch and passed tiring rivals to be clear for third. DIVINE
PASSAGE chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground three wide on the turn, was floated out a path by ADJUST THE HEAT in
upper stretch and did not threaten in the final furlong. ADJUST THE HEAT showed early speed and raced close to the decent early pace, kept attendance to
ANGI'S THIRSTY to the quarter marker, shied from the crop in upper stretch and floated out DIVINE PASSAGE, dropped back nearing the furlong pole and
tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
EL CHARRO CHAMP tracked the early leaders, made a steady advance into the turn, gained ground two wide along the bend, was roused at the quarter
marker, swung four wide into the stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, overtook OBVIOUS nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear
under firm hand urging in the final stages. OBVIOUS asked to show speed and was prominent in the early running, was engaged by DR. FLASH DANCER
and dueled with that rival into the turn, battled for pace duties through the bend while carving out decent fractions, shook free in upper stretch, led to the
furlong marker, could not hold off EL CHARRO CHAMP approaching the sixteenth-marker and stayed on to be best of the rest. DR. FLASH DANCER
forwardly placed in the early running, dueled with OBVIOUS into the turn, kept up that battle to the quarter marker while setting decent fractions, could in not
keep pace with OBVIOUS heading to mid-stretch, gave way in the final stages and held safely in deep stretch for third. TEE SHOT stalked the decent pace
from the inside, saved ground to the top of the lane, improved position heading to mid-stretch, could not sustain that run in the final furlong and faltered.
ZOE'S PAPA CEE lacked early speed, saved ground into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
A NEW PEACE forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to TURA LURA to the
quarter marker, was roused nearing the top of the lane and vied for the lead in upper stretch, took command at the furlong marker, kept to task under steady
urging to deep stretch and held safely at the finish over the oncoming runner-up. HARBOR ABBEY unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the
backstretch run, was steered three wide into the far turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the drive, came within aim at
mid-stretch, finished well in the final stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held safely at the end for the place. TURA LURA away in good
order and assumed command leaving the break, set decent fractions into the backstretch run, was prompted into the far turn by A NEW PEACE, vied with
that foe to the quarter marker, continued to battle into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for the
place, while well clear of the rest for the show. SHERILINDA stalked the decent early pace from a three wide path, maintained her position through the
backstretch run and into the second turn, raced three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages.
STATEFOREST broke a step slowly and settled in the second flight early on, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, was well placed to the
quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. ZELAIA settled off of the early pace while not far back, maintained a two wide path
through the backstretch run, came two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
RAUCOUS TIZZY allowed to settle in the early running, improved position on the turn while outside of rivals, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch,
continued to advance to the furlong grounds, closed determinedly in the late stages, overtook BARBERA inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in
the final strides to prevail. BARBERA showed early speed then conceded the lead to SWEET MILLIE and stalked that rival into the turn, chased two wide to
the quarter marker, was roused approaching the top of the lane, overtook SWEET MILLIE and was set down for the drive, drifted out in mid-stretch, was
confronted by RAUCOUS TIZZY nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the winner in the final stages and was outfinished, while well clear of the
rest for second. VALERIE chased the decent early pace, ran three wide along the turn, gained ground three wide nearing the furlong marker, could not
sustain that run in deep stretch and was outkicked, while clear in the end for third. CHANTELLE lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker,
was not able to threaten the leaders in deep stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final stages. SWEET MILLIE hustled to establish the early lead, set
decent fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by BARBERA in upper stretch, chased that foe to the furlong pole and faded in the drive. DRINK AND
A WINK a bit hard to place in the early running, raced in tight quarters while showing speed into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun
to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC well placed in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained his position to the half-mile marker, was roused three wide
along the far turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch, took command under firm urging inside of the furlong marker, kept to task to deep stretch and drew
clear in the final stages. SEATTLE BOLD prominent in the early running, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter
nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, could not match strides with KENNEBEC in the final furlong and held for second at the finish.
AMERICA GREAT hustled to the early lead, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted along the second turn by SEATTLE BOLD,
met that bid into upper stretch, battled for the lead at the furlong marker, stubbornly stayed on into deep stretch, could not get by SEATTLE BOLD for
second in the final stages and was clear at the end for third. HARMON stumbled leaving the break and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried through the
backstretch run, saved ground while advancing along the second turn, was not able to impact the leaders in the late stages but was gaining in the final
furlong. UNRAPTURED settled in the second flight in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced along the second turn, angled two
wide for the drive, was outrun to the furlong pole and lacked a late response. EXECUTIVE CHEF was never far back in the early stages, raced two wide into
the backstretch run, improved position three deep on the far turn, could not sustain that rally in the stretch drive and weakened. KINGMEISTER was a bit
washy prior to the loading process and was fractious in the starting gate, unhurried in the early going, raced three wide to be outside of rivals into the
backstretch run, made a steady gain to the second turn, came four wide into the far turn, swung to the three path for the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and
did not threaten.

Footnotes
ROISTER broke alertly and assumed command leaving the start, was well handled through decent fractions to the half-mile marker, maintained a
comfortable lead to the quarter pole, felt pressure from oncoming rivals at the top of the stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong pole, drifted out under
left-handed urging at mid-stretch, was steered back to the rail for the final furlong, kept to task under firm handling to deep stretch and determinedly held
sway in the final strides to prevail. SPEED GRAZY unhurried in the early running, was steered three wide into the backstretch run, made a mild advance
nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground two wide on the second turn, slipped to the rail approaching the top of the lane, loomed in upper stretch, was
boxed in inside of the furlong pole, finished evenly while in tight in the late stages and just held for second at the wire. SUGAR BEETS allowed to settle,
raced three wide into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the second turn, loomed nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong
grounds, made a mild late bid while outside of the leading pair but was outfinished in the final stages and just missed for second, while well clear for third.
LOOKOUT POINT allowed to settle in the early going, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, improved position on the second turn, tipped two
wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not rally in the final furlong. MASHHAD FLATS forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the decent
pace through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground heading to the half-mile marker, chased ROISTER to the quarter pole, dropped back leaving the far
turn and gave way in the stretch. UNION GIG settled in the second flight early on, raced two wide into the backstretch run, improved position three wide on
the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages.
