Footnotes
ACE REPORTER chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path, caught the leader inside the eighth
pole then edged past and stayed. DARNELL angled to the inside entering the turn, continued along the rail through the turn when moved closer, cut the
corner into the lane and finished with a steady run to be closing in to the wire. MYGALJUSTICE chased the pace from the four path through the turn and into
the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then needed to do more. ANGELSNDISGUISE set the pace from the two path through then turn and into
the lane then gave way nearing the sixteenth pole. LIZZSAIDNO raced three wide through the turn when never far back then finished evenly. LITTLE GRAY
FLOWER raced near the rail through the turn and weakened while moving further off the rail. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY raced in the three or four path
through the turn, angled into the seven path for the drive and never was a factor.

Footnotes
LASHES settled off the pace while in the two path, guided to the three path in late turn, came into the lane three wide, got nearest the leader outside the
eighth pole, edged past that one and stayed on well while clearing. SECOND EXCHANGE was off awkwardly, trailed through half while off the inside,
guided to the four path into the lane and finished with good energy to clear for the place spot. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY raced along the inside into the
lane, came off the rail and into the three path and was gaining to the end. FIRST SQUADRON set the pace along the inside into the lane and gave way
once headed. SHARP JUSTICE was along the inside into the far turn, steadied when put in tight nearing the five-sixteenth pole, continued along the rail into
the lane and was empty. ROYAL TO BE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, swung four wide into the lane and tired. KANFU pressed the
pace two wide into the lane then was empty.

the clubhouse turn, then chased the leaders and gave way in the stretch. JACK D was unrushed and steadied near the five-eighths pole. PRINCE OF
ROSES broke sharply, then was through early. DOMHNALL was clear from the gate and led briefly before fading. JACK OF ALL TRADES steadied the first

Footnotes
INDIAN ZARA hustled out to a long lead through the far turn, continued well clear to the sixteenth pole, shortened stride soon after and just lasted.
SHARON'S GREY HOPE avoided trouble at the start, raced in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path and was closing in on the
very weary winner late. ZIINZI chased the pace from the two path through the turn, had aim into the lane and gained on a weary leader while losing the
place spot. ICEY ANGEL raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. WILLADEAN was bumped,
put in tight and shut off and checked at the start, moved to the inside and never factored. LUNAR LACE stepped in at the start bothering the inside rival,
raced in the three path through the turn and never was a factor. CASTLE MAGIC was pinballed between rivals, put in tight, checked sharply, raced in the
four to five path through the turn and never was a factor. ALWAYS BLOSSOM bore out at the start and forced others out, hustled up near the rail through
the turn and was empty in the lane. COLOR ME FAST slammed at the start, checked back to last and trailed.

Footnotes
ROTARY DIAL was close up early while in the two path, was shuffled a bit in mid-turn, angled into the three path entering the lane, split rivals near the
eighth pole then reeled in the winner to the wire. KING ICE was unhurried while in the four or five path down the backstretch, bid three wide through
mid-turn while in the four path, quickly cleared into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was run down by the top one. WIN ME OVER stalked the pace
while in the four path down the backstretch and through the far turn, could not go with the top two but stayed on well to be clear for the show spot.
VICTOR'S DEAL set the pace from the two path into mid-turn then weakened through the lane. LOADEMUPJUSTICE was close up into the far turn then
tired. FIRING RANGE chased the pace while along the inside into the far turn, was steadied along the rail then subsequently faded.
