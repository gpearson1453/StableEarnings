Footnotes
ANCHOR MANNE stalked the pace while in the two or three path, bid in late turn and into the lane while in the three path, cleared near the eighth pole and
continued to widen while drifting into the seven path. BACKYARD JUSTICE set the pace while in the two path, was under pressure from the winner into the
lane, could not keep up with that one but stayed on well to settle for clear second best. HITCHPIN stalked the pacesetters from the four path down the
backstretch, continued to chase the duo into the lane and could not gain while best of the rest. ZIPSY ROSE LEE was well back into the lane and offered a
belated gain. BUCKLE UP raced in the four path through the far turn when well back then moved up a couple of spots through the lane. QUALITY DANCER
was never a factor while near the inside. WHITE SILVER SANDS was steadied between rivals into the first turn, advanced into the far turn while three wide,
came into the lane from the two path and tired. PAYNTER'S CANVAS was along the inside into the lane and was empty. CROSSING THE ROAD was
jostled between rivals early, settled to the back while off the inside then passed a couple of tired ones. BUGSY BREEZE outrun while off the rail.
SNERDLEY chased the pace along the inside into the backstretch then was done approaching the far turn. GRAY MIKE stalked the pace from the four path
into the far turn then was done.

Footnotes
SELENAIA (IRE) was unhurried while saving ground, waited along the inside entering the lane, cut the corner and rallied up the rail to be clear at the end.
FRENCH CUFFS was three wide through the turn, came five wide into the lane, was in the six path when straightened and finished with good energy for the
place spot. HABUIAH was off a step slow and settled along the rail into and through the first turn, continued inside into the far turn, guided three wide when
gaining momentum, continued into the lane from the seven path and finished with energy. MACADAMIA (FR) chased the pace from the two path through
the turn, bid into the lane, was clear with and eighth to go but could not finish the effort. GRACELEADSUSHOME set the pace along the inside into the
backstretch, chased the leader into the stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHTMAKESSENSE was near the rail into the far turn, was asked two wide through the
turn, came into the lane a contender and lacked a closing response. DUPLICITOUS was along the inside into the far turn and never was a factor.
HARVEY'S PRINCESS never a menace while in the three path through the turns. MIZZEN ASH was never a factor. SKYLERVILLE chased the early pace
into the backstretch, gained the lead and maintained the top spot into the lane then gave way. LANDSLID raced off the rail when in mid-pack and tired. NO
MORE FAKE NEWS was outrun while near the rail.
