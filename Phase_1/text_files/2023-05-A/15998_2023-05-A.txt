Footnotes
BRITTANYSGLDNFAITH was unhurried while in the three path through the turn and chasing a three rival duel into the lane, shifted from the three path to
the inside after passing the eighth pole and was up in time. Z'S LUCKY GIRL vied for the lead three wide through the turn, continued to duel into the lane,
inched to the front outside the eighth pole, maintained a short advantage from mid-track and was outfinished by the winner from along the rail.
WILDCATJUSTICE vied from between rivals through the turn and into the lane, continued to duel with the runner-up and to the end and missed the place
spot. SKYS IMAGE settled back after the start, raced near the back into the lane and showed some interest late. UNBRIDLED TALENT was never a serious
factor while in the two or three path through the turn. TU CHA bobbled at the start, hustled to the lead early, dueled with two others through the turn and into
the lane then gave way. QUITE WHIMSICAL trailed through the turn and into the lane and was never a factor. TWIRLING JUSTICE showed early speed
while along the inside into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
C C'S WORLD was unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide and from the four path through late turn, continued with aim on the winner in upper stretch,
dueled with that one inside the eighth pole and inched up. ZERO CLICK stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid three wide into the
far turn, gained a clear lead into the lane then could not hold the winner safe. IMPECCABLE TASTE pulled along the inside down the backstretch, came off
the rail into the lane and lacked a closing response. FEATURETTE set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn, was still a contender into the lane then
faded along the rail. ALL ROSES was in the two or three path through the far turn and never was a factor. TAYA ALLDAYA tired along the inside. AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #2 ZERO CLICK AGAINST THE RIDER OF #5 C C'S WORLD FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
MUSICAL SCORE chased the pace along the inside, gained momentum while coming off the inside into the lane, straightened and caught the leader inside
the eighth pole then drew off and won as rider pleased. FIRST HILL pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane, was inching up on the
leader outside the eighth pole, gained a momentary lead with less than an eighth to go then was no match for the winner while saving the place spot.
STORM BAY was three wide through the first turn when in mid-pack, continued off the inside into the far turn, was not far back through the turn, swung into
the land from the five or six path and moved up late. TRIBEST (ARG) saved ground through the far turn then lacked the needed bid. BAMBEROOSKI set
the pace on an early clear lead, vied with another through the far turn and into the lane then gave way. KINGMAKING (GB) chased the pace from the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired. COZEE MAGIC was never a factor from off the inside. LA VOIE was well back while
near the inside and never was a menace. CLOVERTOWNE was done going into the far turn. SWEET ARIA was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
INDICIA raced along the inside down the backstretch, came off the rail and into the four path through the far turn, was in the six or seven path when gaining
momentum into the lane, brushed by outside rival and floated in a path just inside the eighth pole then prevailed to the wire. CHOCTAW BINGO chased the
pace from between rivals into the lane, bid three wide nearing the eighth pole, gained the lead inside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe.
KING'S LEGACY chased the pace along the inside through the far turn, was shuffled as others went wide, continued with good energy to bid for the lead
with an eighth to go then could not go with the top two. FIRESIDE KITTEN was four wide through the first turn, moved five wide through the far turn when
getting closer, swung into the seven of eight path for the drive, stepped in nearing the eighth pole under right-handed urging then moved up but could not
sustain the bid. ALMADRINA (GB) was unhurried while off the inside, bid into the lane, angled to the rail and moved up. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT chased
the pace three wide through the far turn, bid into the lane, was trying to split rivals when shut off, checked and dropped back. TREATY OF PARIS pressed
the pace two wide into the lane, bid straightening into the lane then gave way. YA BEAUTY (GB) was never a factor while well back into the lane. WORLD
OF WONDER stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, bid three wide in mid-turn then was empty turning into the lane. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE
was never a factor while off the rail. PEACH COBBLER was done on the far turn while off the rail. MISS MOON PIE set the pace into the lane, was still a
contender with an eighth to go then was swallowed up by the field. AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF
ORDER.

momentum after straightening in the lane, steered through traffic, shifted down a bit nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in time. CLASSIC MAX settled a
bit early, moved through along the inside to gain the lead into the turn, cleared into the lane, opened his largest advantage with an eighth to go but could not
hold the winner safe. A FEW TOO MANY chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the top one after straightening but
just needed more. CIBOLO trailed into the lane while along the inside, was guided to the eight path when gaining momentum and finished full of energy.
STOP HAMMERTIME was in the five to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and was gaining to the end.
THEDEVILSALGORITHM in the three to four path through the far turn when near the back, came into the lane from the six path and offered a mild gain.
