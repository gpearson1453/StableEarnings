Footnotes
COMMINGLING reluctant to load, dueled inside for the lead, dueeld with MIL DOSCIENTOS on the turn, shook free from that rival turning for home, drew
clear and was kept to the task. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY dueled between rivals in the early stages, then chased, went three wide on the turn, rallied in the
lane and finished well for second. HARLEY'S CHARLY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, moved up inside on the turn, rallied
mildly on the rail in the lane and earned the show spot. CARPE ALL DAY raced three wide off the pace, went four wide past the quarter pole, failed to
threaten and gained belatedly for fourth. MIL DOSCIENTOS was bumped at the start, dueled three wide early, then two wide on the turn and faded in the
lane. WEGOTTAGUY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and tired.

TUDOR PEAK settled inside the dueling leaders, split rivals angling out on the turn, rallied and was up late wearing down the loose leader. REID'S
FANGIRL dueled three wide, took over midway on the turn, moved clear but was nailed. DYSFUNCTIONAL made a menacing four wide bid into the far turn
then flattened out. POOR NO MORE raced just off the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. MAGIC MISS vied between rivals then inside and faltered in
the stretch. INCOMPARABLE lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. IYIYI was urged to a narrow advantage in the opening quarter then stopped
abruptly. ONE PAIR OF HANDS injured herself breaking through the gate prior to the start and was ordered scratched.

ENFORCER tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, continued on the rail in the stretch, angled out at the sixteenth marker, made a late run and was up
in time. RYAN'S FLEET set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid from JOVIAL, drew clear in the stretch, dug in gamely and was caught in the final
strides. MIZZEN MAN raced off the pace inside, steadied at the three eighths marker, moved up three wide at the quarter pole, rallied mildly outside in the
lane and was up for third at the wire. JOVIAL broke in the air and was off slowly, chased four wide, bid three wide on the turn, dug in, then weakened and
missed for third. AVA K'S BOY raced off the pace, moved up three or four wide on the turn, then closed willingly inside in deep stretch. LUCKY AS A
SEVEN chased three wide, bid between rivals on the turn and tired. BEACH WARRIOR stalked two wide early, chased between rivals on the turn and gave
way.

LAZARETTO vied in the opening quarter, shook loose on the turn then held on gamely repelling challengers. GRAVEL ROAD forced the pace, moved inside
on the turn, moved back out in the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. CRYPT trailed to the stretch then finished with good late energy. CHAIN

flattened out in the stretch. NICK THE CARDSHARK chased wide down the backstretch, bid briefly closer on the turn then faded. U U STAR prompted the
pace three wide for half a mile and gave way. BUFFALO SHUFFLE bobbed at the break, was eased back into the far turn and faded. PORTAL ONE

moved with the winner on the final turn but was no match for the winner. TYCOON rated wide in the opening half mile, rallied on the final turn then flattened
out. SCAR trailed early inside and lacked a solid rally. COBBLE ROAD broke through the gate prior to the start, set a pressured pace then gave way.

ONE MORE SCOOP broke slowly, was blocked from the quarter pole to the stretch, angled out to secure room and was up in the final sixteenth. A
DANGEROUS GUY close up from the start, raced inside on the turn, bid in the stretch but was outfinished. LOOSE ENDS chased wide, advanced on the
turn then rallied with good energy too late. DREAMING OF GERRY trailed along inside early then rallied strongly through the stretch while splitting rivals.
JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF steadied at the start, was in tight first quarter, rallied and led in midstretch then tired in the final furlong. PERFECT DAY alternated
for the lead inside then weakened in the stretch. CITY RAGE chased off the leaders between and gradually weakened. PRACTICAL WAY came in at the
break, rushed to the lead outside then gave way.
