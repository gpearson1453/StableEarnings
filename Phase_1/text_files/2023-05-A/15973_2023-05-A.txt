Footnotes
SHEZA HUNK well reserved off the leaders to the top of the lane, commenced a rally from the rail, angled out to the five path to split horses late in the lane,
made the front in final seventy yards, leaned out into the runner- up in the late stages and prevailed. RECLAIMED tracked pace, made a steady advance
through the turn, loomed boldly inside the sixteenth pole, was bumped by the winner several times late in the drive and just missed. KAYLEE'S SHADOW
was well behind in the early going, circled eight wide at the head of the stretch and closed with a belated rush to be going best of all at the wire in a good
effort. LET FREEDOM BLING broke alertly and settled to a stalking position, moved up to duel for the lead through the turn, briefly took the lead in upper
stretch and was out-kicked late. MISS CARMEN rushed up along the fence to duel on the lead, battled gamely to the quarter pole and gave way. SATIN
HEART stalked the pace from between horses top of the lane and weakened in the drive. LUMBERJACK LESLIE went evenly as no threat. ABIGAIL
ALDEN flashed brief speed and tired.

Footnotes
GREATEST GLORY was moving up along the inside to take command at the five furlong marker, cleared the turn, and was kept to task till the end. SHEZA
CAT veered in at the start, then was unhurried early, was moving up along then inside on the turn, came out three wide in the early stretch, dug in gamely
and continued to close well. SIMPERING SMILE raced in the middle of the field while three wide, then made a mild bid on the turn and found more in the
stretch to close well for the show prize. HIT'EM UP chased the pace along the inside down the backstretch and throughout the turn under a steady drive and
needed more in the end. QUEEN OF MAGNOLIA was bumped on both sides at the start, was unhurried early along the inside, then came out four wide in
the upper stretch bid down the lane but it was too little too late. ATTA MOY GIRL bid for the lead while four wide, then pressed the pace down the late
backstretch and into the turn while two wide, was used up and tired in the stretch. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN was away from the gate quickly to lead the
way down the early backstretch, then gradually faded throughout and had no final bid in the end.

BYE broke sharply to take command from the gate, widened his lead in the turn, cleared at the head of the lane and held on gamely to prevail in the drive.
BLING BLING BLING bumped rival at the start, tracked the pacesetters to the quarter pole, rallied strongly in the lane to be gaining late. CAJUN EDDIE
reserved off the pace along the fence through the turn, angled out to the three path to split horses and finish willingly. TOO MUCH INFO stalked the pace
from three wide through the turn, loomed up at the head of the stretch and was out-finished to the wire. ZAVALA bumped leaving the stall, raced up the rail
to press the pace for a half mile and flattened out. RODEO CHAMP trailed early, launched a wide bid into the turn and finished evenly. DOSE'S DREAM
raced wide throughout evenly as no threat. MALIBU MENDELSSOHN raced close up into the turn and tired after three-eighths.

Footnotes
COSTANARMANDALEG broke alertly to press the pace from three wide through the turn, battled in the lane between horses while exchanging bumps with
CARLOS LOVES TEE leaving the sixteenth pole, fought from between horses to the wire bumping with the runner-up in the final strides and finished
determinedly to get the nod. NORA'S LEGACY dueled from between horses early to take a short lead down the backstretch, fought from the rail in a three
horse duel at the head of the stretch, took the lead in the late stages, shied away from the winner fifty yards from the finish briefly tossing his head, dug back
in, bumped winner late and just missed. CARLOS LOVES TEE broke outward leaving the gate, dropped into a stalking position down the backside, rallied
three wide to take the lead at the head of the lane, drifted in bumping the winner and hung in the late stages. GRAN MANNA moved up the rail leaving the
chute to press the pace from the rail, checked by rider in the turn while trying to get out, raced wide while failing to gain from there on. MAYAPRETTY trailed
the field to the top of the lane and showed late interest gaining ground down the stretch. SIMPLE PLEASURE was well placed early on and made a mild bid
down the lane while never posing a threat. SHESMYBROKER dropped back during the run down the backside and was never a factor.

READY TO ROLL was well rated while two wide on the backstretch and into the far turn then rallied in the early stretch, dueled with an inner rival in the final
furlong and was up just in time to prevail. GOLD VERMILION chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, gained the lead in
the upper stretch, then dueled with an outer foe in deep stretch and was out finished in the end by a neck. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY raced in the back of the
field while three wide, was moving up to bid from the inside on the far turn, angled out to the four path in the stretch to close willingly in the end.
RESOLUTIONIST settled while three wide, was gaining ground on the far turn from the five path then closed well in the stretch. HOURGLASS FIGURE
raced from the inside in the middle of the field from the first turn into the second turn, then rallied in the early stretch but came up evenly in the end. JOHN
DOUGH raced in the middle of the field while two wide, then settled back down the backstretch, came out six wide to rally in the upper stretch but it was too
little too late. SHAMAYIM was under a steady drive while racing from the three path down the backstretch, was urging on the far turn to rally from the five
path in the stretch but came up empty in the end. MERCI set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive then faltered in the home stretch. DARE TO BE
WILD raced at an even pace while three wide down the backstretch and throughout the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. TAPIT CITY settled behind
the field along the inside then made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat. ENDLESS SUNSET settled along the inside throughout the first three
quarters then bid from the two path in the stretch and was no menace.
