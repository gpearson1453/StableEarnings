Footnotes
JUST CALL RAY tracked two wide, inched closer in the five path and outside of rivals around the far turn, swept past the leaders entering the lane and drew
off. MADISON LUVS DUKE eased back from between horses entering the first turn, tipped out to the four path while coming under urging in hopes of
ranging up along with an outer rival around the far turn, but got outkicked by that one entering the lane, then by a rail skimmer for place in upper stretch, yet
kept on to sustain a bid for that position in the final sixteenth, and gained it late. JAY VEE BEE trailed, gained ground along the rail around the far turn, but
steadied once blocked behind the leaders nearing the quarter pole, got through to gain place after the leader kicked away in upper stretch, but was caught
for that position approaching the wire. AMANI'S EAGLE set the pace in the two path, but offered no resistance to an outer rival's bid entering the lane, and
gave way. MUGSY MALONE pressed the leader from the three path, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. TRIGGER HAPPY was forwardly
placed three wide, but faded at the five furlong pole, was through early and eased through the lane.

LOVED set the pace inside of a sternly pressing outer rival, shook free of that one entering the lane, opened up under very mild hand urging, and was put to
wraps leaving the furlong grounds. OPENING NIGHT pressed the pace setter from the outside, but proved no match while failing to keep pace entering the
lane, and held place thereafter. SHE'S KEEN tracked in the four to three path, and kept on while failing to menace. LET'S DUET trailed in the two path and
failed to factor. CHIQUITA MOSCA lacked speed along the inside and tired.

DIVINE LEADER stalked in the three path, loomed a danger turning for home, bid in the four path while well in hand entering the lane, took charge under
moderate urging in upper stretch, and drew off. AWESOME AARON cleared passing the five furlong pole, but offered no resistance to the eventual winner's
outer bid entering the lane, and narrowly held place between horses through the final sixteenth. NIFTY wrestled for forward position with an inner rival early
on, bumped that foe nearing the five furlong pole as the leader shifted down, chased along the inside around the turn, then vied for place inside of a pair of
foes in the final sixteenth but missed. FLINT RIDGE exchanged brushes with an outer rival while jockeying for forward inside position through the opening
stages, but steadied hard when bumped and put to tight quarters by that one approaching the five furlong pole, trailed three wide around the turn, spun into
the lane in the five path, and stayed on mildly to vie for place in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. STEINBECK lacked speed two wide and never got
involved.

Footnotes
COEXIST stalked outside of the dueling leading pair, bid in upper stretch, sparred with an inner JACKIE'S SPIRIT thereafter, wrestled an advantage in the
final furlong, and edged ahead. JACKIE'S SPIRIT dueled for the lead inside of a rival, disposed of that one entering the lane, dug in to resist COEXIST's
challenge at the three sixteenths pole, shifted out while battling in midstretch, but was bested entering the final sixteenth. DIVINE GRACE was tentative
inside of rivals and failed to sustain forward position after half a furlong, retreated to be far back entering the turn, swung out to the six path entering the
lane, tipped to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied to claim show in the final sixteenth. AMENSET was urged along at the rear of the main group while
in the five path around the turn, inched closer entering the lane, gained show in midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and was
caught for that position soon after. DREAM TRAP hopped while slow away from the gates, laid off of the pace in the three path, then shifted inwardly in
midstretch before moving up. ZIPPIN PIPPIN stalked behind the leaders while taking the turn in the two path, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, but
only managed to chase among foes while gradually fading. GORMLEYESQUE tracked two wide and between horses, shifted four wide at the three furlong
pole, then faded. BRISBANE ROAD dueled for the lead two wide and weakened between horses in upper stretch. SHACKLED BY LUST was shuffled back
behind DIVINE GRACE in the opening furlong, trailed around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TUSKEGEE CAT tracked three wide, bid at the half mile pole, drew clear well in hand turning for home, drifted out and across a pursuing BATUKHAN
(IRE)'s path at the furlong grounds, yet held well thereafter. BATUKHAN (IRE) tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the newly clear leader in upper
stretch, altered course inside of that drifting foe at the furlong pole, but failed to gain in the late stages while proving second best. YONO pursued from
midpack two wide, chased in the four path around the far turn, and ran on to gain show entering the final furlong. NICHOLAS JONES broke a step slow,
trailed in the four path, shifted out turning for home before drifting to the eight path entering the lane, and rallied. TROPIC STORM stalked two wide, bid
along with an outer rival at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with that one turning for home, and tired. WICCA WISDOM lacked speed in the two
path, shifted to the five path and between horses entering the lane, and lacked a bid. WRITEITONTHEICE broke a step slowly before bumping with an outer
rival, lacked speed in the three path, spun into the lane in the six path and between horses, and made little impact. PAID IN FULL set the pace along the
inside, got headed by a pair of rivals entering the far turn and weakened. BORN FLAWLESS pursued from midpack under a snug hold along the inside, but
was through early. MOTOWN MISSILE broke a step slow, bumped with an inner rival soon after the start, made little impact three wide and was eased
through the lane. THE RIDER OF BATUKHAN (IRE) CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TUSKEGEE CAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN
MIDSTRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

bobbled a bit upon leaving the gates, lacked speed in the three path, then rallied between horses in the five path in the final furlong, and emerged from
among foes to gain place in the closing stages. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE broke a bit out at the start, laid off of the pace while taking the turn in the five path,
drifted to the seven path entering the lane, ran on while one paced, bid for place along with an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked for that
position soon after. GOLDEN BELL vied for the lead in the three path while between pair of foes, but was outkicked by his outer counterpart entering the
lane, maintained place through midstretch, but faltered entering the final sixteenth. PRINCEDREAMCESS stalked along the inside, chased around the turn,
and failed to menace. READY FOR CHANGE trailed in the two path around the turn, and got outrun. ALTERED SHOT set the pace inside of a pair of rivals
while a path off of the rail around the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STRIKINGLY SPUN settled off of the pace two to three wide around the first turn, tipped four wide while between horses turning for home, rallied to bid
along with an inner CLEVER JOKE nearing midstretch, sparred with that one through the final furlong, and edged ahead. CLEVER JOKE got keen among
foes early on, settled into a two wide tracking position between horses around the first turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch to take aim on the leaders, bid
along with an outer STRIKINGLY SPUN entering midstretch, led narrowly at the furlong grounds, battled thereafter, but was outfinished by his outer
counterpart late. BOLIVIE (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside, patiently awaited racing room around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper
stretch, pursued while aiming inside of the new leaders leaving midstretch, and ran on to secure show. UNSTABLE PRINCESS broke a step slow, trailed in
the two path, crept closer in the four to five path around the far turn, then stayed on mildly in the six path. MALAWNIA tracked along the inside, but only
managed to chase in upper stretch, shifted outwardly while failing to keep pace in the final furlong, and lacked a bid. C C CRUISE CONTROL set the pace
along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders inside the three sixteenths pole and gave way through the final furlong. JENNY LIND laid off of
the pace in the three path, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and made little impact. ROOT CAUSE pressed two wide, but was outkicked by a pair of
outer rivals passing the three sixteenths pole and faltered in the final furlong. MUSTANG LADY stalked three wide, but was outmoved by rivals entering the
lane, and caved. DEMI broke a beat slow and never got involved from the two path.

Footnotes
VAIL OF HONOR settled far back in the two path, rallied turning for home took aim outside of the top pair in the final furlong, and kicked past them at the
sixteenth pole. MAJESTIC FLAG prompted outside of the pace setter into the first turn, smartly tucked inside of that foe around that bend, vied along the rail
thereafter, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked entering the final sixteenth. NOBLE CONNECTION tracked two wide, but was
outkicked by an inner rival while drifting to the five path in midstretch, and ran on. LUCKY SMILE set the pace while remaining in the four path, vied with an
inner rival down the backstretch, dueled in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds and weakened between horses. MIFFLIN pursued from midpack
along the inside, then three wide around the far turn, tipped six wide in upper stretch and lacked a bid. MAGNA RULER broke outwardly towards open
space, stalked along the inside, chased in the four path around the far turn and lacked a bid. MATLOCK bumped the inner part of the gate at the start,
lacked speed three wide, improved in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out between horses. STRICKLAND was slow into stride and never got
involved. VORTEX laid off of the pace two wide and was done early. JOHNNY'S MOMENT laid off of the pace along the inside but weakened turning for
home.
