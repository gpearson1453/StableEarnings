Footnotes
INDY LITES stalked the pace through the turn, rallied four wide under right handed urging to make the lead past the furlong marker and edged clear while
drifting out to the seven path nearing the wire. SAUNTER was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, swung wide entering the stretch and closed
determinedly in the eighth path to get up for second. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS unhurried early, found her best stride late in the six path. KISS IT
GOODBYE pressed the early pace between horses two wide, dropped back on the turn, came on again boldly along the rail but was outfinished. NYSSA
made the lead soon after the start, set the pace while getting slow fractions until mid stretch then weakened. RAG TOWN hopped inward bumping
SAUNTER at the start and was no threat. BLUE AGAVE pressed the pace three wide into the stretch and gave way late.

BOURBON BUNS was restless in the gate, saved ground into the far turn, shifted out three wide past the five sixteenths marker, rallied to make the lead at
the top of the stretch and drew off at will to win as much the best while taken in hand late. POLISHED GEM was fractious in the gate, battled for the lead
along the inside into the stretch then was no match for the winner. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT raced widest and went evenly. WHAT'S SO FUNNY dueled for
the lead two wide for six furlongs then weakened. CURT'S ANGEL settled three wide into the first turn and was through after a half.

GRAN MAMIBELLA allowed to settle, closed ground rapidly along the rail through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch and drew off under strong
handling. WHOVILLE reared at the start, sped to the lead along the inside before a quarter while under a strong hold, set the pace to the top of the stretch,
drifted out to the six path then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. BLACK BUTTE trailed into the stretch, swung wide and passed tiring
rivals late. SILVER STICK STAIR had a brief early lead, chased the pace through the turn and gave way in the stretch. LUCKY TO HAVE ME had sped into
the turn then wilted.

SILENCE trailed for a little over a half mile, rallied steadily circling his field five wide and was along in time. GOLD N SILVER broke in front, set the pace
until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. MY BROTHER CAM never far back, finished with good courage four wide. SCORSESE had speed from
the start, inched closer between horses two wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. PATIO PARTY pressed the pace along the inside into the
stretch and weakened late. JUSTIN'S QUEST offered a mild bid three wide on the far turn then came up empty. TAMANRASSETT was outrun.
