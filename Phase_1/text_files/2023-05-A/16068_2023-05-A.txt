Footnotes
MAGICAL MARK was away well to lead the way throughout the turn, then drew away from rivals in the stretch to prove best in the end. EMILY'S BULLET
stalked the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the turn, then continued to bid gamely in the lane and held onto the place prize. DA RINGO was well
rated behind the field while two wide, then came out five wide heading into the stretch to close with a rush and had more in the end. ROCKET SOCKS
chased the field along the rail into the turn, then rallied in late stretch but it wasn't enough. COOL RIDE was in a hard drive to stalk the leader from the three
path throughout the turn then flattened out in the stretch. POUND OUT A DEAL raced in close behind the leader along the rail , then checked, and had no
final bid in the stretch.

Footnotes
LIL ASHLEY B. bumped away from the gate by DISCREET SMILE causing DEL MAR DRAMA to be shut off at the start, settled into stride near the rear of
the field for the first half mile, closed ground along the fence, waited for racing room at the head of the lane, finally found room along the rail and closed with
a rush to be going away late as much best. DISCREET SMILE broke outward impeding rivals, took the lead into the first turn, dropped back off the rank
pace presser to stalk, finished gamely to rally down the lane to hold the place. DADDYMADEMEDOIT tracked the pace from a comfortable spot along the
rail for a half mile, angled out to challenge from three wide in the turn and finished well in the drive to just miss the place. HOT TUB HOTTIE raced wide into
the first turn resisting the rating of the rider, moved to the lead down the backside while still rank, cleared the field by open lengths in the far turn and
flattened out coming for home. XYLOPHONE trailed the field to the far turn, swung out for the drive to mount a belated rally to be gaining nearing the wire.
DEL MAR DRAMA was shut off leaving the gate bumping hard to drop to the back of the field, made an early move down the backside to be prominent and
flattened out turning for home.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY PEERLESS lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, cleared the far turn then drew off in the early
stretch to win by many and proved best in the end. BIG ROJO chased the pace while two wide, was moving up swiftly on the far turn to duel for the place
position while tussling with inner rival, continued to dig in gamely and was up at the wire. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY settled along the inside the first half of the
course then, bid on the far turn to rally in the early stretch, drifted out and brushed rival while competing for he place position down the lane but missed in
the end. GOLD ACCOUNT settled back in the two path while racing down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied in the early stretch to close well.
PEPPERMAN chased the pace from the inside, made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. FREDONIAN stalked the pace while two
wide down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied in the early stretch while drifting out six wide then gave way in the end. MAX PANDOWDY was off
slowly then raced behind the field, slowly losing ground throughout and was no factor. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to the stretch run,
After review there was no change made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
ENGLANDER settled in to track the run away pacesetter from second, moved to challenge entering the turn, dueled from between horses to upper stretch,
dueled with the runner-up through the lane and pulled just clear late in a game effort. DON'TASK DON'TTELL reserved in hand for the first half mile while
always in striking position, moved up three wide into the turn to engage the leaders, battled with the winner to deep stretch and was out-finished to be
second best. BROCK ON BY sped to the lead straightening out down the lane the first time, took clear command into the first turn, widened his lead to open
lengths down the backside, responded well to the challenges through the turn to deep stretch and weakened late in the drive. KOKOKOMO settled in hand
off the pace to be near the rear of the pack along the fence, moved up the rail in the far turn and launched a belated rally down the lane. JOHAN ZOFFANI
(IRE) saved ground to creep into contention nearing the turn along the rail, lacked racing room turning for home, swung into the clear mid-stretch and
finished willingly. THUNDERSHOOK raced three wide through the first turn, raced mid-pack throughout and went evenly failing to mount a bid. HARD LOVE
trailed to midway on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. ALVAARO was rank for a half mile never settling into stride and was finished early.
NEWPORT BEACH was well placed to track the pacesetter in the first flight and gave way in the final bend.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN ABBY chased the pace from the inside, then menaced on the turn from the two path, shifted along the rail in the early stretch then surged to
the wire to be up in time. CADEAU DE PAIX stalked the pace while two wide, was moving up on the turn, gained command around the quarter pole, then
held on gamely to the lead down the lane but was out finished by an inner rival in the end. MARIAH'S CANDY moved up while four wide to chase the pace
into the turn from the two path, then rallied from the three path in the early stretch to close well for the show position. MISS DISTINCTIVE raced along the
inside down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied in the early stretch but closed too little too late. SUPER WONDER GIRL raced in the two path,
then bid mildly on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. SWEET BAY raced behind the field then bid in the late stretch and was no threat.
MIDSUMMER SOIREE bid between rivals to set the pace along the inside, was in a hard drive then was used up on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SMARTY RIDGE settled off the early pacesetters, swung out five wide at the top of the lane and closed with a strong drive to be up in time. TIZ BODHI BOY
well in hand to be near the rear of the field, commenced a rally at the top of the stretch and closed with a belated rush splitting horses to gain the place.
MALORIE'S BIG BOY broke alertly to take the lead from three wide while dueling to the head of the lane, opened a brief clear lead in the lane but could not
hold off the closers in a game effort. MR. VALENTINO dueled on the lead from the rail to upper stretch and finished willingly in a good effort. BEYOND
INFINITY pressed the pace from between horses in a three horse speed duel, backed out turning for home and weakened down the lane. VALDINA
DREAMS went evenly and failed to threaten. DADA BOOM RIDGE raced a the rear of the main body of the field and was never a factor. SUMMER HELP
well placed for the first half mile and tired in the stretch. KEEPMOVINGFORWARD made a left turn from the gate, was gathered up after spotting the field
nearly fifty lengths, galloped to the top of the lane and worked through the lane.

Footnotes
AISHA R N moved swiftly along the inside in the first furlong to gain command heading into the turn, then was able to hold onto the lead grudgingly down
the lane to prevail in the end. FLY CONDOR was in a steady drive to stalk the pace from the three path into the early stretch, then dug in gamely and closed
strongly to be up for the place prize. HOW BOUT ME chased the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn to close belatedly down the lane, just
missing the grand prize in the end. TITLED LADY chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then surged down the lane and hung in the end. NIGHT
ORB was pinched back at the start, then raced along the inside, bid wide on the turn to close well down the lane but it wasn't enough in the end. YVONNE'S
MISS was unhurried early then bid while three wide on the turn, drifted out six wide in the stretch and was no threat. COUNTRY LADY was in a hard drive to
press the pace while two wide into the early stretch, was used up and gave way in the end. SWEET SLEW raced in the middle of the field while four wide,
then faded throughout and was no menace.
