JUST STAY HOME lacked speed, advanced inside on the final turn, moved out, in the stretch and was up late. SUGAR STREAK vied for the advantage
outside, took over near the three eighths pole, moved well clear but was nailed nearing the wire. ALWAYS A QUEEN well placed outside the dueling
leaders, was carried out into the stretch and offered a mild bidi. HEY DEWZPOTS angled inside early, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out.
MANI PEDI broke slowest and lagged far behind then caught fading rivals. YOURINDENIAL dropped back saving ground and and weakened steadily.
FIELD LETTERS led inside under pressure to the far turn, bore out into the stretch retreating.

PARADISE VALLEY dueled wide then the two path, took over into the stretch and quickly drew away under moderate urging. ROYAL MOVER forced the
pace early, faded inside on the turn then came again outside for the place. KAIQUE advanced inside on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. GO EAST
dueled inside the winner to the stretch then came up empty. FLORIANOPOLIS raced close up very wide down the backstretch and weakened. MR LAOBAN
steadied in tight soon after the start then was never in contention. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN saved ground off the leaders and faltered. CARRICKMACROSS
was close up extremely wide down the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
ABUELO NUNO stalked two wide, chased FRENCH TOAST on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed steadily in the final furlong, wore down
that rival in deep stretch and edged away. FRENCH TOAST vied two wide for the lead, took over at the half mile marker, shook free, responded when
asked, dug in gamely in the drive and yielded grudgingly late. YES SIR COLONEL was off a bit slow, trailed the field, moved up on the far turn, came two
wide into the lane, rallied mildly inside and earned the show spot. SUPER DUDE tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane
and gained mildly outside. WIZARD SERRAT raced off the pace between rivals, advanced on the far turn and lacked a stretch rally. LONG TERM
THINKING was off a bit slow, raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide past the half mile marker and did not factor. ANGELUS WARRIOR vied inside
for the lead, chased inside on the far turn and gave way.

CAPITAL CONQUEST alternated for the lead outside, shook loose near midstretch and edged off driving. SPIRIT SKY put to urging early, raced off the
pace then rallied inside through the stretch to gain place. SEPARATE WAYS vied with the winner along the inside to the stretch and weakened. UPFOR
PAROLE was eased back in the opening quarter, bid inside on the turn and flattened out. RABBIT chased just off the dueling leaders and began fading on
the turn. IF WE GET LUCKY lacked speed, moved very wide and was no factor. SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE rushed to contention wide down the backstretch
and faltered. T'WAS THE NIGHT broke through the gate prior to the start then was always outrun. BEAR OR BULL flashed speed inside then stopped
abruptly losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
HOLDTHEFLIGHT stalked three wide, chased outside on the turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, gained steadily, moved up alongside of EGO MAN in
deep stretch, dueled to the wire and narrowly prevailed. EGO MAN set the pace racing off the inside, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the final
furlong, battled heads apart with HOLDTHEFLIGHT in the final hundred yards and just missed. TOUGH TICKETS raced off the pace, moved up four wide
on the turn and rallied mildly outside in the lane. COMMISSIONER G trailed the field, advanced at the quarter pole and passed tired rivals in the stretch.
EASY DAY chased between rivals early on, chased on the turn and tired. DALTON tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and faded. PER RULING
23262PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, EGO MAN WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

with a mild bid. VALIANT MAJESTY saved ground early, faded on the turn and was no factor. FILTERED LIGHT moved inside closer into the far turn then
faltered. HOP ON ME raced very wide throughout and was never in contention. CHRONOLOGY was well placed outside the dueling leaders early then gave
