Footnotes
CAT'S RHYTHM allowed to settle, advanced steadily through the turn and into the stretch to make the lead at the furlong marker, was put to mild right
handed urging and proved best in a game effort. AUJARA was fractious in gate, sprinted p the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set the pace until
mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner. JETTIN PEGASUS trailed down the backstretch then passed tiring rivals in the four path. APPEALING
SENORITA went evenly. STAR MABEE chased the pace into the turn then faded. CARMEN OHIO was no factor.

Footnotes
GRAY ROYALITY was on heels near the nine sixteenths pole causing her rider to check, altered course five wide, rallied three wide into the stretch to make
the lead before the furlong marker and drew off under right handed urging. CHORIST never far back, surged late in the five path and finished clear for
second. ADMONISH unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the six path. MY GIRL MELLY checked and altered course five wide near the five eighths pole,
loomed boldly three wide before a half, prompted the pace to the top of the stretch, made the lead then came up empty. TIME FOR CUPID under strong
restraint along the rail through the clubhouse turn, was through after a half. YEARS AGO made the lead soon after the start between horses two wide, set
the pace for six furlongs then weakened. DREAM TO WIN was unprepared for the start as her head was turned, missed the break, was never involved and
declared a non starter. UNCAPTURED FAITH pressed the pace three then two wide for six furlongs then flattened out. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INIQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DECLARED DREAM TO WIN AS NON STARTER.

PANAMANIAC dueled for the lead along the inside until mid stretch then finished full of run to win going away under a brisk hand ride. A SMILE A DAY
battled with the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while gamely hanging on for second. TOTALLY OBSESSED stalked the pace four wide
and went evenly. TWERK close up along the inside into the stretch, improved position before the eighth pole, drifted to the five path then failed to sustain
that bid. FRONT CIRCLE failed to menace. SUSHI Q stalked the pace three wide through the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
ATILANO'S THUNDER broke slowly and rifted out, circled his field rapidly through the turn and upper stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker and
edged clear under mild urging. DANES HEART never far back, steadied behind a rival in mid stretch, altered course four wide, surged late and got up for
second. SOL OF VAQUERO allowed to settle, loomed boldly along the inside into the stretch and was outfinished despite a game effort. BRONZE KETTLE
found his best stride late in the seven path. IPPOLITO'S WONDER stalked the pace inside, shifted to the six path entering the stretch then went evenly.
VEGAS PLAYER failed to menace. HURRYCANE DON was outrun. STRIKING AGAIN vied for lead the lead three wide into the turn, made the lead at the
quarter pole, set the pace into the stretch then came up empty. TRANSPIRED broke in front, set the pace in the two path for a half then weakened. MY
HOMBRE pressed the pace along the rail and was through after a half. WHY KENNY WHY was through early.

Footnotes
MITESSE sped to the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. MS.
THE LAW pressed the pace three, then two wide, inched closer midway on the turn then was no match for the winner. ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS pressed
the early pace along the rail, dropped back on the turn, altered course to the six path then came on again. TWILIGHT VISION saved ground and went
evenly. ALSANAH unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild rally late in the nine path. DANZING CHICK had good early speed then faded. LADY
GIULIANA failed to menace. KISS ME ON OCONEE trailed.

tight and bumped nearing the first turn, never far back, began to rally in the four path on the far turn, dropped inside the drifting leader then finished with
good courage between horses. COMPLY stalked the early pace four wide, dropped back on the far turn then came on again late. DISCLOSURE trailed into
the stretch, swung out past the middle of the racetrack and passed tiring rivals. RAISON KARTER vied for the lead three wide, offered a bid two wide on the

I WANNA WIN unhurried early, circled horses rapidly five wide through the far turn, made the lead before the furlong marker, drew clear and prevailed under
strong handling. TANTRUM trailed until mid stretch, closed with a burst of speed in the middle of the racetrack and got up for second. DARK VADER never
far back, surged three wide after a half to make the lead entering the far turn, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. TO WIN found his best
stride late in the six path. MO DONT NO failed to menace. IT'S YOUR CALL chased the pace along the inside and was through after a half. UPTOWN
chased the pace two wide in the four path, drew on even terms for the lead entering the far turn, matched strides into the stretch then was used up.
WICKED WARRIOR made the lead soon after the start, set the pace for five furlongs, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then was used up. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
