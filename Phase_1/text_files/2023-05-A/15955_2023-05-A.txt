Footnotes
TAPIT SAM raced outside off the leaders early, shifted to the rail about the three-eighths, saved some ground on the turn, still had much to do in upper
stretch, finished strongly to bid inside the sixteenth pole, took the lead and just held from TIMEHASCOME, who broke a step slowly and a bit awkwardly,
settled toward the rear shifting in, came out early on the turn racing in about the three path, swung six deep into upper stretch, finished with a flourish and
was gaining fast but just missed. TRIPLE CHROME was forwardly-positioned inside early but eased back off the leading pair and switched outside those
passing the five-eighths, stalked three to four wide on the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home and again in later stretch, made a bid near the furlong
grounds, kept on to get show honors. IRONMAN RICHIE came out a bit at the break, moved forward to set the pace facing pressure, dueled inside through
the turn, retook command in upper stretch, was simply outkicked while continuing to fight on to the wire. BOURBON TEDDY bobbled at the break, moved
forward to force the pace, dueled outside two to three deep on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SUPRISE CAT raced near the inside and was never a
threat. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
COWGIRL FRANKIE got away slowly, was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn, angled out eight wide in upper stretch then unleased a furious rally to
fly by a sixteenth from home and cleared. FREEDOM ATTACK was forced out and into a rival at the start, settled off the pace inside, came off the rail on the
turn, swung five wide for the stretch run, ran on to get up for second. BE MY BESTIE bumped the outer rival at the start then was bumped by a foe after,
moved forward outside to challenge for the lead midway on the turn, was in command coming to the quarter pole, clear by mid-stretch but had no late kick.
FAST KYLIE was bumped at the start, chased two wide, failed to rally. GO ON GIRL veered out at the break, was urged forward to set the pace inside,
raced clear into the turn, challenged late on that bend and came off the fence a bit, overtaken by the top of the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.

UNCLE DICK settled outside stalking the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn moving out six deep into upper stretch, drove past inside the final
sixteenth. SANTINO'S FANTASY pressed the pacesetter then dueled outside that one three wide, floated wider into upper stretch, was put to greater urging
past the furlong marker and began to edge past but was outkicked by the winner. STAN THE CAMERAMAN was coaxed to the lead, set the pace inside
racing off the fence, dueled through the turn and into the stretch, drifted out turning into upper stretch, kept on gamely but was outfinished. WICKED
SUPRISE stumbled at the start, chased with a forward position inside, weakened. NOBLE CREEKER was outsprinted early racing well off the inside, raced
in the three to four path on the turn swinging seven wide into upper stretch, failed to make a bid. NORMANDY ANGEL hopped and was squeezed back at
the start, shifted in and saved ground on the turn, was not a threat.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN HAMMER attended the pace inside a rival, took command from that one about the five-sixteenths, drew off in the stretch under urging. ROCKET
MAN ATTACK forced the pace outside the eventual winner, was no match for that one but second best. EYE ON DESSERT trailed early, swung six wide
into upper stretch, shifted in through the lane and got up for show honors late. CHERRY ORCHARD raced off the pace in the two path on the turn, came out
in the stretch, was outfinished for show honors. LIGHTNING CASHES veered out badly at the start but recovered to move forward racing outside a rival off
the leading pair going three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. PASSING TIME tracked from off the rail in the two to three path inside a rival, failed to
make a bid.

Footnotes
ON A TOUR was bumped into a rival and appeared to clip heels heading to the first turn, was allowed to settle at that juncture, raced well back early,
advanced inside on the far turn, came out in upper stretch, struck the lead past the eighth pole and drew clear. COUGER was just a touch fractious in the
gate, lightly bumped heading to the first turn then quickly moved clear and shifted in, set the pace racing just off the rail, drifted out in late stretch while
unable to kick on with the winner but kept on to save the place. NO NANNETTE NO bobbled at the break, tracked inside early racing off the leaders, took
closer order heading into the far turn, switched out and advanced three wide on that bend, was within range but kept on evenly and just missed second
while drifting out a bit in late stretch. WEEKEND PASS was a bit slow to get moving, brought up the rear, improved position in the stretch. HER GOLD MINE
raced four deep through the first turn, moved in a bit and nearer the leader to press up the backstretch, was still within range three then four wide on the far
turn and came up empty for the drive. LINDALOUIMAGE bumped a rival heading into the first turn, raced two wide on that bend mid-pack, came out for the
stretch run and failed to rally. WATCHIN THE WHEELS pursued three to four wide outside runners mid-pack early, floated wider for the drive and tired.

Footnotes
WILMA MANKILLER pressed the pacesetter into the turn racing two to three wide, took a narrow lead past the three-eighths, edged clear by upper stretch,
was put to urging at that juncture and held sway. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER stalked off the leading pair in the two to three path, could make no headway on the
winner but preserved the place. DESSERT FIRST hopped at the start and spotted the field several lengths, steadily advanced into the turn and moved
between foes three wide about the three-eighths, ran on evenly in the lane. BALIMOS settled outside at the rear, swung seven wide for the stretch run and
improved. AWESOME SUNDAY set the pace racing inside on or just off the rail, gave way in the stretch and faded. FREE LOVE saved ground on the turn,
came out in upper stretch and failed to rally. OPALINE pursued from outside mid-pack, was getting out by the five-sixteenths bearing out several paths,
tired.

Footnotes
DREAM ISLAND broke through the gate tossing the rider but was caught by the outrider soon after and received a new jockey, broke outwardly the second
time around and quickly sped clear to set the pace, faced outside pressure early up the backstretch, edged away again on the far turn, held sway in the lane
while being kept to the task. UNIFIED DREAMS broke outwardly, was caught four to five wide through the first turn, steadied ever-so-slightly at the
six-and-one-half, regained momentum advancing again four to five wide on the far turn, was clearly second best. HIGH BROW was urged forward at the
break racing between foes three to four wide into the first turn, dropped back heading to the far turn, moved out from three to five wide on that bend, drifted
a bit in the stretch and was best of the rest. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN was bumped entering the first turn racing at the back and inside, advanced inside up
the backstretch to the far turn, saved some ground on that bend, evened out in the lane. PATH TO SUCCESS was forced out at the break, took back and
angled in heading into the first turn bumping a rival entering that bend, advanced two wide and between foes soon after, continued two to three wide on the
far turn, drifted a bit in the stretch and ran on. WESLAN was in a bit tight and taken back early, settled at the rear, swung seven wide and improved position.
BEN DREAMING was forced out a bit at the start, caught five to six wide on the first turn moving forward, pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch,
dropped back four wide late on the far turn and faded. MIDNIGHT ROYAL was forwardly-placed, pressed two to three wide, faded.

Footnotes
WINNEMAC AVENUE was bumped at the break but recovered well to move forward and stalk two to three wide, edged closer to apply pressure by the
seven-sixteenths, took the lead by the five-sixteenths, drifted out leaving the far turn, drew off under mild urging. MERLOTTI settled mid-pack inside,
switched out three wide about the five-sixteenths, was carried out a bit leaving the far turn then altered inside a foe before moving back outside that rival in
upper stretch, finished strongly to get up for second. GOLD SMOKE rated in behind the early leader racing just off the rail, shifted out five wide leaving the
far turn, drifted in through the stretch and bumped a rival late. BLAME SHIFTER settled off the pace three wide, advanced mildly into the far turn going three
wide again on that bend, ran on in the stretch and was bumped late. MINNESOTA MOON moved clear to set the pace near inside, was pressured heading
into the far turn, gave way. EVEN THE WIND was bumped into a rival at the start, raced two to three wide about mid-pack early, went three to four deep on
the far turn swinging six wide into upper stretch and ran on. ANCIENT MAN was bumped lightly after the start, raced outside at the back, failed to menace.
THREE ROUGH SHODS bumped the inside rival fairly hard at the start then then outside foe after that, saved ground early but was outrun.
