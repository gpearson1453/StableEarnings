Footnotes
ONE SLICK START dueled outside, earned a narrow lead, bid clear near midstretch and just lasted. STAY HYDRATED prompted the pace between foes
and made a gradual late gain. ROCKIN COWBOY saved ground off the leaders, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. SAN ANTONE chased wide
throughout and flattened out in the final furlong. INDIRECTLY trailed to the stretch then caught fading rival. E T'S CANDY MAN hustled to the front inside,
had heels clipped at the top of the stretch and gave way. KADENS COURAGE clipped heels and fell at the top of the stretch causing a catastrophic injury
and was subsequently euthanized. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident in the stretch.

Footnotes
BIG AMBITION raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed willingly in deep
stretch and was up late for the win. ALL THAT MAGIC pressed the pace racing close up between rivals, bid on the turn, gained command at the quarter
pole, edged away, dug in gamely in the final furlong and was caught late. CARNELIAN stalked close up three wide, chased on the turn, made a bid at the
eighth pole, was outkicked and finished evenly. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the lane.
MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES set the pace on the inside, dueled passing the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. BE WATER tracked on the inside,
chased on the turn and lacked a rally. WHY NOT BABE raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide, and failed to threaten. DUNE JUMPER raced off the pace
and did not factor.

MAXIM MOMENT raced off the pace, fell over a fallen rival past the quarter pole and walked off. BUCKS ARE MOVING raced off the pace, fell over a fallen
rival past the quarter pole and walked off. POLAR WIND raced off the pace, collided with a fallen rival and fell, then walked off. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS

Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
CHAIN REACTION prompted the pace outside, faded on the turn then came again through the final furlong to get up in time. HOPE FOR GOLD moved
boldly to the front three wide on the turn, bid clear then weakened. FIRE'S FINALE broke sluggishly and trailed early then rallied wide to gain the show.
MERU broke slowly, chased near the inside and lacked a rally. TACO BEAN sprinted to the front early, was collared midway on the turn and faded.
NATAVALLI'S KNIGHT forced the pace inside through the opening quarter and stopped. DANGNABBIT broke through the gate prior to the start then was
never a factor.

CAUSE I SAID rated outside, bid on the turn then edged clear through the final furlong under confident handling. LADY ZETA dueled outside, led briefly
midway on the turn, was hooked by the winner and continued gamely to the wire. BUCKS SOME trailed for half a mile, advanced very wide and was up for
the show. CONFIRMED GENIUS was asked for run outside on the turn then weakened in the stretch. CHELSEA WALL lacked speed between rivals,
moved wide in the stretch and was no factor. MIDTOWN ROSE hustled to a narrow lead inside, dueled for half mile and gave way. TILSA raced just behind
the pacesetters down the backstretch and faded. SENSE A MILLION dropped back outside and was never in contention.

SOMEBODY tracked on the inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, swept by the leaders at the quarter pole and drew off under urging. SCOTTY
stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn, bid between rivals at the quarter pole, dug in through the lane and earned the place award.
ILLUSTRIOUS set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, weakened and earned the show
spot. JUST NOD AND SMILE stalked two wide, chased two wide on the far turn, lacked a rally and bested the others. SEAT OF HONOR raced off the pace,
chased inside on the far turn and failed to rally. EDDIE'S CHARGE raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. WILD UNION hopped and was off
slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. AWE MUN was outrun early and never factored.
