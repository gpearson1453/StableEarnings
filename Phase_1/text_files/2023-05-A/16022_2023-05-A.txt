Footnotes
SMILE AT THE STORM broke awkwardly, quickly recovered, sent to a clear lead and held safe in the drive under strong encouragement. TAP N TWINE
was coaxed along from the inside, raced two to four wide in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. SUPERSTAR DIVA was bumped at the start,
chased the leaders from the two path and kept on to the wire racing four deep. FANCY EMPRESS was slow early on, raced four wide around the far turn
and lacked a solid rally raced three deep. ARCH FLYER settled early on, raced along the inside around the far into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.
BAILESTON LASSIE dropped back off the early pace, was three deep past the quarter pole and never had a response while racing from the outside.

AUNT STELLA chased the early pace, moved up two to three wide between rivals in the drive and got up late under strong handling. MY LADY SLEW was
sent clear dug in near the eighth pole and gave way to the winner late from the inside grudgingly. BERTRADA settled to race mid pack early on, made a
strong three wide bid near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire racing four wide. MORNING LINE NEWS was slow early on, moved up four wide in the
drive and improved position. NIFF raced off the early going, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a closing bid. GODSGIFT tracked the early leader
from the inside and faded.

FIRST KITTEN tracked the pace from the inside, moved up two to three wide and just got up under all out pressure. LONG TALL WOMAN stalked the pace,
moved up four to five wide in the drive and got up for the place position late. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) was sent clear early on along the inside and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. COME ON SWEET PEA was off slowly, void of early speed and had not enough in the drive. APRIL'S GEM dropped
back early, was bothered by loose horse near the half mile pole and ne never threatened. SAMARITA stumbled at the break and unseated his jockey. Was
caught soon after the wire and walked off the track.
