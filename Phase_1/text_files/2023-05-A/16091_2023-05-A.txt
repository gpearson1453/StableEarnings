Footnotes
NASHOBA'S JOY stalked on the inside then had to take hold when running up on heels on the first turn, chased two wide into the far turn, tipped three wide
to launch a bid outside the top pair exiting the bend, lugged inward while taking over in upper stretch and drove clear. ADVENTURESOME took control from
the rail, pressured from outer rivals at the halfway point, inched away on the far turn before being challenged again entering the stretch, yielded to the
winner but stayed on through the final furlong to secure the place. CLASSICALLY bobbled leaving the gate, chased two wide then steadied on the first turn,
raced between into the second bend, went two to three wide into the lane and edged CARIBBEAN KING for third. CARIBBEAN KING tracked three deep
early, raced near the back three wide into the second bend then move to the four path, kept on through the lane but got outfinished for the show honors.
UPRIGHT stalked two wide early, applied pressure at the four furlong marker, could not keep up with the leader approaching the quarter pole and flattened
in the lane. RIPPIN' RUIS (AUS) climbed along when reserved early, had to steady on the first turn, continued climb on the backstretch, went outside a rival
nearing the far turn, went four then five wide on the second bend before angling back inward and trailed three wide into the stretch, asked in the lane but
failed to menace. AMERICAN LIVIN stalked three deep early, raced up close outside the top pair on the backstretch, asked three then four wide on the far
turn and weakened. PRECISION STRIKE was fanned four deep chasing around the first turn, remained wide through the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and weakened.

ESTABLISHED vied for the lead between rivals, inched ahead at the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off. CAJUN TREASURE
vied three deep early, around the turn and into the lane, could not kick on with the winner entering the furlong grounds but kept on to prove second best.
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL bobbled a bit leaving the gate, went up to fight inside a pair of rivals for the lead, stayed on through the turn, then lost touch with the
winner nearing the stretch, flattened in the final furlong but managed to hold third. MIGHTY MATT bumped inner rival at the start, tracked five wide into the
turn, moved to the three path around the bend then tipped back out into the stretch, churned on through the lane but lacked a necessary bid. VICENTE'S
SHADOW was off slow in the beginning, saved ground at the back through the turn, steered out into the final furlong and failed to menace. SCRATCHY
APACHE took a bump from MIGHTY MATT at the start, chased the top trio four wide into the turn, angled to the two path around the bend, went two to
three wide into the lane and weakened.

MOODY JIM (IRE) stalked between foes early then off the rail in the middle stages, angled out to start a run and traveled four deep at the quarter pole,
moved back in some leaving the bend while taking control from COMRADERY (IRE), cleared briefly in upper stretch then held well over the runner-up.
WEEGEE stalked along the rail early, tipped two wide between rivals at the quarter pole, moved back inward entering the stretch, launched a bid from the
fence but could not get by the winner. COMRADERY (IRE) dueled for the lead from outside, cleared briefly at the quarter pole and moved to the inside, was
soon challenged and overtaken leaving the bend and flattened to third. GROWTH ENGINE bobbled leaving the gate, was keen early three deep under a
hold before settling, asked three then two wide on the far turn but failed to rally. SITTIN ON GO was antsy in the gate, trailed two wide early, three wide into
the drive and was never involved. RIP CITY coaxed from the gate to go to the front, dueled for command from inside, fought to the five-sixteenths pole then
chased the leader around the far turn, had to check when put in tight quarters leaving that bend and faded in the drive.

ROSY EDGE broke out but was quickly corrected, went up to be closest in pursuit from the two path early, applied pressured to the leader from outside on
the backstretch, dueled into the lane, cleared inner rival in upper stretch and drew off. MIDNIGHT SILENCE set the pace from inside early, took pressure
from ROSY EDGE in the middle stages, held a short lead through the far turn before dueling into the stretch, yielded to ROSY EDGE outside the eighth pole
but was still clearly second best. PRESTIGIOUS was a bit rank prior to the first turn, chased two wide between early, trailed three wide into the stretch and
churned on to finish a clear third. JACQUELINE COCHRAN chased three deep around the first turn, three then two wide on the far turn and weakened.
MIDNIGHT SUSI rated along the inside early, lost ground through the far turn still next to the fence and weakened in the drive.

STAMP MY PASSPORT dueled for the lead into the first turn from the rail, cleared around the bend, set all the pace to the stretch and remained clear to the
wire under left-handed urging. GHOSTLY ACT angled in early while settling at the back, pulled a bit into the first turn, moved closer into the far turn, ran in to
traffic and had to steady early on the far turn, remained inside to the stretch, angled out in the lane and rallied for the place. SILVER N BLACK dueled from
outside into the first turn then ceded command to STAMP MY PASSPORT, remained close to the far turn, loomed two wide into the stretch, lacked the
needed late response and got beaten for second. GET THE GOLD settled in the two path then along the rail, moved into range up the backstretch, waited
behind the leader leaving the far turn, roused in upper stretch and could not summon the needed late kick. SILENT HEAT had to check along the rail before
the first turn, rated along the inside then move into the two path, got crowded a bit near the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. WE NEED MARKETING tracked two to three wide on both turns and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SIGNORA MINISTER took control early, set the pace off the rail then crossed over to the inside, met the bid from MISS JOANNIE into the turn, cleared at
the five-sixteenths pole, then drew off under right handed urging and steady handling late. PRECIPICE broke a step slow, chased off the rail, shifted in and
bumped rival near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two then three wide on the turn, tipped out in the lane and finished willingly for second. AVA'S STORM
took a bump leaving the gate, forwardly placed inside rivals then lost her path early, tracked from inside and cut the corner into the lane and gained the
show. MYGALSDAWNNLORI broke in and bumped rival, stalked from inside, put to right-handed urging at the top of the lane and flattened. MISS JOANNIE
raced up close to the inside of the leader then switched to the outside, bid two wide into the turn, could not keep pace at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two
wide into the lane and weakened. TURQUOISE BIKINI got crowded between rivals early, pulled forward and had to check off heels, got bumped and
checked again near the seven-sixteenths pole, asked right-handed into the lane and failed to menace. BELLA BABY was reserved in the early going, had to
steady near the half-mile pole, went three deep around the turn, shifted inward in upper stretch and weakened. STREISAND was off slow to begin, lagged
behind early, eased around the turn and down the lane eventually crossing the wire and walked off.
