Footnotes
WALKTHELINE away well, stalked the early pacesetters from the rail, was set down at the top of the lane, gained the lead with a furlong remaining, and
drove clear. CREDIBILITY chased five wide in the final turn, rallied through the stretch, and edged away late to secure place. BOSS MAN CAN hurried to
the front, set a pressed pace inside of WEDGE POND, and lacked the late rally required. WEDGE POND pressed the early pace three to four wide and tired
in the stretch. SPORTSCARR trailed throughout.

DAD'S LEGACY contested the pace in the three path, gained an advantage leaving the final turn, and held under a late drive. FROBISHER BAY settled off
the pace, rallied determinedly outside through the stretch, and narrowly missed. EXAMINER chased under urging, took closer order in the final furlong and
gave best late missing out. NO SUPAH FOR YOU attended the pace between rivals, and flattened late in the stretch. ADRIEN'S AURORA lacked early
speed and offered a late mild bid. SAVED BY ZERO showed early speed inside, lugged out from the rail, and yielded under handling by the rider.
ENTITLED STAR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MOHAMAD raced three wide into the opening turn, stalked the pace from the rail, shifted out to the two path, ran down the leader mid-stretch and won
driving. LIL ZAPPER vied for the early lead, lead the way through the far turn, and lacked the rally needed late. LAHUN stalked the pace three to four wide,
rallied outside of FROSTEDBIRD, and inched clear to secure show. MUDINATOR broke slow, raced in close quarters entering the opening turn, and offered
a late bid. FROSTEDBIRD pressed the pace early, rallied between rivals into the stretch and gave way late. SMART CAT checked out of tight quarters in
the far turn and finished evenly. CARAVAN PRINCE failed to threaten. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SMART CAT against the
rider of MUDINATOR and MOHAMED alleging interference entering the opening turn. After review by the Board of Stewards, MOHAMED was disqualified
and placed sixth for interference with SMART CAT.

Footnotes
BIG BAD INTAGLIO sat in striking range in the four path, drifted in under right-handed urging, steered out sharply, and closed steadily to score the win in a
multi-horse scramble to the wire. ROUGH CUSTOMER chased inside, gained closer order into the stretch, and closed gamely deep stretch. KISS ME
HELLO sent for speed inside, drifted in entering the opening turn, found the front in the final turn, responded to a looming threat into the stretch, and was run
down. PACHECO checked hard out of tight quarters, chased hard entering the stretch, and just missed after a determined effort. OUR SUNSHINE raced
four wide into the opening turn under a snug hold, and closed gradually under steady urging. MAMA'S PROUD JOKE saved inside, and lodged a mild late
bid. VANTASTICCANAVERAL settled outside, drifted in and came up empty in the drive. BUSTER BRADY outsprinted in the turn, chased KISS ME HELLO
at the head of the lane, and wilted abruptly late stretch. H K RAPPER chased to no avail. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of
PACHECO against the rider of KISS ME HELLO alleging interference into the opening turn was upheld. KISS ME HELLO wsa disqualified and placed fourth
for interference to PACHECO.

Footnotes
FAST EH broke alertly to set the pace, turned back a challenge from J. CRUZ, was kept under handling, and held firm. VICTORY AT LAST outsprinted to
the turn, sat in striking range, loomed boldly into the stretch but was unable to get by. DANZA UNBRIDLED broke inward, closed well late to earn show
honors. WYE CROSS dropped back leaving the backstretch, closed steadily outside late in the stretch and missed. J. CRUZ showed good outside speed,
moved up to challenge FAST EH, was unable to move on with rival and flattened out. FULL VELOCITY bumped leaving, chased outside and tired. MUCHO
MAGIC chased inside, and failed to threaten. MAJOR SHEPARD jostled away, passed tiring rival. BODYMOOR HEATH bumped away, then was hustled
inside, and lacked a kick. SNAP COUNT bumped leaving, and offered little along the rail.
