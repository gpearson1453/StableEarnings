Footnotes
MARCHED , deftly taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch for clear
sailing, closed determinedly outside horses, led late and drove clear. SHARP RED EAGLE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, circled the turn three
deep, advanaced outside horses to gain the lead near the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. STAR SHOPPING , along the inner rail around the
turn, was in hand waiting for room in upper stretch, found a room inside horses in the drive and rallied. QUINCANNON , wide around the turn, drifted to the
eight path in upper stretch and had a slight rally while on his left lead. SUPER JORDAN disputed the pace outside THANK YA PETE and weakened the final
furlong. CLAUDEE BOY advanced between horses leaving the turn, was well positioned in upper stretch then gave way. THANK YA PETE hugged the inner
rail while disputing the pace and faltered approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CYPRES STATION , bumped with GAMING SOUL at the break, hustled up and vied outside I AM THE MIKE into the first turn, shook clear past the seven
eighths and set the pace just off the rail, dropped in closer to the rail leaving the far turn then met an outside challenge, dueled, was headed in upper
stretch, battled back to regain the lead with a furlong to go then edged away under a steady drive. I AM THE MIKE reared up when fractious in the gate,
broke outward then was corrected and sent to dispute the issue into the first turn, rated back off of the winner leaving the seven eighths and angled out to
prompt three wide, bid two wide outside that one leaving the far turn, dueled and gained a slim lead in upper stretch, lost command departing the furlong
grounds, faded late but was well clear of the rest. GAMING SOUL , bumped at the break, regrouped and moved up towards the rail to stalk, was hard urged
pursuing the embattled leaders past the three eighths, eased out some for the drive but went evenly. LUNAR GHOST , bumped soon after the start,
dropped well off the pace while removed from the inside, came wide for the drive and had belated action. GENERAL J R lagged back and failed to respond.
ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE , hustled along while racing the clear past the five furlong marker, retreated.

Footnotes
IN A SPIN stalked the pace inside horses, saved ground around the far turn, found room along the inner rail to take command in upper stretch and drew off
under urging. AMAZON QUEEN stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and
flattened out. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT , wide the far turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late effort. BETCHA BY
GOLLY , steadied leaving the first turn, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, remained inside and passed tired horses. CUPIDS DREAM lacked speed
and was never a factor. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch, gave way and her rider dropped his whip in
mid stretch. BECKON chased the pace two wide and faltered. DOTADA , four wide the far turn, weakened after six furlongs and was eased late.

Footnotes
CAJUN DREAM took over near the five eighths, cleared and dropped in to set a rated pace, responded when sharply roused left handed in upper stretch,
drifted briefly, was corrected with right handed asks and steadily widened while eager to the wire. SIR SMOAK leaned in at the break, corrected and pulled
his way forward between runners nearing the turn, secured the rail past mid turn, kept on gamely and earned the place through the final seventy yards.
BEST CHOICE BABY stalked the pace three deep leaving the far turn, chased to the outside of SIR SMOAK through the lane but was out kicked for
second. SEEING RED had speed to lead early, saved ground chasing leaving the far turn, came out for the drive but lacked a solid rally. SPEIGHTS YOUR
MIND , three deep into the turn, angled wider in the lane but came up empty. DAREDAVITE broke a step slow, angled out early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CLASSIC COLORS lacked speed, raced outside horses on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses and took the lead late.
IZZYBELLA , taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail and gave way grudgingly. PRINCESS JAVONCIA saved ground around
the first turn, raced in the two path between horses on the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and finished evenly. INSTINCTIVE , steadied behind
IZZYBELLA entering the first turn, raced along the inner rail throughout and failed to rally. CONGRESS HALL , along the inner rail on the far turn, swung to
the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BIG CHEEKS raced in the two path inside horses on the far turn, was taken to the six path in upper
stretch and passed some tired foes. CARROLL GIRL , two wide chasing the pace to the stretch, faltered in the drive. BONITA LASSIE was outrun. GIRL'S
ON FIRE , four deep the first turn, raced three wide the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
UTTERLY ENCHANTING , five deep nearing the turn, was put to a solid hand ride five wide while gathering momentum entering the lane, secured
command outside DANCER'S MELODY in mid stretch and drew out under a mild drive. DANCER'S MELODY , three wide between runners into the turn,
shifted four wide making headway into the stretch, challenged between foes near the three sixteenths, failed to kick on with the winner leaving the furlong
grounds but kept on willingly to hold down the place. MY SUPER SALLY broke a step slow, settled off the pace, while saving ground, swung out four wide
for the drive, moved up some past mid stretch and had enough left to save the show. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY , four wide between rivals near the half
mile marker, dropped back some mid turn, angled very wide in upper stretch and churned on without threatening. RAVENEL edged up early while saving
ground and stalked the pace, continued inside into the lane and faded. PRETTY EDGY , brushed at the start, stalked two wide between foes, angled out a
bit for the drive, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and gave way. CALYPSO GHOST brushed at the start, sped clear early and set the pace towards
the rail, drifted outward a few paths entering the stretch, ceded command soon after and faltered in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC FRONTIER broke a step slow, quickly recovered and advanced inside to take command, set a rated pace while handling some outside
pressure, moved clear after six furlongs, responded when put to brisk urging in upper stretch, widened past mid stretch and was kept to strong urging until
the final yards. BRANCO MARIA lost ground four wide while settled off the pace, edged up under coaxing past the three eighths, shifted out wider for the
drive and churned on to gain the place. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , in hand saving ground, cut the corner with a move into the lane, chased past mid
stretch then flattened out. NO ME DIGAS , three deep pressing the pace, saw the winner get away in mid stretch and faded late. TOTAL EFFORT forced
the pace outside the winner, raced between rivals leaving the far turn, failed to kick on soon into the stretch and weakened. TRANSFER THE FUNDS
steadied off the heels of rivals heading to the first turn, drafted back off the pace, raced removed from the rail into the far turn and failed to rally.
