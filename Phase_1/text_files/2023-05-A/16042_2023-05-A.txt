Footnotes
WARRIOR'S STAR moved forward under mild coaxing to take command and set the pace inside on or just off the rail, continued on a clear advantage up
the backstretch, extended the margin when asked coming to the five-sixteenths, came out a bit turning into upper stretch and fought on to hold. BIG PETE
stalked two to three wide, was between runners late up the backstretch and on the far turn, put to urging at the five-sixteenths, lugged in just a bit nearing
the eighth pole then immediately switched outside the leader, closed the gap but was only second best. CURIOUS IRISH bobbled just slightly at the start,
moved forward inside then rated in behind the leader racing just off the rail, saved ground inside foes on the far turn, put to a drive coming past the quarter
pole, was in just a hair tight near the furlong marker and ran on. FOOL'S MIRAGE stalked three to four wide, raced outside foes into and on the far turn and
was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, could only run on evenly. SHINE JACK'S DREAM was caught four to five wide early and was outrun.

Footnotes
FREYAS CATZ switched off the inside heading into the turn, went three wide on that bend in pursuit of the dueling leaders, struck the lead near the furlong
grounds, drew clear and held safe. OKIE HOPE pursued three to four wide, was second best. PASCALA dueled inside a rival till the top of the stretch, came
off the rail turning for home while putting that sparring partner away and with the lead, lacked the needed late kick. BROOKE'S ALL IN was devoid of early
speed, raced four to five wide on the turn trailing the field and coming into upper stretch wider still, ran on to improve. AZUSA STREET shifted in leaving the
backstretch, advanced inside on the turn reaching striking distance turning for home but lacked the needed late kick. RUNNIN BOOTS dueled outside, gave
way. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

INCA EMPIRE settled outside off the pace four wide, advanced three deep on the far turn making a bid at the five-sixteenths, was in command and drawing
away by upper stretch and was geared down late. BIG SKIPPER dictated the pace racing on or just off the rail without much effort or pressure, faced
increasing pressure heading to the far turn, was challenged midway on that bend and overtaken, proved no match for the winner but clearly second best.
GHOST STRATEGY stalked the early pace then took closer order to apply moderate pressure heading to the far turn, had no late bid when asked. MR
OKLAHOMA CITY tracked from inside, came out for the stretch run and failed to rally.

Footnotes
EUTYCHIA settled in behind the leader to track, advanced up the rail to take the lead at the half, was overtaken leaving the far turn but dug in through the
stretch to regain command seventy yards from home and prevail. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY settled at the rear, switched off the inside and made a swift
advance outside foes four wide on the far turn taking the lead at the quarter pole, appeared in command in upper stretch but was engaged by the inside rival
dueling with that one before being outfinished. MISS M J stalked the pace then applied pressure from outside three deep midway up the backstretch, lacked
the needed late kick. ROSE OF EKITA raced off the leaders while several paths removed from the inside early, moved nearer the rail heading to the far turn,
appeared to steady just slightly about the three-eighths, failed to rally. SEE WHAT'S WHAT moved forward to set the pace two deep, faced mild pressure
from outside then pressure from rivals both inside and outside, steadily weakened while switching out and had nothing left for the stretch.

Footnotes
GHOST HERO exchanged a light bump at the start, attended the pace from outside three to four wide, ramped up the pressure past the half dueling through
the turn, took command in upper stretch and forged clear under vigorous hand urging. ROWDY RIVER pressed the pace two to three wide from between
runners, dueled inside the winner but off the fence through the far turn, was no match for that one but second best. SEND THE BOSS exchanged a light
bump at the start, stalked three to four wide and in the clear but could only go on one-paced. RACHEL'S CAPER set a pressured pace inside on or just off
the rail, weakened past the half. DOMINANT OKIE rated off the pace inside early, saved ground both turns, failed to rally. CIMARRON SAND failed to
threaten while racing off the inside part of the track.

Footnotes
ELDON'S SAMURAI chased the pacesetter going two to three wide on the turn, struck the lead outside the furlong marker, moved clear and was geared
down in the final stages. STREETSTER broke a step slowly then moved from between runners to pursue just off the pace going three to four wide on the
turn, drifted about six deep into upper stretch, kicked on but was only second best. C C'S LEGACY sped clear, set the pace inside, drifted off the rail turning
for home, yielded when headed. SWEET ALEX shifted in on the turn saving some ground, needed more. SEVEN VISIONS was encouraged along racing off
the inside and was never near enough to threaten. JEANO raced near the rail well back of the leaders, angled six deep turning for home and failed to
menace. GOSPEL DANDY reared at the start, raced off the inside at the back and was not a factor.

SWEET MEDICINE settled off the leaders tracking inside, came out four wide past the quarter pole, took aim in upper stretch, bid near the eighth pole,
edged away late under steady urging. THOUGHT dueled inside a rival but racing off the rail, kept on doggedly in the stretch to defeat the sparring partner
but was outkicked by the winner. RACE DAY REBAL dueled outside the runner-up three wide, yielded grudgingly late. GOSPEL MUSKETEER raced off the
inside two to three wide and at the back early, failed to rally. HAPPY ROMANCE stalked the dueling leaders from outside four to five wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
HANNAH FO FANNAH got away alertly but was allowed to settle off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, rallied outside in the drive and just got up.
SECRET PASS set a pressured pace racing two wide with foes inside and out, was headed in upper stretch, fought back to retake the lead but was caught
at the wire. AUNT LOTTIE steadied sharply at the start, moved forward in behind runners keen to go on but running up on heels, angled five wide coming to
the top of the stretch, finished strongly making a late bid between runners that just fell short. SAYED IN A DREAM pressed the pace three wide into the turn,
bid in upper stretch appearing to put a short head in front but evened out. PASSION FOR SAND was forwardly-placed stalking four wide into the turn, had
no extra for the drive. BRYANS SONG got away slowly, settled at the rear, saved ground inside on the turn, came out a path to pass a tiring rival in upper
stretch and finished strongly to gain too late. RUN DOTTIE RUN raced off the pace four to five wide through the turn, failed to menace. LAMENTABLE
JARIN was off the leaders racing outside going five to six wide on the turn, failed to menace. BOTTLES AN BIBLES pressed the pace inside, gave way.
FLIP FLOP FLY chased briefly in behind two to three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
TOM'S GIRL settled off the pace inside, advanced near the rail then just off it on the far turn, shifted nearer the rail in mid-stretch, bid inside past the
sixteenth and edged clear. DOUDOUDOUWANADANCE had light bumps on both sides at the start then moved forward and clear to set the pace racing well
off the inside into the first turn going in the three path, moved in a bit and dictated terms two to three deep thereafter, faced inside pressure coming to the
half, was clear again on the far turn, drifted in and out just a bit in late stretch and was outfinished. RED RIVER WITCH was bumped into a rival at the start,
raced a bit rank early steadying slightly at the seven-eighths and three-quarter poles, was guided outside at that point, advanced outside heading to the far
turn then reached striking distance three to four deep on that bend, ran on. LITTLE RIVER JEWEL bumped a rival lightly at the start, had forward position
inside early, switched out heading up the backstretch, was within range three to four deep on the far turn and ran on. EXPENSIVE LIAISON shifted in to the
three path early on the first turn settling toward the rear, was still well back two to three wide on the far turn but improved position in the lane. IM THE
BIGGER BEAR angled in past the seven-eighths and moved forward inside to press the pace by the three-quarter pole, came up empty in the stretch.
RUBY THE DESTROYER was bumped into a rival at the start, pursued the pace four wide, came up empty. SULPHUR SUE bumped a rival at the start,
raced five wide early, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT CANDY stalked the early pace, edged closer to press from the three-eighths, went three wide on the turn, took charge nearing the furlong
marker and forged clear. MEGA SHACK moved clear, set the pace in the two path, was challenged by an outside rival, overtaken by that one nearing the
eighth pole and had no extra. SAZON was caught five wide on the turn, kept on late. SPIN TO WIN tracked from inside, saved ground on the turn, lacked
the needed late kick. KITTER KAT was ridden along midway on the turn, swung six wide, improved position. TIZKANDOIT was outpaced early bringing up
the rear, swung six wide, was never near enough to threaten. MONEY EXPRESS veered out at the start, pursued the pace four wide, failed to rally. OKIE
CHROME shifted in going two to three wide in behind runners on the turn, failed to menace.
