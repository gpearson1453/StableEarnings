AWHITESPORTSCOAT stalked inside early, shifted out leaving the final turn, dueled late stretch outside of SCHOCHOH, and was up with time.
SCHOCHOH showed the way leaving the backstretch, was under pressure at the head of the stretch, and was out finished. EL NOBLE chased three wide
leaving the backstretch, angled inside mid-stretch, and was outkicked. BORKAN brushed leaving then trailed the field early, and closed well late. FAST EH
brushed leaving, sat just off the pace in the two path, was roused at the head of the lane, and failed to threaten. YORKTOWN jostled away, sat off the pace,
and lacked a bid.

SUBLIME EUPHORIA stumbled leaving then was brushed, emerged the leader leaving the backstretch, remained unchallenged through the stretch and
held under a late bid by DYLAN'S SAVE. DYLAN'S SAVE rated off the pacesetter, raced five wide through the lane, closed determinedly and missed.
STUBBORN LOVE lacked a clear path when leaving the gate, hustled quickly inside, roused three wide at the head of the lane, rallied inside of DYLAN'S
SAVE but was outkicked. SHES MY DESTINY chased outside and improved late. SUNDROP sandwiched leaving, took closer order into the final turn,
shifted out to the two path at the head of the stretch, and offered a mild bid. INDIAN GIRL broke outward into SUNDROP, and was roused to no avail.
LANA'S PRETTY GIRL broke inward then was bumped, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BOOTIFUL ROSE hurried inside to secure the lead, two back challenge from NIGHT FLYER at the head of the stretch, and drove clear under a strong hand
ride. NIGHT FLYER chased BOOTIFUL ROSE through the final turn, moved up menacingly but was unable to stall the winner and just held on for second.
QUEEN RHONDA saved ground along the rail, launched an all-out bid, and missed out on place honors. MOHAYMEN DAY was allowed to settle off the
pace, and lodged a mild bid. THRILL OF THE NITE sat in striking range outside, swung four to five wide at the quarter pole, and faded in the stretch. SOFIA
D 'AMORE sat in range while four wide, and lacked a response when called upon. LILBITSPICY settled near the back of the field, and lacked a solid bid.
FAMOUS LAST WORDS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BABS DELIGHT sat in striking position along the rail, responded to handling into the stretch, gained the lead with a sixteenth remaining and held under a
drive. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE quickly went to the front, lacked the response needed when challenged by BABS DELIGHT and held firm for second. BIG
CYN broke outward bumping into MY EXPRESSION, drifted outward in the backstretch, chased four wide, moved up alongside EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE but
was unable to muster the rally needed to improve the position late. TALA broke outward into ENTITLED STAR, raced four to five wide, and closed belatedly.
OUT FRONT stalked the pace, and lacked a closing response. MY EXPRESSION brushed leaving, and offered a mild bid. DAZZLING CHIC offered little.
ENTITLED STAR brushed leaving, and was never involved. KISSABLE U stumbled badly losing the rider from the gate, did not finish, and walked off.
STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving KISSABLE U but made no change, as KISSABLE U stumbled
leaving the gate.

late. CHARMING VINTAGE unhurried early, dueled inside of ICE BOX INDY, and was caught late settling for show. ICE BOX INDY brushed JAKE THE

leaving, fanned four wide, and lacked a kick. AGENT C trailed early and passed tiring. KEEP YOUR COOL broke outward, fanned five wide in the opening

BON PRIX quickly went to the front, kept to task through the stretch, and held safely. GLAVA broke outward into COUNTRIFIED, sat in striking range early,
was roused entering the stretch, closed steadily late, and held. SMARTY RIVER PANTS saved inside, shifted out at the head of the lane, and closed well
missing out late. DRINKING AGAIN showed early speed inside, dropped back, and improved late. ABOVE AND BEYOND jostled leaving, took closer order
nearing the quarter pole, and rallied late. COUNTRIFIED bumped leaving, and offered a mild bid late. FLASHFORDANI brushed leaving, sat mid pack in the
three path, and lacked a kick. HARD TO COME HOME broke inward leaving, chased the pace through the turn, and yielded along the rail. ESCROW
STYLE was not a factor. IMPERIAL BIRD left at the gate and did not receive a fair start. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the start of the race involving IMPERIAL BIRD. After review, IMPERIAL BIRD was deemed to have had an unfair start. All monies wagered on
IMPERIAL BIRD were refunded.
