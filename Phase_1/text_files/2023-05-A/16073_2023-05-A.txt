Footnotes
LARSA was hustled to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under strong urging. LADY ABRIL never far back,
rallied into the stretch outside rivals and finished clear for second. DANCING GRACE stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch, shifted to the four
path then finished evenly. CAN I GO TOO trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally in the five path. EASTER PRIDE allowed to settle, improved
position along the rail into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. SASSY POWER chased the winner two wide into the stretch then weakened. CEE
CEE'S GOT THIS failed to menace. PENNIESANDDIMES chased the winner three wide into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
SALUTE THE KID was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace three wide, forced out to the six path as the leader drifted out entering the stretch, surged
under right handed urging and was along in time. MERE BAG OF SHELLS pressed the pace into the turn, made the lead, drifted to the five path entering
the stretch, maintained a narrow lead until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. TITEBLUEJEANS saved ground, offered a mild bid along the rail
into the stretch then leveled off. CABARET FLEUR close up four wide, failed to respond. MISS MARY JEAN rushed to the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace along the rail into the turn, had speed into the stretch then weakened. GHOSTLY REVIVAL was no factor. WAY OF THE WORLD was no
threat. BEAUTIFULLBLACKSKY was through early.

Footnotes
PERMAFROST was bumped at the start, shifted inward inside the leader leaving the chute bumping LEOLA and causing a chain reaction of bumping to her
inside, prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead before a half, quickly opened a large advantage, ducked in when struck with a right handed
whip near the furlong marker, the rider switched to a left handed stick then drew off at will to win as much the best. AURA OF GOLD broke in front then
dropped in leaving the chute, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half then was no match for the winner. QUARANTINO was in tight and bumped
leaving chute, settled within striking distance in the four path then finished with good courage three wide. LEOLA was bumped at the start then again leaving
the chute while forced inward then failed to menace. ATILANO settled inside and was never a threat. O ROMEO bore out at the start bumping LEOLA
forcing that one into the stretch, squeezed and bumped leaving chute, had speed into the stretch and faded late. TWELVE MINUS ONE was brushed
leaving chute and had brief speed. ALWAYS SPRING was bumped leaving chute, checked between rivals and trailed. THE RIDER OF LEOLA LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF AURA OF GOLD FOR ALLEGED INTEFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START, AFTRE REVIEW THE
STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

EMPIRE'S FIRE pressed the early pace inside, dropped back and shifted out to the three path after a quarter, came on again five wide through the stretch
and was along in time. GUN LAP surged three wide under a strong hold into the turn, gained a narrow advantage at the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch,
was bumped near the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. LUCKY STREAK battled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch, bumped the
runner up past mid stretch and was outfinished. OWN THE TOWN went evenly inside. ROMANTIC COWBOY contested the lead two wide then along the
inside into the stretch then weakened. CORNER OFFICE had good early speed and faded.
