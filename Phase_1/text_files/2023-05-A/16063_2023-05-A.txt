Footnotes
LAST OF THE NILE pressed the pace off the inside, lodged a bid in the two path and between horses second turn, long drive to the wire, eventually wore
the pacesetter down under brisk handling to narrowly prevail. LIGHTENING MO moved up to show the way into the first turn, set a pressured pace along the
inside, responded when challenged by the winner and another rival far turn, extended drive closest to the inside, proved stubborn to the end. SURREY
forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, continued to race within striking distance up the backstretch, challenged three wide and outside the
winner second bend, vied upper stretch while remaining widest of the first flight, could not match strides with the top two the final furlong, far clear of the
others. LA VILLANA toward the front while toward the inside into the first turn, fell back before a half, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
response. LAST PENALTY within striking distance while three wide, crept slightly closer into the far turn, came up empty for the drive. EASY ACES a bit
restless prior to the start, broke awkwardly to spot the field several lengths, trailed far back at the end.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S GIRL void early foot, began to rally smartly three wide midway on the turn, angled in a bit to challenge inside the late leader, up at the wire to
prevail by the slimmest of margins. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN broke outward but forwardly, stalked the pace up the backstretch well out in the strip, lodged a
three wide bid through the turn, took over into the lane, clear past the furlong marker, continued to lead late, nipped at the wire, clearly second best. MARDI
GRAS ALARM in the second flight early, got out through the turn to be four wide into the lane, drifted out further under a single left handed crop nearing the
furlong grounds, continued to drift despite a firm right handed crop to impede JULIO CHOICE late forcing that one to steady and alter course, could not get
to the top pair late. REINA ACES lacked early foot, six wide into the lane when advancing, flattened out in the late going to finish up evenly. JULIO CHOICE
in the second flight turn, came five wide into the pinched and steadied when MARGI GRAS ALARM drifted out with under a furlong to run, altered course to
the inside but had lost all chance. MACEE got clear out of the chute, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, faltered when headed by the
winner into the lane. EASY ACT off a step slow, trailed most of the way, five wide into the lane, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals. MOR KISSES
settled in mid pack, had little for the drive. STOP SHOP N DROP made little impact in lacking a rally. MOONLIGHTMADDY broke well pressed the leader off
the inside, challenged between horses in the turn, faltered in the drive. CONTINENTAL RED broke sharp, flashed some brief speed, began to retreat before
a half, stopped through the stretch to be distanced, jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP
STRETCH, MARDI GRAS ALARM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
CRIDER CHASE moved up along the inside to set the pace, vied in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, shook clear upper stretch, maintained a
daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. BOSTON LUCILLE broke back, saved ground when lacking speed first turn, moved out into the far
turn, came five wide for the drive, finished willingly to be up for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. THE GREY BEAUTY pressed the winner from
the outside early, continued to battle with that one between foes until falling back a bit into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught late
for the place. MYLIES STAR broke out to bother outer rivals, raced in the second flight, saved ground into the lane, not enough in the late going for the
show.l. LUCKY DEAL five wide into the first turn when off the pace, four wide onto the backstretch, three wide through the second bend, lacked a serious
late kick to finish up mildly. KAITLYN'S COURT bothered at the start, void of speed in trailing for six furlongs, moved out widest for the drive, stride late
down the middle of the strip to improve position. IRON BANNER in the first fight while three wide, continued to force the issue for a half and began to
weaken, continued to fade down the lane. KAPPA HILL bothered at the break, four wide when lacking speed first turn, continued outside in lacking a rally.
BRI bothered at the break, was straightened to race in mid pack early, faded through the lane. RESPOSADO in the second flight early toward the inside,
began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
PAYOFF CYCLE cleared into the first turn toward the inside, rated in showing the way onto and up the backstretch, extended advantage second turn,
enough left late to hold off the runner up. NEPHI in a bit tight at the break, settled in the second flight early off the inside, chased the winner through the final
turn and into the stretch, getting to that one late while fully extended to hold the place. MY UNCLE BILLY void of speed while in the two path, moved out for
the run into the far turn, four wide into the lane, rallied, brushed with SHOE TRICK past the furlong marker, late push to be gaining on the top two late.
BUCK'S GLORY in the second flight in the first turn while four wide, continued one paced off the inside, lacked a closing punch. SHOETRICK lacked speed,
moved a bit closer into the stretch, brushed between foes with less than a furlong remaining, went evenly to the wire afterward. APRIORITY ROCKET broke
out to bother BASTI BLUE and carry that foe out, four wide first turn, three wide when moving closer three wide late in the second bend, failed to sustain
that effort to the wire. BASTI BLUE carried out while bothered at the break, trailed in lacking any speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
factor. CAMEO TRICK keen and slow to settle when with the second flight first turn, was finished after a half. UNCLE JETT forwardly placed with with the
second group in the first turn, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
EASY RUNNER stalked the early leader outside, raced three wide when creeping closer through the turn, outside bid in upper stretch, took over past the
furlong marker, quickly drew out on his own courage to win ridden out. HOLY BAYOU quickly sprinted clear after the start, set the pace in the two path,
offered little resistance to the winner when confronted nearing midstretch, no match for that one, remained clear for the place. PESO PESADO void of
speed, raced four wide through the turn when beginning to rally, continued mildly to the wire to be clear of the others, no threat to the top pair. HALF MAGIC
chased the runner up from between foes for three furlongs, set down late in the turn, failed to respond. LUCAS ZIP IT settled off the pace in mid pack, three
wide through the turn, also lacked a closing response. MIZSPELT within striking distance for three furlongs along the inside, gradually weakened through
the lane. WIN WON DOBBS made little impact after being last away. SMOOTH RIVER fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
SABERFIGHT never far back off the inside, four wide when advancing into the lane in taking over, kicked clear, held late. ZONG WAVE within striking
distance outside, four to five wide turning for home allowing the winner the four path into the lane, a bit unruly past the furlong marker, regathered, late run,
dug in late to prevail for the place in game fashion. KASENS TRIBE void of early foot, four to five wide turn, set down for the drive, rallied down the middle
part of the strip, late bid for the place, missed. SPARKLE CITY pressed the issue early along the inside, dueled turn, weakened in the drive. GRACE'S
SOLDIER broke back, moved up to mid pack outside, four wide turn, lacked a closing response in continuing one paced to the wire. SUM CHARM in mid
pack and inside, continued to save some ground through the turn, had little for the drive. A. P. STYLE took up at the start, raced back well wide, five to six
wide through the turn, lacked a late bid. SWEET SASSICAIA off slow while a bit green, void of speed in trailing inside, passed some tiring rivals while never
a threat. SEEMYVALENTINE behind the pace while racing outside, retreated. BEAT THE DOUBLE fractious prior to the start, broke with the field, raced
toward the back of the main group then faded. CAT HAIR FLYING broke on top, set the early pace in the two path, dueled turn and stopped.
