Footnotes
JANERO ROSE broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. J T'S LA
NENA sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. DOZO was forwardly placed early,
raced off the rail through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. APART OF MY CHARM was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the
turn and finished evenly. KEBA LUCKY DAY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MY CRAFTY GAL was hustled along
early, lagged, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DIPLOMATICA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control through mid-stretch
and was fully extended to hold GYPSY WIFE safe late. GYPSY WIFE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and finished with good late energy. INDY'S STAR broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, could not reach that rival in the drive but
finished willingly. IF YOU WANT IT showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. PRANCE
raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) was forwardly placed early, saved
ground through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SUN DROPS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead into the
lane and held sway to the wire. KIRA FEVER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch
and rallied late. ENSLEYS DREAM settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. DREAMER GIRL was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. LOTSA LACE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the
pace and weakened after going a half. FOREST ACCLAMATION was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to menace. K P
HARRY KITTY lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

sixteenth to run and held gamely. SEAFARING WILDCAT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the
winner with a sixteenth to run and gave way grudgingly. BALI STAR was never far back, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy.

Footnotes
RAGING LADY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, responded to steady urging and wore down AIN'T
SHE DAHRLIN in the closing yards. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin into the lane but could
not resist the winner late. BETTY'S BAR chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. MISTY MATT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and lacked the
needed rally. ATLANTIC PRINCESS showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BOUNTY OF GOLD broke sharply to
press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
KATAR sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. JUSTIN AZTECA settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. HI YAH chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave
way in the drive. BIG JACK raced off the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. MY KACEJJ lacked early speed,
raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. PROSPECT OF RAIN was off a step slow, lagged early, moved five-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. COASTAL FOG raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
