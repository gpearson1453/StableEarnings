Footnotes
THE ADDISON POUR , three wide around the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn,
secured command turning for home and was under urging in the drive. DOWN COLD , two wide chasing the pace down the backstretch, bid for the lead
between horses mid way on the far turn, failed to match strides with the winner, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and dug in. STIMULUS MAKER , a
forward factor inside horses, eased out in upper stretch, remained on his left lead until late and flattened out. SIR TERRE , unhurried early outside horses
horses, was five deep around the far turn and passed tired rivals. NICKY BEAR lacked speed, was in the two path between horses on the far turn, failed to
menace and passed tired horses. SEVILLE ROW , in hand behind horses leaving the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, swung to the six path in mid
stretch and was not a factor. UNORTHODOX , caught in close quarters at the start, inside horses throughout, weakened late. SCOTTY BROWN set the
pace along the inner rail and gradually weakened in the stretch. READY REWARD stalked the pace in the two path down the backstretch and weakened
through the lane. OROCOVIX , no factor, was wide on both turns. DIMMI QUANDO , steadied in traffic entering the first turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
AMITY ROAD advanced inside a pair of runners to put a head in front after a furlong, set a rated pace towards the rail, was guided three wide while edging
away into the lane, responded to firm asking leaving mid stretch and held firm. TWICE GOLD broke a step slow, was taken to rate outside, circled four wide
advancing into lane and kept on willingly to gain the place. MY MAMBA chased two wide, shifted in for the drive and kept on with effort. ALOTTACENTS
stumbled at the break, regrouped and rated towards the inside, swung four wide for the drive and offered up a mild late response. SUPERSTITIEUX had
speed two wide, was headed nearing the five eighths, prompted two wide around the turn, saw the winner get away entering the lane and weakened
through the drive. KENNER , three deep tracking the pace, lacked a punch past the five sixteenths and retreated through the lane.

LOW MILEAGE broke slowly, saved ground around the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch, gained the lead outside BUCKIN' GREAT near the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. BUCKIN' GREAT disputed the pace outside DIVINE MAGIC, sprinted clear in upper stretch and was no match for the
winner. BUCKIN' LUCKY , well off the rail around the turn, chased the pace and lacked the needed rally. DIVINE MAGIC hugged the inner rail, dueled to
upper stretch then gradually weakened. FAMILY GAL was outrun. SHE'S FANTASTIC stumbled leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn and was
outrun. CALL THE QUESTION broke slowly, raced four wide on the turn, gave way entering the stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
JACKSON'S DIXIE prompted the pace outside DON'T TELL DEREN, allowed that one to go clear into the turn, came back under confident handling to re
engage approaching the stretch, took command three wide near the three sixteenths, edged clear then responded to sharp rousing, switched over to her left
lead near the sixteenth marker and held firm. BOSSYNESS , four wide outside foes early, edged up into the turn to stalk, was under pressure chasing into
stretch, kept on grinding and bridged the gap. ROWSIE EXPRESS urged along off the rail, eased out some, split rivals near mid stretch and finished with
good energy. ONE LAS OLAS lagged back, swung six wide for the drive and had belated action. QUEEN TAPITURE angled four wide around the turn and
churned on. DON'T TELL DEREN took over early, set the pace towards the inside, moved away nearing the turn, was taken back on entering the lane,
stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened. THENCOMEMORNING saved ground, eased out in the drive and faded. GYMNAST , three wide, raced
between foes mid turn and faltered.

ZYRAMID sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up leaving the turn and was under urging in the stretch. BOURBON CURRENCY
trailed around the turn, lacked room along the inner rail in upper stretch, swung to the six path in mid stretch and rallied outside rivals. STRIKE ME DOWN
circled foes four wide around the turn then rallied mildly. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK , in the two path around the turn, chased the winner to upper stretch then
weakened. REDEEM EDDIE saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and lacked a rally. SPEAK UNITY raced between horses
throughout and came up empty in the stretch. BOMBOLONI , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in the drive.

PORCH SWING had speed and took over from between rivals leaving the three quarter pole, dropped in nearing the turn and took outside pressure from
OCCASIONAL MOON, dueled from there widening from rivals, kept on under left handed asks in mid stretch and got the perfect bob. OCCASIONAL MOON
, five deep with the early pace, emerged in a battled outside PORCH SWING leaving the half mile pole, stayed latched to that one through the lane, fought
valiantly but got the bad end of the nose bob. HOME SCHOOL had speed between rivals then eased back off the leaders to stalk, chased to the inside of
foe past the three eighths, came out to about the three path with pursuit in upper stretch and churned on. VAX A NATION bobbled outward at the break,
quickly gained four wide between runners into the turn, chased outside a rival and went evenly late. DELEGATED , in a bit tight at the break, lagged back
under coaxing, came four wide for the drive but lacked a serious run. HE'S PURE TALENT , with the early pace inside rivals, was shuffled back nearing the
turn, angled out leaving the far turn, dropped back in for the drive but needed more. TEMPESTIVO , five then four wide, pursued mid turn and weakened.
CATCHING STARS stumbled at the break, corrected and rushed up between foes to challenge after a quarter mile, dropped off the leaders into the turn,
chased and gave way. SAGE RUNNER hopped at the break, recovered and edged up three wide, failed to kick on past the three eighths and tired.

Footnotes
WHO'S COUNTING prompted the pace outside CROSSLAND while confidently rated, took over from that one leaving the far turn, shook clear near the
stretch, kept on under solid handling inside the furlong grounds and held firm. MINT GAME settled off the pace while saving ground, commenced a run
leaving the five sixteenths, slipped through along the rail to edged up past the three sixteenths, came out for the final furlong and kept on gamely to steadily
gain. LACCO AMENO , unhurried early while about four wide, came under a ride in the clear leaving the three eighths, circled five wide gathering
momentum steam into the lane, wandered outward past mid stretch, was corrected and finished well to gain. REEL WELL settled three wide, ramped things
up four wide past the five sixteenths, continued progress to mid stretch then flattened out late. FRIGHTLAND tracked inside under rating, angled three wide
nearing the stretch but lacked a finish. BENNY HAVENS stumbled when squeezed back soon after the break, recovered and settled well back, came wide
for the drive but failed to generate a solid response. STARDUST ZIGGY stalked outside a rival, checked sharply leaving the far turn, regrouped and made a
mild run into the lane, swung out near mid stretch but failed to sustain. JARDANI failed to menace. CROSSLAND grabbed command early and set the pace
towards the inside, was shadowed by the winner through the backstretch run, was headed leaving the far turn, stayed on to the five sixteenths, angled out a
bit and gave way. JONES FALLS saved ground early and failed to menace. SPIRITUAL GHOST was outrun.
