back early, advanced through the far turn, raced four wide in the drive and rallied for the place position. SWEET MESA ROSE chased the early pace, raced
near the rail in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. JOJO'S GIRL quick to begin to set the pace from the outside, led through the far turn and
weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. LEONA was off slowly, raced from the outside in the stretch and had no late gain. MISS JAX was hustled along

steady hand ride. AWESOME STORM pressed the early leader from the outside and kept on willingly to the wire. WILD FIREMAKER came in early,

outside in the stretch and kept on to the wire. NIGHT'S WATCH was bumped soundly at the start, soon after the break was bumped soundly, checked
slightly, raced mid pack and was even late. JAZZ TOWN was hustled early, raced four wide around the far turn and had no late response. ALL IN STEW
OUI was bumped, squeezed at the start, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and never threatened. BRON AND THE BROW
