turn to go on even terms with that rival by the quarter pole, but flattened out in the lane, second best. FALSE RULING was rated early and made a four wide
bid on the turn but weakened the final furlong, held show award. HIGHWAY QUEEN was rated early two wide, came four wide into the lane and had no
rally. SAKARI chased the early pace three wide and weakened. LIL H chased the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
TEACHER DRAMA was three wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace while in the two path, drew clear on the backstretch, then was roused
nearing the furlong marker and responded well to remain clear to the wire to prove best. JUSTIN TIME was well rated three to four wide, made a three wide
bid on the turn and off the turn but could not sustain that bid late, second best. FLOWER'S FORTUNE tracked the pace three wide and came four wide into
the lane and faded, bested rest. ESTA CHUCK was settled early, two wide on the turn and lacked a solid rally. ARCTICA was reserved early, shifted out
and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. WHO U GONNA CALL stalked the winner from the inside and tired. WICKED T showed little.
