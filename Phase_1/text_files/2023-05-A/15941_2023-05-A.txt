Footnotes
HEY MADALYN CLAIRE was coaxed forward to contest the pace inside rivals but racing off the rail, had the lead from the four-and-a-half, met challengers
inside and out leaving the turn while drifting out a bit, retook command in upper stretch, drifted out through the lane but held well under steady handling. A P
HUMOR moved outside the leading trio heading to the turn, advanced between runners four to five wide on that bend, made a mild bid coming to
mid-stretch, was no match but second best. ROARING QUINN came in a bit at the start, rated in behind along the inside off the leaders, advanced into the
turn, bid along the rail briefly coming to the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort, saved show honors. DIATONIC vied between runners three
wide for the lead, dropped back abruptly at the three-eighths pole, kept on in the stretch to come again and improve position between runners in late stretch.
JUST A WIN broke in the air, settled at the rear, swung four wide for the stretch and ran on mildly. AGGIE DOCTOR broke awkwardly, made a rapid
advance outside foes five to six wide on the turn, flattened out thereafter. BOSTON BELLE broke through the gate but was immediately restrained by the
assistant secretary, attended the early pace from outside under some encouragement racing four wide into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
SNIVELING set a pressured pace inside, came out a bit leaving the far turn, was in command and clear in mid-stretch, lugged out late but held from PLAY
MO, who settled in behind the leading pair stalking three to four wide, floated six wide into upper stretch, kept on grinding to narrow the gap on the winner
but couldn't get there in time. CHARLIE G was forced out a bit heading into the first turn, settled toward the rear racing off the inside, fanned seven wide into
upper stretch and was gaining late. REAL CITY SPEED reared at the start, steadied on heels and altered outside a foe heading into the first turn, settled at
the back at that point, came out more turning for home but lacked room briefly in behind runners, found room between late and finished with interest. GET
THEM JUSTIN prompted the pace from outside the eventual winner two to three wide, drifted out a bit coming to the top of the stretch, lacked the needed
late kick and finished up evenly. JACI'S ROYALTY was rank early fighting rider's restraint, angled in entering the first turn, pulled nearer the leaders inside,
moved out heading for the far turn racing two to three deep, lacked the needed late kick. NORTHERNREFLECTION raced mid-pack off the inside early,
shifted in and saved ground on the far turn, failed to rally in the stretch. SILENT TAP was outside runners mostly four to five wide and not a factor.

Footnotes
MDA RUN ADDRESS bumped the inside rival at the start, settled off the leaders, moved four wide on the turn, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, took aim and
surged past the leader late to win going away. MARINA was bumped at the break, moved forward from between rivals in an early move to take command
coming to the half, set the tempo racing in the two path around the turn, was clear in mid-stretch and asked for more at that point but was outfinished while
well clear of the rest. PENNIES FOR PAULLA settled off the leaders, saved ground inside on the turn, came out in the stretch, finished willingly to get up for
third. AMELIES DREAMER exchanged a light bump at the start, pressed from outside three wide, steadily weakened from the turn and through the stretch,
lost show honors late. ASEEL raced mid-pack off the inside travelling about two to three wide on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on
evenly. LA LOLA came in at the break, showed a very brief chase from inside but quickly dropped back, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on. WITH
GRACE lacked early speed, was forced five deep outside a rival through the turn coming seven wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten.
HALOS ALARM exchanged a light bump at the break, stalked the leading pair three wide into the turn, came up empty. HIT IT HARD angled in early and
was encouraged along but lacking early speed, came out a bit running in the three to four path on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
COOL INDIVIDUAL, unhurried at the rear racing inside, began to advance on the far turn, came out to pass a rival at the top of the stretch, struck the lead
past mid-stretch inside the tiring leader and powered clear. ALIGNED INTEREST was outpaced early racing outside last but one three to four wide, swung
five wide for the drive and kept on late to get up for second. CHARLI MICHAEL got away alertly, cleared the field and shifted in to the two path setting a
lively pace chased by a foe but in the clear, began to edge away leaving the backstretch, drifted out in upper stretch while weakening and lost place late. J
C'S IN TOWN bumped the outside rival at the start, settled well back of the leaders three to four wide, continued through the far turn removed from the
inside two to three deep and ran on evenly late. BOULDERING was allowed to settle racing off the leaders saving some ground in the two path early,
advanced along the rail on the far turn but lacked the needed late kick and evened out. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE was bumped at the break, chased the
pacesetter three to four deep, came up empty.

Footnotes
STARSNMOTION showed good early speed, dueled inside a runner on the turn, edged clear by upper stretch, held sway under steady urging. TROSKA
settled off the pace racing in behind runners two to three deep through the turn, angled out six wide at the top of the stretch brushing a rival in the process,
captured the place under stout urging but was only second best. ALL AMERICAN PAT began to advance some four wide on the turn after settling in behind
and outside through the early stages, moved out six wide turning for home, was brushed lightly, ran on to secure show honors. TDZ CORRIENDA STAR
was bumped a few strides after the start, raced off the pace inside, came out gradually through the latter part of the turn to be four deep past the quarter
pole, lacked room in behind foes at the top of the stretch and was guided out eight wide at that juncture, finished with good energy but too late. PAYTON'S
INDIAN was reluctant to load, bumped the outside rival at the start, had forward position stalking the leaders four to five wide, ran on evenly. RUN AWAY
SAMARI broke a bit awkwardly then bumped a rival a couple strides later, moved forward to force the issue dueling outside two to three wide through the
turn, steadily weakened. PERIPHERAL VISION was outpaced early, swung ten wide for the stretch run and improved position. DEE'S LIL FOOL was
bumped at the start, outpaced in the early going, advanced outside foes seven wide on the turn, evened out for the drive. OCEAN FLEET broke just a bit
awkwardly but recovered to be within range of the leaders three to four wide heading into the turn, came up empty. MALLORY UNBRIDLED was a bit
reluctant to load, moved forward on the leading pair five to six wide on the turn, was within striking distancing turning for home but could not sustain the
effort. PLEADING GUILTY chased from inside early, faded.

Footnotes
MIAS MOONBEAM was caught five to six wide through the first turn, advanced in a middle move outside foes to challenge for the lead heading to the far
turn, took command coming out of that bend and forged clear under steady urging. HELLUVA LIFE broke a step slowly, raced off the pace two to three wide
into the first turn, was in tight on heels and altered outside a rival about the five-eighths, swung six wide for the drive and rallied but was only second best.
SPHEROID was caught five wide early, moved forward in tandem with the eventual winner to content for the lead between rivals heading to the far turn,
made a brief bid leaving that bend but had no extra for the drive. PAST VISIONS was encouraged forward while angling outside the leader heading into the
first turn, pressed that one four wide then between runners three to four deep into the far turn, was outkicked. TAKEN BACK saved ground racing on or just
off the rail and ran on with mild interest. DEALIN' STELEN settled off the pace racing about four wide through both turns, swung six deep for the drive and
ran on evenly. BINDING saved ground inside mid-pack, dropped back and failed to respond. HONOR MY SPEED reared at the start and hit the gate, pulled
keenly between rivals early up the backstretch, raced two to four wide, tired. EASY TO MISS moved clear under coaxing and shifted in to the three path to
set the pace, soon faced outside pressure still racing off the fence, came up empty by the stretch.

Footnotes
PAYNTER PARTY sped clear racing keenly in the early going to dictate terms off the fence, was encouraged in upper stretch and held sway while being
kept to the task. COLOR FAST settled off the leader outside three to four wide, edged closer past rivals into upper stretch while moving out a bit and was
second best. PAYNT BATTLE switched outside the leader and eventual winner, pursued that one three wide, had no extra for the drive but kept on well
enough late to secure show honors. ONE TIME GEM bumped with the inner rival at the start, was caught two to three wide outside rivals into the first turn,
shifted in at the half, saved ground on the far turn advancing on the leader but could only go evenly thereafter. MONARCH MAN exchanged a couple bumps
at the start, saved ground inside mid-pack on the first turn, took closer order while moving off the inside heading up the backstretch, was within range two to
three wide on the far turn but flattened out for the drive. MOTATAABEQ settled at the rear racing off the inside three to four deep on the turns, failed to
menace. ONEFORVIVI bumped with inner and outer rivals at the start, shifted in, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LET'S GO RANDOM exchanged a light bump at the break, steadily advanced up the backstretch moving between foes at the half, steadied slightly near the
quarter pole then altered out three deep, was within striking distance moving between foes turning for home, took over near the furlong grounds and forged
clear under mild urging. EASY EDDIE A bumped with the inside foe at the start, settled off the pace, advanced steadily into the turn going four wide into that
bend and moving out six deep by the end while making a brief and mild bid, was no match for the winner but second best. FLASHY BOY GOES set the
pace inside with moderate outside pressure, appeared to brush the rail about the half-mile marker without much impact, moved clear turning into upper
stretch, lacked the needed late kick. ASTERN BANKER lacked early speed settling at the back, advanced outside on the turn and ran on. CALL ME FIREY
came in at the break, moved outside rivals four to five wide on the turn to reach striking distance but could not sustain the effort. MO HAWK MAN was urged
at the break, chased inside on or just off the rail in behind the leaders, tired. NAUTICAL CRUISE pressed the early pace outside three wide then two to
three deep through the turn, came up empty. RIDGEPOINT ROAD stalked from outside four wide early, dropped back and faded. SWEET LEVI was
outpaced and not a factor.
