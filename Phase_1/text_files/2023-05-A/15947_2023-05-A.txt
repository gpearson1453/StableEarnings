Footnotes
PRINCESA CELINA chased three to four wide coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch taking over command,
went clear in hand to the finish to prevail. LESLIE'S LOOT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. SLAINTE
MHATH brushed the off side stall at the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the get go, swung three wide for home and improved position to
secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. ROUND THE TOWN hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, ducked in straightened away to the three path, then shied in towards the rail when being flashed the crop to
the right side and tired to the finish. JUST THE OAKS tossed his head and got off slow at the start conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling
into stride, chased two to three wide coaxed along from the get go, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ICY STARE DOWN came away in front then was hustled, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the
turn, responded well when set down into the stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and held under strong urging. BRISKY
FROLIC broke a half-step slow then was hustled, established a good position just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path near the
seven-sixteenths, chased the winner three wide into upper stretch then dropped further behind that foe, kept on willingly in the final furlong and safely
secured the place. JUST A NYQUIST was fractious in the gate, bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained in the final furlong and clearly earned the show. FANTAIL (GB) bumped with a rival at the start, raced
just off the pace between foes, chased two then three wide on the turn, moved to the four path nearing the quarter-pole and came up empty. PRINCESS
PINKY tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back while moving from three to five wide around the turn and capitulated. REDZILLA broke out then hit
the gate and was last away, raced at the rear under urging, moved in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
AMANDA'S FOLLY showed early speed then settled outside under some urging, chased four then five wide around the turn, swept to the lead into upper
stretch then kicked clear under a left-handed crop, drifted out some nearing the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop, remained clear
under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. CAPTIVATING CARA was urged along off the pace, saved ground around
the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. FREDDYMO FACTOR showed speed on the
inside of a foe, took the lead with six furlongs to run, shook clear in the two path early on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, drifted
out outside the furlong marker, remained on her inside lead in the drive and weakened but was clear for the show. COLLABORATION showed good speed
and led early, lost the advantage coming to the three-quarter pole, pressed outside from that point, dropped back early on the turn, chased three then four
wide around that bend and tired. SMOKIE EYES settled under some urging, gained two to three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up
empty. LADY JASMINE was hustled from the gate, moved out then was ridden along on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, went three wide on
the turn and failed to respond.

Q F SEVENTY FIVE coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently
handled and took the inside route into upper stretch, got set down near the three-sixteenths and drew clear to the eighth pole, then got geared down in the
late stages while holding well and clear to the finish. AL'S ROCKET two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. INFLATION ADJUSTED settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tipped out four
wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. AFJAN tracked the pace
along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened. HOLD THE SALSA three wide through the first
turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped six wide into upper stretch and tired. FIGHTER IN THE WIN four wide through
the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. BREAKWATER settled just off
the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. NOT PHAR
NOW forwardly placed from the start, went three then four wide through the first turn before settling three wide in closest aim of the leader down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the
drive and faltered in the stretch.

marker, shook clear near the sixteenth-pole and drew away under strong urging. ICY REPLY was well placed just off the pace, made a bid with five furlongs
to run, took the lead at the half-mile pole, vied inside on the turn, was asked in the two path into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then
was overtaken by the winner and proved no match but was well clear for the place. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE settled just off the pace, dropped back near the
five-eighths pole, dropped from the three path to the rail under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the show
while no match for the top two. CARBON stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend, spun five
wide into the stretch then moved further out and weakened then just missed the show. MAGGIE T went to the front and showed the way, lost the lead at the
half-mile pole, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired then lost the superfecta late. VODKATINI was

Footnotes
RUNNINGWSCISSORS broke a bit awkwardly and was away last but one, moved up while shifting out some, drafted behind three foes in the two path on
the turn, shifted four wide over heels at the quarter-pole, rallied outside to get the lead coming to the furlong marker, kicked clear near the sixteenth-pole
and proved much the best while placed under a hand-ride late. GROOMS ALL BIZNESS was away well from the outside post, stalked the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths then made a bid coming to the quarter-pole, fought with two foes under a
drive into the final furlong, lost touch with the winner while still on his inside lead into the final sixteenth and proved no match while able to get the place.
DOCTOR JEFF disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and weakened but just held the show. MOMOS showed speed between foes then dropped just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then
shifted three wide, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased outside in the drive, swapped to his inside lead inside the furlong marker, went back to the
proper lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. MARVALOUS MIKE settled on the outside, was roused
three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. BIG PACKAGE broke a step slow, settled at the rear, moved closer while three then four wide on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed response. TURN OF EVENTS moved in while settling off the pace, checked
very sharply into the turn and dropped back, saved ground through that bend and failed to rally. SEVEN SCENTS brushed with a foe shortly after the start,
settled towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. FLUID SITUATION contested
the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and faded.
