Footnotes
WHATCHATALKINABOUT brushed the off side stall at the start and conceded two lengths to the front, chased three wide in hand, came under light coaxing
just past the three-eighths and advanced strongly on the top duo five-sixteenths from home, took over command and swung four wide into upper stretch,
lugged in unwilling to switch leads straightened away and was corrected before making contact with ANTONIO OF VENICE just outside the eighth pole,
knocked heads with that rival through to inside the sixteenth marker when shaking off that foe late to gamely prevail at the end. ANTONIO OF VENICE
hustled from the gate, showed the way along the inside under pressure from the get go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch shaking off his main pace
rival while being confronted by the top one, dug in gamely fighting on head to head until shaken off inside the sixteenth marker while finishing willingly for the
place honors, well clear of the rest. MISCHIEF JOKE bobbled at the break and recovered under coaxing to chase briefly along the inside, tipped out steadily
to the three path, the rider peering back before taking to four path forcing TECH DUINN to be taken in hand in behind with seven-sixteenths to go, angled
five wide into upper stretch and kept on one paced to the finish to procure the show honors. FOLLOW YOUR ARROW hustled from the start, pressed the
pace from just off the inside coaxed along from the get go, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. TECH DUINN coaxed from the
gate, got briefly taken in hand along the rail when MISCHIEF JOKE tucked in front, tipped out three then four wide under light coaxing into the turn and was
forced to steady in behind MISCHIEF JOKE once more as that rival tipped out in front seven-sixteenths from home, angled in to tuck to the rail at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SUBSCRIBED lost his rear footing and struck the near side stall at the start getting away
last and conceding three lengths to the front, tipped out to chase four to five wide into and through the midway point on the turn before tucking three wide
inside the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, tired in the stretch reaching out a bit green while under a drive by the rider through to the
finish.

Footnotes
SHIP CADET came away in good order, dropped back on the outside then moved in leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn,
rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, responded well in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging.
TWISTED FILIGREE was away alertly, dueled on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, led into upper stretch then lost the advantage to the
winner inside the three-sixteenths, fought on with good courage in the final furlong but missed while well clear for the place. HEATHCLIFF chased the
leading duo from third, dropped from three to two wide on the turn, moved out outside the furlong marker and came up empty while clearly best of the rest.
MOURNE MOUNTAINS broke out then was sent hard, dueled on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and tired. DREW D'ORO bumped solidly with a foe while breaking near the rear then was taken up with a tug of the left rein, spotted the front a few
lengths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. REAPPLY bumped solidly with a rival while breaking at the rear then was taken up, spotted the front
several lengths, went around the turn in the two path and trailed.

Footnotes
ITSAKEYPER settled at the back then was unhurried, started the turn in the two path, passed the three-eighths under patient handling, slipped to the three
path while roused inside the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into upper stretch, closed strongly into the final furlong, made a bid while drifting in shortly
thereafter then was straightened by the rider, dueled outside of the runner-up, brushed with that foe near the sixteenth-pole, continued the tussle to the
finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. JILL'S A HOT MESS was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path while in dead aim of the
leaders on the turn, angled out after turning into the stretch, rallied to get the lead into the final furlong, was challenged by the winner shortly thereafter,
battled inside of that foe then brushed near the sixteenth-pole, fought on gamely to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. STRONG ODOR
settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and finished willingly for the show. JACKIE THE JOKER leapt in the air near the
eleven-sixteenths then lost action slightly again near the five-eighths, pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased four
wide into the stretch and weakened. SPICY MARGARITA disputed the pace on the outside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked nearing the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened. MORE MANGO settled on the outside, dropped back
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CROWDING OUT disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied
along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, battled into the final furlong and tired. PROPER GRAMMAR was
fractious in the gate, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ALICE KRAMDEN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
advanced inside to take command spinning from the two path into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive to prevail. LIMANI hustled from the start,
chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to
secure the place honors. BUSTINROXY bobbled at the start, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path and advanced to take
narrow and brief command midway on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SCHERZER chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter portion of the turn
running on the heels of the leaders and being forced to take hold when a small usable seam shut down in front, angled five wide into upper stretch, then
weakened in the stretch. MRS BELL coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and passed tired foes. WINE GODDESS four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to
the finish. MAGNOLIA WIND six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. DERWIN'S PAYNTER eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. MY MALIBU HONEY hustled from the gate, showed the way in
hand narrowly seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths and went seven
wide into upper stretch in retreat, then faltered in the stretch. MY INNER VOICE seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. FORALLTHEGIRLS coaxed from the start,
chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three to four
wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
ROSEBUG was coaxed along just off the pace on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the three path on the turn, gained to take the lead in
upper stretch, drifted out while dueling with the runner-up inside the furlong marker, battled inside that foe to the finish and gamely prevailed. YOU LOOK
COLD settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the three path, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths,
dueled outside of the winner in the final furlong, fought gamely to the finish but was denied while well clear for the place. KANT HURRY LOVE was well
placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked while given a clear rail opening at the quarter-pole then came under a drive into upper stretch,
moved out at the furlong marker and earned the show while no match for the top two. BANK ON ANNA stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two
path around the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and weakened. LADY MILAGRO was away alertly and went
straight to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in
upper stretch and gave way. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was crowded slightly along the rail early, settled at the rear, raced inside early on the turn then
shifted three wide later on that bend, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HYDRA settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the
two path, was roused inside the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

to the wire. EXCEPT TEMPTATION tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in

eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. DIVINE WINE just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
