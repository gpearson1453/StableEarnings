Footnotes
FEDERAL JUDGE stalked the early leader, took over command, raced between horses along the turn, was in the two path into the lane, drew clear in the
stretch and held sway in the final stages. EXTRA ANEJO was a tad slow at the start, chased the pace, raced on the inside along the turn, fanned into the
five path entering the lane and was coming on in the late stages. DEER DISTRICT raced back early on, was in the three path along the turn, in the seven
path into the lane with a mild gain late in the stretch run. DANGEROUS RIDE tracked the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, swung into the
six path entering the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. BACKSIDE BUZZ trailed the field early on, raced on the inside through the turn and moved
up down the lane. STUD LOVIN tracked the pace early, raced three wide along the turn, in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch.
WESTERN GHENT raced in the four path along the turn, fanned into the eight path entering the lane while through after a half. OLAZABAL had early speed
then folded up.

Footnotes
QUATERNION stalked off of the inside, bid between rivals, fought on through a prolonged drive and was fully extended to prove narrowly best. QUALITY
CHIC tracked three deep, moved up to engage the leaders on the second turn, poked a narrow lead with five-sixteenths to run, battled on doggedly but
wasn't quite good enough. HARBOUR BRIDGE contended along the inside, tugged his way closer after the opening half, shifted out leaving the second turn
and continued on fairly well through the drive. JUST A PHOTO was allowed to settle, circled four wide and was making up ground. TEXAS PRIDE lagged
well back, got through and finished with a belated improvement. REAL NAUGHTY failed to respond. SIR ROCK opened clear to set the pace, was headed
midway through the second turn and gave in. SAVAGE KISS saved ground to no avail. CHLOE'S DREAM was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground,
went wrong leaving the first turn, pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
PETULANTE tracked three wide, bid turning for home, gained an advantage entering the lane while shifting out to the six path to float an outer KING
OTTOMAN wider, dug in to resist that foe's bid approaching midstretch, shifted out and bumped him leaving the furlong grounds, detached from that one
while taking a brush entering the final sixteenth, and edged clear. KING OTTOMAN tracked from midpack along the inside before shifting out to the four
path at the half mile pole, ranged up turning for home before being floated out to the eight path by the new leader entering the lane, offered a bid in upper
stretch, took a bump from that one at the furlong grounds, leaned in and brushed that foe soon after, and was turned away in the late stages. BRIGHT
FUTURE advanced to midpack two wide down the backstretch, pursued from the three path around the turn spun into the lane in the six path before shifting
to the eight path in upper stretch, and ran on well in the late stages. EL ORIENTE (CHI) was brushed by an outer foe into an inner rival soon after the start,
raced off of the pace three to two wide, altered course outside of a stopping rival at the furlong grounds, but brushed and put an outer COASTAL DEFENSE
to crowded quarters in the process, then stayed on between horses. FLAGS UP lacked speed four wide, bumped with an inner rival in midstretch, and
stayed on between horses to gain a minor share. PIPES AND DRUMS took contact from an outer rival a few strides after the start, laid off of the pace in the
four path around the turn, floated to the eight, then nine, path in upper stretch, and failed to menace outside of rivals. COASTAL DEFENSE lacked speed
along the inside while under a snug hold down the backstretch, turned for home three wide and among rivals, but was put to crowded quarters between
horses at the furlong grounds, and steadied hard in the process. EMBRACE advanced to midpack along the inside down the backstretch, but gave way
around the turn. MAJOR BLUE tracked from behind the leaders while in the two path around the turn, chased while aiming between foes in upper stretch,
but faded. SUPER DESIGN bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, tugged clear down the backstretch, encountered a pair of challenges turning for
home, got headed entering the lane, and weakened nearing midstretch. MOHAAFETH was pinched back between horses before clipping heels soon after
the start, and got outrun. BRIGADIER GENERAL bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide, bid for the lead along with an outer foe turning for
home, but got outkicked while shifting to the five path entering the lane, and weakened. THE RIDER OF KING OTTOMAN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF PETULANTE FOR INTEREFENCE IN THE STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MATAREYA stalked the pace early on two wide, raced in the two path along the turn, shifted into the three path entering the lane while taking over
command, began to clear a bit near the three sixteenths pole, inched a little further ahead inside the eighth pole and held sway in the final stages. WICKED
HALO tracked the pace early on while three wide, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and
was slowly gaining on the winner in the late stages. GOODNIGHT OLIVE tracked the pace early from the inside, stayed near the rail through the turn,
shifted into the three path entering the lane, wanted to make a bid down the lane but was boxed in by WICKED HALO throughout and never found room to
the wire. HOT AND SULTRY chased the pace early, raced in the two to three path along the turn, swung into the five path entering the lane and flattened
out late in the stretch run. MY DESTINY trailed the field early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and never a factor.
TRAVEL COLUMN set the pace early from the inside, was in the two path into the lane and gave way down the lane.

Footnotes
FLUFFY SOCKS settled in hand, tucked in to save ground, took closer order on the second turn, shifted out entering the stretch, split rivals and poked her
head in front nearing the furlong marker, shook off SPENDARELLA and kicked clear. SPENDARELLA tracked three deep, came to level terms leaving the
second turn, continued on well but was unable to go on with the winner late. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL (FR) settled off of the inside, ranged up three wide
through the second turn, came five wide and loomed a danger entering the stretch, weakened slightly during the drive and settled for the show. WAKANAKA
(IRE) was bumped at the start, lagged well back, moved up some on the second turn, worked her way to the far outside for the final furlong and finished with
a belated improvement. SHARP HERO was forwardly placed along the inside, got through but lacked the needed late response. HAUGHTY bumped with
WAKANAKA (IRE) at the start, opened clear to set the pace, was collared between horses entering the stretch and gave way readily.

Footnotes
ZOZOS set the pace along the inside, sparred with a pair of outer bidders around the turn, got headed leaving the five sixteenths pole, regained an
advantage in upper stretch, and held gamely thereafter. KUPUNA prompted the pace outside of a quartet of rivals leaving the chute, sustained vying
position three wide into the turn, led narrowly in the four path turning for home, but relinquished the advantage to his inner counterpart in upper stretch, kept
on well thereafter, but was kept at bay by that foe through the late stages. THREE TECHNIQUE lacked early speed, launched a rally in the five path around
the turn, tipped to the six path entering the lane, sustained his charge outside of foes to gain show at the furlong grounds, and chased the leading pair
home. BABY YODA laid off of the pace in the five path around the turn, improved to vie for show in upper stretch, but was outkicked for that position by an
outer rival in midstretch. KNEEDEEPINSNOW pressed two wide and between horses, had his hind quarters knocked from underneath him while exchanging
bumps with an outer rival at the eleven sixteenths pole, vied between a pair of foes around the turn, but gave way nearing the lane. MASQUEPARADE laid
far back two wide, advanced between horses entering the turn, but flattened out while lacking a rail rally through the lane. PROMISE KEEPER raced
forwardly four wide and between horses leaving the chute, but traded contact with his inner counterpart multiple times passing the eleven sixteenths pole,
took back from crowded quarters soon after, retreated to be off of the pace before taking the turn in the three path, fanned out to the seven path entering the
lane, and lacked a rally. NOBLE DRAMA lagged behind around the turn, cut the gap before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact.
GULFSTREAM WAY stalked along the inside while keen to place leaving the chute, then weakened passing the three furlong pole. CADDO RIVER raced
forwardly between rivals early on, but took contact from rivals on both sides passing the eleven sixteenths pole, lost position soon after, sustained a chase
from the four path while between horses around the turn, and weakened. SURLY FURIOUS laid off of the pace along the inside, and faded before easing
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
GENERAL JIM contended between foes, angled out six wide to launch his bid, caught FORT BRAGG nearing the furlong marker, battled on from there and
was fully extended to narrowly prevail. FORT BRAGG was bumped at the start, recovered quickly and rushed up between rivals, made a sweeping move
four wide through the turn, opened clear nearing the quarter pole, dug in to meet the challenge of GENERAL JIM nearing the eighth pole, but grudgingly
gave in following a long drive. GILMORE was allowed to settle, commenced his rally circling eight wide and was making up ground. FROSTED
DEPARTURE bobbled at bumped with FORT BRAGG at the start, moved into position along the inside, was within striking distance to the final furlong and
weakened. GUN PILOT was hustled along five wide, churned on through a long drive but failed to seriously threaten. ECHO AGAIN settled toward the
inside, closed the gap on the turn, came three wide but failed to make headway. LUGAN KNIGHT attended the pace between horses, came four wide to
make a mild bid but flattened in the drive. CURLY JACK was slow into stride and was never a factor. DAMON'S MOUND was away alertly, angled in to set
the pressured pace, was headed midway through the turn and gave in. TALL BOY broke slow and passed only the tiring ones. KANGAROO COURT
tracked off of the inside, moved up between horses to vie for the lead into the turn, but came up empty after six furlongs and dropped out. BOURBON BASH
was allowed to settle, stopped leaving the turn, eased to the wire but walked off. FREEZING POINT contended between horses leaving the chute, when
wrong inside the six furlong marker, pulled up sharply and was vanned off.

Footnotes
WEBSLINGER tracked in midpack three wide, took aim outside of the leading trio entering the lane, produced a grinding charge to offer a bid leaving the
furlong grounds along with a pair of inner rivals, dueled with a rail-rallying FAR BRIDGE through the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed. FAR BRIDGE
leaned in and brushed the gate at the start, saved ground while settled off of the pace, commenced a rail rally in upper stretch to bid approaching the final
sixteenth, sparred with an outer WEBSLINGER through the final sixteenth and missed. MAJOR DUDE stalked along the inside, tipped off of the rail in upper
stretch, bid for the lead three wide and between horses passing the furlong pole, vied entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by a foe on either side.
MO STASH set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, met bids from rivals on both sides inside the furlong grounds, got headed between
horses at the sixteenth pole, and gradually yielded. JOHANNES squarely bumped with an inner rival at the start, then steadied out of tight quarters in the
opening furlong, raced far back in the two path, trailed turning for home, yet rallied along the fence to quickly surpass outer rivals in upper stretch, flopped
back to his left lead while gaining a minor placing entering the final sixteenth, and chased the leading quartet home well through the late stages. BEHIND
ENEMY LINES (GB) hopped at the start, saved ground far back, improved around the far turn, tipped out at the three sixteenths pole, and ran on evenly
between horsres. ANDTHEWINNERIS bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path around the first turn, moved out of last in the four to
five paths around the far turn before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, stayed on while shifting ground inwardly in midstretch, and leveled off in the
final furlong without reaching contention. CARL SPACKLER (IRE) bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, stalked three wide while prominent, but
failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and tired between horses through the final furlong. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH bounced off an outer
rival at the start, shifted out and put that foe to tight quarters a sixteenth of a mild late, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and failed to factor.
ANGLOPHILE raced off of the pace three wide and between horses, and failed to factor among foes in the lane. SCOOBIE QUANDO lacked speed while
hung four wide, came under coaxing around the far turn, spun into the lane in the six path and between horses, got outkicked while being subtly put to tight
quarters at the furlong pole, checked mildly in the aftermath, and lacked a rally thereafter. OTAGO got briefly keen among foes entering the first turn,
tracked two wide and between horses around that bend, required urging to sustain position around the far turn, then gave way while shifting to the five path
in upper stretch. DESERT DUKE pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but weakened nearing the lane.

UP TO THE MARK lunged out and bumped a rival leaving the gates, settled off of the pace in the three path, inched closer in the three to four paths around
the far turn before fanning out at the quarter pole, loomed large in the seven path entering the lane, offered a good kick to drive past the leaders in upper
stretch, drew clear entering the final furlong, and was put to hand with victory secured in the final sixteenth. HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) was slow out of the
gates, settled towards the rear in the two path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied in the seven path while chasing the clearing leader's charge in
midstretch, and gained place at the sixteenth pole. SPOOKY CHANNEL bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed around both turns, spun into the lane
in the five path, shifted out to the eight path at the three sixteenths pole, offered a late rally outside of foes in the final furlong, and reached show at the wire.
OCEAN ATLANTIQUE tracked along the inside, vacated the rail around the far turn before turning for home two wide and between horses, shifted out to the
five path while hanging on his left lead and failing to quicken among foes in upper stretch, but changed leads inside the three sixteenths, kept on with a
steady grind between horses to gain show in the final sixteenth, but got nailed at the wire. SANTIN got a bit warm pre-race, bumped with an outer rival at the
start, pressed the leader from the three path around the first turn, vied in the two path around the far turn, led while shifting back to the three path entering
the lane, but offered little resistance to UP TO THE MARK's challenge leaving upper stretch, and faded. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST stalked along the inside,
vacated the rail to take aim in the four path and between horses at the three sixteenths pole, but lacked the needed rally to produce a bid. EARLS ROCK
(IRE) took a bump from an inner rival at the start, tracked from the three path, chased outside of the leading pair around the far turn, floated to the five, then
six, paths while between horses in upper stretch, gave way on his left lead soon after, changed over in midstretch, but continued to weaken. BYE BYE
MELVIN set the pace inside of a pressing foe, but was headed by that one nearing the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. PER RULING #23-0059 FROM
THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MAGE broke a step slow but avoided trouble between horses by doing so, shifted inwardly and across DISARM's heels after a furlong, settled far back in
the two to four path and between horses around the first turn, tucked back to the two path approaching the far turn, smoothly tipped five wide leaving the
three furlong pole, rallied outside of rivals turning for home before tipping to the seven path entering the lane, sustained his charge to bear down on the
leader nearing midstretch, bid at the furlong pole, edged an advantage soon after and held well. TWO PHIL'S received light contact from an inner rival at the
start, stalked behind the embattled leader two wide and from between horses, produced an early bid inside of the KINGSBARNS as that one gained a brief
lead between calls with three furlongs to go, edged clear while tipping to the two path entering the lane, but met MAGE's outer challenge nearing midstretch,
got headed by that one at the furlong grounds, fought on doggedly thereafter but was bested and saved place. ANGEL OF EMPIRE tucked in to save
ground, moved into position on the backstretch, moved with the winner on the second turn, worked his way to the outside, came seven wide, quickened
once straightened and was getting to the leaders late. DISARM broke a bit inwardly at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued two wide
around the far turn, tipped to the four, then five, path while among foes in upper stretch, bumped with an inner RAISE CAIN approaching midstretch and ran
on well to gain a minor share. HIT SHOW tracked the top flight from the two to three path around the far turn, responded to rousing to range up outside of
the leading trio entering the far turn, gradually progressed around that bend to spin into the lane in the five path while within striking range but flattened out
between horses. DERMA SOTOGAKE (JPN) broke inward, brushed the gate soundly and was away slow, settled between runners down the stretch and
into the first turn, worked his way forward in tight quarters, moved to the outside on the second turn while continuing the advance, came six wide and toiled
on through the drive. TAPIT TRICE was slow into stride under moderate urging in the opening stages, trailed in the two to three path around the first turn,
moved out of last entering the backstretch, attempted to launch a rally by shifting from the three path to the five path approaching the five sixteenths pole,
but squarely bumped MANDARIN HERO (JPN) in the process, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and failed to sustain a rally while leveling off.
RAISE CAIN settled along the inside, took closer order down the backstretch, kept on through the second turn, got through into the stretch, lacked room and
tacked outward nearing the furlong marker, was bumped and checked when the tiring KINGSBARNS drifted about, altered out further but lacked a response
thereafter. ROCKET CAN settled between rivals while not far off of the inside, mounted an early move after the opening half for position, churned on in
traffic through the second turn and into the lane within striking distance but flattened in the final furlong and faded. CONFIDENCE GAME stalked just behind
the leaders along the inside, tapped on the brakes briefly when too close to those rivals in the latter half of the first turn, pursued comfortably along the rail
down the backstretch, got subtly shuffled behind a stopping VERIFYING entering the far turn before surpassing outside of that foe soon after, tipped back to
the inside turning for home, but only managed to chase in upper stretch and faded through the final furlong. SUN THUNDER hopped at the start and was
away a step slow, was unhurried off of the inside, came under a ride into the second turn, moved up between foe, angled in entering the stretch and
improved belatedly. MANDARIN HERO (JPN) settled four wide in mid pack, was bumped hard and forced further out midway through the second turn when
TAPIT TRICE came out and came up empty thereafter. REINCARNATE broke a bit outwardly towards open space as his outer counterpart left a step slow,
prompted the top pair three wide around the first turn, sustained pressing position under coaxing entering the far turn but weakened between horses turning
for home. KINGSBARNS dueled for the lead two wide and between horses entering the first turn, sparred down the backstretch, inherited an advantage
from his inner faltering counterpart entering the far turn, but only led briefly before getting headed by an inner bidding TWO PHIL'S leaving the three furlong
pole, gave way in the three path entering the lane, lightly brushed with an inner rival before bumping with an outer foe inside the three sixteenths pole,
steadied in the aftermath and dropped back. KING RUSSELL was hung wide throughout and lacked a response. VERIFYING brushed an outer rival upon
leaving the gates, dueled for the lead inside of a pair of pressers around the first turn, clung to an advantage down the backstretch, but weakened at the
seven sixteenths pole, and wilted along the rail around the far turn. JACE'S ROAD was forwardly placed four wide, but stopped before going six furlongs.
CYCLONE MISCHIEF was unhurried while widest and was never a factor. OAKS DERBY PICK 6 WINNING NUMBERS 1-14-5-1/2/7-2/4/5-8/9/10/15/19/20.
