Footnotes
BALLYDOOLEY (GB) got bumped at the start by the breaking outwards STANDUP and in turn bumped LANDBISCUIT, chased three then four wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong knocking heads briefly
inside the final sixteenth with CASH NOW before taking command in the final jumps to the finish. CASH NOW pressed the pace from the three path
advancing to take command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat,
dueled briefly before getting displaced in the final strides to the wire. LANDBISCUIT got bumped at the start by BALLYDOOLEY due to pressure from
STANDUP, chased along the inside from the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. STANDUP broke out a step at the start bumping BALLYDOOLEY into LANDBISCUIT, chased just off the
inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MOUNT TRAVERS chased along the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. KLICKITAT four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near
the five-sixteenths, offered up a mild bid swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late going. BUSTIN SHOUT established the
front and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from CASH NOW to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and was
headed at that station, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. PROPENSITY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. RUSSIAN TO WIN tracked the pace along the inside getting taken hold of intermittently when
pulling on the bit at times, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. CHOWDA chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
SPLENDID SUMMER went to the front while in the two path, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace off the rail, controlled the action while inside
on the far turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. BORN A GAMBLER bumped with
foes on both sides at the start, was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then tipped
to the two path in upper stretch, pursued the winner under a drive to the finish and willingly earned the place. AMERICAN GRANT was caught four wide on
the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under encouragement in the three path on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, pursued the
winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. GHOSTLYPRINCE brushed with a rival at the start, went three wide around the
opening bend, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two then three path, was roused four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner
in the drive and also lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. PROVEN HOPE bumped with a rival at the start, was rated on the inside, saved
ground through the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. STRONG LIGHT bobbled in the early going, saved ground
on the first turn, settled outside towards the rear on the backstretch, was roused three wide on the final turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed to
threaten. TOGA DANCER broke out then bumped with opponents on both sides, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried near the rear,
saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. GINNSU WARRIOR broke in and bumped with a foe, was taken under a tight hold early then reserved
under stout restraint in the two path, leveled out some going around the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole and failed to rally. LABARDE raced in the
three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper
stretch between foes and came up empty. GOING IN STYLE brushed with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside
but with the benefit of the cover, was asked while three to four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VINDICTIVE vied briefly among a quartet before easing off to chase two to three wide with six furlongs to go, continued two to three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command nearing the sixteenth marker,
then edged clear to the finish kept to task. EMPTY TOMB vied briefly outside a trio before emerging to duel with NO BURN to the inside while four then
three wide, tucked to the two path nearing the turn and continued to knock heads with that rival until taking sole command three furlongs from home, swung
four wide into upper stretch and was set down straightened away, dug in under lone threat and was caught just outside the sixteenth pole, then ran on safe
for the place honors. ANEJO broke a half a beat slow and was brushed at the start by NO BURN breaking outwards, chased along the inside from the tail of
the field, tipped out three wide midway on the turn, then went four wide put to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled seven wide into upper stretch and
kept on one paced to the finish to procure the show honors. MARKET ALERT vied early on inside a trio before easing off to chase inside, came under
coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. NO BURN broke out at the start brushing ANEJO,
vied briefly with three rivals before emerging to duel with EMPTY TOMB to the outside while three then two wide, tucked inside five furlongs from home,
came under coaxing midway on the turn when in the midst of being shaken off by his main pace rival, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and
folded in the drive.

Footnotes
MYSTERIOUS STARE broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with a foe, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the
turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, reached even terms with the leader in upper stretch, battled with two foes into the final furlong, dueled gamely
inside of the runner-up in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. TAP IT UP was rated while well positioned just off the pace, stalked
three wide on the turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled outside of two foes into the final
furlong, dueled determinedly outside of the winner in the stretch and was denied while clear for the place. ADDRESSABLE MARKET (IRE) settled near the
middle of the field, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved for the show. NIGHTSABER (GB)
broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, fought inside of the top two into the final furlong,
dropped back coming to the sixteenth-pole and weakened. GEOMETRIQUE moved in while reserved off the pace, was roused while two then three wide on
the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. NAA DUDETTE bumped hard with a rival at the start then dropped back while
taken up some, settled off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
EXOTIC CAT was hustled from the gate then well placed towards the front, saved ground while asked on the turn and also lacked the needed response.
BOUNTY KILLAH stalked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. AUNT BERRA
broke well while brushed in the hindquarters, settled near the middle of the field, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. TOOSHAY
settled on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn and faltered. MY GIRL JAL bumped hard with a rival at the start then dropped back, went around
the turn in the two path and was no factor. EXTESSA was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, checked sharply near the seven-eighths, drifted out
significantly shortly thereafter then reached the far outside, went three wide on the turn and showed little.

down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. MR. BUSTA four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide
into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. BAD LARRY broke in at the start bumping THIRTY

Footnotes
MASTEROF THE TUNES stalked the pace on the outside, inched closer in the three path on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, chased the
runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and got up under strong urging. STOLEN FUTURE went to the front, showed the way
with company to her outside, vied inside on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied near
the finish while able to get the place. I'MHAVINGAMOMENT broke a step slow, moved up under urging then was well placed just off the pace, saved ground
on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the top two to the finish and willingly earned the show. SIKUM was bumped very hard on both sides
at the start then checked sharply, moved in towards the rear late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while
under the crop, altered out over heels near the three-sixteenths and improved position. U SHOULD B DANCING stumbled at the start, settled on the inside,
moved off the rail midway through the turn, shifted four wide late on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased in a reasonable striking position
into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. CAMP AKEELA was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two
path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. BERN ROSEY BERN came inward at the start then bumped solidly with a foe before being
pulled off that opponent by the rider, moved up while pulling under restraint, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and
came up empty. MAJESTIC RETURN was bumped hard on both sides at the start then taken in hand, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FREDDYMO FACTOR broke out then slammed hard into an opponent and checked, raced off the
pace, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. QUEENS MASTERPIECE tugged at the bit under tight restraint, was let
out three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. LONGLIVE THE QUEEN stumbled badly after the start and was sandwiched hard by two foes then
checked very sharply, lagged well behind, rounded the turn in the two path and lost all chance. MONROE was urged along off the pace, dropped back with
a half-mile to run, went around the turn in the two path and retreated.

BATTLE SCARS coaxed from the gate, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths and angled out to swing
eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish closing with a rush the widest of all and was up in the final jumps to score. GEM MINT TEN tracked
the pace along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing
the sixteenth marker, dug in under a drive and was caught in the final strides. SELL SOMETHING coaxed from the gate, chased three wide from mid pack,
tipped out four then five wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors.
EXCURSIONNISTE tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and closed well to the finish. MR. KRINGLE prompted the pace three wide outside a pair, before
advancing to take command with seven-sixteenths to go tucking to the two path three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared near the sixteenth pole, then got outfinished in the late stages. GENERAL
BANKER coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked through the final furlong. LORD FLINTSHIRE two to three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. BRICCO three to
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. KING OF COMEDY prompted the
pace from the two path between foes, tucked inside at the three-eighths put to coaxing when the former leader BASIS RISK backed away, took the inside
route into upper stretch and weakened. DR. KRAFT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch,
made no impact. BASIS RISK hustled from the gate, cut the pace along the inside under pressure from a pair, yielded the front near the seven-sixteenths
and began to back away midway on the turn, faded and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. MARINARA SAUCED four then
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, was off the heels of DR. KRAFT at the five-sixteenths and bobbled, swung four wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CARAMEL SWIRL settled off the pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, drafted behind foes while three then four wide on the turn, was roused five
wide into the stretch, accelerated quickly while rallying on the outside, closed fast to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then glided clear while eased up.
DR B tracked the pace on the inside of a foe, lost position badly in the two path on the turn then dropped to the rear inside the three-eighths, shifted three
then four wide from behind foes while asked late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and reached her best stride too late while finishing with good
courage for the place. ROSSA VELOCE was hustled to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook
clear outside the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best into upper stretch, led under a drive until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear
for the show. MOSIENKO broke out then brushed with a foe, settled off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, chased four wide early on the turn,
made a bid at the three-eighths, dropped to the three path under urging near the quarter-pole, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. MIDNIGHT STROLL bumped lightly with a foe at the start and was last to commence, settled on the outside, gained late on the backstretch,
chased five wide on the turn, dropped to the four path nearing the quarter-pole, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. FUNNY
HOW was restless in the gate, settled just off the pace on the inside, was roused near the three-eighths, saved ground into the stretch and came up empty.
EASY TO BLESS bumped lightly with a rival at the start, moved up then prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn,
dropped back with three furlongs to run and capitulated.

Footnotes
CYNWYD established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. THE COMPAS MAN (IRE) three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and ran on to chase the winner home just preserving the place honors on the wire over a closing rival. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES broke in
at the start bumping SWAY'SINMYDNA, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick. SWAY'SINMYDNA bobbled at the break and was bumped by the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home advancing, then made no late headway through the final furlong. OXFORD UNION two to three wide in
pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
NIEUWENDYK away to an awkward start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
offered no response. BEAR'S CORRECT chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch,
tired. EDDIEMUSH shied in at the start in reaction to WEALLLIKEDHIM breaking inwards and was away last, strode green and sluggish four to five paths off
the inside down the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked three wide through the turn, went four wide at the head of the stretch and
made no impact. FATHER OF LIES chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, briefly tucked to the two path with five-sixteenths to go
before angling five wide into upper stretch and tired. CARPE CAPELLA chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. WEALLLIKEDHIM broke in at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to
