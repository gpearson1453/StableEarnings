Footnotes
DIAMONDS ENJOY pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch, inherited lead nearing the three furlong marker, set the balance of the pace,
widened into the stretch and prevailed under strong handling. PLATINUM MAC had good early speed along the inside. struck the fallen rider nearing the
three furlong marker, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late. STRIKE A BEAT allowed to
settle, jumped the fallen rider nearing the three furlong marker then had a mild late rally in the four path. NOBLE BEHAVIOR bumped at the start, advanced
in the five path midway on the turn then was outfinished. YONDERING passed tiring rivals. REINSURE bumped at the start and lacked the needed
response. YO BERBS inched closed in the three path on the turn then came up empty. SPECTACULAR ROAD made the lead soon after the start, set the
pace in the two path, stumbled entering the turn and unseated his rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
