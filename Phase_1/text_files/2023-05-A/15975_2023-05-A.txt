Footnotes
SASSY MARTINI was well rated between rivals, waited behind rivals by the quarter poll, dived to the rail nearing the furlong marker and closed up the inside
to edge away to prove best under a drive. AMEN SYLVIA stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, continued that bid off the turn but
was outfinished by the winner, second best. RUN LAURA RUN set a pressured pace on the inside and then dueled for command by the quarter pole and
faded late, held show award. MIZZEN pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but faded in the drive. TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER was
allowed to settle early, made a five wide bid off the turn but flattened out late. BILLIEANNE chased the early pace four to three wide and then was in traffic
leaving the turn and lacked the needed bid. JACK'S LILLY chased the early pace and made a inside bid on the turn and weakened.

ANTE UP ALEX set the early pace while clear and getting over to the two path, drew out on the backstretch, then was kept to pressure to the wire to remain
clear to prove best. MR BOLDACIOUS was reserved early, three wide move on the turn and finished well to be clearly second best. INNUENDO chased the
pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and was empty, bested rest. PEAKY BLINKERS was bumped into the first turn,
chased the pace in between rivals and weakened. BODE LYNX was four wide and bumped into the first turn, chased the pace three to four wide and tired.
BOSSY CAT was off slowly, failed to menace. D BLACK MAMBA was bumped at the start and then was not a factor. HE CAME TRUE was settled on the
inside, checked leaving the three eighths and tired.

SANTAFE EXPRESS set a pressured pace on the inside, was well rated on the turn while maintaining a short lead, then let out and made a bid leaving the
turn and quickly spurted clear, then remained clear to prove best, driving. LONDON LADY stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and
continued on willingly to be clearly second best. KAZ LUCKY NUMBERS pressed the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and weakened.
MISS MIA LIA was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. WIN FOR LAILA failed to menace. TRECHMO GIRL was off slow,
raced on the inside and weakened. THATSJUSTLOVELY broke outwardly, tracked the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SHY DA RUNNER set the pace on the inside, then was pressured on the turn and dug in gamely in the drive and held on to prove best under a drive.
POLSAR stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but hung in the lane, second best. SNIP THE ROSES stalked the pace on the inside and
weakened, held show award. LETSGETLUCKYTONITE was slow into stride, then made a wide move on the turn and came five wide into the lane, then
improved late while racing green. THE LAST JUMPSTART was bumped at the start, chased the pace five wide and was wide on the turn and weakened.
FUZZY NAVEL swerved out at the nine sixteenths bumping a rival, then tracked the paced four wide on the turn, came five widee into the lane and then
ducked out sharply at the sixteenth marker and weakened, green. ABBY'S SPIRIT failed to menace. MONEY MAKING KAZ was reluctant to load, then was
not a factor. SENSE OF IRELAND chased the early pace from between rivals, then was bumped and checked hard leaving the nine sixteenths and stopped.
