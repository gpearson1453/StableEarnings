Footnotes
HOPING FOR A RING settled off the pace and the inside, continued three wide into the far turn, advanced, challenged on the outside turning for home,
drove well clear. EMITYAAZ chased the early leader off the inside, engaged that one second turn, vied between foes turning for home, could not match the
winner through the lane, proved determined for the place. PUT A BOW ON IT broke in good order, cleared toward the inside, set in the two path, continued
to hold a narrow advantage through the final bend, also proved no match for the winner, gradually weakened to lose the place. MUMBLEBEE fell back along
the inside, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. WEST SIDE GIRL last away, trailed while moving outside, made little impact while four
wide through the final turn. CLOSE TO ME lacked speed, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
PETULA behind the pace inside, continued to track while saving ground through the turn, split foes inside the furlong maker, bid, edged clear. ROWDY
DAISY closest to the leader off the inside, challenged outside that one late in the bend, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, could not contain the
winner, saved the place. ZONGS IRISH FROST restless in the gate, off slowly, moved up through some traffic, steadied five furlongs out, traffic into the
turn, four wide into the lane, not enough for the place. BLUE COWGIRL off a step slow, moved up steadily up the backstretch and through the turn, lodged a
brief bid three wide turning for home, hung in the drive. THE X FACTOR off a step slow, checked up when moving up in traffic with five furlongs to run, three
wide into turn, two wide exiting, improved slightly. HOT SUMMER DREAM in mid pack while racing outside, floated out five wide into the lane, passed a
couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. LOVELY JOYCE settled off the pace in the three path, came four wide for the drive, failed to rally. LUNCH LADY
broke sharp, quickly sprinted clear while angling sharply to the inside, briefly vied inside the winner into the stretch, faltered when headed. SWEET BABY
KATE fell back to trail after the start, was never a threat. DEVON'S GIRL showed little in finished far back.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BAND with the pace from the start, held a narrow advantage late in the turn while between foes into the lane, kicked clear under steady
handling. FOREVER HOME lacked early foot, angled out three wide turning for home, could do little with the winner late, held sway for the place.
LANTERN'S CANDY lacked early foot, carried four wide by the runner up exiting the turn, outkicked by that rival for the place. TAP ME A TEXT last away,
lacked speed, came in the two path for the drive, finished willingly to improve position. HAVE I EVER void of speed, continued to trail through the turn, also
improved position with some belated interest. WHISKEY BLUE broke with the field, four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane, continued one paced
through the lane in lacking a closing response. ESSENTIAL BELLA with the pace three wide and between foes, retreated down the lane. QUEENIES WAY
with the pace along the inside, continued to contest through the turn, gave way. HAIL COLUMBIA flashed brief speed while four wide, faltered in the turn.

Footnotes
MYSTIC PLEASURE forwardly placed while racing outside, three out to four wide turning for home, drew well clear under steady pressure. CHANISA
prompted the pace off the inside, two to three wide turn, proved no match for the winner, held the place. VOW lacked speed, three wide into and through the
turn, mild rally, finished up clear of the rest. SUPER CINDY bumped, bothered at the break, trailed well back, angled four wide exiting the turn, improved
position with some belated interest. TYRONA off the pace pace toward the inside, two path and in some traffic early in the turn, steered out four wide
entering the stretch, went evenly when clear for the drive. GREEK HEIRESS in the second flight well out in the strip, five wide into the lane, failed to muster
a rally. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE bothered and was bumped at the break, mid pack early, faded. MARY'S BOON moved up to take control after the start,
showed the way for a half, gave way when headed by the winner into the stretch.

Footnotes
RIVERCREST GIRL lacked early foot off the inside, three wide onto the backstretch, worked way to the five path into the far turn, swept up with a strong
move to challenge midway on the final bend, quickly clear, drew out. HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL settled off the pace just off the inside in the first turn, in some
traffic second turn, got through rail, proved no match for the winner in the stretch, clear for the second spot. BETTY JO in the second flight while off the rail,
continued in the two path second bend, lacked a serious kick through the lane, all out for the show. HAMAZING DEBATE in mid pack while racing outside,
four wide into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. FORTIBUG off a step slow, lacked speed inside, continued to save ground, improved position without
posing a serious threat. JERI DAWN off a step slow, trailed, two path into the lane, passed tiring rivals. SHE BE SHEEHAN lacked speed while inside first
turn, shuffled back in some traffic into the far turn, sharply altered course to the outside late in the turn, made little impact through the stretch. DANCIN N
THEPULPIT vied up front off the rail, held a small advantage into the far turn, began to give way late in that bend three to four wide after being headed by
the winner. WILD ROSEY forwardly placed into the first turn three wide, vied into the far turn, also gave way in the drive. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE set or forced
the pace along the inside for five furlongs, began to give way while getting out with a quarter mile remaining, caved in down the stretch to trail home.

Footnotes
MRS. BEANS prompted the pace while in the three path, moved to engage late in the turn, set down, long drive, dug in late to prevail in determined fashion.
WOBBERJOD forwardly placed racing just off the inside, two path into lane, dropped to the rail when straightened for home, challenged inside the winner
with less than a furlong remained, outkicked to the wire. ONE FOR RICHIE broke out, settled off the pace outside, continued four wide through the turn,
lacked a closing response. HIGH CRUISE broke alertly, set the pace toward but not on the inside, faltered from between horses the final furlong.
ALEXANDROS back off the pace out in the strip, moved closer five wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. HOLDING PATTERN last to leave, trailed
much of the way, never a threat. FREUDIAN FATE lacked speed outside, five wide exiting the turn, pulled up soon after in apparent distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
BLACK POWDER broke alertly, raced with the pace off the inside, rated under kind handling up the backstretch, continued to vie while between horses
second turn, showed the way into the lane, second duel upper stretch, edged clear, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN in the
second flight while racing in the turn path, continued within striking distance second turn, shifted out slightly when roused for the drive, late surge to be up at
the wire for the place while closing the gap on the winner. HEROIC MOVE raced back off the pace while five wide into the first turn, four wide onto the
backstretch, continued outside, four wide bid turning for home, dueled outside the winner through upper stretch, could not match that one late, nailed for the
place at the wire. EL TOMATE in mid pack while racing toward the inside, in some traffic late backstretch, angled out four wide for the drive, lacked a
serious closing kick to finish up evenly. SILVER HEIST broke back, trailed, saved ground through the second turn, improved position inside of several rivals
into the stretch, flattened out a bit through the stretch. RECKER POINT in mid pack while four wide through the first turn, three wide through the second
bend, failed to muster a bid. LINE TO GAIN void of speed while three wide first turn, moved inside for the run through the second bend, improved by
passing mostly tiring rivals. G T FIVE HUNDRED pressured the pace while racing three wide, gave way turning into the stretch. MISTER MULDOON broke
out, bumped and tightened up JEWELSTOWN, was straightened to set the pace firmly in hand, stopped late in the final bend, continued to back up. SIR
LIAM broke in to brush JEWELSTOWN, raced in mid pack, traffic first turn under steadying restraint, faded after six furlongs. JEWELSTOWN forced back
start, remained always back.

Footnotes
KABOOM BABY settled behind the pace inside, continued to save ground when unhurried the first five furlongs, steered out to be three wide when
advancing into the stretch, outside bid, wore down leaders. SUMMER SHOES prompted the pace while racing outside, advanced and took over turning into
the stretch, briefly clear then gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. TOO PRETTY away in good order, set the pace toward the inside,
briefly offered resistance when the runner up challenged turning for home then could not keep up or contain the winner. KANTEX within striking distance off
the inside, continued one paced in the two path second turn, lacked a closing punch. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke on top, raced forwardly and inside
for six furlongs then had had little left for the drive. RUN FEARLESS steadied early in some traffic, mid pack in the two path, lacked a closing response.
SHE'S STORMING bothered into the first turn, dropped inside second turn, saved ground into the stretch, made little impact to the wire. CONNIE K broke
back, a bit rank into the first turn when moving up to mid pack first turn, four wide first turn, also was found lacking through the stretch. PROUD VICTORIA in
mid pack while racing outside, failed to menace. ARDEN AR was not a threat while racing toward the inside. SULWE off slowly, raced well back, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. PATTERN BET tired while racing three wide. COURTNEY FAY was never a threat while racing in the two path.
SUMMORYA fractious prior to the start, off slowly, always outrun.

Footnotes
DON'T FORGET within striking distance while three wide, moved on the leader far turn, dueled into the stretch, put that rival away and kicked well clear.
WARTIME HERO in the second flight while just off the inside, continued in the two path final turn, up late for the place, not a threat to the winner. HOME
RUN TRICK broke alertly alternated up front off the inside, briefly clear in the far turn, second duel with the winner came alongside after six furlongs, equal
terms with that one into the lane, could not keep up the final furlong, caught late for the place. FORT PECK settled off the pace and the inside, three wide
through the final turn, lacked a closing kick. FLATOUT WINNER off a step slow, raced back off the pace, improved the middle half mile then went flat
through the lane. CHAPEL BARN fell back to trail after a half, steered out three wide into the lane, passed a few tiring rivals while not a serious threat.
COAL TRUTH remained back in lacking a rally. TAPPIN FORA DANCE in mid pack along the inside, pulled up the backstretch, traffic with a half mile to run,
came up empty for the drive. JUNE GLOOM dueled early closest to the inside, began to tire after a half.
