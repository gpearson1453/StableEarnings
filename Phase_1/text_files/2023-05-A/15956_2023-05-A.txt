Footnotes
IRISH WARLOCK settled in the three and four paths on the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms two deep
midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to inch clear nearing the wire. COLONEL CAPPY took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came
under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at even terms at the rail midway on the far turn and remained close through the upper stretch,
but relented later yards. MR MAJESTIC settled off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and was steadily handled to
just last in third. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail, eased out leaving the turn, finished evenly and just missed third. BEFRIENDTHEENEMY raced in the two and three paths on the opening turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. DANNY'S WINKSTER stalked inside through the
front stretch and raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. ARTHUR S GOLD ducked
out leaving the gate, bucked through the opening furlong and was distanced throughout. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the
rider of Irish Warlock for alleged interference in the stretch, lodged by the rider of Colonel Cappy.

Footnotes
MYGIDGETMARIE took over at the rail into the first turn and was firmly rated to show the way, kept the edge over DIAL HER past the three eighths pole
and came under pressure leaving the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. The latter stalked two deep, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY rounded the opening turn
in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn and was along for third late yards. EXTRA CRUNCHY had a brief
early lead while tapering inward then stalked into the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, drifted
leaving the turn and flattened in the stretch. MIDNIGHT REGRET was bumped then jostled leaving the gate and saved ground on the first turn, picked up
the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. LIKELY CHOICE exchanged contact with Midnight
Regret leaving the gate then saved ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened in the stretch. BIZZY
GAL broke awkwardly and made contact with Midnight Regret, raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SWEET
SPIN was not a factor.

Footnotes
SLOE GIN BIZ settled in the three path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide
approaching the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. TRIPLE TITOS was shuffled back at the start and saved
ground on the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then dueled
through the stretch for second. CHERRYS CROSS rated close two deep into the first turn then took the nod past the nine sixteenths pole, came under
pressure toward the seven sixteenths, was met approaching the quarter, dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and relented in the stretch duel for
second. BUBBA G ducked out and made contact with SCOOTSCOOT leaving the gate then set the early pace inside, was met past the nine sixteenths pole
and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened leaving the turn. The latter was bumped then pinched
back leaving the gate, rated close inside on the first turn, raced hemmed in toward the half mile pole, recovered stride approaching the seven sixteenths,
rounded the far turn in the three and four paths but weakened leaving the turn. ANGELUS DIAMOND was bumped off stride at the start, settled off the rail
on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. VIVE BIEN rounded the opening turn about
the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn but left the turn outside. ROCKY DICE came outward leaving the
gate and raced well back. BET ON BITZ hopped from the gate and raced well back in the four path on the opening turn.
