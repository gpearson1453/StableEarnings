Footnotes
HEIR TO THE ROAR stalked in the four path, ranged up under a nudge around the turn, received right handed cues while making bid from the five path into
the stretch, and inched past an inner rival in the final sixteenth to win. DEMURELY prompted the pace in the three path, bid around the turn and took a
narrow lead at the top of the lane, stayed on to hold the lead into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe passing the sixteenth pole to place.
LEXINATOR tracked in the three path, tipped inside and was nudged along around the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on for show.
DANNYHILL was hustled along to lead in the two path, ridden along the rail rounding the turn, but lost the lead entering the lane, and faded. WINNING AT
EASE trailed in the three path, tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, but did not threaten. ARROW SHAPE hopped at the start, chased in the five
path, was under right handed urging while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, but failed to menace.

Footnotes
STARSHIP WIZARD stalked in the three path, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn and took aim while tipping out to the four path into
the stretch, swept to the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. TAPATERM hit the side of the gate and brushed with an outer foe at the start, settled
in range inside of rivals, moved up along the rail around the far turn, was ridden from the two path into the stretch, and chased on for place. SOLAR TAP set
the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the stretch, but was overtaken by the winner passing the eighth pole, and evened out to show.
BLUTO'S CANDY tracked in the four path, was briefly stymied around the five-sixteenths point, shifted out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished
evenly. SEBARAY brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced up close along the leader in the four path, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but
flattened. PLUMA ROJA rated in the three path, was under right handed urging around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path into the lane, but was no
factor. BACH chased in the five path, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but was tired. JUST PRAISE was wellback in the four path and never
threatened. SANDY DUDE trailed in the two path down the backstretch and never menaced. SHIPWRECK prompted the pace in the five path but faded
turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
REBELDE settled off the pace while racing four and five wide, continued on the left lead to deep stretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides.
HERE COMES BULLET raced closest to the pacesetter in the three path, took over near the three-eighths pole, stayed on well and was caught in the final
strides. ROYAL KITTEN set a clear pace in the two path, yielded near the three-eighths pole, fought on inside through midstretch and held well enough to
preserve the show. THENORTHREMEMBERS tracked the pace four wide and lacked the needed stretch kick. SMALL REASON was bumped between foes
at the start, chased the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. LONG BEACH KID was bumped between foes at the start and always
well back inside. TEXTPECTATION was bumped at the start, mostly saved ground and made little impact. GHOSTINYOU was bumped and squeezed back
at the start, raced three wide and was never involved. ATTENTIVE was bumped at the start, raced five wide in midpack and had no response.

Footnotes
SHE'S OUTTA HERE stalked in the two path, was short of room along the rail passing the three-eighths pole, tipped out and bid from the four path into the
stretch, took the lead while gradually drifting out into the final furlong, and held on. GINGER SPARKLE chased in the five path, floated out to the nine path
into the stretch, and drifted out while running on for place. TESTED POSITIVE rated inside, tipped out to the four path under coaxing into the lane, and was
up for show. JUNO SEA set the pace in the four path, shifted to the rail and was challenged around the turn, and yielded form the two path down the lane.
BELLA ROMANCE raced prominently in the five path, headed the leader in the two path around the turn, but gaveway into the stretch.

bid. KISS saved ground in range, bobbled near the three-eighths pole and faded through the lane. BUCCHERA had speed inside and tired in the drive. SHE
HAS CLASS played no factor while racing five wide. SCOOTALOO failed to menace while racing four wide. FUMBLEROOSKI was off a step slow and was
outrun inside. GIRVIN STAR bore out entering the turn and retreated along the outside rail.

Footnotes
NEOGEM was unhurried along the inside around the first turn, tipped out to the four path down the backside, was ridden around the far turn and fanned out
to the eight path into the lane, rallied outside of foes, and was up in the closing stages. FACTOR THAT set the pace under a hold inside, allowed an outer
foe to take over the lead into the far turn, angled off the rail under coaxing and stayed on to re-bid from the four path into the final furlong, briefly led passing
the sixteenth, but was quickly overtaken by an outer foe to place. EXCLUSIVE JONI rated in the three path, was roused between foes into the far turn,
swung out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on for show. LENDHERCREDIT settled up close in the four path, took command and was under a
nudge from the two path early around the far turn, opened slightly from inside into the stretch, but yielded late. STARSHIP DYNASTY raced in range from
the five path, was cued from the three path into the far turn, was in the two path entering the stretch, but was one paced. NEWTON'S STAR (IRE) steadied
along the rail around the first turn, tracked inside, moved up down the backstretch, was driven along while swinging out to the five path into the lane, but
faded. NO WASABI FOR ME raced off the pace in the six path but was no factor. LUCKY IN LOVE raced in midpack around the five path, was under right
handed urging while angling out to the nine path into the stretch, but flattened. MOONSHINING stalked in the three path but never threatened. KAZILLION
raced wellback in the two path early and never menaced. DOMO ARIGATOU always trailed around the four to six paths.
