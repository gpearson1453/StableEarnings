Footnotes
ALLEGE bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, became the clear leader's only pursuer around the far turn, took aim inside of that
one in upper stretch, tipped outside of him as that foe shifted inwardly at the sixteenth pole, sustained a bid to range up late, and gained an advantage late.
KISSALOT showed the way off of the inside with a loose margin while well in hand around both turns, held sway from a rail chaser through upper stretch,
gradually shifted inwardly to deter a rail bid coming to the final sixteenth, but allowed an easy tip out for that counterpart in the process, and was worn down
in the closing stages. LOCALLY OWNED took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, trailed around the first turn, improved position into and around
the far turn to gain show nearing the lane, and was best of the rest. SILVER DUST tracked three wide, but tired around the far turn. CURRENT bumped an
outer rival leaving the gates, prompted the pace inside of the leader early on while rank to place, backed off approaching the wire for the first time, chased
the leader two wide and between horses around the first turn, but was done with five furlongs to go.

Footnotes
VITEMENT dueled for the lead inside of SONOFASHIP around the turn, inched free of him in the two path in upper stretch, and held firm from his outer
re-bidding counterpart through the final furlong. SONOFASHIP sparred for the lead outside of the eventual winner around the turn, briefly failed to keep
pace with that one while entering the lane in the three path, yet chased that foe well thereafter while attempting a re-bid, but was kept at bay.
BEAUDACIOUS COLTON stalked while forwardly placed two wide and between horses, vied for show with an outer rival while exchanging bumps in hopes
of shifting outside of the top pair, and prevailed for that position in the final sixteenth. LET'S GO MARK nudged the get upon leaving it, recovered to chase
outside of rivals into the turn, moved forward to press the embattled leading pair at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with them while spinning
into the lane in the four path, exchanged bumps with an inner rival while dueling for show through the lane, but yielded that position late. PRINCE OF
POWER took a bump from an outer rival at the start, failed to sustain position inside of rivals approaching the turn, raced off of the pace in the two path
around the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, tipped to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. SUGA STEVE stalked along the inside,
but only managed to chase in upper stretch before giving way. LOUDERMILK broke a step slow, tracked four wide, floated to the five path entering the lane,
and weakened. FAVORITISM broke slowly before mildly shying from an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path around the turn, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. MI OSCURO SECRETO bumped an inner rival at the start, failed to keep pace with the field while
subtly shuffled behind a rival approaching the turn, then trailed around the bend and got outrun.

HERD IMMUNITY set the pace in the two path, shook clear of an outer rival while spinning into the lane in the three path, and inched away. MY
REDEMPTION got antsy in the gates just before the off, stalked in the three path, pressed the leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that one
while entering the lane in the four path, dueled with an inner bidder for place through the final furlong, and held that position. BAJAN RUM took back from
crowded quarters when squeezed between horses nearing the end of the chute, improved position three wide and between horses at the half mile pole,
pursued from midpack along the inside around the turn, sustained a rail chase to bid for place in midstretch, sparred for that position thereafter, but was
denied. PEEKACHO was jostled between horses upon leaving the gates, tracked from the three to four paths around the turn, but floated to the five path
entering the lane, and gave way. CO CONSPIRATOR bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but lost position while attempting to slip
inside of a pulling-up rival leaving the nine sixteenths pole, scraped the rail in the process, then saved ground around the bend, but to no avail.
BLUEBERRY never got involved two wide. GO FOR SHERRIE bumped an outer rival at the start, was void of speed in the four path, weakened around the
turn, was eased in upper stretch, jogged home while distanced through the final furlong, and walked off. THAT KHENNY prompted the pace along the
inside, but went wrong nearing the five furlong pole, was pulled up around the turn, dismounted and untacked in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, and
got vanned off.

Footnotes
GLORIA'S PRINCESS set the pace along the inside, kicked away in upper stretch, and drew off with good energy while flopping back to her left lead
entering the final sixteenth. WARDEYA bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, moved to the two path approaching the backstretch,
inched closer three wide and between horses around the far turn, gained place in upper stretch as the leader drew away, and held that position well
thereafter. BEST PERFORMER laid off of the pace three wide, tracked four wide and between horses around the far turn, gained show nearing midstretch,
and chased place home. BLESSING THE FLAG settled off of the pace two wide, pursued from behind the main group in the three path around the far turn,
moved forward between horses entering the lane, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, and ran on while one-paced. HOLY FOLEY lacked speed
along the inside, checked under a firm hold around the first turn, improved position two wide around the far turn before shifting out to the five path in upper
stretch, but failed to menace thereafter. HECKLED pressed the eventual winner from the outside, but gave way entering the lane, and weakened.
EMPATHY trailed, got caught four wide around the far turn, then moved up between horses. WHAT'S TO DO lacked speed three wide, improved four wide
entering the backstretch, chased from the five path around the far turn, but faded through the lane. AUNT NELDA was bumped by rivals on both sides while
put to crowded quarters at the start, settled far back along the inside, took the far turn in the three to four paths, and made little impact.
PAT'SCHROMECOMPASS bumped a outer rival leaving the gates, stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home. LE LEVRE (IRE) saved ground off
of the pace, but to no avail. SUPER COOL STORM pursued from midpack two wide, lost position to outer rivals at the half mile pole, and weakened
between horses around the far turn.

TOWING set the pace along the inside, drew away from an outer rival entering the lane, and lasted safely thereafter. LEMON DROP SHOT trailed in the
four to five paths, rallied to reach place approaching midstretch, and was slowly closing in on the tiring leader late. ROAN FOR THE ROSE lacked speed in
the two to three paths into the turn, improved four wide nearing the lane, shifted inwardly and put an inner rival to crowded quarters entering it, then
sustained a rail chase to edge show from an outer foe late. GOT THE BOB advanced from off of the pace four wide into the turn, gained show turning for
home, chased while getting outkicked and re-reaching that position in midstretch, but lost show to an inner rival late. MULTI PLATINUM pressed the leader
from the three path, but failed to keep pace while drifting to the five path entering the lane, and weakened. MASTER LEA broke through the gate pre-race,
then never got involved three to two wide. SWISS GUARD chased in the three path, but weakened around the turn, and steadied in tight quarters entering
the lane. LOOT THE MOON laid off of the pace two wide, tucked to the inside entering the turn, but sustained an injury in upper stretch, was pulled up in
midstretch, and got vanned off.

and between horses while headed by her outer counterpart around the turn, bumped her inner counterpart while in tight entering the lane, got outkicked by
an outer bidder in upper stretch, yet took up the chase well, vied for place along the inside through the final furlong, and gained that position late. ELLE OF
THE BALL stuttered a step at the start, vied three wide, forged a short advantage around the turn, led through upper stretch, but was headed by an outer
bidder at the furlong pole, sparred for place with an inner rival through the late stages, but was bested. CHARLEY RUDE tracked along the inside, but was
shuffled back while searching for racing room turning for home, tipped to the four path for clear sailing in upper stretch, and chased evenly. MS HAYLEY
saved ground far back, improved entering the lane, but failed to sustain a bid in the three path and between horses in the final furlong. MAGNA MASSA
broke out and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer pair around the turn while slightly headed, bumped with her most
immediate counterpart entering the lane, and gave way. KILMOREY broke slowly, trailed in the five to six paths, drifted inwardly in upper stretch, and moved
up. BIG JAVA laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path turning for home, and made little impact. AZUL TEQUILA took a bump from an
inner rival at the start, chased five wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane. TWIRLING PATTI broke a touch outwardly, pressed four wide, but
weakened between horses entering the lane, and faded while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
GREYS THE BOY laid off of the pace, gained five wide and outside of foes around the turn, took aim on the leaders from the seven path in upper stretch,
edged past them at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. BAD TO THE BONES tracked along the inside, loomed while appearing to have run behind the
leaders in the two to three paths turning for home, got outmoved by an outer rival while blocked in the four path entering the lane, tipped down to the three
path for clear sailing, but only offered a mild kick, vied for place with an outer foe after the eventual winner kicked away, and dead-heated for that position.
ANGKOR chased four wide under constant urging into and around the turn, offered a bid in the five path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer
bidder at the furlong grounds, dueled with an inner rival for place through the closing stages, and dead-heated with that one on the wire. PATIENT CAPITAL
pressed three wide, vied around the turn, led entering the lane, but was outkicked by a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, and yielded between rivals.
SPARTAN ARMY laid off of the pace in the three path, tucked to the rail entering the lane, but failed to slip through a very narrow seam inside of a rival in
upper stretch, got through leaving the three sixteenths pole, but failed to menace thereafter. TIM TAL vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but
weakened entering the lane, and faded on his left lead. ZIPPIN GIGI set the pace inside of a pressing pair, vied with them around the turn, but caved
between horses at the three sixteenths pole. AMERICAN ICON bobbled at the start, trailed in the five to six paths, drifted inwardly while hanging on his left
lead in the stretch, and failed to factor. THE FIRST FOUR MARGINS AT THE FINISH WERE COLLECTED BY HAND.

WARRANT pressed two wide, vied around the final bend, led entering the lane, drove clear at the three sixteenths pole, flopped back to his left lead while
meeting an outer challenge approaching the wire, and narrowly held. RED RUN tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair entering the lane,
steadily closed in on the clear leader through the final furlong, produced a bid in the closing stages, but just missed. NEXT set the pace inside of the
eventual winner, vied with that bidder around the far turn, but was headed entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. DECISION MAKER trailed
along the inside, and moved up without factoring. CALIBRATE lacked speed while kept wide, and never got involved. LONE ROCK bobbled a bit leaving the
gates, stalked behind the top pair around the first turn, shifted outside of them around the second turn, but chased around the final bend, and weakened in
the five path entering the lane.

Footnotes
DANSE MACABRE tracked two wide and between horses early on, achieved and inside position entering the turn, edged up an open rail to slip inside of the
leaders nearing the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway. AMERICAN APPLE tracked three wide, swung to the six path in upper stretch, rallied
to bid for place at the furlong grounds, gained that position entering the final sixteenth, and lasted from an outer bidder late. ANNA'S ARABESQUE bumped
the gate while off slow, raced far back two wide into the turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane, shifted out to the seven path leaving the three
sixteenths pole, offered a late kick outside of rivals in the final furlong, but missed reaching place. MY SWEET AFFAIR chased four wide, spun into the lane
in the five path, bid for place along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the final sixteenth, and
weakened. B G WARRIOR chased two wide and between horses, vied for place among foes in upper stretch, but was outkicked inside the furlong grounds.
PEACOCK LASS rated at the rear along the inside, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, and stayed on late. SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS stalked outside of
the leader while in the four to three paths into the turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival while entering the lane in the four path, then weakened between
horses in midstretch. SASSY NATURE set the pace in the three to two paths into the turn, vied between bidders turning for home, but proved no match for
her inner challenger entering the lane, and caved in the three path and between horses in upper stretch. LADY HOLLYWOOD (GB) failed to sustain forward
position inside of foes nearing the turn, saved ground off of the pace before being roused for gain turning for home, but lacked a bid, and weakened.

Footnotes
EDDIE M vied for the lead three wide, dueled with an inner RATE CONFIRMATION through midstretch, and edged clear late. FOREVER COOL broke
slowly, drifted out while lagging behind down the backstretch, yet offered a quick blitz in the five to six paths and outside of foes turning for home, shifted
inwardly while rallying in upper stretch, sustained his charge in pursuit of the top pair in the final furlong, and gained place late. RATE CONFIRMATION took
a bump from an outer rival early, tugged forward, bid through a vacated rail turning for home, dueled through midstretch, but yielded late. RIVOLI chased
from the three path, got brushed and herded inwardly by an outer rival in upper stretch, and lacked ab id. BROKENHEARTED laid off of the pace along the
inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and failed to menace. GOLDEN REIGN brushed an inner rival early on, laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses, got floated to the five path entering the lane, yet sustained stride while failing to factor. POWER ALLEY broke a step slow, transferred
contact from an outer rival into an inner foe early on, tugged forward, tracked from the two path around the turn, chased in upper stretch, and faded.
MOONOVERMONTGOMERY was tough to load, lacked speed in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. AIR
KENNEY set the pace while remaining off of the rail, then weakened between horses turning for home. PAPA D L lacked speed three wide and never got
involved.
