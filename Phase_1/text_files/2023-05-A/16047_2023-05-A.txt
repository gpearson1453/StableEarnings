SUMMARY JUDGMENT moved clear after a quarter mile, rated on clear lead then drew away under moderate pressure. ELUSIVE RYDER trailed early,
advanced inside, finished willingly but was no threat to the winner. BRODY SLAM moved wide on the final turn and into the stretch narrowing the gap.
VIRADIA was well placed outside the pacesetter early and faltered. ABHAILE pressed the winner along inside briefly then gave way readily.
LONDONDERRY dropped back after the start and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
BOSS LIKE BETH stalked close up outside, bid on the turn, dropped back a bit in upper stretch, then re rallied and wore down her rival late to prevail. BAY
AND GOLD away alertly, set the pace on the inside, dueled with BOSS LIKE BETH at the quarter pole, edged away from that rival in the stretch, dug in
gamely and yielded grudgingly late. ALL HAIL MO raced off the early pace, chased three wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside and earned the show spot.
LADY SICARIA pulled close up early on the inside, steadied at the seven sixteenths marker, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. DIVINARY tracked on
the inside, chased inside on the turn, continued along the rail in the stretch and had no rally. LUNA T raced off the rail, off the pace, chased four wide on the
turn and tired. HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH was outrun.

SPRINKLE THIS forced the pace outside, took over midway on the final turn, drifted out through the stretch but lasted. MISS CHAMITA settled inside the
dueling leaders, bid outside on the final turn, angled back inside winner with as gradual late gain. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE trailed racing wide and offered
some late energy to gain the show. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER saved ground off the pace, bid into the stretch then went evenly. POP THE CLUTCH rated
wide within striking range then faltered. CINNAMON DREAM dropped back early and was never in contention. JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL hustled to the front
inside, led then was finished by the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
JOHNNY RITT broke sharply, set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, responded when roused at the top of the lane, pulled away and was
ridden out. IN SKY WE TRUST bobbled at the break, stalked close up outside, chased on the turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, could not threaten the
winner and was well clear for place honors. CRAFTY DON raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail in the final
furlong and got up for third. PORSUPUESTO raced off the pace with a three wide trip, rallied mildly outside and was outkicked for third. CLEMENZA tracked
on the inside, chased inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. MACH TRIAL raced off the pace inside and did not factor. KEFI
raced four wide early, stalked outside, chased three wide on the turn and faded.

LET IT FLOW JOE close up between rivals, advanced on the final turn then drew away in the stretch under mild urging. FIRST TO LAST stalked the loose
pacesetter, bid to front nearing the quarter pole but yielded to the winner. ROAD CALL saved ground off the leaders and finished willingly to gain the show.
EL GRAN CUYAYA settled close up three wide and was finished after half a mile. CAPT COMPLICATED urged to clear advantage to midway on the final
turn and gave way. FRUGAL JUDE broke very slowly, trailed then caught fading rivals late. KANE lacked speed and was never in contention. SHADOW
BAY was urged close up briefly inside then gave way readily.

MR. ROUNDTREE trailed the field, advanced inside on the turn, angled out, rallied outside in the stretch run, surged in deep stretch and got up at the wire.
STRUGAR dueled outside of HE'S INCREDIBLE from the outset, dueled with that rival on the turn, then dueled with JUMP SHOT entering the stretch, dug
in gamely inside, battled determinedly to the end and just missed. JUMP SHOT tracked the dueling leaders, chased on the turn, bid three wide at the
quarter pole, dueled with STRUGAR past the furlong marker and dug in gamely between rivals to the finish. HE'S INCREDIBLE dueled inside for command,
dueled on the turn and faded in the lane. PER RULING #24009PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, MR ROUNDTREE WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ROADTRIPTONOWHERE alternated for the lead along the inside to the stretch and edged away under moderate pressure. RICH'S WAY vied with the
winner outside to the stretch then weakened and just lasted for the place. SECRET ALLIANCE stalked the dueling leaders three wide then continued
willingly while no threat. BRINDISI settled at the back of the field early then rallied mildly. JAMIE DREAMS moved just off the pace between rivals then
faltered. NORTHERN EXPRESS was well placed off the pace inside for half a mile then gave way readily.
