Footnotes
TEN MILES HIGH tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane
despite drifting a significant amount. BLAME BISHOP pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend
and chased the winner home in the lane. LUSCIOUS raced off the pace on the inside early, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn
and continued to improve position in the stretch. HENRY'S WORLD led the way on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn
and weakened in the lane. RULING FRONT raced in the middle of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the bend from the two path and was
outkicked from there. ADIOS BOBBY trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
INCREDIBLE BILL led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and in upper stretch and drew off in the final furlong. MIKES
MYTH was away from the gate slowly, recovered to move up and track and leader on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the
bend and into the lane, gave way passing the eighth pole and chased the winner home from there, the best of the rest. TOYI chased the pace setters
between horses early, came around the turn in the four path and was outkicked in the stretch. KENRIC bumped with the horse to his outside at the start,
raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening.
SHAKEN AND SHIMMY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and showed no kick. KADAR INDY was
bumped by the horse to his inside and veered out at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no
bid. DISCREET DEVIL stalked the leader on the outside through the early going, came around the turn in the three path and tired from there.
