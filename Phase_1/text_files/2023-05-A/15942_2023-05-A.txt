GOLDDIGGENDEVIL jostled at the start when in between rivals, raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path with
momentum, caught the leader into the lane then drew off. BAD BOY GEIST pressed the pace three or four wide through the turn, was moving to the lead
into the lane when passed by the winner then stayed on for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. WHOSFORJUSTICE pressed the pace two wide
through the turn, dropped closer to the inside into the lane then could not keep up with the top ones. SECRETO DE AMORE was unhurried while moving
three wide through the turn, moved up into the lane and never was a threat. RUNAWAY IMAGE chased the pace from the four path through the turn and
tired in the lane. INFINITY'S WARRIOR set the pace along the inside into the turn then faded along the rail. QUALITY DANCER was between rivals through
the turn when well back and never factored. JACK OF ALL TRADES raced near the rail through the turn and was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
RILEYS REDEMPTION cleared soon after the start, raced in the two or three path into the turn, was joined by the runner-up through the turn, continued with
a short lead into the lane then inched away inside the eighth pole. ANAITA pressed the pace two wide through the turn while in the three or four path,
continued close up into the lane then could not keep up through the final sixteenth while clear for the place spot. HER WAY chased the pace from along the
inside through the turn and into the lane, was under strong handling inside the eighth pole but could not gain on the top ones. CHELSEA'S STRENGTH
raced in the three path through the turn and lacked a closing response. DASH OF SIMPLICITY saved ground through the turn and into the lane and never
was a factor. HOOSIER PREMIUM lunged at the start then hustled up to join the field before the first call, raced in the four path through the turn and tired.
TIZ ABBY trailed while well off the rail through the turn and in the seven path into the lane.

Footnotes
MORE THAN GLORY was bothered at the start when another came over, lost path then raced in mid-pack, swept four wide through mid-turn on the far turn,
quickly gained the lead into the lane then widened through the stretch while in mid-track. MISCHIEF LILY chased the pace from the two path through the
turn, came into the lane three wide, got closest to the winner outside the eighth pole then could only chase that one home while saving the place spot.
ROBIN SAGE vied for the lead along the inside through the turn then yielded coming into the lane. DOT MARIE was bothered at the start and steadied
slightly, raced through the four path in late turn when gaining momentum, continued with energy into the lane and moved up for a share of the show spot.
VOGELSANG chased the pace from the three path into the lane, had aim on the leaders and lacked a closing kick while saving a piece of the show spot.
PETERPAM vied for the lead two wide through mid-turn then was done near the quarter pole. SAY SAYONARA steadily faded while near the rail. A STAR
FOR CORA was in the three path through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane.

path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then couldn't close late. HOBNOBIN GENERAL saved ground, bid five wide on the turn, angled six wide in the stretch
and closed late. C. J'S STORM stalked the pace in the five path, then faded in the stretch. MACHO JUSTICE pressed the early pace before fading on the
turn. ONE WAY RAY pressed early in the three path, then faded on the turn. HE B READY pressed early inside before fading. CASPER JUSTICE was not a
factor. FIERCE JUSTICE led early inside to the stretch and faded. BINGE raced five wide and then faded.

Footnotes
UNDERDRESSED chased the pace from along the inside into the far turn, shifted out into the three path approaching the five-sixteenths pole, continued on
with good energy while dropping to the inside then drew off through the final eighth. PADDY'S HOUSE was unhurried while off the inside, advanced through
the three path through mid-turn, was brushed and forced into the four path nearing the five-sixteenths, battled with the winner into the lane while moving into
the two path and then was no match once straightened. SAMI'S TROOPER stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn then could not keep up
with the top two. POET OF LIFE (IRE) was never a factor while saving ground into the far turn. EVIL EYE set the pace along the inside through late turn
then was empty turning into the lane. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) chased the pace from off the rail into the far turn then was done. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF #9 PADDY'S HOUSE AGAINST THE RIDER OF #6 UNDERDRESSED FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN WAS DISALLOWED.
