GOOD BYE PUTIN away well and raced up three wide entering the backstretch to track the early pacesetter, commenced his bid two out from the rail
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in the final strides. FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and just failed to last
while proving clearly second best. WISE MARKET broke sharply and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, loomed a danger
from between rivals approaching the final turn, was unable to keep tabs with the pacesetter through the turn, and lacked the needed closing response when
called upon. GORKY PARK dropped back to trail a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to bide his time at the
back of the pack while racing three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three out from the rail in the drive.

BAKKEN OVERDRIVE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, opened a
clear advantage approaching the final turn, and continued to widen his advantage over the final furlong while being ridden out late. BAK TO LIBERTY away
alertly and tracked the pacesetter while racing three wide entering the backstretch, took up the chase while commencing his bid two wide entering the final
turn, and held on for the place in deep stretch while finished one out from the rail. MAGIC ROAD settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the
rail entering the backstretch, began to advance three wide midway to the final turn, continued two out from the rail through the turn, and finished willingly
three wide in the drive to just miss the place. TAPITS CHOICE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
continued to save ground through the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive. UNION MAN unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
began to show interest approaching the final turn while mounting a three wide bid, and finished with some late interest two wide in the drive. BRIAN'S DE
LEIGHT tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing between rivals, struggled to maintain his position in the run to the final turn, and

SHOTGUN RIDER broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, drove up along the inside to
challenge for the lead midway down the backstretch when VALUABLE COWBOY bore out, battled from along the rail for the lead entering the final turn, took
command entering the lane, and was never seriously threatened late. TIZ VICIOUS away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while
racing two out from the rail entering the backside, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to grab the place. DRILLER broke in a bit of a tangle, but raced into a stalking trip from just off the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed with interest from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. VALUABLE
COWBOY away alertly and battled for the lead from the inside of BABY GRAND entering the first turn while racing one out from the rail, drifted out into the
middle of the track entering the backside while carrying his pace rival out with him, dropped back into the two path to battle for the lead entering the final
turn, but faded in the late stages. BABY GRAND was fractious prior to the start, and hopped at the break, but rushed up to battled for the lead three wide
entering the first turn, was carried extremely wide when his pace rival bore out entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and
wasn't persevered with over the final furlong.

JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backside while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two wide
through the final turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, and closed with a rush to get up in time. LASTING LIGHT broke sharply and dueled for the lead
from the outside of KANDY KATIE entering the first turn, continued to force the pace two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, took a
narrow advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. KANDY KATIE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the inside of LASTING LIGHT in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid
effort. HARLAN'S ANGEL settled towards the back of the field while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide
entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive but needed more. BAKFIRE BABY settled off the contested early pace while saving ground
along the inside through the first turn and into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing
three wide in the drive. BAKZONE tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the
run to the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

WALKINTHEWALK settled well off the contested early pace while being carried three wide into the backstretch, dropped to the rail midway down the
backside to save ground in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly from along the inside through the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed
with a rush to get up in time. LIZZIES GIRL away well and dueled for the lead from between rivals entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from
between rivals in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and finished determinedly from along the inside in the drive in a solid effort. ANAAMY
tracked the contested early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, collared the pacesetters three wide entering the final turn, held the
narrowest of advantages into the lane, and finished two wide in the drive to just miss the place. TEXAS HUMOR settled off the dueling leaders while racing
three wide entering the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive. ROSE OF TEXAS was slow
into stride while racing a bit rank into the first turn, drifted four wide entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. VALERIE VALESKI away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, steadied sharply when in tight quarters at the rail entering the
lane, and weakened late. SKY FACTOR broke sharply and pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue three wide in
the run to the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the leaders entering the turn, and weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race
there were two jockey claims of foul. The rider of VALERIE VALESKI lodged a claim of foul against the rider's of both LIZZIE'S GIRL and ANAAMY for
alleged interference entering the lane. After review both claims of foul were dismissed and no change was made to the original order of finish.

SIR BREGOVIC away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, drifted four wide entering the lane while being overtaken for the lead, but battled back gamely in deep stretch to get up in time. MAJESTIC
STREET broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the pacesetter two wide into the final
turn, was carried five wide into the lane, but battled determinedly through the stretch to just miss. QUINTO SOL away well and tracked the leaders in the run
down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, slipped through at the rail to take command
entering the lane, but was outfinished in deep stretch in a solid effort. FOREIGN PROTOCOL was pinched soon after the start and trailed the field into the
first turn, raced with a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied six wide through the final turn, and continued seven wide in the drive. PAY MY WAY
settled off the early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed
closing response late when called upon. FAMILY BIZ stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground
through the final turn, and finished at the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious impact. STAY FANTASTIC stalked the leaders into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but faded in the late going.

BUNNY away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of LICORICE in the run down the
backside, held a narrow advantage through the final turn, and pulled clear late under steady urging to prove best. LICORICE raced up two wide entering the
first turn to battle for the lead, forced the issue from the outside of BUNNY in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides
with that rival late, but battled on gamely three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. FREESTYLE was off a step slow, and allowed to settle off the
contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, began to advance from along the inside midway down the backside,
rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and finished well three out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. INDYETTA broke
sharply and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final
turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. ARUNDEL CASTLE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive in an even effort. ELLAMEISTER settled well off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing at
the rail. B C CHU CHU away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but faded over the final furlong. HIGHER IMAGE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, saved
ground at the rail through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. C C SUNRISE rushed up from the outside to chase the
leaders to the first turn, but bore out badly entering the turn, raced wide throughout, and wasn't persevered with in the late stages.
