Footnotes
MAS RAPIDO (GB) bobbled a bit crossing over the dirt, tracked inside a pair of rivals into the turn, tipped out and took aim two wide into the stretch, drew
alongside ITZEL in upper stretch and inched away late. ITZEL took control from inside early, set all the pace to the stretch, met the challenger from outside
in upper stretch, resisted to the sixteenth and yielded late. REXFORD raced near the back on the inside, tipped out into the stretch and finished well to earn
the show honors. ZE'BUL was off slow to begin, trailed early, went two then three wide on the turn, steered out in the lane and missed the show. KID
AZTECA stalked three deep into the turn, remained three wide into the stretch and lacked further response. HOGMANAY (IRE) was off slow at the start,
settled off the pace, went three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. CASTLEKNOCK stalked two wide into
the turn, raced between rivals then angled to the rail late on the bend, then faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BALADI stalked the top trio to the turn, rounded the bend two then three wide, tipped out into the lane and launched a bid four deep in upper stretch, cleared
with a furlong remaining and drew off. REDLINE raced near the back off the rail, angled to the two path on the turn, moved out leaving the bend and came
four wide into the stretch, steered out widest in the lane and rallied for second. ROOKIE MISTAKE stalked briefly then went up to press the pace from
between rivals, vied for command around the turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. STRIKE THAT
stalked then went up to attend the pace three deep, found outside inner pair through the turn, stayed on to the eighth pole then weakened in the furlong
grounds. TOOK CHARGE sped clear and crossed over then took pressure from outside rivals, vied for command through the turn, relinquished the lead
leaving the turn, fought to upper stretch and gave way. NEXT REVOLT climbed along up the backstretch and dropped back, trailed four then five wide on

Footnotes
BLUE CHEESE OLIVE brushed with inner rival at the start, took a bumped from outside early then was closest in pursuit from inside up the backstretch,
challenged inside the pacesetter exiting the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was ridden out late. MONTANA bumped leaving the gate, trailed early,
raced near the inside into the turn, steered out to the four path around the bend to go around rivals, rallied under left-handed urging and bested the rest.
MR. DISRESPECTFUL came in twice and bumped FORDY G early, went up to take control then cleared at the half-mile pole, showed the way in the two
path through the bend, pressured from inside entering the stretch, offered little resistance to the winner and weakened in the furlong grounds. FORDY G got
bumped by MR. DISRESPECTFUL before having to check when that rival came in once again early on, chased three wide around the turn and flattened in
the lane. STELLA BOY was floated in and bumped with inner rival early, chased two wide around the bend and never responded to urging. FINALLY AN
EDDIE got bumped on both sides at the start, tracked from inside to the stretch and failed to menace. R HEART OF GOLD broke a step slow, was forced to
check early, traveled three wide through the turn and had little left for the drive. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN
FORDY G AND MR. DISRESPECTFUL EARLY IN THE RACE. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHROUGH MR.
DISRESPECTFUL DID COME IN AND MAKE CONTACT IT DID NOT COST FORDY G A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

the top of the lane, continued to drifted steadily while urged right-handed and drew off. NAVY MAN hopped slightly at the start to break a step slow, settled
at the back, went five wide into the turn, moved into the four path then came back out and entered the stretch six wide, summoned a mild rally and got up for
second. TAHOE SUNRISE broke a step slow, climbed early then stalked the top pair up the backstretch, took aim three to four wide on the turn, got floated
out six wide into the drive, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and was edged for the place honors. HARD TO FIGURE pressed the pace from
outside, headed the leader exiting the backstretch, dueled around the turn then got floated five wide into the lane and flattened in the furlong grounds.

relinquished the lead in upper stretch, stayed on into the final sixteenth and faltered late. FAST AND SHINY dropped her head at the start to come away

Footnotes
SAWASDEE sped clear to a comfortable advantage early, led three wide into the turn, opened up around the bend while moving inward under coaxing
through the turn, asked right handed into the stretch, switched to the left hand in upper stretch, remained far in front into the final furlong and was geared
down in deep stretch. BARSABAS chased outside a rival into the turn, went two to three wide around the bend, whittle the gap late on the winner while
holding on for second. MITICO raced three deep at the back into the turn, angled out and traveled five deep at the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into
the stretch and missed the place. SONIC BREES chased between at the back into the turn, was driven two wide into the lane and improved position.
WARRENS CANDY MAN broke a step slow, raced at the back along the inside into the turn, got blocked around the bend, tipped two wide into the clear
and could not threaten. WINTER FALCON broke a step slow, chased along the rail into and around the bend, then faded in the stretch run. BRUTTO
chased three deep into the turn, lost ground three to four wide around the bend and came up empty. STIR THE POT chased four deep into the turn, started
to weaken around the bend, came five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DEAN MARTINI bumped inner rival at the start, took control and moved inside, showed the way to the far turn, met bids from a trio of rivals at the quarter
pole, carried a short lead into the final furlong and held gamely to the wire. YES THIS TIME stalked from inside and had to steady a bit first time through the
stretch, tugged early on the backstretch, was on the move three deep then bid four wide at the quarter pole, fought outside DEAN MARTINI into the final
furlong but lacked the needed late punch to get by while holding the place. FLASHIEST was off a bit slow to begin, traveled two wide near the back,
between into the far turn then angled four wide around the bend, finished well outside YES THIS TIME but missed the place. GENERAL MATHIS stalked
three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep with a quarter mile remaining, fought into the final furlong but faltered in deep stretch.
CROSBY BEACH stalked from inside and had to steady briefly first time through the stretch, saved ground to the lane and flattened in the final furlong.
TAISHAN pulled early then settled inside, steadied off heels at the three-eighths pole, tipped out leaving the far turn and could not rally. TIDAL FORCES
trailed on the inside early, angled four wide on the far turn and failed to menace. VANZZY got bumped leaving the gate, was forwardly placed two wide
early, bid two wide at the quarter pole and weakened in the furlong grounds. FAYATHAAN (IRE) was unruly first time through the stretch, still rank on the
backstretch, went four to five wide on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) set the pace under pressured, led along the rail through the turn, shook free upper stretch and held safely. KING APOLLO
bumped leaving the gate, lost some ground in traffic early and altered inward, rounded the bend three then four wide, put in a late run but could not reach
the winner. CHERUBIC FACTOR got crowded between rivals early, started to pull and had to steady up the backstretch, got put in tight between rivals and
checked into turn, found traffic in upper stretch, tipped out and gained the show. THORNE HOUSE bumped between rivals at the start, pressed the pace
from outside, lost touch in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. DANCING RINCA stalked the pace from inside, chased behind the leader to the stretch and
failed to respond when called upon. CALI BAY (IRE) stalked outside rivals then bumped near the half-mile pole, rounded the bend four then five wide and
lacked a rally. VANCOUGAR got crowded between rivals early, rated three deep and bumped at the half-mile pole, steadied in tight entering the turn, moved
into the two path around the bend and flattened out in the lane. FORGIVING SPIRIT was off a bit slow in the beginning, moved into range outside rivals,
chased three wide into the stretch and weakened. SMUGGLER'S RUN bumped leaving the gate, raced at the back on the inside into the turn, trailed two
wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.
