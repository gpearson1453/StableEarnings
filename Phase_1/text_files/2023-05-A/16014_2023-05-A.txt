the win at the wire. DRILL'S VALENTINE chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and gained ground late
to just miss. SHALL RETURN raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid while saving ground around the turn and
dueled between horses in the lane to just miss. CSILLA tracked the pace setter between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn

Footnotes
WOODS HOLE saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and kicked
clear in the lane. COOL FRONT raced in the two path around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path
around the second turn and could not go with the winner in the lane, chasing that rival home. LIZZ A BEE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and improved position in the lane.
MARYNMIKE raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the far turn from the two path
and finished evenly. SHE B GLAMOROUS trailed the field from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still
in the three path and improved position in the stretch while never threatening. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through
the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the five path and was outkicked in the lane. STRIKING CHROME raced in the three path around the first
turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the five path and faded from there. HARDLY SOCIAL raced in
the five path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the four path and was empty in the
stretch.

UNIFIED RIDE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming around the turn, lost the lead briefly to DIVINE
CONNECTION in upper stretch and battled back gamely to edge clear late. DIVINE CONNECTION chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the bend from the two path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire, giving way late. MYLASTREDCENT raced off the
pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground in late
stretch. GLEAMING BRUTALITY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and weakened in the
lane. MUGURUZA stalked the pace setters on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. QUALITY
TOO SPARE raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the turn and was empty from

Footnotes
CAJUN CRACKER led the way on the outside racing up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held that margin to the finish. HEAVY WEIGHT stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and gained
ground late. STREET COP OFFICER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the
three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. RAGING WHIRLWIND raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
came around the bend in the four path and improved position in the lane. RECTANGLE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to
the five path for the run around the far turn and improved position in the stretch. HE'S CONNECTED raced off the pace between horses in the early going,
continued around the turn in the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane. TRUTH AND HONESTY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and weakened from there. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and never threatened. PERSONAL FINANCE tracked the pacesetters on the outside through
the opening quarter, dueled from the three path around the turn and faded in the lane. KALINBA chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.
