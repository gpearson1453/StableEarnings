Footnotes
HANK'S GAL was on the pace out from the rail about the three path while inside a rival, was challenged through the far turn and met that bid then kept
JOSIES SCORE at bay under a steady ride. JOSIES SCORE tracked the pace off the rail to bid outside the winner through the far turn into the lane and
could not get by. JOCOTE moved three wide to get within range going to the far turn but weakened. JUDGE JENNINGS failed to mount a bid three wide.
SHES STEEL DREAMIN forced the early pace outside the winner and tired in the far turn.

PICTORIAL tracked the early leaders three and four wide, moved to challenge three wide into the far turn, dueled outside CAJUN TRINITY through the lane
and was up after alternating on the lead late. CAJUN TRINITY gained a short clear lead early to gain inside position in a tightly grouped field, dug in when
headed in the far turn and gave ground grudgingly throughout. DOLLY DIMPLE moved three and four wide to bid going through the far turn, continued well
but came up short at the wire. FOOLISH INTENT was along the inside always in reach but had no late bid. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK forced the early pace
three wide to bid through the far turn but came up empty in the drive.

LEVEL tracked the early leader three wide to bid and move clear in the far turn then drew off under mild handling in the lane. LOVE OURS moved three
wide to challenge in the far turn then could not go with the winner the remainder while clearly best of the others. RING TAILED TOOTER stalked the leaders
three wide and lacked a closing rally. IZZY IN A TIZZY was bumped and forced out into the first turn as a rival came out, continued four wide and missed the
show late. ROCKETS AFLEET showed good early speed inside the winner, was headed into the far turn and gave way on entering the lane and was not
persevered with in the lane. COUNT D'ORLEANS ducked in at the break then came out into a rival entering the first turn, gave way after a half and was
eased in the lane.

Footnotes
TAPIT'S LADY moved to challenge outside HOT CAVIAR into the far turn and move clear then held safe in the lane under steady urging. FAST SOPHIA
saved ground and made a mild late run up the inside to gain the place narrowly. SATURDAY SERVICE steadied from between rivals into the first turn,
moved three and four wide to have aim through the far turn then continued to finish on even terms with HOT CAVIAR for the show. HOT CAVIAR showed
the most early speed inside then held well in the lane to finish on even terms for the show. CHAOS MAGIC lacked a solid closing bid three wide. SUE
HAPPY failed to threaten three and four wide.

LOVETHATCAUSE stalked the pace inside to late backstretch, angled three wide into the far turn to bid outside rivals then dueled to the wire and was just
up. HULEN dueled on the lead inside a rival about the three path, resisted as the winner challenged in the far turn and came up short late. OLD TRAFFORD
stalked the pace four wide and offered up a late surge in the closing sixteenth to just miss at the wire. PREACHER dueled on the pace outside HULEN to
the far turn, continued to vie into the lane but weakened late. KNIGHTED stalked the pace in good position three wide and weakened. LARCH was always
back, stopped entering the lane and was eased through the stretch. JUST ASK JOEL was never a factor, gave way in the far turn and was pulled up before
the wire but walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
SABER QUEEN tracked the early leaders to bid four wide into the far turn, kicked clear nearing the lane and held safe under mild urging. UNHERDOF
settled three, rallied five wide into the lane and gained clear for the place. ZIPPORAH moved up four wide but lacked the needed late rally. COLD AS YOU
failed to mount a bid three wide. SASSY SUE'S BAND was always back saving ground. WITCHY WINDSOR contested the early pace three wide and
weakened. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY was on the pace inside rivals and tired.
