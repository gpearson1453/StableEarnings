Footnotes
SHE'S MY RIDE was wide throughout, won driving. TOSSAPENNYDOWN steadied 1/4, bumped 1/8, rail. EMPEROR'S CHOICE set pace, bumped stretch.
ROMEO'S GLORY stalked pace, bumped stretch. PREDETERMINATION was no threat, broke down after wire. BECOME AN INSIDER was never a factor.
KICK IT broke sharply, tired.
