Footnotes
RUNNING ARGUMENT brush at the start, settled off the pace and the inside, began to advance three wide late in the turn, reached the leader past the
furlong marker and powered by under steady handling. CUSTOM SUNSHINE broke very alertly to be immediately clear, continued to show the through the
turn by daylight, offered but brief resistance to the winner a furlong out, remained far clear of the rest. LONG LEGGED LADY broke out and bobbled, raced
back, moved out for the drive, along for the show, no threat to the top pair. CAJUN ROCK STAR chased the runner up in the two path for a quarter and
began to weaken, caught late for the show. C C LLAM in tight at the start, fell back to trail and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GALAXY THIRTYSIX within striking distance early, moved closer three wide late in the turn, saw that progress stall while drifting out steadily during the
middle part of the stretch, straightened, late surge to be up in time. SIENNA BREEZE broke alertly, pressed the early leader from along the inside,
challenged along the rail turn, took over, clear past the furlong marker, continued to hole a daylight advantage late, could not contain the winner. TUGBOAT
last away, lacked speed, came four wide for the drive, slow gain on the top two late while fully extended to preserve the show. LOVERS NEVER SAY within
striking distance in the run up the backstretch, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. SHELLI'S ANGEL trailed off the inside, four wide
midway on the turn, three wide exiting, failed to rally. SOPHIE'S PRAYER took control out of the gate, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path,
caved in when headed.

Footnotes
CHAOSMOS took command after the start, clear onto the backstretch, rated kindly the middle half mile, shrugged off a rival turning for home, plenty left to
remain well clear. RUN ROCKET settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the final turn, eased off the rail a bit for the drive but still
challenged for the runner up spot inside another rival, dueled with that one to the wire and proved game while not a serious threat to the winner. ONE TIME
GEM closest to the winner, advanced and tried that one from the outside late in the second turn, could not keep up in the drive,outkicked late for the place
position. BAYOU JAM one paced off the inside, crept closer in the three path through the second turn, flattened out a bit in the drive, not enough for the
show late. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN last to leave, raced four wide through the final turn, asked into the lane, went flat to the wire to also be found lacking
late. GUITAR TRIBUTE fell back to trail, was never a serious threat while making up some ground late with some mild late interest out in the course.

Footnotes
CAJUN CARLOS stalked the pace up the backstretch out in the strip, challenged three wide turn, began to draw steadily clear when straightened for home
and slowly increased that margin to the wire while kept to pressure. FRIEND'S DO CARE vied early while off the inside, contested the issue while between
horses through the turn, could not match strides with the winner through the lane, clearly second best. WHISKEY RED back off the pace and the inside,
came in the two path for the drive, rallied mildly to earn the show. COLE'S SENSATION fell back after the start, saved ground turn, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals while never a threat. POPPA BEAR off a step slow, well back early, four wide into the lane, made little impact to the wire. HEZA CHAIN
BREAKER flashed early foot along the inside, began to gave way after a half. BELLAMY BROTHER raced in mid pack for a half, backed up while three
wide.

Footnotes
ALLIACEOUS tracked the leaders toward the inside, raced in some traffic second turn, split foes when challenging nearing the furlong grounds, drove
strongly clear. GLANCE lacked early foot in settling into a rhythm, raced four wide through the second turn when beginning to advance, came five wide for
the drive, continued to rally willingly down the lane to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. BROKEN PROPOSAL broke out and slowly, moved
up outside to race in mid pack, closer into the far turn, four wide into the lane while seeing progress stall, angled in, found more late to miss the place.
COINMAKER prompted the issue early, moved to duel before a half, continued to alternate up front second turn, weakened through the stretch. GURKHA
GOLD (IRE) fell back to trail after the start, lacked a serious bid. SHE A HOT MESS dueled early along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.
SERIOUSLY SAM dueled early off the inside, disposed of that rival before a half only to be joined by a second rival, narrowly showed the way through upper
stretch then stopped late.

outside, four wide again second bend when being asked, drifted out badly through the stretch but was still coming late to be getting to the winner. MIND ON
MY MONEY vied up front while off the inside, continued to battle through the second bend, could no keep up with the winner in chasing that one past the
furlong marker, caught late for the runner up spot. BAND BOSS narrowly set the pace inside early, allowed the winner the inside before a half, vied with that
one and two others through the second bend and began to weakend. BASSETT fell back after vying the opening quarter and failed to menace. LIAM SKYE
five wide when with the lead pack first turn, continued wide up the backstretch, five wide again through the second bend, trailed home.

Footnotes
MI SOLUTION broke on top set the pace while under light restraint just off the inside, came out slightly into the far turn while continuing to show the way,
steadily widened through the lane while kept to pressure. DOUBLE ON THE RED last to leave, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second bend
when beginning to improve, between foes nearing midstraight, continued willingly to the wire to be well clear of the others. RUN ON ACES within striking
distance, moved closer along the inside second turn, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, weakened a bit late, nod for the show. VETERANS DAY
chased the winner, bothered slightly when that one came out a bit into the far turn, fell back off that one into the lane and continued to weaken to the wire.
ITS WILD AGAIN fell back to trail, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MY LIL DUDE forwardly placed for a half, fell back.
FIELD OF VISION settled off the pace, well wide through the final turn, had nothing for the drive. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF VETERANS DAY
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
RAZZ back off the pace and the inside, raced four out to five wide to lose some ground to the leaders into the lane, firmly roused, lacked kick to be up in
time. ROLL ON OUT broke alertly, set the early pace in the two path, vied through the turn while between horses, continued to hold a narrow advantage
past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. WICKED TOUGH lacked early foot, came on the outside for the drive, angled steadily to
the rail past the furlong marker, up for the show while closest to the rail of the top flight. MARVINS' WARRIOR prominent in the run up the backstretch,
closer to vie three wide and on the outside through the turn, faltered in the drive. ARKANSAS ZONG moved up to vie inside the runner up into the turn,
continued on equal terms into the stretch and began to weaken. RED ON THE HEAD went one paced and failed to rally. SMOOTH CUSTOM fell back to
trail after the start and never menaced.
