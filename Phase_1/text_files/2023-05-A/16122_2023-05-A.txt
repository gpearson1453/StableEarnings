Footnotes
STRIKE THE POSE had a good position outside tracking the speed duel upfront, waited to pounce midway on the turn, cruised to the lead outside in the
four path turning for home and was kept to the task late drawing away comfortably at the wire. HUMOR ME JIM set the fractions down the backstretch on
the rail, surrendered the lead at the three eighths pole running inside, was in contention at the top of the lane on the fence and determinedly battled on late
besting the rest in the end. SPEEDY JOHNY was on the rail in the second flight stalking the early speed duel, was roused inside at the quarter pole, shifted
out to the three path for the drive and closed in for third passing a tired runner in the late stages of the race. I'M A BOURBON GIRL hounded the pacesetter
outside at the half, took command in the two path at the three furlong marker, was in between runners vying for the lead turning for home and tired in mid
stretch. SANDY GRACE broke with the field but soon dropped back outside to trail, was hustled for more to keep pace with the other rivals down the
backside, could not get into contention on the turn and was never a factor in the lane. PER RULING FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION,
SANDY GRACE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR CARRYING TOO LITTLE WEIGHT.

Footnotes
HIT AND RUN was reined back at the half watching the contesting trio battle up front, waited inside midway on the turn to offer a run, shifted outwards to the
four path for the drive and wore down the leaders in the stretch to get up for the win. ANITA GRIGIO hounded the frontrunner outside in the early going, bid
for the lead three furlongs from the prize, had a short lead between horses as they straightened out for the drive and stubbornly gave way to the winner a
hundred yards from the line. GORMLEY GIRL broke out, bumping foe at the start, advanced smartly up the rail three eighths from the finish, was in range
behind horses in the three path in upper stretch and split runners late to close in and capture third. MISS BOBBIT was unhurried early trailing the field down
the backstretch, began to unleash her run midpoint on the turn three wide around challengers, was six wide at the top of the lane and was closing in for a
share while on the wrong lead to the wire. WEST PAW broke inwards to start bumping a rival, settled near the back outside in the beginning, could not gain
on other runners through the turn and could only offer an even finish running down the stretch. J M R BOLD VISION pressed the issue on the rail down the
backstretch, took the lead inside entering the turn, fought gamely on the rail turning for home and faded on the fence in deep stretch. WAKE UP MAGGIE
stalked in mid pack outside with four furlongs remaining, made little impression running on the turn and was not involved in the stretch drive. TAKE IT EASY
had a short lead with runners on either side at the half, began to give way between foes three furlongs from home, backed away through the field at the
quarter pole and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
MENDELJOHN (IRE) took control from the onset, was in hand but pressured outside through the turn, opened up with ease at the top of the lane and
convincingly won going away in deep stretch. GIZMO'S MISSION was brushed between horses to begin, took up the running up front seven sixteenths from
home, battled outside with the winner at the top of the stretch and simply could not match strides with the overwhelming winner down the lane. BIG
RANSOM broke out on the start, was under a snug hold between challengers in mid pack four furlongs out, could see most of the field still in upper stretch,
shifted in to the rail at the eighth pole and finished strongly up the fence just missing the place award. WILD CONVERSATION had a good position tracking
behind the top pair on the rail in the early going, was coaxed on the fence two furlongs from the prize, at the top of the lane was in with a chance for a piece
of the prize and finished evenly in deep stretch for a minor share. CHICAGO FREDDY settled near the rear after being brushed inside at the start, offered a
mild run three wide around rivals on the turn, and levelled out in the four path in mid stretch running to the finish line. SMOKIN HOLIDAY chased the pace in
the early going, tracked in the second flight outside entering the turn, was ridden for more with five sixteenths left to go, between horses was involved for the
show share as they turned for home but faded at the furlong pole. DON'T STOP DREAMIN settled at the back on the rail down the backside, was on hold in
tight quarters inside on the turn, steadied at the three eighths pole then midpoint on the turn and could not recover to play a role down the lane.

Footnotes
RAPID TEST was urged forward to set the pace inside under pressure, was headed at the quarter pole, even further back of the new leader in upper stretch
but fought on gamely to come back and retake the lead a sixteenth from home and just lasted from another rallying rival. CADFAEL tracked form inside,
sought room to come out in upper stretch, was able to do so at the furlong marker, rallied but just missed. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW bumped a foe lightly at
the start, prompted the pace outside a foe two to three wide, dueled into the turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, extended the advantage slightly
in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. JIM'S HOPE raced off the pace three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit further in upper stretch,
gained some but too late. SILENT RESERVE was within range stalking the dueling leaders from outside into and on the turn, travelled three to four deep,
loomed a threat in upper stretch but faltered and faded in late stretch. CRUMLIN LAD was ridden along inside foes on the turn and made no bid. MR.
MARSHALL got away slowly, raced at the back near the inside, was never near enough to threaten. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA raced mid-pack off the inside,
moved out from three to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. BROTHER BELEN bumped with a rival at the start and stumbled badly just after, dropping back
to last outside a foe and well back of the remainder, made no bid.

Footnotes
SCOOT DADDY was reined in off the leaders with a half left to run, rallied midpoint on the turn finding a seam in the two path between horses, shifted out
three sixteenths from home in the four path pushing his way through in upper stretch and was full of run late for the victory. KID MARVELOUS was content
chasing the pacesetter early on, assumed command two wide turning for home, battled with the winner until mid stretch and bested the rest in the end.
TAKE CHARGE SOUSI stalked at the back on the rail in the beginning stages of the race, saved ground in the early part of the turn, angled outside around
horses at the quarter pole, was in the seven path entering the stretch and closed well running on the wrong lead to get a share at the line. LEGISLATOR
settled near the rear outside of rivals at the half, was scrubbed on for more effort midturn, angled out in the six path turning for home and showed good
interest late passing tired runners. EL COHETE led the field down the backstretch, continued to be the pacesetter on the turn, was collared outside entering
the lane and yielded on the fence at the furlong marker. TAZMAN tracked the top duo three wide outside foes down the backside, continued to keep in touch
with the front pair running on the turn, was pushed out to the five path while in contention in upper stretch and stalled running to the finish line. TOWN'S
WARRIOR had a good inside tracking position behind the speed into the turn, was ridden to keep pace with the contenders at the quarter pole and came up
empty on the fence in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LIVIN ON LUV tracked from inside just off the leaders under light rating tactics, came out in upper stretch for room, struck the lead a furlong out and drove
clear. COLLECT DATTT broke a step slowly, lacked early speed racing off the rail, fanned seven wide under encouragement turning for home, was gaining
late to secure the place. POPNFIZZ forced the pace inside, edged clear turning into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick but kept on to hold show
honors. RIFLING settled off the leaders inside, moved out to race two to three deep in the stretch, passed rivals from inside in upper stretch and just missed
third. I'M INTO MISCHIEF chased off the leading pair, was ridden along three wide coming to the quarter pole, moved out further for the drive but failed to
rally. DIXIE MORNING was at the back outside a rival, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, failed to menace. ADORA was pressured on the lead,
exchanged the advantage dueling outside two to three wide, came up empty. CAHIRA'S BLESSING pursued from outside the second flight going four wide
on the turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
OL' BLONDIE took the lead from the onset, was left alone up front throughout the turn, had plenty in the tank entering the stretch and won going away
unchallenged in the late stages of the races. VERDEJO began to rally between runners midpoint on the turn, was in with a chance at the top of the lane, ran
on through the stretch but the winner was long gone and had the settle for the runner up finish. BILLYJANE tracked the winner outside down the backside,
continued to chase in vain making little headway on the turn and faded inside late losing the place share in the end. TRADING BAY tracked on the rail
entering the turn, was coaxed inside three eighths left to run, had no gain, was ridden for more in upper stretch and raced evenly between horses to the
wire. SOUPER PECAN was situated in midfield on the rail in the early going, saved ground on the fence on hold behind a fellow runner midpoint on the turn,
angled out through the stretch and passed tired foes running to the finish line. GIZMO'S B F F settled in the four path in the middle of the pack down the
back straight, made little progress three wide through the turn and had nothing to offer to the wire. KAVALA trailed the field after the start, offered a brief run
at the back of the pack between rivals at the quarter pole but could not get involved down the lane. HARD TO CAPTURE travelled in mid pack in the three
path in the beginning, was shuffled back to near the rear nine sixteenths from the prize, was urged on the turn three wide and, could not reach contention
outside in the stretch.

Footnotes
OUR FLASH DRIVE stalked the leading pair from outside a rival, range up outside three wide, took command in upper stretch, kicked clear with just
moderate urging and was taken in hand late. MISS SPEEDY broke inwardly, tracked from inside on the turn, came out a path and advanced between foes
in mid-stretch, was no match for the winner but got the place. BABY NO WORRIES exchanged a light bump at the start, settled at the back, went five wide
on the turn, gained but too late. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE was forced out just a bit and exchanged a light bump with the outside foe at the start, settled at the
rear, went three then four wide on the turn, ran on with mild interest. FOREST DRIFT vied inside a rival, had the lead into upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. HARD EDGE attended the pace from outside, prompted two to three deep through the turn, weakened. AMBASSADOR LUNA showed
very brief speed chasing the leading pair under encouragement but soon steadily dropped back three then two wide, failed to rally. BASALT STREET
chased from mid-pack going three wide on the turn and within range of the leaders but dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
BOSSKAYE had a good position stalking the top trio outside entering the turn, cruised around horses to be on the lead in the five path at the top of the lane
and finished up putting away a stubborn rival late to edge away nearing the wire. LEGAL STEPS chased the pace inside into the turn, assumed command
briefly two furlongs from the finish, was headed by the winner at the top of the lane and fought on through the stretch in a gritty runner up performance. FIRE
EMOJI was on hold saving ground on the rail behind runners travelling on the turn, looked for a seam to run through in upper stretch, finally had a clear path
at the furlong marker and when clear ran on to be a good third. FAVORITE CHANNEL tracked behind the leader on the rail into the turn, shifted just outside
off a tiring runner in the four path turning for home to be in the mix and showed some interest to finish up holding on for a minor share. MISS SCHILLER
settled in midfield alone at the half, picked up some rivals running outside of foes five sixteenths from the line and evened out in the five path in mid stretch.
MANITOULIN ISLAND travelled on the rail in the middle of the pack in the early going, was ridden for more three furlongs from home but to no avail and
could not be a presence through the stretch. ELUSIVE GEM took control from the start clearing the field to lead down the backside, was collared outside at
the quarter pole and faded on the fence in mid stretch. NEPRIKLAUSOMA DAMA was outrun early to be near the rear down the backstretch, could not gain
on her competitors throughout the turn and had nothing to offering turning for home. DON'T MOVE was steadied soon after the start trailing early, caught up
to the field midway on the far turn but could not find anymore in the stretch to make an impression in the late stages of the race.
