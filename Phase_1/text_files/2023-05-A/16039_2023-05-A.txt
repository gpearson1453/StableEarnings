PERFETTO well placed, rallied into the far turn grabbing the lead near the quarter pole clearing in upper stretch pouring it late on while ridden out.
COLAVITO prompted the pace through the backside being hooked near the quarter pole, dispatched by the winner in upper stretch would go all out near
mid track to save place. BLUEBANK slow early gave a mild rally on the far turn then found best stride along the inside down the lane finishing well. KNOWN
went evenly through the backside rallying to bid on the far turn losing momentum in upper stretch dropping off there. QUESTION AUTHORITY tracked the
pace chasing on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. PALACE PRINCE played no factor. HARD N'SWEET was always outrun. KITCHI pressed through
the backside then wilted abruptly on the far turn.
