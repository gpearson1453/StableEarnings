GRAND WISER was rated between rivals, made a two wide bid leaving the quarter pole, went on even terms leaving the turn and had a long drive to prevail
under a drive. ECONOMIC POWER set a pressured pace on the inside and shook clear on the turn, then was headed leaving the turn and stayed on
gamely but was outfinished. LAKE NAKURU was void of early speed, came five wide into the lane and was up for the show award. BLOOD MOON pressed
the pace three wide and weakened. DEVOTED KITTEN chased the pace four wide and tired. EDICT was well placed on the inside and tired.

HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY was off slowly, moved to the inside to save ground while far back early, shifted out midway on the turn and circled the field six
wide leaving the turn and hit the front leaving the furlong marker and edged away to prove best under a drive. HAPPY RIDE pressed the pace and made a
three wide bid leaving the turn to go on even terms for command nearing the furlong marker but could not go with the winner while being second best.
CANDY ARCADE dueled for the lead two wide and made a bid to shake clear on the turn but faded the final furlong, bested rest. COSMOLOGICAL was
fractious in the gate, broke a step slow and then chased the pace five wide and made a mild bid four wide on the turn and weakened. FIVEALARM
FREAKOUT stalked the pace four wide and weakened. GATITA SUAVE rushed up the inside to duel for command and then stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
MI CLEOPATRA AND I set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the three sixteenths and then was resolute and came back to prove best under
left handed crop urging. BOWL OF CHERRIES chased the pace and made a four wide bid off the turn but was outfinished to just miss. MISS CONVEYOR
stalked the pace three wide and made a three wide in between rivals to vie for command by the furlong marker but hung. CABRA CHICA was allowed to
settle early, made a mild bid five wide by the quarter pole and then was slowly gaining. POSITIVE FORCE stalked the early pace in between rivals by the
half mile marker, swung out six wide leaving the turn and weakened. KAREN'S WAY stalked the pace on the inside and weakened. WILL OR WON'T was
not a factor. The rider on POSITIVE FORCE claimed foul versus the number six MI CLEOPATRA AND I and number seven MISS CONVEYOR for
interference after the STEWARDS reviewed the replay the OBJECTIONS were dismissed and race was left as is.

BOSS was bumped at the start, then was reserved early, advanced three wide on the far turn, then was rallying but lugged in by the sixteenth marker and
could not get to the winner, second best. HIGHWAY QUEEN was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide by the quarter pole but lacked the needed
winning bid, bested rest. SAKARI vied for the lead between rivals and weakened. SILENT SCARLET vied for the lead on the inside and stopped.

the turn and came four wide into the lane and had a belated rally to gain the show award. LUSCIOUS LOLA tracked the pace on the inside and fell back on
the turn, angled off the inside and faded in the lane, missed show. SUSIKIN set the early pace on the inside and weakened. HAD THE NOTION was not a
threat while four wide. HIT A HOMER HONEY failed to menace on the inside.
