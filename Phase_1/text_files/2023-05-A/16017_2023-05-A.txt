Footnotes
DOWNY BOY stalked four wide down the backside midfield, was content sitting off the pace outside of runners on the turn making little advance, turned for
home in the six path when asked, was full of run and drew away with every stride at the finish. EMICRACK (CHI) set the pace down the backstretch,
continued up front making the fractions on the turn, was headed by the winner inside the furlong marker, offered no resistance but held on to the place share
of the prize at the wire. WESTERN TROUBLE was a little slow into stride after the break, waited patiently near the back running on the rail through the turn
saving all the ground, rallied up the fence in upper stretch, shifted just outside with a sixteenth left to close in capturing third money. STAR SIGN trailed the
field while unhurried in the beginning, was nudged along by his rider mid point on the turn for run, shifted out widest in the seven path for the drive and
passed tired rivals in the late stages of the race. SUNSPEAR chased the frontrunner inside on the turn, was scrubbed on for more at the quarter pole, could
not gain between rivals and gave way in mid stretch. GHOUL (BRZ) tracked in the middle of the pack travelling three wide on the turn, loomed five wide
taking closer order to the leaders at the top of the lane but had nothing to offer for the stretch run and emptied out at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CEFALO pressed the pacesetter from outside, put to stout urging coming into upper stretch, edged away late. SUPER LUNAR chased from inside on or just
off the rail, came out in upper stretch, kicked on to get show honors in a photo but missed the place. PINO IN A PURSE set the pace inside, was challenged
in upper stretch, yielded only grudgingly and held the place. FLAT OUT VIXEN broke inwardly just a bit, switched out, advanced four then five wide on the
turn, missed second and third in a photo. SIMPLE SOUVENIR tossed her head once at the start, moved out heading into the turn racing at the back inside a
foe, went three then four wide on that bend and was asked to pick it up three furlongs from home, failed to rally. TEXT ME UP stalked from outside going
two to three wide on the turn, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MOMENT OF PEACE was on top leaving the chute, surrendered the front to an inside rival at the half, pressed the issue outside of the speed five sixteenths
from the finish, took control in the four path at the furlong marker and stubbornly battled on for the victory holding safe while not switching leads throughout
the lane. COLLABORATIVE had a good position tracking the leaders all alone in mid pack at the half, took up the run inside three eighths from home, rallied
up the fence in upper stretch to be in contention, was slowly gaining mid stretch but could not close enough in the end for the win. QUIET VISTA trailed the
field down the backside, started to lengthen his stride circling tiring horses two furlongs out, closed well in the four path turning for home and put in a good
late run to capture third in the end. AGILE DANCER assumed command inside four furlongs from the finish, continued to be hounded outside by the winner
on the turn, was collared by challengers on either side at the furlong pole and faded late holding on for a minor share. BLASITO stalked near the rear on the
fence down the backside, offered only a mild rally on the fence throughout the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive. STREET MAX settled four wide
near the rear down the backstretch, couldn't get interested running outside of rivals on the turn and made no impression running to the wire. MR. DE broke
in some at the start, tracked three wide watching the contesting front duo into the turn, was ridden to go after the top pair at the quarter marker, offered little
response at the top of the stretch and faltered at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
BIG INVESTMENT moved to the lead after the opening three-sixteenths, set the pace racing inside, was well clear past mid-stretch and just lasted under an
all out drive. COACH ABERNATHY broke just a bit awkwardly, settled inside, shifted out leaving the turn entering upper stretch six deep, ground on to gain
steadily on the winner but just missed. ROOKIE RADAR attended the pace from outside, pressed into the turn, kept on in the stretch. SCENIC HOLIDAY
switched off the inside racing toward the back and in the two to three path heading into the turn, urged along from the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into
upper stretch and gained some. SPIRAL STORM was lightly bumped at the break, tracked from inside, urged along to chase, improved position willingly
late. IT WORKED stalked from outside going three wide on the turn, was within range and loomed a threat in upper stretch but flattened out, was vanned off.
GROOM LAKE was in just a tad tight at the start, raced at the back three to four wide into the turn, swung eight wide out of that bend, needed more. SILENT
LUCIDITY was outpaced and unable to threaten. BENLION bumped a rival lightly at the start, raced near the rail inside foes and failed to rally.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED MOMENT rated kindly ahead of the rest of the field tracking the loose frontrunner at the half, took up the chase at the two furlong marker,
assumed command in upper stretch and had enough left to hold off the outside challenger in the late stages of the race. FOREST STAR settled in the two
path between rivals tracking at the half, kept pace with the winner while closing in on the leader at the two furlong marker, loomed the threat outside in the
four path as they straightened out for the drive but needed more in the final furlong to threaten the winner late. ROCK BULLET was brushed by an outside
rival on the break, settled near the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, advanced up the rail smartly on the turn, shifted outside off the faltering
leader at the top of the lane and showed good energy to close in to be a clear third at the finish. GLENHOLME settled in mid pack three wide outside at the
half, labored four deep travelling on the turn, could not find another gear to threaten in upper stretch and had to settle for a small share in the end. FOUR K
FORCE shot to the front leaving the chute, was loose on the lead opening up down the backside, began to shorten stride at the quarter pole and retreated
through the field in the stretch. TALL BOY JOEL broke inwards at the start, trailed the field down the backstretch, could not keep pace with runners through
the turn and was not a presence running to the wire.

SILENT MIRACLE tracked from inside just off the leaders, angled five wide turning for home, was carried out late by a drifting rival having taken a narrow
lead and just held. JUSTIN'S WAY tracked mid-pack with good position racing two to three wide, angled six wide into upper stretch, was carried out in mid-
to late-stretch, kept on but just missed. LA BELLEZA NEGRA broke well but relinquished the early lead to stalk just off the pacesetter, went three wide on
the turn, bid and took the lead by the top of the stretch, drifted out late and was outfinished. ALLEGORICAL was forced four to five wide on the turn, shifted
in once in the stretch and ran on. BET N WIN broke just a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, steadily advanced inside late up the backstretch, saved ground
on the turn, evened out in the drive. GIANT ONE raced off the inside and failed to menace. TEMPO MADNESS bumped the outer rival at the start, moved
forward inside to take the lead past the five-eighths, set the pace with pressure from an outside rival, gave way. WORKIN OUT pursued the leaders from
outside just in behind three to four wide, failed to rally. NIKKI NOOTS was bumped at the break, ridden along early while bringing up the rear, was never
near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
TYSON took command from the start, was reined in to get a breather while still dictating the pace at the half, repelled challenges midway on the far turn and
was let out a notch in upper stretch and drew away convincingly in the end. STANLEY HOUSE broke out at the start, settled well in midfield between horses
entering the far turn, made a bold move with runners on either side at the quarter pole to bid as they turned for home but could not threaten the winner in
mid stretch and had to settle for second best. FULL EXTREME was allowed to settle early stalking near the rear down the backstretch, picked up the pace
circling around runners at the quarter marker, seven wide at the top of the lane was gaining momentum for the drive and closed well to passing weary foes
to be a clear third at the finish. RED LINE OVERDRIVE tracked the winner inside down the backstretch, waited behind the front pair with five sixteenths left
to run looking for a seam to appear, found clear running room on the fence as they straightened out for the run to the wire but could only finish up evenly for
the drive. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed the to the half, seeing a slow front pace made an early outside move four wide to force the running into the far
turn and gave way between rivals as they turned for home. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY tracked three wide in the early stages of the race behind the frontrunning
winner, engaged for the top spot midway on the far turn outside, was repelled turning for home and faltered between in mid stretch. SUNRISE DRIVE
settled inside near the back into the first turn, remained on the fence saving ground down the backside, was hard ridden midpoint on the far turn, offered
little run and could not reach contention in the stretch.

Footnotes
NADIABIZNIZ set the pace racing off the rail in the two path, drifted out a bit turning for home and again later in the stretch but well clear, held safe under
moderate urging. COURTINGCOURTNEY dwelt at the start spotting the field man lengths, advanced to be in behind and closer heading into the turn,
angled seven wide coming out of that bend, kept on to get up for place. CLIFF'S HEAD stalked the eventual winner three wide, was no match and lost
second late. ZIPPITY DAY settled between runners mid-division, came out five wide turning for home then shifted back in and kept on but needed more.
CHARLOTTE'S SILVER was slow to gather, advanced inside up the backstretch, evened out in the lane. REINS OF PURPLE dropped back early and failed
to rally. ITS A BIRDIE stalked four wide, faded and was not persevered with late. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
COOL KISS had a good spot tracking outside in the second flight entering the turn, was in contention four wide with runners on either side as they turned for
home, stubbornly dug in with a sixteenth remaining to pull off the victory in a gutsy stretch effort. MAD MOCHA broke in and hit the gate at the start trailing
early, began to rally midpoint outside on the turn, loomed five wide into the stretch, battled on the outside brushed by the winner at the furlong marker and
just missed at the wire. PALACE VIEW (IRE) tracked in the two path leaving the chute, angled in to the rail nearing the five eighths marker to settle inside
waiting behind the contesting leaders through the turn, shifted to be three wide as they turned for home for clear run and was outkicked running between
horses in the final sixteenth. WAR STRATEGY led the field racing on the rail down the backstretch, repelled an outside bid at the quarter pole, opened up
some in mid stretch on the fence but could not hold off the closers in the late stages of the race. MIDWAY MISCHIEF hounded the frontrunner down the
backside on the outside, battled for the lead midway on the turn two off the fence and faltered between foes in upper stretch. OCTOBER FROST was in tight
on the rail nearing the five eighths pole, was steadied, trailed the field afterwards and could not recover enough after that to pose a threat in the stretch
drive. STEWARDS INQUIRY NEARING THE FIVE EIGHTHS POLE INVOLVING #1 OCTOBERS FROST AND #2 PALACE VIEW RESULTED IN #2
PALACE VIEW BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 MAD MOCHA AND #6 COOL
KISS THROUGH THE STRETCH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

C C'S KINGDOM settled in behind the leaders racing off the inside, moved nearer the rail on the turn while advancing, bid inside in mid-stretch and kicked
clear. CHAIRMAN BOB tracked in behind, raced mostly three to four wide, kept on for the place. HALLIE'S HERO was bumped at the start, advanced
inside, moved out, was within striking distance in upper stretch but outkicked. STORMY SOUL moved forward and set the pace racing just off the rail with
outside pressure, lacked the needed late kick. COMBATIVE was encouraged along five to six wide on the turn racing outside mid-pack, ran on. DIXIE
GIANT was forced wide going five to seven deep on the turn, came out a bit further in upper stretch for room, needed more. LION'S GOLDENHEART raced
off the inside part of the track in behind and went evenly. SEGUIMI chased from outside four wide early, weakened. WENJACK pursued from inside, faded.
GENDRAGON bumped a rival at the start, pressed the pace three wide and between, weakened. WHERE'S ANTHONY was not a factor.
