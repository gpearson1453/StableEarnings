Footnotes
JULIUS THE GREAT emerged the leader leaving the backstretch, turned back a challenge from PRESS GANG and held firm. PRESS GANG broke alertly,
lodged an all out bid inside but was unable to get by the eventual winner. DUNE D'ORO chased four wide, dueled outside of ALL THAT GOLD into the
stretch and edged clear late stretch. ALL THAT GOLD sat in striking position early, was joined by DUNE D'ORO into the stretch, and gave way grudgingly
late. PARLEY STREET failed to threaten. FINAL SAY showed little.

Footnotes
BURNLEY saved ground while showing the way, responded to looming threat from IMPACTO and DECOY near the quarter pole, and edged clear under
light handling. IMPACTO broke inward into NORTHERN JEWEL, hustled inside leaving the backstretch, gained quickly through the turn, angled out after the
quarter pole, was unable to reach the eventual winner and held on for place honors. DECOY vied outside, opted to sit just off the pace, dueled outside of
IMPACTO through the stretch, and was out-finished for place. ANOTHERFORBROOKS lacked a kick that needed. H K MELODY fanned three wide into the
opening turn, and lodged a mild rally. NEXT JOURNEY lagged early, and lacked a bid. NORTHERN JEWEL bumped leaving, and trailed the field
throughout.

CHRIS'S COMMAND dueled for the early lead, was under steady pressure into the lane, and held safely. AL REICHERT was outsprinted to the opening
turn, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole marker, and gave a final game effort but was unable to reach the winner. ZURI RISASI unhurried early,
gained closer order from the rail, and held on for show. REMAIN CALM sat mid-pack and improved late. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK prompted three wide
leaving the backstretch, and faded through the stretch. RUN ROSSCO RUN raced four to five wide, lacked a response into the lane and faded. JOKERS R
WILD trailed the field, and passed tiring rival. CLEVER CONNECTION chased and tired.

Footnotes
FLORAL sat in striking position, pressed the issue alongside THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI into the final turn, gave her at the head of the stretch, and won going
away. QUICK DIAL settled inside early, shifted outside into the lane, and closed steadily to secure a place position. HENRY'S GAMBLE rallied belatedly for
show. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI broke alertly, responded to a challenge from FLORAL but was no match in the stretch and gave way. EXACTLY hustled
away, encountered traffic, lost ground, and offered a mild rally. GO MAMA raced four wide entering the opening turn, and lacked a closing response.
MAGICAL LADY showed little. LOAD ABROAD crowded leaving, chased the dueling pacesetters, and wilted.
