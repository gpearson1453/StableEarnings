Footnotes
STAY STRONG settled into the second flight and trekked the two path through the opening half, swung to three wide at upper stretch, locked into a heated
stretch duel, and won the nod at wire for the score. J R ORCHESTRATE was unurried through the opening half and trailed the field through the first two
calls, angled out to five wide at upper stretch, dueled the length of the homestretch, and was nipped by slimmest of margins at the finish. HOMEGROWN
LEGEND saved ground through the first turn while giving case from the second flight, closed the gap on leader along the backstretch, gained brief command
near the quarter pole, but could not fend off the dueling duo in final furlong. GOSPEL GRAYSTONE rushed from outset and established a comfortable lead
onto the backstretch, was challenged near the half pole, relished command nearing the quarter pole, and weakened in the crucial stages of contest.

RED RIVER WITCH hustled from outset and led the field into the homestretch, was headed near the eighth pole, and refused to lose the stretch duel for the
score. ITSONLYMONEYHONEY stalked the pacesetter through the opening half while saving ground, locked into a stretch duel t top of lane, but was
outdueled. PAYDIEM chased the pacesetter from a three wide stance, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but proved no match for top pair in final
furlong. ORTS DREAM gave chase from a three path pose around the first turn and along the backstretch before angling wide at upper and stretch and
lacking a needed rally to improve placing. LIL DITTY'S KITTY was reserved in the early stages, tucked to save ground midway through the opening bend,
maintained that line into the homestretch, but lacked a rail rally to improve position. FOREIGN CREATION trailed from outset and was no factor.

EXCETERA stalked the pacesetter along the backstretch, advanced to be in concert for the lead at upper stretch, locked into a stretch duel and kicked clear
in final sixteenth for the victory. MARIA ELENA Y. G zoomed from outset and led the field into the turn, was on even terms through the bend, headed at
upper stretch, then failed to match strides with eventual winner in final sixteenth. DIXIELAND CANDY settled into the second flight, chased the pacesetting
duo around the bend from a two path stance, and bested the rest while proving no match for top pair. GOSPEL CARLOTTA came away awkwardly, chased
rivals into homestretch and failed to gain on leaders in closing strides. J LOVE was unhurried, trailed the field, traveled wide and failed to menace.

SHE'S FIRE AND ICE pressed te pace from a two path stance, was in concert with that rival at upper stretch, then inched clear in final sixteenth for the
score. BID FOR POWER rushed from outset and led the field through the half from a ground saving stance, was on even terms at the top of lane, and gave
way to that rival in the stretch duel. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO established a ground saving stance and settled into the second flight through the opening
half, maintained the inside line into the homestretch and got up for show. STRONG WOMAN hustled from outset to press the pace from a three wide pose,
rated close up at upper stretch, then failed to sustain the bid in closing stages. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY failed to threaten from a back rated stance.
FETCHING FURY rated back and was never involved or near the top three.

CALI stalked the pacesetter from a two path pose along eh backstretch, advanced to be on even terms through the closing turn, locked into a stretch duel
and won the nod at wire. FREE SPIRITED showed reserve in early going, advanced on the leaders inside the half pole, rated three wide at upper stretch,
and was outdueled in final furlong. CREES VALENTYME settled into the second flight around the opening bend, saved ground through the half, and finished
willingly for the show. SHEZONEZESTREET saved ground from a back rated stance through the opening half before angling out at upper stretch to no avail.
SCRAPPY PATCH was unhurried and chased rivals from a back rated pose before passing tiring foe in late strides. MUSTANGMAGNA trekked wide shortly
after the start, gained command into the backstretch, rated close up as the inner most rival at upper stretch, then eclipsed in closing stages.

CRAZY LOVER showed interest in early command and set pace in concert from between rivals, locked into a stretch duel at upper stretch and proved best
in the end. DOCTOR TINK rated close up shortly after start, trekked three wide amongst the leaders around the bend, was on even terms at upper strtch,
but was outdueled in final sixteenth. CINCO STEVE pressed the pace as the widest of four rivals along the backstretch and through the turn before finishing
evenly to secure the show. MIRANDEN came away alertly and set the pace in tandem as the inner most rival of four abreast, rated close up at upper
stretch, and gave way to dueling duo in final stages. DANCING DEVIL lacked a needed rally after trailing rivals and giving chase from an inside stance.

TUATHA gained command on first stride, saved ground throughout and never relished for a gate to wire score. SEATTLE WILDCAT broke alertly and
trekked close up while three wide along the backstretch and around the bend, then finished a clear second but was no match for winner in closing stages.
INDIAN ACES pressed the early pace from a two path stance, tucked to the inside near the quarter pole, then weakened along the inside in the final furlong.
TOTAL RUSH showed reserve and rated well back into the turn before improving position in the late going. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT was unhurried early,
advanced on leaders as the widest of all rivals around the bend, but tired in late strides. FLASHY GAIL failed to respond to urging after stalking the pace
from a four wide pose in the opening half.

EARS TO ME showed reserve through the opening half, was roused inside the half pole and advanced on the leaders with a wide trip around closing bend
before drawing clear of all challengers in final sixteenth. KODALINE settled into mid pack and chased the front runners from a two path pose, angled out
near the quarter pole, and finished willingly to procure the place. DOMINANT OKIE stalked the early pacesetter from a four wide stance, rated close up
three wide at upper stretch, but couldnt fend off the rally of eventual winner in closing strides. HOPGUN saved ground while giving chase from the second
flight, swung three wide at upper stretch, tucked to rail near the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a rail rally in final furlong. DENS DEVILLE lacked a late bid
after pressing the pace from between rivals and rating close up at upper stretch. PAPA BILL flashed early foot and led the field through the opening half
while saving ground before tiring in the late going. CAPTAIN COMEBACK trailed the field through the opening turn, closed gap on leaders nearing the half
pole, then faded in homestretch.

Footnotes
JACKS SPRING BREAK stalked the frontrunner from a three path pose for the opening half, rated on front end at top of the lane and kicked clear in final
furlong. NOMOREMRNICEGUY showed reserve through the opening bend, closed gap on leaders along the backstretch, was in tight nearing the midway
point, trekked wide at upper stretch and finished with good late kick to procure the place. WAVERUNNER settled into a three wide pose around the opening
turn, advanced on leaders along the backstretch, rated three wide and within striking distance at upper stretch, then finished evenly to hold the show. GOT
MOJO flashed early speed and led the field onto and along the backstretch before giving way to closing rivals near the three eighths pole. LIMBO'S
PROMISE pressed the early pace from a two path pose, gained brief command near the midway point, then retreated along the rail in closing strides. JOHN
ALLEN settled in behind the leaders while establishing a ground saving stance, maintained that line throughout and was no threat in the end.
CHOCOLATEICECREAM trailed from outset and passed tiring foe in late going. TARUCA failed to menace while giving chase from a two path position.
