LIGHTNING TONES settled off the pace outside, cruised up three wide around the turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
FIRST TEAM dueled along the rail to the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but kept trying inside and held clear of the rest. HARD TO HANDLE
raced in range two and three wide, lacked the needed rally but churned on for the show. PACIFIC LEGEND chased the pace inside and lacked a closing
bid. DANGER RANGER failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CAPTURE MI dueled two wide to upper stretch and retreated through the lane.

AVATAL HERO stalked in the two path, was roused from the rail around the turn and swung out to the six path into the lane, ran on to bid into the final
furlong, took the lead just before the sixteenth pole, and held off an outer foe late to win. GIRL BYE brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, tracked
between foes in the four path, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place. BULLOCK prompted the pace in the five path,
bid in the four path around the turn, took the lead while in the five path passing the eighth pole, but was caught by a pair of outer rivals to show. EXTRA
INDY brushed with an outer foe then an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path, tipped out to the six path into the lane, but was no factor. ANGELIC
GAL chased in the two path but was no threat from the four path in the stretch. STRIKE JAK brushed with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the three
path but gaveway into the lane.

CHENTI raced off the pace three wide, tipped further out in upper stretch and finished well. ACAMAR set the pace in the three path around the first turn,
angled in nearing the far turn, led to midstretch and kept on inside to save the show. BOBBY'S CANDY saved ground off the pace and rallied belatedly.
FROSTY THE SOLDIER prompted the pace in the four path around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, was not urged while appearing to try to
lug in throughout the stretch then steadied when in tight late. DREAM ON BABY tracked the pace two and three wide and faded in the lane. TUMIGA was
shut off at the start, saved ground well back and never threatened. IMPOSTER SYNDROME stumbled badly at the start, raced four wide and made little

SLIM SLOW SLIDER stalked in the three path, took over under confident handling midway around turn, was coaxed from the five path into the stretch, and
driven clear. SEPTEMBERTEN was bumped by an inner foe just after the start, tracked in the six path, was cued from the eight path into the lane, gradually
drifted out thru the lane, but kept on for place. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY had a slow start and trail in the five path, fanned wide into the stretch, and ran on while
drifting out for show. AMERICAN PRINCE broke in and brushed with an inner foe, then went out and bumped an outer foe just after, prompted the pace in
the five path but flattened from the six path in the stretch. NATURE BOY broke out and brushed an outer foe, set the pace in the four path, lost the lead in
the two path midway around the turn, and gaveway. SHA TIN got pinched at the start and raced wellback around the two path early, but was no menace.
