late, could not contain the winner. IMMORAL away in good order, fell back, came four wide out of the turn, rallied for the show. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL off
a step slow, raced back while saving ground through the turn, improved position a bit down the lane. TOPF ROAD RULES with the early pace along the

resistance to the runner up past the furlong marker and faltered. MR CREED off a step slow, raced back while three wide, made little impact through the
stretch. PITTSBURGH in mid pack while racing just off the inside, faded. ABUNDANT stalked the lead back while racing three wide, backed up through the

along late for the show, no threat to the top two. RELEASED cleared to the inside to set the early pace, continued to vie through the turn along the rail,
offered little resistance to the top two the final furlong, caught late for the show. GINSBURNED off a bit slow, moved up to chased in the two path, dueled
through the turn, weakened stretch. POP'S BISCUIT in the main group while three wide and between foes, had little for the drive. PRINCIPE GUILHERME

Footnotes
BETTYS CASH in mid pack while racing outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting when making a mild advance, engaged the leader nearing the
furlong marker, wore that rival down to be edging clear. MIDNIGHT TAXES sprinted clear along the inside to show the way up the backstretch, continued to
set the pace through the turn, gave grudgingly to the winner until late, narrowly saved the place. REEF'S DESTINY forwardly placed along the inside, in
traffic through the turn on the rail, roused when clear past the furlong marker, not enough late for the place. AFLEET SKY floated out soon after start, three
wide into the turn, four wide exiting, displayed some mild late interest to improve a bit. AL'S ROMEO runner up for a half off the inside, weakened. DATA
STORM went evenly while racing off the inside. YOU VEE CEE in the second flight while racing three wide, weakened in the drive. EUROBELIEVER five
wide through the turn, had nothing for the drive. CHUPAPI MUNYAYO last away, remained always back.

Footnotes
TONKA WARRIOR back off the pace while racing in the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, outside bid upper stretch, edged clear late under firm
handling. PRESIDENTIAL narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch, saved ground second turn, gave ground
stubbornly to the winner late. PATS PROPERTY pressed the runner up to that one's outside, vied between rivals through upper stretch, could not match the
top two late, narrowly gained the nod for the show. EASTSIDE COOL within striking distance inside, two path for the lane, lacked a winning kick. RATED R
SUPERSTAR trailed early in lacking speed, swung out five wide into the stretch, displayed a mild amount of late interest. ROYAL ACT in mid pack while off
the inside, had little for the drive. OUT RUN'M off a step slow, trailed most of the way to be always outrun.

Footnotes
MADMARTIGAN in mid pack while three wide early, came four wide for the drive, shifted out widest and accelerated inside the furlong marker, late surge to
be in time. CHICAGO'S GRAY broke on top, sprinted clear to set the pace, extended that advantage through the turn and into the lane, an even larger
advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, all out to hold the place. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER off a step slow, raced back while well
out in the strip, came five wide into the lane, late rally, also closed on the runner up, missed that position. RUNNIN' BLOCK off slowly, void of speed toward
the inside, steered out a bit midway on the turn, improved position in finding his best stride too late. RING BEARER lacked early foot, two path through the
turn, went one paced through the lane. RUDIANO behind the pace while in the two path, came up empty for the drive. FOUR DICE broke back, trailed early
in lacking speed, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. RACING IN MY HEART reluctant to load, settled outside behind the pace,
four wide through tired down the lane. PIKACHU void of speed while five wide, fell further back to trail by late in the turn, picked off a couple of faltering foes
while not a factor. PROCHARGER forwardly placed four a half while four wide, backed up through the lane. GUARDED in mid pack along the, began to
retreat before a half. HUEY DUEY chased the leader for a half in the three path, stopped in the drive, jogged in.

Footnotes
SMOOTH SCAT forwardly placed from the start, stalked three wide into the turn, outside bid, took over, drove clear. OTTOMAN EMPIRE back off the pace
in the two path, dove to the inside nearing the furlong marker, rallied to be clear for the place. MIRI A COINCIDENCE within striking distance while off the
inside under stout restraint early, set down for the drive, nod for show while between horses at the wire. MY NOAH took command after breaking in good
order, clear through the turn, began to weaken when headed by the winner entering the stretch. PEPPERONIKID void of speed, swung out widest for the
drive, staged a belated rally while well out in the strip. REUP broke back, lacked speed toward the inside, angled out four wide turning for home, improved
position. KOSELIO bobbled then broke in to bother WESTHEIMER STREET, was straightened to race in mid pack, four wide through the turn, continued
one paced down the lane in lacking a closing response. WESTHEIMER STREET bothered and was checked up at the start, raced back and three wide,
failed to menace. TRAFFIC CONTROL in main body along the inside, failed to rally. KRUSIN ROCKET forwardly placed for a half, tired from those early
efforts. MAKE YOUR DESTINY fell back after the start, five wide into the turn, was always outrun. STORM APPROACHING reared and unseated rider at
the break.

three wide, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. PEACE DOG lacked speed, angled out to be five wide turning into the stretch,
along for the show well out in the strip. TABLE MONEY in the second flight while along the inside, weakened in the drive. KINFOLK broke out, remained
back while racing three wide. MACHO ROCCO chased the winner for a half in the three path then gave way in the drive. PARTYINTHESTREETS floated

no more with the winner the final furlong, clear of the others. EDGE TO EDGE moved off the rail early in the turn, steered out a bit more to be three wide for
the slowly getting to the runner up late. TUT'S REVENGE off a step slow, well back while inside, improved position with some mild late interest. WALKER'S
WIN off the pace, four wide turn, went evenly through the lane. JOE FRAZIER in the two path behind the pace, had nothing for the drive. MORELLO broke
back, trailed through the turn, remained back.

Footnotes
TEJAS lacked speed, continued back up the backstretch, blocked, steadied midway on the final turn, strongly split foes soon after, continued with good
resolve to be up in time in a well timed ride. TAHOE RUN settled off the pace toward the inside early, angled four wide into the lane, collared the leader past
the furlong marker, took over, nailed late. MIDNIGHT PRANKS took command soon after the start inside, continued to show the way the middle half, briefly
raced on equal terms with the runner up then faltered with less than a furlong remaining. SOYBEAN MAN bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, moved to
the inside when improving late second turn, flattened out in the drive. AUTO GLIDE in the second flight while racing off the inside, came up empty for the
drive. EMPYREAL SHADOW fell back to trail after the start, four out to six wide turning for home, improved upper then failed to sustain that energy the final
furlong. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR pressed the leader early in the two path, fell back after a half, evenly drive. NIGHT EFFECT restless post parade and
loading into the gate, broke mid pack, fell back and turned in an uninspired effort. SALINE RIVER five to four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide and
in some traffic second turn, remained back. RANSAM PAYNTER chased the leader early off the inside, gave way. GOLDEN BANDIT five wide into the first
turn, five again in the second bend, fell back, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
WILLOW CREEK ROAD never far back off the inside, ranged up to challenge and take over three wide into the stretch, roused when straightened for home,
held the runner up safe late. KING PEANUT in the second flight, moved out to be four wide first turn, relaxed nicely in the run up the backstretch, four wide
again second when moving smartly, came on the outside the winner into the lane, stalled, late surge to be coming late. DINNER AT CRUMPIES mid pack,
moved closer into the far turn, in some traffic early in that bend, three side into the lane, rallied through traffic to finish up willingly. GAR HOLE in the second
flight off the inside, in some traffic second turn lacked the needed kick in the lane when clear. MAHOMEY broke well and sprinted clear, pace toward the
inside, vied second turn, began to gradually weaken when headed midway on the that bend. MAN IN THE CAN within striking distance off the inside, lacked
the needed closing response. BANDIT POINT lacked speed, passed tiring rivals while never a serious threat. ONE TEN STADIUM broke back, lacked
speed, made little impact. NAVY SEAL within striking distance for six furlongs, came up empty for the drive. SKYPED pinched hard start, remained always
back in failing to menace. PROMISING SHOES void of early foot, was never a threat. MORE THAN BLESSED broke out to bump SKYPED, settled in the
main body, had nothing for the drive. ALLO ENRY was finished early. BIG SUCCESS unprepared for the start, was detained by the assistant starter,
unseated rider. AFTER A STEWARD'S INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, BIG SUCCESS WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER.

Footnotes
HELLORHIGHWATER close from the start, took over past the wire the first time, continued to show the way, drew out through the lane, under steady
handling. TIGER MOON never far back outside, closer into the third turn, could do nothing with the winner in the drive, no match for the winner. NEPAL UP
raced back, continued to race mid pack into the far turn, rallied outside, finished up best of the rest. POLTERER bothered at the break, was straightened,
forwardly placed, chased the middle three quarters, had little left for the stretch. MOLIERE void of early foot, improved position without posing a serious
threat. BACKGATE RED void of early foot, continued to lag, also improved position while also never dangerous. MULBERRY STREET one paced
throughout through in lacking a closing response. FETCHS BRAHM in mid pack early, retreated after a mile. GOLD BUCKLE was finished after a half.
BACK BEAT bothered, off a step slow, used to move up to contest the pace, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the field. GENERATOR finished
early, far back, distanced.
