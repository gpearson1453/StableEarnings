Footnotes
J B GRAY broke sharp and was able to set the pace while being pressured by another foe, saved ground while racing along the rail, was un hurried through
the turn and fell back, was asked at the sixteenth pole came back on late, battled with the leader in deep stretch and was victorious. SILKY'S DANCE
settled off the early pace, was given time to find his stride while racing in the three path, was cued at the quarter pole where he responded with a nice turn of
foot, came along the side of another competitor, battled with that one, took the lead, was challenged by another foe who slipped up the rail late, battled
again for the win but came up short today. ROCK STAR ALEX laid just off the pace early, took the lead after the half mile pole from the three path, was
challenged by another foe moving into the stretch, battled in the upper stretch and faded. SOUTH AL SPARKY was off slow, raced along the outside, was
asked at the half mile pole, advanced into good striking position then faltered late.

the quarter pole where she waws asked and responded with a turn of foot, was able to move up the rail and draw off. SWEET LITTLE ROSE raced off the
pace from mid pack in the eight path, was asked at the quarter pole, responded well, closed in the deep furlong ground, drifted out late but was able to hold
on to second. SMILING ANGEL was off slow, was unhurried and settled off the pace from the nine path, was asked to start gaining ground after the half mile
pole, responded and was kept to task around the turn and into the stretch while passing tired rivals at the quarter pole, kept the drive going but could not get
up n time today. AFLEET CHARLENE was sent to the lead out of the gates, set the pace while racing along the fence, showed the way into the the furlong
ground where she tired. CAT B CAUSE was off a bit slow, settled into the rear of the field early while racing seven wide, moved closer into contention at the
three eights pole, was seven wide at the quarter pole and into the upper stretch, was encouraged and raced past rivals that were to the inside but was not
enough. FIELD OF LIGHTS was mid pack six wide, settled in hands early, was edged out a bit at the three eighths pole made a mild bid, at the quarter pole

Footnotes
HELAIRE broke on top, took the early lead along the inside in the two path, was joined by an outside rival, raced with this rival applying pressure from the
outside for the first furlong, then matched strides from the half mile pole through the tun and into the stretch, battled on down to the last furlong where
HELAIRE finally shook his rival and drew away for the win. INTO WISHING broke into a stalking position, pressured the early leader from the outside, drew
along the side of the leaders by the half mile marker, matched strides through the turn, battled into the lane but gave way late. FAR BEYOND stalked the
leaders from the three path, put in a mild bid at the quarter pole but was not enough. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY no factor. COHERE never involved.

Footnotes
SALUTE NOW stalked the early leader from the rail, moved up at the half briefly challenged for the lead, shook that competitor, drew away through the turn
and held on for the win. DUDE DROP KID broke a bit slow, was urged into mid pack while being five wide, tucked in behind horses through the first turn well
off the leaders, was kept after and encouraged to steadily close ground along the back side, was in contention at the three eighths pole, was kept to task
into the stretch, continued to close in on the early leader but ran out of room and settled for second. WESTERN STAR stalked the early pace while being
settled in hands from the two path, was gently urged to close ground at the half mile marker, continued pushing forward through the turn safely held off the
rest of the filed while maintaining third. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN took back early, settled in hands along the rail, moved up into the middle of the field by the
half mile marker but made no improvement. AMAVI was well off the pace early on, took a ground saving trip until the three eighths pole, edged further out by
the five sixteenth pole, continued to close passing tired rivals. YOU YOUR DADDY SON set the early pace, was challenged for the lead at the half mile
marker, chased after the leader and faded. KINGPRIN was no factor. MR. BUTCH WOMBLE was forwardly placed early, was asked to advance at the three
eighths pole to no avail.

Footnotes
BELL PEPPER settled off the pace along the rail early, stalked through the backside and into the turn, tucked behind the leader leaving the turn, after the
quarter pole, slipped down to the rail and was able to pass the early leader undetected and drew away. BROADWAY PEARL broke a bit slow, raced mid
pack from the four path, angled out at the half mile marker, circled the field with a nice turn of foot while being seven wide, entered the upper stretch nine
wide continued to close and gain ground with every stride was within striking distance but was challenged by a horse along the rail and did not have enough
today. VALENTINE ANGEL vied for the lead and set the pace, attended the pace from the two and three path uncontested until the five sixteenth pole, was
collared by a challenger and battled for a few strides and tired in the lane. CORONA DEL MAR showed early speed and was right off of the early leader
while racing in the three path, stayed on in the top flight through the turn and to the quarter pole, had trouble switching leads and tired in the lane.
CHATAIN'S EAGLE broke slow and was allowed to settle off the pace while finding her stride, raced eight wide early, was asked to move at the half mile
pole where she responded well passing horses from the three and four path in the turn, edged out at the quarter pole into the upper stretch, where she was
driven and encouraged and continued to make head way down the lane but it was not enough today . MILU ROCKET settled into the second flight just
behind the early leaders while racing from the four path, advanced at the three eighths pole continued to hold that position until the sixteenth pole and tired.
DON'T BLINK TWICE sowed good early speed but then dropped back to last early on, raced in the four path the whole trip and was able to pass tired rivals
at the quarter pole. SENSING GOLD showed early speed while racing from the five path, angled into the three path while being driven to stay with the early
leaders, was being encouraged through the turn to continue on with the leaders while trying to get out, was wide upper stretch and failed to switch leads
then tired. COURT COSTS flashed early speed from the outside and fell back. SEE YA BYE was never a factor.

into the stretch where IRONIIT was able to finally shake the inside rival but still had to battle with the outside challenger until deep into the furlong ground,
was kept to task and was able to out finish the out side challenger and was up for the win. OURPERFECTPRINCESS rated just off the leaders hip from the
four path, stayed on with the early leaders until the seven sixteenth pole, challenged, battled through the stretch, settled for second while racing a game
race. REBECCA G vied for the lead from the rail, stayed in company with the eventual winner through out most of the race while saving ground, challenged
for the lead and gave way. L G GIRL never involved. THEBOYZGALAXY not a factor.

Footnotes
MONARCH'S MISCHIEF settled into the second tier in the three and four path, rated until the half mile marker, edged out and advanced while being
challenged by an outside attacker, continued to gain ground through the turn and challenged for the lead at the five sixteenth pole, took command by the
quarter pole and drew clear. WHITAKER was off slow and allowed to settle in hands while finding his stride, maintained position until the half mile marker,
started to advance and gained ground at the three eighths pole still from the four path, spilt horses through the turn, angled out at the quarter pole, was set
down for the drive and was kept to ask while closing beautifully, but could not catch the leader but ran a game second. CREME DE BALI vied for the lead,
matched strides with the early leader by the six furlong pole from the three path, continued on in company setting the pace through the three eighths pole,
was challenged by an outside foe battled with that foe until deep in the furlong ground and tired late. ELUSIVE D'ORO raced along the rail from mid pack,
had a ground saving trip and maintained momentum and position but to no avail. DECLARE WAR raced mid pack early along the rail was allowed to fall
back to last, was asked to make one run while saving ground and passed tired rivals in the stretch. PAYNTED LOVER made no impact. MOUNTAIN
BREEZE raced from the four and five path, was asked at the half mile marker, circled the field at the three eighths while being six wide and tired at the
quarter pole. HELIOCHROME was never a factor.
