TARA'S TIME tracked the pace along the inside, tipped two wide and headed into action at the head of the lane, dug in determinedly and prevailed. BE
SINCERE raced off the early leaders, swung five wide entering the lane and finished strongly through the lane. STARGRAZER led the way in early stages,
continued to lead the way with a furlong left to run then got wore down late. KAMEA raced in early contention, launched a bid at the quarter pole, stayed on
three wide but had no late kick. MY FOUR POINT OH hustled up four wide around the turn and failed to stay on in the lane. KYLIES HOPE settled along the
inside, angled two wide for the drive and weakened in the lane. REVENANT raced in or near the back and never menaced.

raced near midpack and four wide around the turn, came wide into the lane and needed more for impact. WESTA WAVERLY raced off the early leaders,
hustled along two wide into the lane, gained closer contention but failed to sustain bid. MAFIA DON came away awkwardly at the start and failed to move
into contention. A. K. SAFARI raced off the pace, saved ground entering the lane and never threatened.

lead past the furlong marker and pulled away. LUCKYHOTSTUFF raced up close in early stages, launched a four wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained
response into the lane and finished second best. ESPIRIDION raced up close in the early going, launched a bid for command three furlongs from home,
took over a slim lead, continued on top into stretch run then weakened in late stages. SIMMERING raced in range near the inside, waited behind horses late
on the turn, shifted two wide for the drive and failed to kick on. DREAMINONTHENILE got bumped at the start, raced in the back and never threatened.
DONNA'S HOPE raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. READY TO GET LOUD set the early pace, came under attack from rival midway
around the turn, lost the lead and steadily faded.
