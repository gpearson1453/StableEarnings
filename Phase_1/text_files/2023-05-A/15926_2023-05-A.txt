Footnotes
MILWAUKEE BAY settled off the pace, raced in traffic early stretch then split rivals rallying late and was just up. HEART LIGHT lacked speed inside, angled
wide in the stretch and closed well. FANCY SCEPTER controlled the pace inside, led to the final sixteenth and continued willingly. SEIVER trailed briefly,
moved closer near the inside on the final turn but flattened out in the final eighth. ISLAND BELLE broke out at the start, pressed the pace outside and
weakened late. THE FURMANATOR raced just off the leaders inside then gave way after half a mile.

WITHOUT A VIEW stalked the pace three wide, took over at the three eighths pole and drew off while kept to her task. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE saved
ground early, faded on the turn, swung wide into the stretch rallying for the place. SCARF stumbled slightly at the start, advanced outside then raced evenly
late. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX trailed for half a mile then narrowed the gap without menacing. ROLIN N CONTROLIN raced within range in the two path then
flattened out in the stretch. BELLA MARIA rushed up inside after a sluggish start then stopped after half a mile. FRIEDER FANATIC dueled outside then
gave way midway on the turn.

PURRFECT MISTRESS showed good early speed to set the pace, opened up a clear lead, responded when roused, turned back a bid from the runner up
in upper stretch, drew clear under urging and coasted the final yards. PEARLBDANCING stalked the pacesetter, chased that rival on the turn, made a bid at
the top of the lane, was no match and remained clear for the place spot. RISEN CHANGE raced three wide off the pace, chased on the turn, then bested
the other rivals late to earn the show award. MISS ALEX raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. MOVING IN STEREO bobbled
at the break, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
LIVING MAGIC outrun early, moved boldly three wide on the turn, moved clear nearing the eighth pole and remained safe driving`. TROUBLED DREAMS
saved ground off the pace, angled wide into the stretch and closed well. KRISTINACHRYSALIS chased along the rail throughout and continued gamely
while no threat to the wire. SHE SPEAKS quickly sprinted away, was collared into the stretch and weakened. MII AMO was hard ridden in closest pursuit of
the pacesetter and proved empty in the stretch. SPEIGHTFUL MISS raced inside, faded on the turn and lacked a rally. MACI'S WORLD broke slowest and
raced far back throughout.
