winner inside the sixteenth pole and could not keep up while clearly second best. LIAM THE BRAVE saved ground down the backstretch and into the far
turn then moved up through the lane, from the show sport while not a threat to the top ones. SATURN BOY set the pace while under pressure into the far
turn, relinquished the lead in mid-turn then gave way into the lane. VINTAGE VINYL unhurried while off the inside was asked four wide and in the five path
through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and tired. TIZ A BEAST chased the pace from the two path into the far turn then faded. SOFT PANTS

Footnotes
LOOKING GOOD LEWIS vied for the lead while in the two path through the turn gained a clear lead inside the eighth pole, was weary late and lasted.
FOREVER LASTING chased the two rival duel through the turn when in the three path, came into the lane from the four path, had aim on the leader and
was gaining on the tiring winner late. GO FOREVER was along the inside through the turn, guided into the four path for the drive and was slowly gaining to
the wire while just gaining the show spot. LANTANA STAR was void of early speed while along the inside, continued along the rail into the lane and finished
with a rush. NINE POINTER lacked any speed while in the three path through the turn, gained momentum after straightening in the lane and was flying late.
SIR RONALDO vied for the lead two wide through the turn then weakened in the lane. SKY HIGH FIVE was in the three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the six path and never factored. STAR REVIEW was off slowly then ducked in and spotted the field some seven lengths, raced off the rail into the
lane and gained. DOC BENNETT was in the three path through the turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS PRAYER chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path with aim on the leader, caught that one
inside the eighth pole and drove past. TAY set the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from near the rail, was caught by the winner
nearing the sixteenth pole, yielded to that one and drifted out a couple of paths late after being urged left-handed. SUDDEN SHIFT raced in the three path
through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the top two while just saving the show spot. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY raced three wide through the turn
when near the back, continued in the three path into the lane then was gaining on the show rival late from the four or five path and just missed the minor
share. KINGOFTHERAINBOW chased the pacesetters from along the inside through the turn and into the lane then faded. UNBRIDLED VICTOR never a
factor while in the three or four path through the turn. CIELO BLU saved ground into the lane and tired. ROYAL ICING raced between rivals through the turn
and was done entering the lane.

start, pressed the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. BROKEN JUSTICE raced evenly. MEATLOAF'S CHANCE was bumped and squeezed
back at the start.
