backstretch and the turn, came five wide into the lane and was outfinished for the show award. KIDYOUNOT was three wide into the first turn, set a

OUT OF AMMO stumbled at the start, then moved up four wide to duel for command by the half mile marker, then made a two wide bid on the turn to draw
clear, then was confronted by STASSI by the furlong marker and dug in gamely to hold on to prove best under a drive. STASSI was allowed to settle early
towards the inside, shifted out and made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly nearing the furlong marker but hung in the final furlong, second best.
WISE CHOICE pressed the early pace three wide and then fell back on the turn and then gained the show award late. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH was bumped
at the start, reserved early, came five wide into the lane and improved position late. INDY'S GOLDEN GIRL tracked the pace and came three wide into the

Footnotes
OUR RONNY ALAN stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole and drew away in the lane to prove best under a mild drive.
WARRIOR'S CAUSE broke in at the start, then rushed up to set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed nearing the furlong marker and was no
match for the winner while second best. GURT'S WARRIOR tracked the pace two to three wide and had no kick, held show award. FIERCE AND STRONG
chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed bid. ALLIWORSHIPNADORE was fractious in the gate, then was on the inside early and passed the tiring
rivals. HE AROSE was off slowly, raced wide early, then found best stride late. FLETCHER STATION failed to menace. RAY OF LIGHT was reluctant to
load and then was not a threat. BARN SWALLOW chased the early pace on the inside and stopped.
