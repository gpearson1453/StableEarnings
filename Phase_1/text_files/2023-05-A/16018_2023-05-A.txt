Footnotes
KALIK went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch and powered home with impressive strides to prove much the best. SCRAMBLE saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, drafted in the
two path around the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and earned the
place. C'EST MAGNIFIQUE saved ground on the first turn, dropped back late on that bend, was reserved off the rail down the backstretch, rounded the far
turn in the two path, was roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. OPERATION TORCH was away awkwardly,
saved ground while in hand on the first turn, became rank when a foe dropped back in front later on that bend, checked while extremely rank at the
seven-eighths, dragged his way forward under stout restraint with six furlongs to run, saved ground on the final turn, was asked near the quarter-pole and
came up empty. CLASSIC CREATION stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. LIFE AND LIGHT was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went
three then four wide on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths then carried six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

HIGHER QUALITY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing briefly at the three-eighths and advanced tucking three wide near the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, took over command near the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages. SALUTE
TO AMERICA chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got set down taking the two path into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. BINGO JOHN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tipped out three then four
wide floating R BOY CHEEKUM briefly five wide at that station, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go now three wide, swung four wide into upper
stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. MAJOR SPIN reluctant to load prior to the start, established the front after the start and showed
the way four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, was lightly coaxed along nearing the quarter pole, the rider
peering back to see who was coming, took the inside route into upper stretch yielding command to HIGHER QUALITY without resistance and weakened to
the end. R BOY CHEEKUM chased four wide down the backstretch, had BINGO JOHN tip out from the inside near the nine-sixteenths and was floated five
wide briefly into the turn, tucked three wide through that bend coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and tired.
EXXTOP chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and made no impact. ONE MORE SCORE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tired.

Footnotes
MARKETSEGMENTATION prompted the pace on the outside of the leader in the two path, took over when asked three wide into upper stretch then kicked
clear, responded well under the crop into the final sixteenth and was placed under a strong hand-ride from that point to the wire while much the best.
CONSUMER SPENDING was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, spun into the
stretch in the two path then angled out, pursued the winner in the drive and proved no match while willingly earning the place. SURPRISINGLY was rated on
the outside but with the benefit of cover, went three wide around the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and just
missed the place while able to get the show. VERONICA GREENE was reserved on the inside, saved ground around the turn, came under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. CONTEMPORARY ART stalked the pace on the outside while rated without cover, was asked three wide on the
turn, dropped back into upper stretch then drifted in some and came up empty. EVVIE JETS went to the front, showed the way on the inside with some
company to her outside, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and faltered. FINEST WORK was rated off the rail with cover, rounded the turn
in the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

MONDEGO (GB) lightly coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled through sensible splits, got let out taking the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under challenge from RIGHT TO WIN and rebuffed that foe a furlong out before edging clear to the finish kept to task.
SGT. PEPPER two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to just get up for the place honors in the final jumps to the wire. RIGHT TO WIN (IRE) tracked three then two wide in
closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge a
furlong out, got repelled and shaken off by the top one inside that station, then got out-finished in the late stages and forced to settle for the show honors.
SPINZAR three then two wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. FERAL'S JOY tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. BEL AMI just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY just off the inside tracking the front from just off the pace, came under
coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ROCKSTAR RED four wide through the first turn, chased four
then three wide coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PRINTRACK bumped with a rival outside the five-eighths pole, raced just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, gained to make a bid nearing
the quarter-pole, took a short lead outside the furlong marker, disposed of the pacesetter into the final furlong and held under strong urging. THE SICARII
settled well back on the outside, was urged five wide around the turn, gained under a drive into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth, drew
alongside that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. GANDY DANCING was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went four then
three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while along for the show. MOTION TO STRIKE was hustled to the front, showed the way with a
clear advantage, raced inside on the turn, was challenged late on that bend, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths and weakened.
ZERTZ drifted out inside the five-eighths pole, raced towards the rear, dropped from the two path to close to the rail on the turn and was no factor then
drifted out again late. POPPY'S PRIDE was hustled from the gate, bumped with a foe outside the five-eighths, chased three wide through the turn and came
up empty.

Footnotes
Following a sixteen minute delay due to the wrong tack being placed on CLITHEROE, followed by a fractious and then loose CANDLE, requiring a late
scratch, CLITHEROE (GB) raced four wide in pursuit, advanced on the leader near the quarter pole and took over command when set down spinning three
then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in under a drive shaking off FROSTED OATS inside the sixteenth marker and gamely prevailed
between late closing rivals. EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun
three wide for home, offered up late foot to close in near the finish and missed at the end. PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) settled just off the inside tracking the front
from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out four wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors.
FROSTED OATS hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with SISTER BRIDGET to her inside, took over sole command at the five-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch and yielded command straightened away, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish but was out-finished in the late
going. WINGS LIKE EAGLES chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but
was outkicked. FORTINENO (IRE) bumped at the start by OUT OF SIGHT, who broke outwards, chased along the inside, got set down spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish. FONTANAFREDDA chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. OUT OF SIGHT broke out at the start bumping FORTINENO, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and never threatened. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths and tired in the stretch. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) hustled from the gate, dueled inside of FROSTED OATS from the get go, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. BROADWAY FORCE chased

hold, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was roused near the three-eighths, chased the winner while inside of a foe in the stretch and was
outfinished but willingly earned the place. MON PETIT CHOU broke very fast, set a joint point on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped
back a bit into the stretch, chased outside in the drive and was out-kicked then just missed the place while clear for the show. ALPINE QUEEN was hustled
from the gate, jostled with a foe early, was rated under a tight hold, went three then two wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the seven-sixteenths, took
a short lead at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive outside the furlong marker and weakened. I'M BUZZY jostled with a foe early then dropped
back under urging, gained inside of an opponent leaving the backstretch, made a bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the five path on the turn, dropped back
under urging outside the five-sixteenths and capitulated. GAME THEORY broke awkwardly then was squeezed in tight between foes, settled on the far
outside, gained leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the six path at the half-mile pole, dropped to the four path later on that bend, chased into the stretch
and tired. TRIPLE P broke out at the start, jostled with foes early, raced just off the pace, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and had nothing left.
