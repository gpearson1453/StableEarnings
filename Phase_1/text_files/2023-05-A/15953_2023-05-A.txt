GALLAND DE BESOS prominent in the early running, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, confronted WESTERN SIERRA in upper stretch,
battled with that foe to mid-stretch, shook free and kept to task to deep stretch under steady urging, felt pressure from KERRY GOLD inside of the
sixteenth-marker and lasted for the win in the final strides. KERRY GOLD allowed to settle, saved ground into the turn, was roused four wide into the
stretch, advanced at the furlong pole, rallied in deep stretch, just missed for the win and was up in time to secure second. ROY HOBBS was away a step
slowly and was a bit green in the early running, chased the decent fractions into the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, loomed at the furlong
pole, closed willingly in the late stages, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for third. WESTERN SIERRA broke
alertly and dictated terms in the early running, set decent fractions into the turn, was confronted by GALLAND DE BESOS in upper stretch, met that bid to
the furlong pole and gave way in deep stretch. JERSEY BABE was fractious in the post parade, raced close to the decent early pace, saved ground to the
quarter marker, chased the leaders to the furlong grounds and weakened in the drive. ANOTHER STRIKE chased the decent early fractions, lost ground on
the turn while four wide, ran evenly to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
PRANCIN N THE PARK was a bit keen in the early running, settled heading into the backstretch run, saved ground while well placed into the last turn, came
in a bit tight in upper stretch, advanced at the furlong pole, vied between rivals at the sixteenth-marker, gamely kept to task while battling NOBLE HEARTED
to the wire and won the nod at the finish to prevail. NOBLE HEARTED tracked the moderate early pace, raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run,
made a steady advance to the second turn, maintained a three wide path to the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch and came within aim at the
furlong grounds, confronted LADY GREGORY inside of the furlong marker, battled with that foe to deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the final strides, was
confronted by PRANCIN N THE PARK and was nailed on the line by that one for the win, while holding for second. LADY GREGORY sent leaving the break
and established the lead into the first turn, set contested fractions through the backstretch run and into the far turn, shook free from MANY MARKETS in
upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong pole, met the bid of NOBLE HEARTED inside of the furlong marker, battled to deep stretch and was outfinished
in the final strides, while holding safely for third. BLUE BREEZE was allowed to settle while never far back, raced three wide to the quarter marker, was
roused four wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run in deep stretch and flattened out. MANY MARKETS
forwardly placed into the first turn, advanced and contested the moderate pace through the backstretch run, disputed the pace with LADY GREGORY to the
furlong marker, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way.

CRY ME A RUNNER broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, rated nicely along the turn while carving decent fractions, drew
to a clear lead at mid-stretch, widened the lead into deep stretch and was hand urged to the finish as much the best. AUTISM SHINE broke in at the start
and was away a step slowly, chased the decent pace while outside of rivals, was roused four wide into the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker,
could not impact the winner in the final stages and held safely at the end for second. AUNT NOREEN bobbled slightly at the start, chased the decent early
pace from the inside, advanced on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and was outfinished by the top two,
while clear of the rest for third. STANDFORGRIT prominent in the early running, chased the decent fractions while two wide to the quarter marker, lost
ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. ACHROMATIC chased the decent early pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not
threaten. SENSATIONAL CITY chased the early pace, lost position heading into the turn, raced four wide to the quarter marker and did not factor in the
drive.

LYING GHOST was asked to show early speed and was prominent into the first turn, disputed the pace with MESA EMPIRE into the backstretch run then
set moderate pressured fractions to the half-mile marker, took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was confronted by BEROLIJEAN at the furlong marker,
dueled to the inside of that rival to deep stretch, came again inside of the sixteenth-marker, dug in in the final strides and determinedly held on for the win.
BEROLIJEAN (FR) settled just off of the moderate early pace, was steered outside of rivals along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid coming to
the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch then vied for the lead at the furlong marker, confronted LYING GHOST inside of the furlong pole, dueled with
that rival to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while holding safely for second. VANISKY was away slowly and was unhurried in the
early running, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, improved position into the second turn, was roused three to four wide into the stretch, finished well
inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the top two in deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. ROARING TIGER lunged at the start and was
away slowly, was allowed to settle early on while not far back, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came in tight and waited for racing room at the top of
the stretch, found room and advanced at mid-stretch, was gaining in the final furlong, could not muster the needed late response and was just edged for
third. MESA EMPIRE forwardly placed in the early running, came under a snug hold into the backstretch run, prompted the moderate fractions to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

UPSTART YANKEE well placed in the early running, tracked the solid pace while outside of rivals into the far turn, was roused three wide nearing the
quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, overtook BLUE SILVER heading to the furlong marker, was given one reminder tap inside of the furlong pole, kept
to task to deep stretch and drew away in the final stages. STRAIT OF GEORGIA allowed to settle, slipped to the inside along the backstretch run and saved
all of the ground to far turn, advanced from the inside nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, was no match for the winner in the stretch
run and ran on in in the late stages to be second best. BLUE SILVER asked to show early speed and was prominent into the first turn, set pressured
fractions into the backstretch run, carved a solid pace to the half-mile marker, shook free on the second turn, was overtaken by UPSTART YANKEE nearing
the furlong pole, gave way in the final stages and was outfinished for second, while well clear for third. RAVELLO sent in the early going, disputed the solid
fractions into the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

PANDEMIC GIRL forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the moderate pace while three wide outside of rivals into the backstretch run, advanced at
the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch, took command inside of the furlong pole, met the bid
of BIG GIFT to deep stretch, dug in under steady urging in the final stages and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. BIG GIFT unhurried in the early stages,
loomed on the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, confronted PANDEMIC GIRL at mid-stretch, battled that foe to the sixteenth-marker while on the left
lead, was unable to get by the determined winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. DUST MAKER allowed to settle in the early running, improved
position along the backstretch run, advanced while saving ground along the second turn, angled three wide for the drive, came within aim at mid-stretch,
was outkicked by the top pair in the final furlong and was well clear of the rest for third at the finish. HALLELUJAH BABY hustled in the early going, stalked
the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter at the quarter marker, battled for the lead in upper stretch, could not keep
pace with rivals inside of the furlong pole and tired in the final stages. LUCKY LOCKETT showed early speed and established the pace into the first turn, set
moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with rivals in upper stretch and gave
way in the drive.

OAT MILK LATTE settled off of the moderate early pace while not far back, advanced along the backstretch run, loomed three wide at the quarter marker,
battled for the lead in upper stretch, assumed command and drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and
drew away in the final stages. PEACEHAVEN crowded BEA MISCHIEF a bit at the start, stalked the moderate fractions, advanced two wide at the quarter
marker and vied for the lead nearing the top of the lane, could not match strides with OAT MILK LATTE inside of the furlong marker and ran on in the final
stages to hold safely for second. BIG JOLT stalked the moderate early pace, raced two wide into the last turn, came in tight and waited for racing room
approaching the top of the stretch, lost ground heading to the furlong marker, rallied in the late stages, could not reel in the top two in deep stretch and was
up in time to secure third. BEA MISCHIEF hopped then was crowded at the start and was off slowly, settled in the early running, improved position along the
backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, swung five to six wide for the drive, was gaining inside of the furlong marker and just missed for third at the
finish. TIGERIZE settled off of the early pace, raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, maintained that four wide path into the second turn, was
outrun in upper stretch and did not rally in the final furlong. SPORTS FOR WOMEN allowed to settle, was roused three wide along the far turn, lost ground
at mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. THE RIVER MANGITA chased the moderate pace, improved position along the backstretch run, advanced
on the far turn, could not sustain that rally in the stretch drive and gave way. DON'S DAYNA was asked to show early speed and dictated terms in the early
running, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was overtaken by OAT MILK LATTE in upper stretch, ran in pursuit of that rival to the furlong
pole and tired in the final stages.
