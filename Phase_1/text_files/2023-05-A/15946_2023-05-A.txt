PREACH IT GIRL pressed the pace from a two path stance, locked into a stretch duel at upper stretch and wore down the leader for the score. EASTER
VISION rushed form outset and led the field around the bend from a ground saving stance, but was unable to fend off the late charge of PREACH IT GIRL.
LIL' BIT OF CHROME settled in behind the pacesetting duo, was forced to alter path at top of lane and finished evenly but was no match for top pair in the
end. SWEET OLIVE gave chase from a three path pose, floated out at upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BIG NORTHERN RIVER stalked the pace from a ground saving stance through the opening half, trekked the two path while under urging near the quarter
pole, tucked to the rail at top of lane and rallied along rail for the victory. TEQUILA REVOLUTION hustled from outset to first command, led the field along
the backstretch, had a slight advantage at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off the rally of eventual winner in final sixteenth. GOLDBRIDGE was
unhurried through the first half, circled rivals around the closing turn, rated widest at upper stretch, and finished with a late rush to procure the show. BLAKE
FROM TISH lacked a needed closing kick after stalking the pace from a three path stance, and rating close up at the top of the homestretch. SCHLEICHER
came up empty in the crucial stages after flashing early foot and sharing command in opening stages.

MANDOLIN WIND stalked the pacesetter as the lone rival in second flight, closed the gap on leader around the final bend, headed that rival at upper stretch
and proved best in the stretch duel for the score. SOMERSETSLASTRIDE rushed from the break and established a comfortable lead along the backstretch,
was headed at upper stretch and failed to match strides with that rival in closing strides. PRINCE OF EARL settled into mid pack through the opening half,
swung three wide nearing the five sixteenths pole, rated close up as the outer most of three at upper stretch, and finished willingly for the show behind
dueling duo. HOLCOMBE established an inside track shortly after the start and failed to menace. MY CALANTE lacked a serious bid after settling in behind
pacesetters and giving chase from between rivals. OKLAHOMA MOON steadily lost ground to front runners and never threatened.

BRING IT ON BABY forced the pace issue from a three wide pose, gained command mid turn and drew off from rivals in homestretch for the score. SINNIN
N GRINNIN hopped at the break, trekked three wide around the bend, responded to urging nd finished a clear second. PATSY R pressed the early pace
from a two path stance, rated within striking distance at upper stretch but was no match for top pair in closing strides. SUPERBLEA stalked the pace from an
inside stance along the backstretch, lot ground to front runners around the turn, and showed some late interest in final furlong. MO ARETHA lacked a
needed rally after settling in between rivals and trekking widest of all at upper stretch. MISS RITA rushed away for first command, led the field into the turn
then eclipsed in crucial portion of contest.

Footnotes
OKIE CODE broke alertly, gained first command, led the field into the homestretch, kicked clear near the eighth pole and held off the late rallying rival for the
victory. EURA NORTHERN SKY saved ground in early going, was in pursuit of leader from a two path pose at upper stretch, and finished with a late rush to
be gaining on leader at finish. SUPRISING CODE came up empty and failed to match late stride after pressing the early pace from a three path position and
swinging three wide at upper stretch. CAT TALE BREEZE lacked a needed rally along the rail to end a ground saving journey. OKIE HEAT failed to threaten
from a back rated stance. SCANDALOUS AFFAIR came away slowly, trailed the field from outset and was vanned off

MACER THE RACER hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem as the outer rival of three abreast, trekked the two path around the bend and drew off in
final furlong for a clear score. TUFF MANDATE settled into second flight, trekked three wide at upper stretch and showed late interest to gain mildly in the
end. LITTLE MAD MAX hustled from outset and established an inside stance to set the pace in concert around the bend before backing out of the bid in final
furlong. NORTHERN ORBIT gave chase to front runners from a ground saving pose, and finished willingly but was unable to close on leaders in
homestretch. RIGGED RIGHT lacked a needed rally after settling into midpack and travelling four wide into the homestretch. SILENT SAILOR chased the
frontrunners from a wide position, maintained that wide line around the turn and lost ground to front runners. RED ACE pressed the early pace from
between rivals, rated two wide at upper stretch and tired in closing portion of contest. PROBATION ROYALTY got loose during loading process, trailed the
field from outset, and proved no factor.

Footnotes
KWONTRO rushed from outset to lead the field, never relished command, and denied all challengers for a gate to wire score. BRIGGSEY broke alertly and
established a ground saving stance, pressed the pace along the backstretch, rated close up and two wide at upper stretch, but proved to be no match for
tough winner in final strides. GOSPEL BUZZ trailed the field early before swinging wide at top of lane and rallying mid track to earn the show. CHEROKEE
LEGACY was unhurried in the early going, closed the gap on leaders around the closing bend, and finished evenly along the inside. FRIGERATOR settled
into mid pack around the opening turn, trekked three wide near the half pole and advanced on leaders but lacked a rally in the homestretch.
HEPUTTHEACEINRACE lacked a closing kick after looming on the heels of pacesetter through the opening half while trekking four wide. HUNTER QUICK
stalked the early pacesetter from a three path pose, was shuffled back nearing the final turn, and faded fast in closing stages. WILBERT gave chase from a
ground saving position then tired in latter half of contest.

Footnotes
MISSIN HOLLYWOOD broke alertly, assumed command shortly after the start and kicked clear in homestretch for the victory. SEARCHIN SAFARI pressed
the early pace from a two path pose, swung to three wide at upper stretch, and finished a clear second but was no match for winner in closing strides.
DEN'S DYNASTY stalked the pacesetter from a ground saving stance, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but was unable to match strides with
top pair in final furlong. AMMENTHEDESTROYER was hesitant at the start, trailed the field along the backstretch and passed tiring rivals in the late going.
FORT NECESSITY lacked a needed rally after looming boldly on the heels of pacesetter from between rivals. MAJESTIC FLASH gave chase from a wide
stance and tired in crucial portion of contest. KENNY T failed to threaten from a back rated position.
