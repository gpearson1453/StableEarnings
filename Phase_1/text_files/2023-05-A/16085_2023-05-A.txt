Footnotes
ATRAS pressed the pace from the inside, was moving up from behind the dueling pair while three wide on the turn, then dug in gamely to kick clear of the
inner rivals and was up in the final strides. BIG TICKET brushed rival at the start, then raced behind the leaders while four wide, bid on the turn then closed
belatedly to be up for the place position. PHILO BEDDOE brushed foe at the start, then bid well to take command heading into the turn, dueled to keep the
lead with an inner rival, continued to menace between rivals in the stretch and was out finished in the end for the place prize. SAINT PIO raced second to
last position into the turn, made a mild bid heading into the stretch but came up empty. RUSH THE COLORS lead the way from the gate briefly, then
pressed the pace from the inside, was moving up to challenge for the lead throughout the turn and into the early stretch, was used up and gave way in the
end. BOLD N WILD was out run and no menace.

Footnotes
CLEAT sped to the lead shortly away from the gate, opened a clear advantage in the turn, repelled the bid of the runner-up in upper stretch and finished up
convincingly. STRAIGHT LUCK broke alertly to press the pace from the rail, made a bold bid in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but proved a
clear second best in a good effort. PITALE dueled for the early lead from between horses, backed out of the duel to track from third and failed to gain on the
leaders in the lane. TEO settled along the fence to track the pacesetters through the turn, drifted into the gap in the rail down the stretch, and finished up
evenly. SAINT CHARLES reserved off the leaders down the backstretch, split horses while rallying through the turn and kept on in the drive with a mild late
bid. SEARING bumped at the start to be slow early to be at the back of the field and made up ground in the stretch passing tiring rivals. MIDNIGHT
HUNTER tracked the pace in the clear to the turn and lacked a response when called upon. JERSEY JIM bumped at start between rivals, dropped to rear of
the field, was getting out on the turn racing wide and was never a factor.

BONNIEVIEW dueled for the lead from the inside, gained command heading into the turn, was confronted by outer rivals but pulled away in the early stretch
and held on well to prove best in the end. PERILOUS LIFE raced in close behind the dueling pair while three wide, was urging gamely on the turn to vie for
the lead, gained it by a head at the quarter pole, but was over taken in the early stretch and was able to hold onto the place position in the end. WIKI LIO
was in a hard drive to duel for the lead while two wide, was used up on the turn and gave way in the stretch. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF was bumped at the start,
then chased the pace from the inside into the turn, rallied in the early stretch but came up evenly in the end. THE RAGE OF ART was off slowly at the start,
then raced behind the field down the backstretch, bid mildly on the turn and was no menace. JENNY'S PENNY broke inwardly at the start, then chased the
pace while four wide, then rallied on the turn, was hard used and weakened in the lane.

IT MAKES SENSE stalked the pacesetters from three wide into the turn, took command turning for home and persevered in a determined drive under strong
handling. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY saved ground along the fence down the backside, moved up in the turn to be in striking distance, split horses at the head of
the stretch and finished well to gain the place. PIKNITUPLAYNITDOWN broke alertly and was taken in hand to be the early trailer, circled the field in the
turn while closing quickly to loom boldly in upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. IM THE MACHINE slow early to trail the field into the turn and
made a mild late bid down the lane. DAME PLATA tracked the pace from two wide into the turn, was set to a drive at the three-eighths pole and failed to
gain ground. ALGEBRA dueled from two wide on the pace for the first half mile and gradually gave way. MACHO RONNIE rushed up the fence to battle on
the lead for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
TRES SOLES chased the pace from the inside, was gaining swiftly on the far turn to vie for the lead while three wide, then took command in the early
stretch and held on grudgingly till the end. COSMIC SOUL was under a steady drive to stalk the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far
turn, then rallied in the early stretch to surge down the final furlong to be up for the pace prize. MOR LANA SPIRIT chased the pace while two wide, was
urging strongly on the far turn then closed willingly in the stretch and was best for third in the end. FAST TRAFFIC raced behind the field heading into the
first turn, was moving up down the backstretch, to bid gamely on the far turn while five wide, then gave way in late stretch. KLIMTOMANIAC was unhurried
early then raced from the inside, came out five wide on the far turn to rally in the late stretch but it was too little too late. DOUGH BOY settled in the two
path, bid while three wide on the far turn then raced evenly throughout the stretch. BAREFOOT SAMURAI raced from the inside in the middle of the field
down the early backstretch, then flattened out and needed rally in the end. BRATTON lead the way into the first turn, was in a long drive down the
backstretch and into the turn, then faltered in the stretch. AARON'S SPIRIT was in a hard drive to talk the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then
dropped back on the turn and continued to fade throughout.

Footnotes
LIL MISS SUNSHINE broke sharply to take control from the gate, quickly opened a clear advantage and widened to mid-stretch, gearing down late as much
the best. LEPRECHAUN CHARM rated in mid-pack to the head of the lane, weaved her way through traffic down the stretch and finished willingly to gain
the place from between rivals. RUN FOR MRS RIGGS stalked the leader from the rail, was well placed in contention but failed to make up ground while
holding on for the show. MISCHIEF ANGEL settled near the rear of the field and closed with a rush down the lane to be going best of all at the wire while
gaining a piece of the show spot. LADAWN prominently placed while racing four wide through the turn and flattened out in the drive. PIECE OF ME stalked
the pace at the head of the chasing pack, was prominent until upper stretch and weakened in the final eighth. EMMYLOU SQUALL went evenly failing to
mount a rally. MAREBELL raced in mid-pack and failed to respond when called upon. ROSITA LA CARINOSA tracked the pace through the turn and faded
in the stretch. WISTFULLY trailed most of the way as no threat. NELLIE DEE was never a factor.

MORE THAN SHAKIN lead the way throughout and prevailed wire to wire. OLIVIA'S RACE DAY was bumped at the start, then raced along the inside to
closed willingly in the stretch for the place prize. GOLDEN SLEW stalked the pace while three deep, was urging gamely on the turn to close well in the end
just missing the place prize. RIVER'S END broke inward and bumped rival, then bid between rivals, was in tight, then rallied while four wide on the turn and
into the stretch and was closing well but it wasn't enough. POQUITO LADY stalked the pace while in a hard drive in the two path, continued to rally gamely
on the turn then gave way. ALONG CAME THUNDER was in a hard drive to stalk the pace from the inside into the turn, then gave way in the stretch.
CROSS CLAIM raced at an even pace throughout while five to six wide and was no threat. RON'S LAVENDER was unhurried early then trailed behind the
field and passed tired foes in the end. BLOOD ORANGE settled in the second to last position and was flat throughout and needed rally. DIVAESQUE was in
a hard drive to stalk the pace while four wide, then faded on the turn and had no final bid.

Footnotes
CHOJO raced up the rail shortly away from the gate to take the lead, battled through the turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and held on to the
wire in a game effort. CINNAMON FACE broke well and was taken in hand to settle off the early pace, commenced a four wide rally into the turn and
finished with a rush to just miss. SUGAR MAMAS CAKERY stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, mounted a strong bid through the lane and
was just out-finished for the place while gaining at the wire. OUR PASTOR pressed the pace from between rivals to midway on the turn, dropped off the
leaders and finished willingly through the stretch. SKY ROCKER saved ground for the run down the backstretch along the fence, angled out for the drive
and made a mild bid in the drive. LOANA reserved near the rear of the field to the turn and made a late rally passing tiring foes. HAPPY IN HEELS raced in
mid-field down the backside, was set to an early drive into the turn and flattened out. BOLD EXAGGERATION broke awkwardly almost losing the rider,
dropped to the back, raced wide and was never a factor. PEYTON KENNEDY flashed brief speed and was through early.
