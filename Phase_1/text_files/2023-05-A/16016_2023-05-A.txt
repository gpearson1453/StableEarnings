Footnotes
TRUTH SEEKER raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. MINISTER OF SOUL was
away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid in mid-stretch but could not match strides
with that rival in the drive. CHASING FAME was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with
some late run. TIGER DAD dueled for the lead with TACTICAL ATTACK from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. TACTICAL ATTACK broke
sharply to dispute the pace with TIGER DAD while racing three-wide and gave way after going five furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CREME DE LA CHROME was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway. ITALIANO was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a steady bid. XTREME MAYHEM
settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. MISTER MCLEAN broke sharply to press the pace while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FURY KAP pressed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way after a half. CANNONBALL
COMIN raced off the pacesetters from the inside, reached a contending position in mid-stretch and failed to gain in the drive. PURE ROCKET raced off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. GRAN MARTILLO was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. WRONG SPOT was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. FURLOUGH FIT
lagged throughout and raced four-wide through the turn. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ITS A CHEAP DATE sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace, drifted out in mid-stretch and drew off with little need of urging. CALEBS
LADY broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide, angled in with a furlong to run, was no match for that rival but finished well to be clearly
second best. ACES OVER DEUCES settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. PERFECT MISCHIEF
raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. X RAY VISION raced off the leaders early, moved eight-wide through
the turn and did not threaten. DON JUAN BUBBA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GENERAL CROOK was
off a step slow, lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. BIG MOONIE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did
not offer a bid. ESCAPEFROMPARADISE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. SISTER COUSIN chased the
leaders from the inside for a half and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TARTINI tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the five-eighths marker, moved three-wide through the fourth turn and
drew off. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the third turn and finished with a steady bid. NO SLO
MO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the fourth turn and finished with a late bid. LUVLUV lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the fourth turn and finished evenly. SWEET SAVANT raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the fourth-turn and failed to menace.
SONNY SMACK lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the fourth turn and was not a factor. FALSELY ACCUSED sprinted clear at once, saved
ground while setting the pace and gave way after going a mile and three-eighths. UNMACHABLE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
fourth turn and did not offer a bid. BAROSSA showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
