Footnotes
SON OF A BIRCH was hustled from the gate then bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn,
responded well while between foes in upper stretch, fought gamely inside of the runner-up in the final furlong, gained a short lead inside the sixteenth-pole
and determinedly prevailed. AMERICAN KNOW HOW chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, gained to take a short lead
into upper stretch, fought outside of two foes to the furlong marker, led under the crop into the final sixteenth then lost the advantage to the winner, fought
on to the wire and just missed while winning the head-bob for the place. LITTLE SKIPPY chased the pace on the outside, dropped from the four path to the
two path on the turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, chased the leading trio on the outside into the final furlong, loomed a major threat into the final
sixteenth, drew alongside the top two approaching the finish and just missed while out-nodded for the place. FAST BOAT TO SKYE was hustled to the front,
set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. FLAT TOP BOX was fractious in the gate, broke in and awkwardly while off slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, climbed some while urged
at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five to six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) established the front and showed the way past the stands just off the inside before tucking to the rail into the first turn, dawdled down
the backstretch under a light rating hold unhurried and unprompted as her rivals took up a straight course in behind her, continued along the inside through
the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole as the pace quickened, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in and held well kept to task to the finish. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) tracked the pace along the inside past the stands the initial time and
through the opening bend, settled along the inside briefly before tipping to the two path six and a half furlongs from home, got nudged three wide near the
nine-sixteenths as ATOMIC BLONDE tipped out along her inside, went three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) tracked along the inside until tipped to
the two path at the nine-sixteenths nudging VIRGINIA JOY three wide at that station, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths just off the inside, tipped
three wide at the head of the stretch and ran on under a drive to the finish. AMAZING GRACE (GER) saved ground at the tail of the compact field, remained
patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response while one paced to the finish.

Footnotes
DISARMED bumped lightly with a foe while brushing with another opponent at the start, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved
out while asked after turning into the stretch, chased the leaders into the final sixteenth and got up to prevail under strong handling. ELECTRIC STUFF was
hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, fought outside of a foe while
leading under a drive into the final sixteenth, got the better of that rival for the place but was denied by the winner. FACTUALLY CORRECT broke out and
brushed the gate then brushed with a foe, went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage
to the runner-up in upper stretch, fought on determinedly inside that foe in the final furlong and just missed while clear for the show. NEWPORT BRIDGE
was coaxed along on the far outside, went five wide under stronger encouragement on the turn and lacked the needed kick. LAUNCH CONTROL broke in
and bumped lightly with a foe, was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out one path into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. WILLINTORISKITALL chased the pace on the outside then four wide around the turn and weakened. SCHERZANDO was urged along
off the pace, went three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. Z DANCER brushed with foes at the start, settled
under some urging, lugged out in the two path early on the turn, jostled with KREESA near the three-eighths, continued in the two path while inside that rival
on that bend, was driven five wide into upper stretch and was no factor. UNCLE MARTY stumbled at the start, settled at the rear, moved in late on the
backstretch, went three then two wide early on the turn, shifted four wide late on that bend, was carried six wide into the stretch, dropped in outside the
furlong marker and failed to threaten. KREESA moved out while settling towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn, jostled with Z DANCER
near the three-eighths, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to respond.

DAUFUSKIE ISLAND was hustled to the front, dictated terms while inside through the turn, was shaken up lightly in the two path into upper stretch and
powered away under a hand-ride to win handily. MARATHONER broke a bit awkwardly but with the field, chased the pace on the outside then in the three
path around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. SUIT OF ARMOR settled in third
position, was given his cue in the two path on the turn and came up empty. VOLIERO broke out then was taken up and dropped back, spotted the front a
few lengths, moved out while ridden along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
REPO ROCKS prompted the pace of EXPRESSMAN from the outside in the three path, came under light coaxing near the three-eighths and took over
command nearing the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, drifted out slightly while drawing clear to the finish kept to task. ZANDON
chased five then four wide patiently handled until set down angled seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure
the place honors. WEYBURN chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages. UNBRIDLED BOMBER chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
DR ARDITO got bumped at the start by EXPRESSMAN, who recovered outwards from a bobble, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. EXPRESSMAN bobbled at the break recovering outwards and veering into DR
ARDITO, came under coaxing and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from REPO ROCKS to the outside, came under urging near
the three-eighths and yielded the front near the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BOURBON CALLING broke a half a
beat slow and bobbled at the break, raced three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, made no
impact.

Footnotes
SUCCULENT was reserved under a tight hold, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside to get the lead
coming to the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. BERNING HONOR was reserved on the outside, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths,
ranged up to issue a challenge while four then three wide on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths then shook clear into the stretch, lost the
advantage to the winner while remaining on her inside lead under a drive approaching the furlong marker and proved no match then just held the place
while continuing on her inside lead to the finish. SHE'S A NATURAL was off slow then checked early, raced towards the back under reserve, lugged out a
bit while five then six wide around the turn, chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong and just missed the place while able to get the show.
SILENT MELODY was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. ROBYN AND ELI was reserved on the outside, came under urging while three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, chased into the final furlong and weakened. GOOD ACCELEBRATE settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out at the
quarter-pole, lacked room behind foes in upper stretch, altered in outside the furlong marker then slipped through on the inside and failed to threaten. LA
GOULU was off slow, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. CHARISSE was well
placed just off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path while asked, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole and came up empty. LA CONQUISTADORA
contested the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. BE BEST stalked the pace on the
outside under a snug hold, chased three then two wide on the turn, moved back to the three path late on that bend and tired. NORTHWAY broke a step
slow, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. BIG HAZEL contested
the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.
