Footnotes
VALEROSO gave a quick move abreast rival at the quarter pole shaking clear while grabbing the rail at the head of the stretch holding up while a bit weary
late. LOST IN MANHATTAN stalked the pace rallying to grab a short lived lead on the far turn being hooked from the outside at the quarter pole pausing
briefly when losing path at the head of the stretch angling out late closing the gap after the fact. PARADE GRAND slow early gained spots four wide in
upper stretch posing no serious threat. TWO GOLD SPOTS was never a factor. SMOOTH PAPA set the early pace wearing down on the far turn. SUPER
VISION folded up on the far turn. THIRSTY ACTOR took a bad step nearing the three quarter pole pulling up and vanning off after the race. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF LOST IN MANHATTAN AGAINST THE RIDER OF VALEROSO FOR INTERFERENCE PAST THE QUARTER POLE
WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

PAPA CHARLES slow early began to pick it up near the quarter pole surging on the outside of rivals in upper stretch blowing clear to win as much the best.
BAYTOWN BEAVER pressed the pace wresting a clear lead on the turn, engaged from the outside in upper stretch would prove no match holding well to
secure place. TRUST FUND ROBBER sent inside pressed through the turn into upper stretch wearing out the final eighth. WHY WINCHILL WHY played no
factor. HICKORY BILL gave hard pursuit through the turn tiring in upper stretch. ZACH AND JILL struggling from the get go was eased in upper stretch
walking off after the race.
