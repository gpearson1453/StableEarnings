RECORDER bided his time while saving ground through the opening two turns, moved closer while angling out going to the final turn, rallied four wide to
loop the field in that bend and drew off under steady handling. G'S TURN tracked the leaders four wide, settled back going to the final turn then regained
position in the lane as rivals weakened. BARSTOW stalked the pace three and four wide in good position but weakened into the lane. DEBONNAIRE DUDE
contested the pace two to three wide outside a rival and weakened in the lane. FRIENDOFTHECOURT contested the pace inside rivals while out from the
rail and weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
NAME THE PRICE showed the most early speed to gain clear about the two to three path, made all the running and held safe in the lane. KENHEDOIT
tracked the winner's pace three wide and closed through the lane but could not reach that one. PICKLES N ME was in reach three to four wide but lacked a
closing run in the drive. REPORT TO DUTY was four wide and gained position but lacked a solid closing bid. MR. BIG SHOT saved ground and weakened.
JOY FOREVER was not a threat. PICKELJUICE was outrun.

Footnotes
DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR was on the pace about the two to three path to kick clear into the far turn, shook off a bid turning for home and held safe to the
end. BRADSTREET tracked the pace three and four wide to bid outside the winner turning for home but could not run that one down. STAR OF STARS
stalked the pace three wide, moved in through the far turn but could not close on the top pair. AFTER BURN briefly contested the pace inside the winner
and dropped back after a half. HESACALENDARBOY saved ground and had no rally. GREAT REALIZATION was always back. SCOOTER FLASH was
outrun and lost contact with the field going to the final turn.
