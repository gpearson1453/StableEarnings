Footnotes
MARIA ELENA Y. G attended the pace from outside, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths, moved clear willingly on the turn, drew off in the stretch under
vigorous hand urging then geared down late. HEY ROXY set the early tempo on a narrow advantage facing outside pressure from the eventual winner,
steadily weakened but fought on well enough to share the place. NAUGHTY NATALIE steadied on heels outside the three-eighths shifting first inside a rival
then angling out late on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide, ran on to share the place. SUNDAY'S VISION lacked early speed, advanced mildly
outside three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. MISS TYRO was away well between runners briefly then taken back off the leading pair to track,
moved out a bit entering the turn, raced about in the three path, failed to menace.

Footnotes
FAR FROM FINAL was coaxed forward mildly from the start, set the pace racing just off the rail, turned back a mild challenge coming to the quarter pole
and drew away, was geared down late. MESSAGE DISCIPLINE had forward position early, dropped back under a moderate hold inside, came off the rail
leaving the turn, ran on to get up for second inside. LUCKY MCCOY stalked from outside going three to four wide, gained to within striking distance coming
to the quarter pole but was no match for the winner and lost place late. MAGNET AND STEEL was never near enough to threaten racing inside. WEST JET
settled at the rear, switched out early, went three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. FREEDOM FLASH chased two to three wide, tired.
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

BRODIE BABY moved forward inside to take the lead past the seven-eighths setting the pace while attended by an outside rival, was overtaken by that foe
past the five-sixteenths, lost further ground coming into upper stretch but fought on under stout urging to be resurgent inside and retake the lead seventy
yards from home. CANADA CANDY ceded the early lead content to attend the pacesetter from outside two to three deep, moved to the lead past the
five-sixteenths, was clear in upper stretch and put to urging but lacked the needed late response and was outfinished. SMOKIN' OKIE shifted in early, raced
inside rivals up the backstretch, came out three wide turning for home, was no match for the top pair. OH NIKI raced two to three wide early and off the
pace, went three to four deep on the far turn, failed to menace. CON SUERTE raced outside three to five wide throughout and made no bid.

Footnotes
MARCH WEST stalked the dueling leaders, advanced outside three to four wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, forged clear and held safe. G'S
STORM tracked in behind the leaders racing off the rail, went in the two to three path on the turn, gained the place over ROBERT WHO, who prompted from
outside, took over early on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. DEL MOON settled off the pace inside, came off the rail
nearing the quarter to pass a tiring rival, ran on in the stretch. MAJOR GRIFFIN got away slowly, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position.
FROGGY broke awkwardly, raced at the back five wide into the turn, came out of that bend seven deep and passed a couple tiring rivals. TERAWATT was
mid-pack four wide through the turn coming to the top of the stretch five deep, faded in the lane. ORNERY AS HELL dueled inside, tired.

Footnotes
MESA MOON settled off the pace outside, advanced four deep on the turn, took over in mid-stretch and drew clear. CONNORS OUTLAW moved forward
inside to attend and press the early leader, eased back off that foe and switched out three wide nearing the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch, could not kick
on with the winner but secured the place. SHANNON C set the pace racing off the inside, went in the two to three path through the turn, was challenged in
upper stretch, yielded grudgingly. JUST A IRISH LAD raced near the inside off the pace and failed to rally. WRANGLERED chased from off the inside in the
three path through the turn, dropped back and faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION HALF-MILE TIME UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
NUMBER ONE DUDE got away well but was taken back off the leading pair to stalk those dueling leaders two to three wide, advanced willingly late up the
backstretch to apply pressure to the leader, took over past the five-sixteenths, drew off under urging and was in hand late while much the best. COWBOY
MISCHIEF was reserved inside at the back racing on or just off the rail, began to advance entering the far turn moving out from three to five wide on that
bend and rapidly advancing on the lead but could not sustain the effort. TOMMYHAWK settled outside at the back after breaking just a step awkwardly,
raced two to three deep on the turns advancing past rivals turning into upper stretch, kept on but missed second. I'M CRENSHAW was mid-pack racing off
the rail in the two to three path, went evenly. ROWDY RASCAL broke sharply and with the lead shifted in to the two path into the first turn, ceded the lead to
press from outside, engaged further to duel early up the backstretch, took the lead past the five-and-one-half, was overtaken on the far turn, weakened
thereafter. UNITED PATRIOT moved forward inside and to the lead early on the first turn, faced pressure throughout while on the lead and gave way.

Footnotes
ABSAROKA was urged forward at the break, set the pace racing off the rail, was clear into late stretch and just held. DRIFTING WEST was bumped early
and steadied slightly into the first turn, settled at the back racing inside on then just off the rail, continued well back near the rail through the far turn, angled
five wide in upper stretch still with much to do, got going best of all and was gaining on the winner but too late. BOX SEAT was forwardly-placed four then
three wide through the first turn, stalked from between runners up the backstretch, continued to chase three then four wide through the far turn and the
stretch, kept on well but needed more. SHANGHAI SKIPPER bumped a rival early heading to the first turn while moving in on that bend, continued near the
inside mid-pack on the far turn, shifted five wide turning for home, was forced out a further path in upper stretch and ran on. CANEY'S GHOST pressed the
early pace from inside then continued to track saving ground, ran evenly in the stretch. ROCKPORT KAT was bumped into a rival heading to the first turn,
steadied when in tight and squeezed back, settled at the back racing outside two to three deep, failed to rally. FIRE EXTINGUISHER raced outside off the
pace three to five wide, failed to threaten. VERRAZANO FIRST was within range stalking three to four wide up the backstretch, retreated, was eased
through the lane and walked off. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS bucked into the rail leaving the first turn and lost the rider, was vanned off.

GIT AROUND BROWN broke on top and went straight to the lead to set the pace inside, edged away from the nearest pursuer willingly on the turn, was put
to urging in upper stretch and extended the margin. CLINTON QUARINTINO settled at the back, saved some ground near the inside on the turn, gained the
place while no threat to the winner. MISTER TYRO stalked the eventual winner from outside two to three deep, weakened. EASTER JIM switched outside
the leading pair chasing in the three to four path on the turn, failed to rally. J BOB was outpaced early racing off the inside part of the track, was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOTTA SEE RED stalked from mid-pack and outside, advanced four wide and bid at the top of the stretch taking a narrow lead, edged clear late. KACHINA
was caught four then three wide in the early stages in pursuit of the pacesetter, moved in and nearer that rival heading up the backstretch, took the lead
past the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on gamely. DICEY settled off the pace outside at the rear, launched a sweeping move
outside five wide on the far turn to reach contention coming near the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort. FIGHTINGTEMPTATION was urged
at the break but lacking early speed inside, switched off the rail, went two wide into the far turn, ran on in the stretch while no threat to the top ones.
PLENTY OF VISION broke a half-step slowly, raced off the inside into the first turn then was guided to the rail, advanced inside coming to the
seven-sixteenths, raced in behind foes till the top of the stretch and found room up the rail, ran on evenly. RAINBOWS ARE FREE raced two to three wide,
was between runners and coaxed along past the four-and-one-half, failed to rally. CHILLAXIFICATION moved forward to set the pace racing three paths off
the fence into the first turn, moved nearer the rail thereafter, was pressed up the backstretch, dueled inside briefly, weakened.

Footnotes
SHUTUP PLEASE was urged forward to the lead, set a pressured pace just off the rail then inside heading into the turn, was overtaken on that bend, came
again in the stretch and kicked clear. HAUNTED DREAM got away a bit slowly, advanced in behind rivals three wide on the turn, rallied for the place.
GRACE THE LADY broke on top then settled in to press the intent leader, was between runners to the far turn, took the lead on that bend, drifted to the six
path turning for home and lost the lead, kept on evenly thereafter. JADE ENVY settled off the pace shifting in, saved ground early on the turn, fanned five
wide into the stretch, ran on mildly. DARETOCATCHLOVE was outpaced in the early going, made up ground near or just off the rail and evened out in the
stretch. ELENA MAE stalked from outside with good position five abreast, was carried eight deep into upper stretch and failed to rally. DODGEBALL was a
bit fractious in the gate, pressed from outside four wide, was floated seven wide out of the turn and came up empty. LISTEN DISTINCTLY pressed briefly
inside then continued to chase, dropped back and faded.
