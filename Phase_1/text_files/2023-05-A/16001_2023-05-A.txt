Footnotes
UPTOWN BIGBADJON well rated while reserved off the pacesetters for the first half mile, commenced an inside rally on the turn, cut the corner to take
command in mid-stretch and cleared the field in a drive to the wire. DIXIE MOONSHINE taken in hand early, started a steady drive into the turn, circled the
field six wide and finished full of run to gain the place. TOP COP tracked the pace to the far turn, loomed up boldly to take a brief lead between calls and
flattened out in the drive. FABLED RULER stalked the pace throughout in striking position and failed to mount a rally. BABY ITS COLD pressed the early
pace for a half mile, took the lead at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. PRINCE CURLIN rushed up to take a clear lead in the first turn, sped off from
the field for a half mile and faltered. MAN IN THE MIDDLE broke inward leaving the gate, dropped to the back of the pack and showed little.

Footnotes
DIXIE CARROUSEL chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn, came out four wide in the upper stretch then
closed with fire to be up just in time. RUN WITT RUN lead the way into the first turn and into the second turn, then vied with outer rivals in late stretch,
drifted out while retaining bid but was caught in the end. QUEEN OF BEERS stalked the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive down the backstretch
and throughout the far turn, rallied in the early stretch then vied between rivals in the final furlong but was floated out and was best for show in the end. MY
PATRIOTIC GIRL chased the pace while two wide throughout the first half of the course then rallied on the far turn to vie for lead from the three path in the
late stretch, was in tight, and taken up, giving way in the end. DIAMONDS N ACES settled in the two path down the backstretch then bid while three wide on
the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. GUITAR GROUPIE settled along the inside then bid on the far turn and was no menace.
THETEASERGOTLOOSE raced in the middle of the field while two wide, then faded gradually throughout the course and failed to rally in the end. There
was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OJECTION following the race. The rider of MY PATRIOTIC GIRL claimed foul against the rider of DIXIE
CARROUSEL for interference in the stretch. After reviewing the replay, RUN WITT RUN was disqualified from second and placed fourth for interference in
the late stretch.

WILL TAKE CASH pressed the pace from three wide to the head of the lane and drew clear convincingly to the wire. FREEPORT well placed behind the
front trio of leaders, saved ground into the stretch, angled out and finished well in a nice try. LIVINGSTON reserved of the pace early, rallied in the lane and
closed well to be gaining late. MIAMI MOONLIGHT taken in hand to be well off the pace, mounted a strong belated rally in the stretch. MR. MUNNINGS
dueled for the lead from the start from between horses to midway down the lane and weakened late in the drive. CATCHEM IF YOU CAN tracked the pace
through the turn and lacked a closing response. JUST WHISKEY dueled on the lead from the rail to upper stretch and gave way. OLCZYK went evenly
failing to respond when called upon. GWYNETH'S MALIBU briefly contended for half mile but failed to threaten. G B'S TURBO was never a factor. WITT'S
ROJO dropped back after a quarter mile and was outrun.

BREW CREW tracked the leaders through the turn, swung out to take command midway down the stretch, drifted out through the lane while pulling clear.
GRAZEN IN THE PARK slow early to trail, circled the field in the turn to be wide at the top of the lane and closed with a rush to be gaining late and garner
the place. LOVING LUCKY tracked the leaders to the quarter pole and rallied well in the lane to be up for the show. JAMES'S MOONSHINE broke alertly to
take the lead from the gate, ducked out interfering with most of the field approaching the gap leaving the chute, opened a clear lead down the backstretch,
battled to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. TENACIOUS LION pressed the pace to the far turn, took the lead at the quarter pole and flattened out
in the stretch. UNCORKED HUMOR stalked the pace from four wide, drifted out in the turn while mounting a challenge and lacked a response when called
upon. GAMMA RAY broke in leaving the gate bumping rival and went evenly as no threat. PROUD TO SERVE raced mid-pack to the far turn and failed to
mount a bid. SCHOENHARDT showed brief early foot, dropped back and was never a threat.

IMA BLING CAT lead the way along the inside, was confronted for the lead by an outer rival on the turn, then kicked clear in the late stretch under a strong
hand drive to prove best. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY chased the pace while three wide, then rallied in the early stretch to close with force in the end. FLIP THE
COIN JAN tracked the pace while two wide into the turn, then menaced from the five path in the upper stretch to close strong in the end. OPTIMAL
COURAGE chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied gamely down the lane but came up empty in the end.
DECLINED was moving up along the inside to duel with an inner rival throughout the turn, was hard used and tired in late stretch. POMEROY HAZE chased
the pace while two wide into the turn then flattened out in the end. LAB RAT tracked the pace from the inside then made a mild bid on the turn but came up
evenly and needed more in the end. BELEWS GOLD settled in the three path and raced at an even pace throughout and needed rally in the end. YANKEE

Footnotes
SONNEMAN reserved off the early pacesetters, rallied from the back into the turn, swept to the lead and drew off as much best down the lane. PALATIAL
TIMES pressed the pace down the backstretch, moved to the leaders on the turn, took a brief lead, was out-finished by the winner while proving second
best. IMPLICATOR slow early to trail the field, launched a rally late in the turn and finished with a belated rally to get up for the show. DRIVEHAPPY tracked
the pace to the far turn, made a brief bid and finished evenly late. MAU MAU settled into a tracking position early, dropped back in the far turn and passed
tiring rivals down the lane. PICKNNGRINN set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. SPERLE prompted the leader for a half mile and
came up empty. DISCO DANZING made a middle move into contention down the backside and flattened out.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THUNDER dueled from the inside down the backstretch and throughout the turn, then continued to rally gamely while vying for the lead down
the lane and was up just in time to prove best. DOC'S BUD raced in the middle of the pack while four wide, was gaining on the turn to menace from the four
path in the upper stretch and was closing belatedly to be up for the place position. MAGICAL GOLD chased the pace while two wide, was moving up on the
turn to vie for the lead from the three path down the stretch, and was closing strong and was best for the show prize. LOCKSMITH LEAH dueled with an
inner rival down the first half and into the turn, then vied for the lead between rivals down the lane, then gave way in the end. DEL MAR LABOR DAY was
off slowly at the start, then raced in the two path, bid on the turn while four wide to rally in the stretch but it wasn't enough in the end. PERSONAL ISSUES
raced in the middle of the field from the inside, then made a mild bid from the four path in the upper stretch but came up empty in the end. SHE'S
SPELLBOUND chased the pace along the inside, then faded throughout the second half of the course and was no threat. SLIM CAUSEWAY settled along
the inside throughout and was no rally. CANDY DAY settled in the three path and was no menace.

Footnotes
CLIFF DIVER stalked the pacesetter through the far turn, took command at the top of the lane and cleared in a determined drive. KAZAN (IRE) reserved off
the early pace, made a steady gain through the turn and close willingly in game effort to garner the place. SEDUCTIVE U S A slow early to settle near the
rear of the field, rallied in the turn circling the pack and closed with a rush to just miss the place. GO SPEED RACER GO well positioned at the head of the
second flight, rallied down the lane but was outkicked for the major placings. FRED'STWIRLINCANDY took command down the frontside the first time, set a
lively pace, dug in when challenged turning for home but weakened late in the drive. GOLD MONEY tracked the pace to be in striking distance at the head
of the lane but lacked a late response down the stretch. BUBBA BLING was well rated along the fence in mid-pack and failed to mount a rally finishing
evenly. WAR CHEST raced near the rear of the field throughout posing no threat. MANOR BORN positioned in mid-field for the first half mile, dropped back
through the turn and faded in the stretch. WARRIOR'S MAP raced towards the rear of the second flight and flattened out. MOOJAB JR trailed as a
non-factor.
