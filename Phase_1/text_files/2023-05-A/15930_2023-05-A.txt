Footnotes
DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE tracked along the inside, took the turn in the three path, chased while aiming between the top pair in upper stretch, bid inside of
a leading and drifting GORMLEYESQUE passing the furlong pole, and drove clear. GORMLEYESQUE vied inside of a rival early on, but took back to alter
course outside of his outer counterpart leaving the eleven sixteenths pole, stalked that foe from the five path into the turn, bid in the four path turning for
home, led in upper stretch, but drifted outwardly a touch coming to midstretch as an inner bidder issued a challenge, and was bested leaving the furlong
grounds. KENTUCKY REIGN set the pace in the two path around the turn, but was headed by an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way in
upper stretch. GIRLS HOUSE chased from the four path around the turn, then lacked a bid in the five path before yielding in the final furlong. RECITE
lacked speed, required urging in the four path around the turn, and tired while hanging on her left lead. START CLASS was outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
LUNA MOTH settled off of the pace two wide, ranged up outside of the top pair and from the four path around the far turn, spun into the lane in the five path
while sustaining a bid, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and edged clear entering the final sixteenth. PARTY AT GRANTS settled off the pace along the
inside, vacated the rail turning for home, but was green to change leads in the four to five paths in upper stretch, ran on once on task in the final furlong, and
reached place via a dead heat. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD stalked three wide while keen outside of foes around the first turn, settled into stride entering the
backstretch, bid outside of the leader and from the three path at the three furlong pole, vied in the four path entering the lane as an outer rival offered a bid,
got outkicked by that one in upper stretch, fought on through midstretch, but yielded entering the final sixteenth, and was caught on the wire to share place
rewards. RUDIMENTARY DRINK stuttered a step upon leaving the gates, tracked two wide, chased from the three path while between foes around the far
turn, and lacked a bid. PROMISEMEPARADISE set the pace in the two path, met an outer challenge entering the far turn, then got headed by a pair of foes
in upper stretch, and weakened. EMBRACEABLE broke a beat slow, raced at the rear in the three to four paths, and made little impact. GOLDEN VIEW
stalked along the inside, but weakened entering the lane. PLUS POWER was reluctant to load while balking multiple times, then broke a step slow, trailed in
the two path, and got outrun.

Footnotes
ELECTRIC SENSE set a clear pace in the two path, spun into the lane in the three path, and held sway thereafter. ACACIAHELPME laid off of the pace in
the two path, swung out to the six path entering the lane, and rallied with a late kick outside of foes to gain place at the wire. SONADOR broke a step slow,
stalked along the inside, chased around the turn, yet kept on in upper stretch to gain place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds, shifted out in the final
sixteenth while leveling off, and was nailed on the wire for that position. BOURBONWITHGINGER got a bit restless in the starting gate, stalked in the three
path, floated to the four path entering the lane, and yielded on his left lead. MUSICMANSANDY hopped while off slow, trailed in the three path, and moved
up along the inside. JACKIE FLASH tracked in the four to five paths, and lacked a bid before giving way. DOMITIA LUCILLA rushed the gate pre-race, yet
settled quickly after to be prepared for the start, broke on top, but failed to sustain forward position, raced off of the pace in the four to five paths around the
turn, trailed entering the lane, and was outrun.

Footnotes
I'MHEREFORTHEPARTY took a bump from an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, gained in the three to four paths and between horses
around the far turn, sparked a duel with the new leader while entering the lane in the five path, sparred through upper stretch, exchanged brushes with that
one at the furlong grounds, then took a bump at the sixteenth pole, and forged an advantage at the wire. RAMADHAAN (IRE) broke a step slow while
getting floated outwardly by an inner rival, tucked to the inside to achieve a tracking position around the first turn, shifted to the three path at the five furlong
pole, bid outside of the top pair around the far turn, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the four path to embrace
IMHERFORTHEPARTY's challenge entering the lane, dueled with that one through upper stretch, shared blame in brushes in midstretch, but leaned out
and bumped her counterpart while clinging to an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and got nailed at the wire. MORE ROMANCE raced at the rear two wide,
gained ground in the three path around the far turn to loom a danger behind the leaders entering the lane, tipped outside of them in upper stretch but failed
to keep pace in the process, flattened out soon after, yet maintained show through the final furlong. TAP THE LINE saved ground off of the pace, tipped two
wide while gaining between horses in upper stretch, gained fourth at the furlong grounds, but leveled off and failed to threaten thereafter. FAST GAL raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position entering the backstretch, faded in the three to four paths soon after, yet regained
stride nearing the far turn, gained in the five path around that bend, turned for home within striking distance, but tired after behind floated to the six path
entering the lane. WILMORE trailed along the inside, shifted from the three path to the five path entering the lane, and failed to menace. DRE ME LESS
broke outwardly at the start, stalked three wide around the first turn, moved to press the leader entering the backstretch, but was outmoved by an outer
bidder nearing the five sixteenths pole, and faltered. BEACH KITTEN leaned out and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was
headed at the five sixteenths pole, and caved. THE RIDER OF RAMADHAAN (IRE) CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF I'MHEREFORTHEPARTY
FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) tracked in the three path, pursued the leading quartet around the far turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, bid outside of
the top pair at the furlong ground, drove past at the sixteenth pole, and was put to hand while kicking clear. EIDIKOS (GB) prompted the pace inside of the
leader into the first turn, tipped outside of that one before tugging between horses entering the backstretch, settled down the backstretch, produced a bid
along with outer rivals at the three furlong pole, led turning for home, dueled gamely inside of a pair of foes coming to midstretch, but was outkicked at the
sixteenth pole, and held place. JOYFUL APPLAUSE stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the first turn, bid three wide and between
horses entering the far turn, dueled with an inner rival in upper stretch before an outer foe joined the fray nearing the furlong grounds, got outkicked by that
one entering the final sixteenth, and was fended off for place. MO SHIRO settled far back two wide, shifted out to the four, then five, path entering the
backstretch, gained four wide at the half mile pole to press the top trio around the far turn, but lacked the needed punch to produce a bid. BREAKER OF
CHAINS trailed along the inside, improved position down the backstretch to be just behind the leading group entering the far turn, saved ground around that
bend, shifted off the rail approaching midstretch, but only managed to chase through the final furlong. HELENS WELL (IRE) set the pace in the three path
around the first turn, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, maneuvered to the rail before meeting a trio of challenges at the three furlong pole, got
headed turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. JE SUIS RAPIDE laid off of the pace along the inside, and was outrun around the far turn. TAKE
CHARGE BRIANA pursued from midpack in the two path, then between horses approaching the far turn, but sustained an injury in upper stretch, fell, and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
MUSIC AMORE tugged clear under a snug hold around the first turn, settled into stride while well handled down the backstretch, met an outer challenge
turning for home, repelled that foe in upper stretch, and kicked clear. WATERS OF MEROM tracked two wide, bid around the far turn, but was turned away
in upper stretch, and held place thereafter. SACRED BEAUTY was fractious in the starting gates, tracked along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, and
chased the top pair through the final furlong to prove best of the rest. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO lacked speed two wide into the first turn, tucked to the rail
around that bend, then saved ground around the far turn, but to no avail. SHE'S GONE D'WILD pursued from midpack three wide, chased under urging
around the far turn, and tired. ADDISON broke a step slow before taking back from tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace three to
two wide early on, took the far turn in the four path, and made little impact. ZAWADI lagged behind down the backstretch, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SWEET AZTECA set the pace inside of a hounding through a quick opening quarter, dueled with that one around the turn, spun into the lane in the two path
as his counterpart faltered an another outer foe menaced, yet held firm from chasers on either side through midstretch, and inched further away in the final
sixteenth. LITTLE PRANKSTER tracked in the three path, ranged up in the four path in hopes of bidding in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with the
leader approaching the furlong grounds, and held place from an inner rival through the late stages. GENEROUS LOVER tracked along the inside, then
chased along the rail through the lane. MISS ARLINGTON prompted the pace two wide, sparred around the turn, but weakened between horses in the three
path entering the lane. PRINCESS POM POM lacked speed inthe three path, improved in the two path past outer foes in upper stretch, and failed to
menace. SACRED CIRCLE lacked speed in the four to five paths, and failed to factor. BIRDIE ROSE pursued from midpack along the inside, but faded.
MAMBA OUT trailed in the four path, shifted from the five path to the six path in upper stretch, and never got involved. GIADA laid off of the pace two wide,
spun into the lane in the four path, but shied mildly from an inner rival while between horses at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. HAPPY AM I
lacked speed three to two wide, and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
COPPOLA bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced forwardly along the inside, checked slightly while up on the leaders heels approaching the turn,
settled into stalking stride around the bend, smoothly split foes two wide coming to midstretch, bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear soon after.
MISTER MMMMM bumped with an inner foe leaving the gates, saved ground off of the pace, then sustained a rail chase to bid for place at the sixteenth
pole, and forged that position at the wire. DIAMOND CITY dueled for the lead along the inside, led entering the lane, but failed to resist COPPOLA's bid
leaving the furlong grounds, and lost place to an inner foe at the wire. WILLTORUN laid off of the pace three wide, spun into the lane in the six path, and
stayed on. CHARCOAL sparred for the lead with an inner rival while remaining a path away around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper
stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. THANKS MR. EIDSON took bumps from rivals on each side at the start, stalked the
embattled leading pair from the four path, but lacked a bid while getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, and gave way, bled. AGENT PETER
GRAVES broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked
a kick to split foes. ALL IN SYNC broke out and bumped a rival at the start, then was shuffled back when put to crowded quarters in the aftermath, laid off of
the pace in the two path, swung to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. CHASING ARTIE was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the
start before being squeezed back soon after, then was outrun along the inside, and got vanned off.

PROVE WORTHY shifted out and bumped a foe in the opening stages causing a chain reaction for outer rivals, tracked along the inside, pursued two wide
