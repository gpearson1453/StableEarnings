Footnotes
LOVE TO ZOOM was bumped leaving the gate but took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, dueled
clear at the rail at the quarter, was steadily handled through the upper stretch then coasted later yards. EX RATED rounded the first turn about the four path,
started a bid nearing the three quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out nearing the head of the lane and dueled through the stretch for
second. CEDARS BULLS EYE settled off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and came along for third the
final yards. M'LADY THATCHER rated close, challenged toward the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then flattened inside the eighth
pole. BOCA BIRDIE lunged from the gate and saved ground well off the pace, bid past the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and
finished evenly to pass rivals outside. SARAH'S WARRIOR came in and made contact with Love To Zoom leaving the gate then rated close inside, picked
up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. HOVEL rounded the opening turn about the four
path then saved ground on the second turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER was not a factor.
The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Love To Zoom for alleged interference on the far turn, lodged by the rider of
M'Lady Thatcher.

Footnotes
SHENANDOAH CAT tapered inward and took over approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and was kept alert
through the lane. JUBA'S HOUSE was roughed off the heels of Shenandoah Cat approaching the seven sixteenths pole, quickly recovered stride to give
chase from that point and rounded the turn about the three path, dug in from the head of the lane and got up for second under the wire. SISTER JOANN
pressured the pace but steadied from the heels of Shenandoah Cat in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, gave chase past the pole, rounded the turn near
the rail and was nipped from second under the wire. LUNAR PRAYER had a brief early lead then pressured the pace from the three eighths pole, raced
close two deep on the turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. TWO STEP SALLY ducked outward and made contact with.
RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and flattened in the lane. The latter was
squeezed leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the four and five paths and passed rivals in the lane. BALI BALIFLY
chased inside, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. EMBERLY ducked in and made contact with Risksrhighpayislow leaving the gate,
engaged in close early chase but faded past the five sixteenths pole. SHAKE IT GIRL gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then drifted toward
the head of the lane. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Shenandoah Cat for interference in the vicinity of the seven
sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Juba's House.

NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES stalked from the three path, closed to the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear approaching the head of the lane
and widened under steady handling. C R'S MANDATE rated close off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path and cleared second inside the sixteenth pole. SPUNMAN rounded the opening turn about the four path, started a bid approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came along for third later yards. MISSIONSNINETYNINE took over and moved to the inside to
rate the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.
UNCAPTURED STORM ducked out and hit the gate and made contact with Hot Fudge Sonde at the break then saved ground well off the pace, picked up
the chase approaching the three eighths pole and improved position, but was blocked at the rail on the far turn. SUBJECT TO CHANGE settled in the three
and four paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. JAXJAXXORJACKS raced with the pace two
deep, dueled into the backstretch but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and faded on the far turn. HOT FUDGE SONDE was bumped off stride
leaving the gate then settled off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the five path of the far turn.

Footnotes
EXCALIBUR settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, surged from
mid-stretch and got up in the final strides. LADDIE LIAM rounded the first turn in the three path then saved ground racing well off the pace, bid from the half
mile pole, steadily improved in the five path on the far turn and dug in through the lane to take second under the wire. LIQUID LOUIE settled just off the
pace about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep midway on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement
leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole,
ceded the nod at the rail midway on the far turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened later yards. RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground well
off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and weakened in the lane. TOP HAT TREASON rated off the pace
inside, showed little response through the backstretch and faded into the far turn. DR. FERBER was not a factor. DUNLUCE CAISSLE raced well off the
pace in the three and four paths. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the
far turn.
