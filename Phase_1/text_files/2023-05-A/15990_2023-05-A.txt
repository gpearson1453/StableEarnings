Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MAN was hustled to the early lead, was challenged half way down the backstretch and shared command around the far turn but edged
clear at the top of the stretch and won going away. CLARESTOWN was off the pace in the two path around the first turn then moved up to force the pace
around the far turn but was no match for the winner. COFFEE COUNTY was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a mild three wide bid on the
far turn but lacked the late response needed. MOTAWAAFEQ saved ground down the backstretch then moved between horses on the final turn to be best
of the rest. BONUS APPRECIATION was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from three wide to improve position. BARAHIN was hustled
along early to be placed off the pace and faded after a half. WITCH'S VOW remained back.

TOUCHUPONASTAR pressed the pace around the first turn then took command with six furlongs left and drew away to prove much the best. DOUBLE
STAR tracked the leaders from off the rail down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn but was no match for the winner. HIGHLAND
CREEK was off the pace in the two path around the first turn then moved up entering the final turn and was out kicked in the stretch. BEHEMAH STAR
saved ground down the backstretch then moved out to four wide on the final turn but never made a serious bid. CALCULATED set the early pace around
the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch and was out run.

Footnotes
PLAY MASTER was five wide into the first turn then stalked the pace from the two path, made a three wide bid on the final turn and fought gamely in the
stretch but veered in in the final jumps causing TSURIS to steady but was able to hold on for the win. TSURIS vied for the lead from the two path then took
the lead at the three furlong pole drifted out slightly at the top of the stretch and fought gamely inside of PLAY MASTER in the drive but had to steady late.
KAT'S SOLDIER raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from four wide at the half pole, tipping out to five wide in upper stretch and proved
to be best of the rest. ST PIERRE saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn,
moved out to six wide in upper stretch for a late run to improve position. CREOLE REB hopped at the start and bumped with CUSTOM DANCER then raced
back down the backstretch moved out to three wide to make a bid on the final turn but was not enough. KATS PICK was always back. RICKY RIGHT was
hustled to a pressured lead to the three eighths pole and tired. GLITTER STORM tracked the leaders down the backstretch but was not a threat. CUSTOM
DANCER was off the pace in the three path to the five furlong pole and slowly retreated. AN STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED ALONG WITH A
JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF TSURIS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF PLAY MASTER FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE
WIRE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS ALLOWED AND PLAY MASTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO SECOND
FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.

Footnotes
BLACK SWORD broke outward at the start then vied for the lead from four wide to the half pole, then made a rebid from three wide in upper stretch and
drew clear in the stretch. X CLOWN dueled for the lead from the three path, stayed on gamely in the stretch and held the place. BIG CHOPPER had an
awkward start spotting the field several lengths, gained momentum on the turn while moving out to four wide at the three sixteenths pole for a late rally to be
up for show. BERTIE'S GALAXY dueled for the lead from two wide then edged away on the turn and fought gamely in the stretch but was out finished late.
RELENTLESS DANCER tracked the leaders to the turn then moved up from two wide on the turn, moving out to three or four wide in the stretch but was
empty. NO PEDIGREE vied for the lead from the inside to the half pole and faded.

Footnotes
FINISHWHATUSTARTED vied for the lead from three wide early then dueled from two wide on the turn and down the stretch and proved best. FIRE
VISION had good speed then dueled on the turn and down the stretch but couldn't hold of the winner and proved second best. PORTO DEL ACE had no
early speed then moved up from three wide on the turn and moved out to six wide in upper stretch and had a late surge for the show. LA VIE EN ROUGE
had a brief early foot then was placed off the pace on the turn and was game down the stretch but was out kicked late. HIGHER NOTE was forwardly placed
on the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn and was out finished in the stretch run. SWAMP ROCK was off the pace on the inside but failed
to menace. ELLA'S BABY raced near the back early then moved to three wide on the turn and angled in at the three sixteenths pole to improve position.
SWEETHEART VISION was slightly fractious in the gate then raced back to the turn, made a mild bid but was not a factor. STARRY STARRY DAY saved
ground to no avail. HERECOMESGOODBYE showed little. LADY KRISTEN raced in the middle of the pack then moved out to three wide at the three
eighths pole and out farther to five wide in upper stretch but was no a threat.
