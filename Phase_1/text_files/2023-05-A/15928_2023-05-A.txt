Footnotes
FAT AND FURIOUS lacked early speed, checked nearing the three-eighths marker, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a
furlong to run and drew off as a handy winner. CURIOUS INJI broke sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive and came
back to regain the place. PANCAKES AND BEER stalked the leaders from between foes, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear lead
into the stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. IMPULSUS raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, drifted in and out
in mid-stretch and lacked the needed rally. EARLYNTHEMORN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a
half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

PRINCESS JAYLEEN dueled for the lead with MISCHIEF MAME while racing four-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and drew clear with a sixteenth
to run. IZE SMILING was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. MISCHIEF MAME was
away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied into mid-stretch and gave way. FULL SPIRIT showed brief speed,

ANNA'S IRON MAN set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. GO LAKER GO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but
clearly second best. RIGHT TO SUE was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
UNSTOPPABLE ME lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. PARTYOFSIXTEEN was forwardly placed early,
moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. SUGAR SHANE was off slow, lagged early, raced off the rail and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

CHEERIO bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to race just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the
drive but finished well to gain the place. SILVER DASH was away in good order then reserved just off the leaders, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished with good late energy. GOLD CRUSHER set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and gave way through the final furlong.
NUMEROLOGIST lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. TRY TO CAPTURE broke sharply to press the pace while racing
three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. LINCHTOWN was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE

Footnotes
GOOD BOY ROY was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with GATO SICILIANO disposed of that rival after going three furlongs,
opened a clear lead and held sway to the wire. MIGHTY TIGER lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy.
WESTERN CHARM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
evenly. DALE'S ADDICTION lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. SUPER INTENSE was void of early foot, raced
seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BURNIN VERNON was slow to begin, lagged far back, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer
a bid. GATO SICILIANO broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner and weakened after going three furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
