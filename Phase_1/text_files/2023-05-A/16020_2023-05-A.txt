Footnotes
CHILLY WILLY broke alertly, showed good early speed and set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out solid fractions while pressed to the quarter
marker, shook free in upper stretch while holding foes at bay to the furlong marker, kept to task to the sixteenth-pole, felt late pressure from oncoming rivals,
was fully extended in the final strides and dug in at the finish to prevail. COLONEL VARGO stalked the solid early pace, raced two wide between runners on
the turn while advancing, shifted four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied under steady left handed-urging to deep stretch, came within aim in
the final strides and just missed for the win, while winning the nod for the place on the wire. FLY WICKED EAGLE chased the solid early pace, advanced
three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly while within aim to the furlong grounds, vied between runners in deep stretch, could not get by the
determined winner in the final strides and was tagged for the place on the wire, while holding safely for the show. MR. FIGHTER forwardly placed in the
early running, pressed the solid pace to the turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, battled for the lead with CHILLY WILLY to
mid-stretch, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. WART chased the solid early pace from the inside,
advanced on the turn, saved ground into upper stretch, angled three wide inside of the furlong marker and did not rally in the final stages. BIG STICK
allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of rivals into the turn, was coaxed five wide into the stretch and did not factor in the drive.

BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly, established the early lead and set the pace to the turn, carved out moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was
confronted by SNIP nearing the furlong pole, kept to task under left-handed encouragement to deep stretch and held in a drive in the final stages to prevail.
SNIP raced close up to the moderate early pace, kept attendance to the pacesetter through the turn, advanced on BLUEBERRY MUFFIN heading to
mid-stretch, drifted out a bit approaching deep stretch, was kept to firm urging to the final stages and was outfinished, while well clear for second. PETE'S
INFERNO a bit slow into stride early on, chased the moderate pace from the rail through the turn, was steered three wide for the drive and did not offer a
late response.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST tracked the moderate pace from a ground saving position, advanced along the second turn, waited a bit behind horses nearing the top of the
lane, tipped two wide in upper stretch, responded to his rider's urging at the furlong grounds, wore down the leaders into deep stretch, took command in the
final strides and held in a drive at the end to prevail. MORE POWER TO HIM prompted the moderate fractions while outside of POUR ON THE COLE, kept
attendance to the pacesetter to the far turn, advanced in upper stretch and dueled with POUR ON THE COLE to deep stretch, took command at the
sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by ECOLOGIST in the final strides and held for second at the finish. TWIRLING DERBY forwardly placed into the first turn,
stalked the moderate fractions while three wide into the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground heading to the second turn, raced three wide to the quarter
marker, swung four wide for the drive, gained ground at mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and was up in time to secure third. POUR ON THE
COLE assumed command leaving the break, set moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker,
was confronted in upper stretch by MORE POWER TO HIM, met that bid to the sixteenth-marker and weakened in deep stretch. SUNNY SPOT shuffled
leaving the break and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle while not far back through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn, came
in a bit tight nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, lost ground at mid-stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but could not muster the
needed late response. WELLSWORT (IRE) allowed to settle early on, never far back through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, came four wide into
the far turn, was coaxed five wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and lacked a late rally.

COUNCILWOMAN JILLY forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the decent early pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run, held her
position to the half-mile pole, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the stretch, closed the gap heading to the furlong
marker, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, took command into the final stages and offered a good late run in deep stretch to prevail. AMANDA ROSE settled
off of the decent early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run while two wide, slipped to the inside heading to the second turn, advanced in upper
stretch then loomed along the inside at the furlong marker, vied for the lead into the final furlong, could not keep pace with the winner in the late stages and
was outfinished, while besting the rest. KOKO'S MOM allowed to settle in the early running, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to
the half-mile pole, came two wide into the far turn, was roused four wide for the drive, was not able to impact the top two in the final stages but closed well in
deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. MISSING PENNY broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early running, set
moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, met the bid of SPARKA and battled with that rival to
mid-stretch, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages for third. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE allowed to settle in the early stages, saved all
of the ground to the second turn and did not threaten in the stretch. SPARKA (IRE) close up in the early running, stalked the decent pace into the
backstretch run while saving ground, maintained her position to the half-mile marker, was roused into the far turn, vied for the lead at the quarter pole,
battled with MISSING PENNY to mid-stretch, lost action inside of the furlong marker and was not persevered with in deep stretch.

Footnotes
STRETCH RUN broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set moderate fractions while well rated through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, felt
mild late pressure inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prove best. IMPLICITLY stalked the moderate pace from the inside,
made a steady gain along the turn while saving ground, continued that bid to come within aim nearing the furlong pole, was not able to reel in the winner in
the final stages, closed well in deep stretch and was up in time for the place. REFI NOW stumbled at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to
stalk the moderate pace into the turn, kept attendance to STRETCH RUN to the quarter marker, lost ground at mid-stretch, could not muster the needed late
response and was outfinished for the place, while holding safely for the show. OUR EXPECTATION rated off of the moderate early pace, advanced while
outside of rivals on the turn, raced three wide into the drive, continued that bid to mid-stretch, needed more in the final stages and was outkicked in deep
stretch. QUE SERA SIR RALPH chased the moderate pace into the turn, lost ground while two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide into the
drive, offered a mild late rally but was unable to threaten in the final stages.

CRYSTAL PROOF stalked the decent early pace into the turn, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, overtook SPUN BEAUTIFUL heading into the
stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, drew away under steady urging in the final stages and was hand ridden to the wire. SHOUT IT OUT
prominent in the early running, took back to track the decent pace into the turn, raced two wide between runners through the bend, was steered four wide
into the stretch, lost a bit of ground nearing the furlong marker, closed well late, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and outfinished LIAM'S
SECRET in the final strides to secure second. LIAM'S SECRET allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the turn, improved position nearing
the quarter pole, came in tight approaching the top of the stretch, angled three wide for the drive, rallied inside of the furlong marker and just missed for
second at the finish, while holding safely for third. KITTEN'S KID stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide nearing the
quarter marker, lost ground while still within aim approaching the furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch. GET'EM TIGER prominent in the early
running, chased the decent pace into the turn, lost ground along the bend, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. MY LEGAL BET
lacked early speed, advanced three wide on the turn, swung five into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and did not factor in the final stages.
SPUN BEAUTIFUL sent leaving the break, set a decent pace into the turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with
CRYSTAL PROOF in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN showed good early speed, engaged with LOTSA PEPPER soon after the break and dueled with that foe into the turn, shook free along the
bend, raced in hand to the furlong marker, was kept to task under left-handed encouragement and drew off in the final sixteenth to be much the best. TIP
TOP GAL chased from the second flight, saved ground along the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, re-rallied in upper stretch, closed in the final
furlong, was no match for the winner in the late stages and held safely for second at the finish. MARILYN'S SMILE allowed to settle in the early running,
raced two to three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive, was full of run at the furlong marker, could not sustain that bid in the final stages and
finished evenly, while holding for third. PERFECT STORIES shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground through the
turn, made a quick move at mid-stretch and advanced into the final furlong, navigated through traffic in deep stretch and was gaining in the final sixteenth.
LOTSA PEPPER broke alertly, was prominent in the early running and pressed the fast pace into the turn, lost a bit of ground to BABY KRISTEN along the
turn, could not keep pace with BABY KRISTEN heading to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages. SWANEE chased the fast early pace, raced two wide
along the turn, came three wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and weakened in the late going. GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA chased the
lively early pace, came two wide to the quarter marker, was steered four wide into the stretch and did not rally in the final stages.

Footnotes
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) allowed to settle early on, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained his position to the half-mile pole, advanced two
wide on the second turn, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, closed well to the furlong marker, battled with BROOKYS TAPIT to the sixteenth-pole,
found more in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail. BROOKYS TAPIT settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the
backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, loomed in upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, gained command inside of the furlong
pole, battled with LORD WIMBORNE to the sixteenth-marker, relented in deep stretch and was outfinished for the win, while holding for the place.
WALKING BOSS unhurried in the early running, was content to trail through the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the second turn, was roused five
wide into the stretch, closed well to the furlong grounds, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked, while holding safely for
third. SYNC allowed to settle in the early running, saved all of the ground to the second turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, was not able to reel in
the leaders in the final stages but was gaining in deep stretch. ON RAGLAN ROAD tracked the decent early pace, raced two wide into the backstretch run,
maintained his position to the half-mile marker, raced three wide into the second turn, advanced two wide at the quarter pole, battled with TIZONA to
mid-stretch, took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and weakened. TIZONA sent leaving the start and was
prominent in the early running, stalked the decent pace along the first turn, came three then four wide into the backstretch run, dueled for the lead with DICK
BEST through the backstretch run then assumed command heading to the far turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, met the bid of ON
RAGLAN ROAD and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, could not hold off oncoming rivals into the final furlong and faltered in the late stages.
GORDY'S BOY took back in the early running, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced to track the pace to the half-mile pole, gained ground
four then three wide on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. DICK BEST hustled leaving the break, set decent early
fractions into the backstretch run, conceded the lead to TIZONA and stalked that rival to the half-mile marker, saved ground to the second turn, lost position
nearing the quarter pole, re-rallied in upper stretch but could not sustain that run in the final stages and faded.
