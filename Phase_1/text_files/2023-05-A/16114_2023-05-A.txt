Footnotes
AMEDEUS MUSIC , sluggish early, was four deep on the turn stalking the pace, fanned six deep in upper stretch, closed outside foes, led late and switched
to his left lead approaching the finish. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , three deep prompting the pace around the turn, sprinted clear in upper stretch and weakened
late. GILLIGAN lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch, bumped with BBALI'S SHADE when caught in tight quarters in mid stretch then
finished willingly. HIGHLAND DREAM , three wide on the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch, drifted in a bit when reaching a striking position in
mid stretch then flattened out. DESPITE ODDS raced along the inner rail throughout and lacked the needed late effort. POLITICAL DECISION saved
ground around the turn while disputing the pace and weakened through the sttretch. BALI'S SHADE disputed the pace between horses and steadied when
bumping with GILLIGAN while caught in tight quarters in mid stretch.

Footnotes
WATER WITCH settled off the early pace while saving ground, edged up behind the leaders heading to the far turn, eased out soon after and chased two
wide outside a tiring rival, swung out wider into the lane, kept on grinding under strong right handed encouragement and forged to victory in the final strides.
DAILY PLANET rated kindly three wide while tracking the contested pace, bid three deep in hand leaving the far turn, battled outside LADRO DI FICHI into
the lane, got the better of that one in mid stretch, briefly went clear, kept on gamely but just failed to hold off the winner's charge. LADRO DI FICHI vied
outside DULINI, took a slim lead after six furlongs, was then join by the winner from her outside, sparred towards the rail from upper stretch past the eighth
pole then weakened late. DULINI grabbed command early and set a pressured pace towards the rail, was headed near the three eighths, kept on for a bit
further then faltered entering the lane.

REBELLIOUS STAGE hopped slightly at the break, angled outside DONEGAL DANNY near the three eighths pole, swept to command in upper stretch and
pulled away under brisk, left hand urging. DONEGAL DANNY broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, failed to keep up with the winner through the stretch but was well ahead of the others. JOLLY BY GOLLY ,
steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and failed to rally. MARGIE'S FUN SON raced between horses on the turn,
moved to the inner rail turning for home and weakened. MARTINI MARTIN , caught in close quarters soon after the break, swung outside in upper stretch
and showed some late interest. MALIBU RUMBLE raced in the two path entering the turn, swung four wide leaving the turn and failed to be a factor. MENO
hugged the inner rail and weakened. BETTANOT CROSS ME was outrun.

REMEMBERING WILBUR settled four wide while not too far back of the dueling leaders, advanced five wide under coaxing into the stretch, drifted in briefly
near mid stretch, corrected and sustained under solid handling, took over inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear at the wire. MONTAUK DADDY had
speed then rated just off the embattled leaders, tracked two wide mid turn, angled four wide and launched a bid entering the lane, gained a slim advantage
inside the three sixteenths, got the better of FLAMING EAST leaving mid stretch, dug in when confronted by the winner from the outside, fought on past the
sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. CALL ME MAESTRO broke a step slow, trailed three wide into the turn, shifted in some around the turn, move
up past mid stretch and kept on with some effort to earn the show. FLAMING EAST was sent up to the inside of rivals to take a slim early lead, set a
pressured pace in the two path, dueled past the five sixteenths, brushed with LANTAU soon into the stretch, kept up the fight past the furlong grounds then
gave way very late. JIMMY THE KID rated off the leaders after an alert break, chased towards the inside and failed to drum up a rally. LITTLE BAY broke a
step slow, raced three wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace. LANTAU had speed three wide and contested the pace outside FLAMING EAST,
stayed on past the quarter pole, exchanged a brush in upper stretch then tired through the final furlong. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND RACING
COMMISSION, MONTAUK DADDY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

TAP N GLO , well off the duel while two wide around the turn, eased outside mid stretch, closed and got up late. SWEET BEAUTY saved ground around the
turn, disputed the pace and weakened late. BLUEBERRY INDYGO rushed up early, disputed the pace outside SWEET BEAUTY, remained on her left lead
in the drive and tired. BLETCHLEY GIRL , always inside horses, failed to menace. PERFORMANCEANXIETY lacked speed, swung outside leaving the turn
and passed tired rivals. INCONTROVERTIBLE , three wide stalking the duel around the turn, gave way the final furlong. FIVECOMMATWO was not a
factor.

Footnotes
MARIA FROM MIAMI , with the pace three deep and under rating, responded to stout asking in upper stretch and kicked well clear, wandered outward
under left handed encouragement through the final sixteenth, met an outside challenge from ROYAL PARTY in deep stretch and got the perfect bob.
ROYAL PARTY drifted out a bit at the break then checked when pinched, recovered and trailed two wide leaving the far turn, gathered some momentum
past the five sixteenths, swung out five wide into the lane, straightened away, closed gamely through the final furlong, drew alongside the winner in deep
stretch and got the bad end of the nose bob. WINDS OF FORTUNE rated towards the inside early on, eased out and edged up between rivals leaving the
far turn, angled four wide approaching the stretch and closed steadily. SUPER JO JO broke sharply and took a short lead between foes, dueled between
runners into and around the turn, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. SNOOZE BUTTON was urged along inside a pair of runners while contesting the
pace, fought on into the lane, failed to keep pace past mid stretch and gave way. SK'S HEART , three wide nearing the turn, pursued the duelers around the
turn and gave way. BIZ AS USUAL was outrun. AZTEC BAY saved ground with early pursuit, dropped back after appearing to shy from the rail nearing the
turn, saved ground into the lane, faded and was reported by the stewards to have bled. SONNY AND MAX gave early chase four wide and retreated around
the turn.

Footnotes
OUT OF SORTS had speed inside then was rated back off the leader around the first turn, prompted the pace while saving ground through the backstretch
run, eased out leaving the three eighths and was put to a hard chase, kept on determinedly under left handed asking leaving mid stretch, reeled in
CASHING BIG CHECKS in deep stretch and went clear at the wire. CASHING BIG CHECKS vied outside the winner before clearing around the first turn,
set a solid pace just off the inside, was under a drive maintaining a clear advantage past the three sixteenths, remained in front past the sixteenth pole, gave
way grudgingly and saved the place. DRY WELL was steadied when in close at the break, regrouped and raced under a firm hold saving ground into the
backstretch, eased out near the five eighths, circled four wide into the stretch and steadily gained. MISTY MAUVE tracked the pace two wide, shifted in
some with a bit of progress into the stretch, gave chase past mid stretch then flattened out. SURYA settled well back while about three wide, was coaxed
along outside a runner leaving the far turn, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a serious finish. EIGHT DANZAS , off the pace and four wide past the
five eighths, failed to respond. DOUBLE FIREBALL , three wide pursuing, remained a presence to about the quarter pole then gave way. BOURBON
WILDCAT , three wide stalking the pace, tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
THE GREAT GAZOO stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn, was fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, was deftly
handled when attempting to get in and got up late. BAR DOWN EXPRESS saved ground around the turn disputing the pace, drifted to the five path in upper
stretch, finished gamely and brushed with BOX N BEN in deep stretch. BOX N BEN dueled outside BAR DOWN EXPRESS around the turn, floated to the
six path in upper stretch, was caught in close quarters inside the sixteenth pole and brushed with BAR DOWN EXPRESS in deep stretch. MONEY ROOM
stalked the duel while three wide on the turn, was angled in near the eighth pole and lacked the necessary rally. POLSAR raced in the two path inside
horses on the turn and lacked a rally. EL PATOJO raced in the two path on the turn and faltered. SURF CITY GOLD , four deep on the turn, faltered.
BUSTERMARTIN BROWN , kept along the inner rail, was outrun. Objections by the rider of BOX N BEN against THE GREAT GAZOO and BAR DOWN
EXPRESS for alleged interference in deep stretch were not allowed.
