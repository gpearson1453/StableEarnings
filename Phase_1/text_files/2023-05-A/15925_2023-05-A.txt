FREE SPEECH dueled from the inside early , put away foe at the top of the stretch and won easily. BOATSWAIN trailed early, moved wide around the
turned and rallied for the place. PROFESSIONAL was reserved early rallied mildly for the show. WHISKEY SUNRISE saved ground to the stretch and
finished evenly. ZAINO BOYZ disputed the early pice and gave way readily. BOO BE RIGHT was up close early and tired late. EPIC WEST was never a
factor.
