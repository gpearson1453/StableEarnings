OFF THE CHARTS good position to split horses to lead at the half, stayed clear under stout handling to the wire. COMMANDANDCONTROL lagged back
off rail to the stretch, rallied along in the final furlong while all out for the place spot in a good effort. MAMBO KITTEN inside speed to duel to far turn but
weakened in the stretch run while best of the rest. PASSO A FRENTE pressed pace early and went evenly thereafter on wrong lead. TRULY A DREAM
raced along evenly while saving ground to no avail. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY good position outside first turn with a steady fade from there. AUNT RUTH
always trailed throughout.
