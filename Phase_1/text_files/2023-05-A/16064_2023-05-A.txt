Footnotes
ROYAL JUBILEE set the pace in the two path, settled back when FUNTASTICA became intent on the lead early on the backstretch, re-bid in the three path
rounding the far turn, regained command near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held safe under a steady drive. STUCK IN MALIBU
raced off the pace three wide, advanced under urging four wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner throughout the stretch run but was only
able to gain mildly on the winner. MAJOR PRYCE raced in range three and four wide, shifted in in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. DULCE
AMBICION raced well back three and four wide and had a mild gain outside. FUNTASTICA fought rating in the four path around the first turn, took the lead
early on the backstretch, cleared soon after, set the pace in the two path to the five-sixteenths marker and gave way. UPSTREET threw his head at the
start, chased pace in the two path and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
IL MALANDRINO bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the six path, ranged up and bid from the five path around the turn, stuck a head in front
passing the quarter pole, floated out to the six path into the stretch and held way under right handed encouragement. NATURAL VIBES bumped with an
inner foe at the start, raced up close under a hold in the four path, was cued early around the turn and driven from the three path into the stretch, and kept
on for place. ANTILLEAN set the pace in the three path, was coaxed from the two path when challenged by a pair of outer foes around the turn, lost the lead
along the inside passing the quarter, and finished evenly down the lane for show. MOUSEFAST raced off the pace in the five path, tipped inwards and was
ridden in the three path around the turn, but did not factor from the five path in the stretch. FUN AMERICAN stalked in the two path, lost ground while
shifting out around the turn, and did not threaten out in the eight path down the lane. DEN STREET had a slow start and always trailed from the five to nine
paths.

was repelled by the winner in upper stretch, and chased on for place. SPEEDY HANS tracked inside of foes in the two path, was driven along while tipping

ROCKIN ROLLER chased in the two path, advanced under rousing around the turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, was herded outwards while
making a bid into the final furlong, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth to win. CRUZIN MAN set the pace inside, floated out to the four
path into the lane, drifted out while fighting on into the final furlong, and was caught by an outer foe in the closing stages to place. LOYAL LOUIE raced off
the pace in the four path, was under a drive while fanning out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. ROLLING ON stalked in the five path
but was one paced from the six path down the lane. PAPA KATZ trailed in the three path early but did not factor. NERVE pressed in the three path but
gaveway turning into the lane.
