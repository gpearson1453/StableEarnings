Footnotes
ALL forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate pace while two wide through the turn, was roused at the top of the lane, collared
JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT in upper stretch, kept to task inside of the furlong marker and drove clear under steady late urging to prevail.
BOUNDFORJAMAICA chased the moderate early pace, ran in pursuit while three wide on the turn, gained ground nearing the furlong pole, could not keep
pace with ALL in deep stretch and ran on in the final stages to secure second. JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT hopped slightly leaving the start, was hustled to get
to the early lead and dictated terms to the turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter maker, was collared in upper stretch by ALL, chased that foe to the
furlong grounds, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. HALF HOPING chased the moderate early pace,
angled to the outside of rivals into the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed four wide into the stretch and lacked a late rally. COASTAL
STARLITE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, could not sustain that rally into the final furlong and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the half-mile
marker, made a steady gain while three wide into the stretch, came within aim of the leaders nearing the sixteenth-marker, rallied between runners in deep
stretch and surged in the final strides to prevail. LOVE CANDY was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong pole while outside of rivals, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker, just
missed for the win in the final strides and was up in time to secure the place. IL CAPITANO was asked to show speed leaving the break and set the early
pace, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure at the quarter marker, battled with LOOKIN FOR REVENGE to mid-stretch, was
able to hold that rival at bay into deep stretch, was confronted inside of the sixteenth-marker by oncoming top pair and was gamely bested in the final strides
for the win and place, while holding for the show. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE forwardly placed early on, stalked the solid pace three wide into the backstretch
run, advanced two wide approaching the quarter marker, battled for the lead in upper stretch, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was
outfinished. NO HANG CHARLIE prominent in the early running, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, stopped along the second turn,
was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
CHRIS FIX forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the modest fractions through the backstretch run, was roused two wide approaching the quarter
marker, battled for the lead with PORT O' CALL to mid-stretch, drifted through the lane while kept to firm urging, was able to shake free from the stubborn
runner-up in deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prove best. PORT O' CALL settled early on while never far back, raced two wide into the
backstretch run, made a steady gain into the far turn, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead in upper stretch with CHRIS
FIX, stayed right on that rival's flank into mid-stretch, could not match strides with CHRIS FIX inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished, while
besting the rest. TAKE THE TWO TEN allowed to settle in the early running, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, continued his advanced two
wide along the second turn, gained ground nearing mid-stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, was outkicked by the top pair in the late stages
and held clearly at the finish for third. TIZ A THRILL assumed command leaving the break and showed the way into the first turn, set moderate fractions
through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong pole and
faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
ZIPPY BABY allowed to settle early on while never far back, saved ground into the turn while advancing, was roused at the top of the stretch and tipped two
wide for the drive, loomed at the furlong marker and overtook WICKLOW HILLS, took command and kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, inched away from
the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. SONOFAFINCH unhurried in the early running, advanced three wide on the turn, was roused
four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and came within aim at the furlong marker, was outfinished by ZIPPY BABY in the final sixteenth and bested
the rest. WICKLOW HILLS engaged with MOB BOSS in the early stages and disputed the pace with that rival, shook free into the turn and set solid fractions
through the quarter marker, led into upper stretch while on the left lead, was collared by ZIPPY BABY at mid-stretch, weakened in the late stages and held
safely in the end for third. EL BERRINCHES chased the solid early pace, raced two wide along the turn, was steered three wide for the drive, Monroy lost
his crop heading to mid-stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a late rally. BALLROOM HUSTLER lacked early speed, saved ground through
the turn and did not factor. MOB BOSS was a bit washy before loading and was fractious in the starting gate, was away in good order, contested the early
pace with WICKLOW HILLS then took back off of that rival and stalked into the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, was coaxed three wide
into the stretch, lost position at the furlong marker and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
DOS VICIOS tracked the moderate pace, was roused two wide along the second turn, drew to even terms with EFFECTIVE GIG in upper stretch, battled
with that rival to the furlong grounds, repelled EFFECTIVE GIG heading to the sixteenth-marker and drew clear under steady urging to the wire. EFFECTIVE
GIG settled off of the early pace, maintained a three wide path into the backstretch run, inched closer heading to the half-mile marker, loomed three wide at
the quarter pole, met the bid of DOS VICIOS in upper stretch, battled with that rival to the furlong pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch and was turned
away, while just holding for second at the finish. WILD BILLY D took back in the early running, raced two wide into the backstretch run, advanced to stalk
the pace to the half-mile marker, kept that two wide path into the far turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, rallied in deep stretch and just missed for
second on the line, while getting up in time to secure third. SNAKE ISLAND was sent in the early stages and assumed command into the first turn, set
modest fractions through the backstretch run, was overtaken nearing the quarter marker, stayed on well in the drive while chasing the leaders and was just
outfinished for the minor awards in deep stretch. BIG DIFFERENCE was allowed to settle early on while never far back, saved ground to the second turn,
raced two wide into the stretch and did not rally.

Footnotes
BOTH AT FAULT well placed in the early running, rated just off of the pace while two wide through the turn, slipped to the rail in upper stretch, overtook
CASH'S CAT nearing the furlong pole, met the bid of CHAOKOON inside of the furlong marker, dueled to the inside of that foe to deep stretch, drifted out in
the final stages under firm left-handed urging and dug in at the finish to prevail. CHAOKOON unhurried in the early running, was roused four wide along the
turn, loomed nearing the furlong pole, confronted BOTH AT FAULT inside of the furlong marker, dueled to the wire with that foe, could not get by the game
winner in deep stretch and was denied for the win, while well clear of the rest. UPDRAFT chased the decent early pace, advanced while three deep on the
turn, swung five wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker, lacked the needed late response but passed tiring foes in the final sixteenth and was
up in time to secure third. CASH'S CAT prominent in the early running, pressed the decent early fractions, kept close attendance to SMOKIN BLAZE then
took command nearing the quarter marker, led into upper stretch, was overtaken by BOTH AT FAULT at mid-stretch, faltered in the final stages and was just
edged for third in the final strides. WOLF'S LIFE raced close to the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and
gave way in the final furlong. WEE BEASTIE chased the decent early pace, raced two wide into the turn, slipped to the rail in upper stretch, lost position at
the furlong grounds and weakened in deep stretch. SMOKIN BLAZE contested the early lead with several rivals then showed good early speed and set a
pressured pace into the turn, battled with CASH'S CAT along the turn then lost the lead to that foe, dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
DEALERS HAND allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, was roused two wide in upper stretch, dove back to the inside and closed well at the
furlong marker, responded to urging and rallied along the rail heading to the sixteenth-pole, surged in the final stages, caught STANFORD BAY in deep
stretch and just held at the line to prevail in a blanket finish. GRIT AND CURIOSITY unhurried in the early running, kept a two wide path to the quarter
marker, was roused at the top of the lane and came three wide into the stretch, closed well at the furlong marker, rallied inside of the furlong pole, split rivals
while advancing inside of the sixteenth-marker, matched strides with DEALERS HAND to the finish and just missed for the win, while just getting up on the
wire for the place. STANFORD BAY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set pressured fractions through the turn while off of the rail, shook free in
upper stretch, kept to steady urging to deep stretch, was all out inside of the sixteenth-marker and was tagged on the line for the win and place, while just
holding for the show. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS lunged at the start and was off a step slowly, showed good early speed and pressed the solid pace into the
turn, kept attendance to STANFORD BAY to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit of that rival to mid-stretch, closed in deep stretch and was outfinished in the
final strides in a blanket finish. FULLY LOADED stalked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide along the turn, swung five wide for the
drive, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, closed in the final sixteenth but could not muster the needed late response.

Footnotes
MOUNT MARY (IRE) was asked to show early speed and assumed command soon after the break, set solid fractions into the turn, rated nicely while
pressed to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds while in hand, was kept to task under steady urging to
deep stretch and pulled away in the final sixteenth to be much the best. THERESASILVERLININ forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the solid pace
while outside of rivals into the turn, lost ground three deep nearing the top of the lane, chased MOUNT MARY to mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in
the final furlong and was second best at the end. BULLETPROOF TOO chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost a bit of ground heading to the
quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, did not offer a final kick in the drive and held safely in the late stages for third. ADAPTED MEMORY lacked early
speed, raced three wide along the turn, came four wide into the drive, could not muster the needed late response and passed tiring rivals in the final stages.
SWEET TESSA broke alertly, lost the early lead to MOUNT MARY and pressed that rival into the turn, kept close attendance to the decent pace to the
quarter marker, lost position heading to mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong. TUDOR'S FOREST chased the fast early pace, lost position on the turn
while two wide between runners, was outrun to mid-stretch and came up empty in the final stages. MISS FLAGG hopped then lost her path at the start and
was off slowly, trailed into the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch.
