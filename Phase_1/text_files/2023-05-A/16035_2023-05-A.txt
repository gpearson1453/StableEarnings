Footnotes
TIPSY MOON took command leaving the chute, was uncontested up front down the backside, repelled a mild challenge with three furlongs to go, opened up
while well in hand as they turned for home and cruised to the wire being geared down in the end. T'PRING took up the chase putting mild pressure outside
of the winner at the three furlong marker, was repelled quickly and chased in vain down the stretch but to no avail and just held onto the place share at the
finish. P. S. RISING STAR was unhurried four wide at the half trailing between runners, rallied three wide knifing between runners midpoint on the turn,
shifted out to the four path for a closing kick and was finishing well just missing out on second at the line. GRANDE BELLA travelled near the rear in the
early stages of the race, started a mild run midturn between horses, had clear run in the three path in upper stretch but only could put out in an even finish to
the line. LOADED MISTRESS settled in the middle of the field on the rail in the early going, roused running inside on the turn, offered little response and
was not involved running to the wire. SHE'S SO COLD broke out at the start and was steadied mildly to trail, racing behind horses was in tight quarters nine
sixteenths to go and was checked briefly, was shuffled back some on the rail through the turn and could not be a factor running to the wire. ASHWICKEN
travelled three deep in midfield down the backstretch, was ridden for more five sixteenths to go, could not gain on horses and was empty for the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
CANDY STREET was allowed to settle, advanced three wide between runners coming to the quarter pole in behind foes, found room in upper stretch,
altered outside the leader coming to the sixteenth pole and surged to get up late. PIDIN vied between runners two to three wide, moved clear coming to the
top of the stretch, was caught late. BUSTA GROOVE broke a step slowly, moved forward inside heading into the turn, angled five wide out of that bend,
gained but too late. SEATTLE POINT chased in behind the leaders, moved out five wide coming to the quarter pole, ran on. IT'S ME MARIO stumbled and
bumped with a rival at the start, settled at the back, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position. ONE MORE RING set the early tempo on a
narrow advantage, was soon faced with plenty of outside pressure, weakened in the stretch. JOE CHROME forced the pace from outside three to four wide,
weakened in the stretch. FIRST ROUND raced outside five to six wide on the turn, failed to rally. QUIET SPEED bumped with a foe at the start, went mostly
four to five wide on the turn racing off the leaders, failed to threaten. STORMIN DAVE steadied at the start, raced off the inside at the back, was not a factor.

Footnotes
SILVER MAGNATIZED had a good tracking position watching the top front duo at the half, began to reel in the frontrunners while shifting out to the four path
three furlongs from the line, collared his rivals outside as they entered the stretch and was full of run when roused to draw off in mid stretch. BATYAH trailed
the compact field at the half, saved ground inside through the far turn still at the rear, angled outside for run at the quarter pole, shifted out five wide in upper
stretch and determinedly chased the winner home in the final eighth. LOVE TO RUN hounded the frontrunner in the early going just outside, continued to
keep close order to the pacesetter as they raced through the far turn, was in the mix between rivals in upper stretch but could not match strides with the top
pair through the lane and had to settle for the show award. BUTTERED TOAST was void of early speed and trailed the pack into the first turn, continued
stalking near the back on the rail at the half, advanced on the fence through the far turn, shifted out to be six wide turning for home and levelled off running
outside foes to the wire. TWIRLING CAT took the field into the first turn, dictated the pace down the backside, was collared outside by multiple challengers
three sixteenths from the prize and faltered on the fence at the furlong marker. IMPROVISE (FR) tracked outside in the second flight mid pack down the
backstretch, could not keep pace when the running started entering the far turn, retreated as horses turned for home and could not be a presence in the late
stages of the race.

Footnotes
CRAFTY CONQUEST was urged from the break and quickly moved clear shifting in to the two path to dictate terms, had enough left to keep on well in the
stretch and hold sway under moderate urging. MALIBU SECRET chased the eventual winner going three wide on the turn, was no match but second best.
BEN LOMOND chased from third racing four wide on the turn, needed more. WONNEFRAC saved ground racing inside mid-pack and ran evenly. ONE
PUNCH CHARLIE came in sharply after the start, raced mostly four wide mid-pack through the turn and ran on in the lane. TALL WATER brushed with a
rival at the start then was forced in badly soon after, bothering other rivals in the process, moved back out and raced mostly five to six wide through the turn
and off the leaders, failed to rally. MONEY MATTERS brushed lightly at the start and was then forced in, settled inside, was not a threat. STRIKING HEIR
chased from outside five wide, came up empty. COMMANDER TOM was brushed by rivals on either side at the start then badly forced in, raced off the
inside, swung wide and failed to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY ONE PUNCH CHARLIE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND
PLACED LAST BEHIND COMMANDER TOM FOR INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START.

Footnotes
SIMCOE missed the break at the start, trailed the field on the rail into the first turn, lumbered at the rear down the backside, angled out five wide watching
the engaging foursome battle up front three furlongs from home, started to lengthen his stride to loom the threat outside rivals turning for home and wore
down the leader taking all the stretch to do it just before the finish. THE THUNDERER trailed the field four wide into the first quarter, shared the rear position
outside of runners at the half, rallied four wide to be part of the four horse front end charge at the three furlong marker, took command at the top of the
stretch in the four path and was caught just in the final strides to the wire. LANIGAN stalked five wide into the beginning turn, settled outside in the two path
down the backside in the tracking flight, fought for the leader three wide midway on the far turn, was in with a chance at the top of stretch, fought on gamely
but needed more late to threaten the top two in the end. LEGAL CATCH showed speed forcing the fractions four wide into the first turn, continued to press
the issue outside down the back straight, was part of a four pronged battle two deep midpoint on the far turn, still was in range inside in upper stretch and
faded late to settle for a minor role. UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) set the pace on the rail into the first turn and through the half, battled inside with three
others on the far turn, was the first to give way at the quarter pole on the rail and weakened in upper stretch. DOLOS settled on the rail in the second flight
having a good position down the backstretch, was shuffled to last on the fence when the running began three eighths from the line, could not keep pace with
the others two furlongs remaining and was not involved in the running down the lane.

RONDURE settled outside off the pace, advanced willingly four wide on the turn, took command near the furlong grounds and powered clear under just mild
urging. BOHEMIAN BOY moved clear and shifted in, set the pace racing just off the rail, was no match for the winner but kept on to maintain the place.
KEEPING THE EDGE stalked the pace three wide, went evenly in the lane. BRINGER OF RAIN settled inside rivals off the leaders, shifted in and raced in
the two to three path through the turn and improved position in the stretch. DAY TRIPPER tracked from inside racing up close, lacked the needed late kick.
CONCEALED CARRY raced between foes mid-pack into the turn, went three wide on that bend, came out wider for the drive and ran on evenly.
BREAKING ALONE broke a step slowly, settled at the back racing inside, angled seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly under stout urging. ON
THIN ICE broke a step slowly, raced outside a foe at the rear, shifted six wide turning for home, failed to rally. COMMANDER JOE chased briefly three to
four wide, retreated.

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE was unhurried trailing outside in the beginning, content to sit at the back outside under a strong hold when they hit the backstretch,
started to roll six wide midway on the far turn, shifted outside, continued to be in the six path at the top of the lane having a clear run, closed with a rush
under right handed urging drifting in while getting up at the wire. HADDASSAH took up the chase on the front end outside at the half mile marker, dueled
outside on the far turn for the lead, gamely fought on turning for home, started to inch away from chasing rivals inside the furlong marker but was caught by
the closing runner outside in the final strides. MONEY PRINTER broke in at the start, tracked the pace early on, settled in mid pack between foes at the half,
took up the running with rivals on either side two furlongs from home, battled for position four wide with inside foe in mid stretch, kept to the task and was
gaining late only to be steadied at the wire. FROSTED OVER set the fractions inside for the first half, was headed outside leaving the backstretch, battled
stubbornly on the fence throughout the far turn and into upper stretch, began to weaken slightly on the fence one hundred yards from the line still showing
grit inside until the end. LUCKMAN was content sitting at the rear under a snug hold down the backside, continued to see them all saving ground on the far
turn, waited behind horses looking for a seam in upper stretch, was full of run late but could not find a clear path in the final eighth and was unable to extend
his stride in the final seventy yards. DUKE OF LOVE had a good position well in hand at the half behind the front pair, waited on the far turn looking for a
clear lane to offer a run, tried to shift out off the contesting duo in upper stretch, could not find a clear path at the furlong marker, was stymied behind and
between runners in deep stretch and could run to his fullest nearing the wire. FULL SCREEN was headstrong on the first turn, continued to be eager behind
foes through the backside, put in a brief run outside runners three furlongs from the prize, was asked for more run two furlongs out, could not find more and
weakened at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUNDAY broke sharply and on top but settled in to stalk the pace, moved to challenge and took charge outside the three-sixteenths, was put to
stout hand-urging in upper stretch and quickly powered clear to be much the best. VELIKIY tracked in behind near the rail, came out for the stretch run, was
second best. MY GIRL GABBY settled just off the leaders racing outside, went three to four wide on the turn within striking distance, ran on. MISS MOLLY
LALOU was off the pace two to three wide on the turn, tipped out a bit for the stretch run and kept on mildly. SECRET SUNSHINE settled toward the rear,
raced two to three deep on the turn, improved position late. LOKI'S LIGHTNING was urged from the break, took the lead after the opening sixteenth and
moved clear to set the tempo racing inside, challenged on the turn and overtaken late on that bend, gave way. PRIVILEGED raced outside four to five wide
and failed to rally. BLACKMARSH got away slowly and lost the path at the break, switched out and was encouraged forward outside foes three to four wide
into the turn, evened out for the drive. RUMOURS FLY broke outwardly, raced inside coming out a path to pass a rival on the turn, tired in the stretch. SAKE
AND SUSHI steadied slightly racing near the inside past the seven-sixteenths, dropped back inside foes on the turn and tired.
