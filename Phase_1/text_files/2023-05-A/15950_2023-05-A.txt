Footnotes
CONDIMENT GIRL set the pace outside of a pressing rival, cleared that foe and crossed over approaching turn, showed the way in hand turning for home,
then drew off in upper stretch, and inched away under driving urging. ELLIE DELI initiated bumps with an inner rival soon after the start, pursued from
midpack in the two path around the turn, moved up between horses in midstretch to bid for place, sparred with an outer rival for that position through the
final sixteenth, and prevailed. TATTERED HEART tracked three wide, chased the clearing leader from the four path through upper stretch, dueled for place
with an inner bidderthrough the final sixteenth, but was bested. TOTAL DISCRETION had his hid quarters knocked from underneath him by an outer rival
leaving the chute, laid far back along the inside, shifted out entering the turn, took the bend in the four to five paths while attempting to range up, then ran on
evenly outside of rivals through the lane. WAR ENSIGN stalked two wide and between horses, chased the clearing leader from the three path while among
foes through the lane, but yielded nearing the final sixteenth. SONNYNEEDSMONEY prompted the pace along the inside, was taken in hand to ease back
at the half mile pole, stalked from the pocket around the bend, but weakened through the lane. FREEDOM MACHINE raced at the rear outside of a rival, but
got floated to the five, then six, paths by that foe around the turn, and got outrun.

Footnotes
ACADEMIC HONOR stalked among foes early on, inched closer outside of the top pair while under moderate coaxing around the turn, offered a bid leaving
upper stretch, wrestled a narrow advantage passing the furlong pole, and held with a measured margin from his inner game counterpart to the wire.
SCARLET STRIPE prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, dueled between horses as an outer ACADEMIC HONOR forged an advantage, then
fought on grudgingly, but failed to regain even terms. BEAUXS ARTES set the pace inside of a pressing foe, vied with that one around the turn, sustained
the duel as an outer rival joined the fray nearing midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. FINE COTTON tracked along the inside, but only managed to
chase the top trio through the lane while fending off an outer foe for fourth. BRITTLE AND YOO chased five wide, then four wide around the turn, and failed
to factor. FRANGO ELECTRICO tracked four wide and between horses, but weakened entering the turn, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP bumped an outer rival soon after the start, prompted the the pace between the leading pair early on, backed off to stalk from the two path
approaching the half mile pole, pursued comfortably from the pocket around the turn, launched a rally in upper stretch after the leader kicked clear, ranged
up outside of that one at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. TETSU laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the turn, then stayed on, bid for
place two wide in the final sixteenth, and gained that position late. MY MAN FLINTSTONE was away sharply while breaking inwardly, dueled for the lead
outside of a rival, shook free of that foe in upper stretch, held sway through midstretch before CARAMEL CHIP took aim, but proved no match for that one
approaching the final sixteenth, and faltered late. HIGH TONE laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, ran on outside
of foes, and got outkicked for show by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. MASAI MAN bumped with an inner rival while being pinched in crowded quarters
between horses at the start, recovered to vie three wide, then two wide while remaining in the three path around the turn, but gave way in upper stretch.
IMPROBABLE STORY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked the top pair from the four path, but faded between horses through the lane.

YOUALMOSTHADME broke sharp, set the pace in the three to two paths with his ears pricked as an outer rival applied pressure, shrugged off that foe
entering the lane, and coasted away handily. LOU'S LEGACY chased from the three path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on to gain
place late while no match for the winner. TRANCHE emerged from between horses to press the leader from the four path approaching the turn, but gave
way turning for home, and lost place late. LIL ANTHONY was outrun along the inside. WHO'S SNOW TROUBLE was urged along in the five path while off
of the pace around the turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
HIDDEN PATH brushed with rivals on either side early on, stalked two wide, pressed the leader into the far turn, bid turning for home, led in upper stretch,
drifted out subtly while edging clear in midstretch, flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth as an outer HE'S GOT SWAGGER pursued, and
held from that foe late. HE'S GOT SWAGGER tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair and to the four path entering the lane, chased before
shifting ground further out in midstretch to remain outside of the clear leader, kicked in to offer a late bid approaching the wire, but was kept at bay.
CURLINS INCHARGE tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the inside around the far turn, then sustained stride in the two path through the
lane to gain show at the sixteenth pole. QUALIFIED was bumped by rivals on both sides while among foes early on, settled off of the pace two wide and
between horses, shifted out to the seven path approaching midstretch, and offered a mild rally to gain fourth at the wrie. KIGALI set the pace along the
inside, met the eventual winner's bid around the far turn, got headed entering the lane, failed to keep pace in midstretch, and weakened through the final
sixteenth. MO SATURDAYS laid off of the pace three wide, got floated out to the eight path in midstretch, and moved up. NOW AND LATER tracked three
wide, spun into the lane in the five path while between horses, but only managed to chase while lacking the needed kick. MAIN LINE CIPHER got rank while
uncomfortable between horses through the lane early on, steadied back passing the wire for the first time, settled off of the pace while tucking two wide
around the first turn, gained three wide around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but flattened out between horses approaching
midstretch. ARCHIE THE GIZA brushed an outer rival early on, then took back from back from between horses crossing the sixteenth pole for the first time,
laid unhurried along the inside, surpassed an inner weakening foe entering the far turn, then failed to menace before being put to hand behind foes in the
final sixteenth. HARD SPUN FANTASY trailed, moved out of last three wide around the far turn, and failed to factor. RIDGERUNNER bumped an inner rival
early on, saved ground off of the pace, but weakened entering the far turn.

Footnotes
STRAVA set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist RUN CLASSIC's bid nearing the lane, held sway through midstretch as that foe wandered about, but
flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, and got caught at the wire to share victory honors. RUN CLASSIC prompted the pace four to three
wide while outside of foes into the turn, bid outside of the leader while shifting to the four path entering the lane, but drifted out from a left handed crop in
upper stretch causing him to briefly fail to keep pace, drifted back inwardly from a right handed crop through the final furlong, yet sustained his bid to range
up to the leader in the closing stages, and dead-heated at the wire. CHASING TIME stalked two wide, tucked to the rail approaching the turn, then chased
the top pair through the lane while pulling away from the rest. SPANKSTER pressed three to two wide and between horses entering the turn, but gave way
approaching the five sixteenths pole, yet sustained stride between a pair of foes through the lane, and regained fourth in the closing stages. READY TO
POUNCE laid off of the pace three wide, and failed to factor. DOUBLE CROWN laid off of the pace, came into the turn two wide and between horses, but
was shuffled and steadied behind a faltering SPANKHURST entering the lane, drifted out soon after, and made little impact. RADICAL RIGHT tracked along
the inside under a snug hold, retreated to trail the field entering the turn, improved past outer rivals in upper stretch, but tired once again in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HOME PORT set the pace along the inside, shook free while well in hand in the two path turning for home, then drew off in upper stretch, and was ridden
out under mild urging through the final furlong. FEARLESS KRISTIE chased five wide, tucked three wide entering the turn, ranged up four wide entering the
lane to bid for place in upper stretch, and gained that position at the furlong grounds. VALIANT PRAISE tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain
position approaching the turn, saved ground off of the pace around the bend, shifted out in upper stretch, tipped five wide passing the furlong grounds, and
stayed on to gain show. RED HOT JEANIE was a bit antsy in the starting gate, stalked four wide into the turn, tucked to the three path as the last remaining
pursuer nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, lost place to an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and gave way. KIKI
KRAZY leaned out and snagged the gate at the start, lacked speed in the two to three paths before swinging six wide entering the lane, and ran on outside
of rivals. GOOD TOHAVE AROUND backed out of crowded quarters between horses passing the eleven sixteenths pole, raced off of the pace two wide
around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and moved up along with an outer foe. MERRILY RUSH saved ground far back, and improved up the rail
through the lane. GOOD TURN hopped slightly while off a step slow before shying from an inner rival at the start, rushed forward, chased two wide and
between horses approaching the turn, shifted in to maneuver around a faltering rival at the five sixteenths pole, vied for place in upper stretch, but was
outkicked approaching midstretch, and weakened. DOODLE DOO was slow into stride, lagged behind in the two path, then surpassed tired rivals.
ALLINTHECALL stalked three wide and between horses, chased around the turn, but weakened entering the lane. ITSABLINGTHING was keen and
uncomfortable between horses, took back at the nine sixteenths pole, then steadily faded in the four path around the turn. PROUD PERFORMER pressed
two wide and between horses, but wilted turning for home.

Footnotes
CIRCLE BACK JACK tracked along the inside, took aim two wide and between horses in upper stretch, grinded away to gain an advantage at the sixteenth
pole, and lasted from an outer pair to the wire. FIGHT FIERCELY tracked two wide and between horses, tipped to the three path turning for home, shifted to
the five path entering the lane before getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, yet kept on along with an outer foe to attempt a late bid, but did not
have enough. GROUP HUG bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, settled from off of the pace three wide, surpassed inner rivals while commencing
an advance approaching the turn, gained ground in the four to five paths around the bend, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, yet sustained his long
charge outside of foes in the final furlong, closed in along with an inner rival late, but came up short, and missed reaching place. MORNING CUP prompted
the pace along the inside, vied in hand turning for home, led entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, but was collared at the sixteenth pole, and
yielded. LEND IT TEWMEY set the pace outside of an inner presser, got headed by that one while drifting to the four path entering the lane, and weakened
between horses. COLOR FIELD tracked four wide while taking the turn in the five path, spun into the lane in the six path, and tired while hanging on his left
lead. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR trailed in the five path, and moved up between horses. UNDISMAYED was urged along in the two path while midpack
around the turn, and only offered a mild response. BUCKTOWN failed to factor from the four path. RUN RUN RAPIDASH bumped with an inner rival at the
start, pressed the top pair from the four path while between horses into the turn, but weakened turning for home. NAVY SOUL pursued from midpack two
wide, but weakened in the three path around the turn.

Footnotes
BANGO pressed outside of the leader, vied in the four path entering the lane, led in hand leaving the three furlong pole, then responded readily once set
down straightening for home, drew off willingly, and was ridden out under mild urging. MILES AHEAD got floated inwardly by an outer rival at the start,
rushed forward in the opening stages, achieved a stalking position while tapping on the brakes behind the leaders at the half mile pole, got shuffled back
behind a tiring PIRATE RICK nearing the lane, tipped out and split foes two wide at the three sixteenths pole, then rallied to gain place from an outer rival in
the final sixteenth. SURVEILLANCE was put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, tracked in the five path while between horses around the turn,
ranged up to the new leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace while drifting to the six path entering the lane, chased the clearing leader through
midstretch, but lost place to an inner rival in the late stages. BAGBOSS broke inwardly, tracked in the three path and between horses, and lacked a bid.
HEART RHYTHM trailed around the turn, then surpassed tiring rivals in the final furlong. COLLABORATE was urged off of the pace in the six path, but
yielded in the seven path entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead. PIRATE RICK shifted inwardly at the start, set the pace inside of a prompting
rival, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole, then weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
ANNAPOLIS broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside while a path off of the rail, gained while shifting three
wide turning for home, fanned to the six path entering the lane while taking aim, ranged up to the leader at the furlong grounds, sparked a duel, and edged
an advantage late. CHURCHTOWN stalked outside of the clear pace setter, bid in the four path in upper stretch, led before meeting ANNAPOLIS's outer
challenge in midstretch, dueled through the late stages, but was bested. SET PIECE (GB) broke a step slow, trailed two wide, then between horses around
the far turn, encountered traffic in the five path in upper stretch, altered outwardly at the furlong grounds, and surged belated to gain show late. ENGLISH
BEE tracked two wide, got floated four wide while getting outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, kept on thereafter to gain show in the final
sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire. STITCHED tracked along the inside, vacated the inside to take aim between horses in upper stretch, but lacked a bid,
vied for show in the final furlong, but yielded. GET SMOKIN set the pace, but was nearing midstretch, and gave way. KENTUCKY GHOST was squarely
bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, laid unhurried along the inside, surpassed an inner rival in upper stretch, and failed to menace. TIME
TO PARTY pursued off of the pace two wide while in the bit around the first turn, raced between horses around the far turn, and failed to threaten. GRAY'S
FABLE got rank leaving the gates, laid off of the pace three wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. CAMP HOPE raced in
midpack three wide, and gave way between horses in the lane. NATIVE THUNDER took a solid bump from outer rivals at the start, then saved ground off of
the pace, and tired.

Footnotes
SOLIDIFY got hung in the six path while far back, drifted to the eight path entering the lane, yet sustained a rally while gradually shifting in, bid leaving the
furlong grounds, and edged ahead. LEGAL DEAL tracked in the two path and between horses, altered course outside of the leaders in midstretch, and
rallied to gain place at the wire. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT rushed to vie along the inside, chased his outer counterpart into and around the turn, kept on
through the lane to gain place in the closing stages, but got nailed at the wire. EMERALD EXPRESS broke slowly, trailed in the two path, advanced
between horses while hanging on his left lead in midstretch, then rallied between the top flight late. ALL EYES WEST tracked in the four path, chased on his
left lead in upper stretch, got outkicked at the furlong grounds, and kept on mildly. RACE DRIVER was washed out pre-race, stalked the leader from the
three path, bid turning for home, dueled through midstretch, but weakened between horses at the sixteenth pole. DARK TIMBER set the pace in the two
path, dueled inside of an outer bidder in upper stretch, but faltered between horses entering the final sixteenth. PALACE KITTEN never got involved from
the two path. CRIME SPREE made little impact from the five path. BOISE lacked speed in the three path and between horses, and got outrun. THE RIDER
OF SOLIDIFY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
