Footnotes
IT'S MY HOUSE dueled for the lead from outside, inched ahead in the middle stages, maintained a short lead over ARHAM on the far turn, cleared entering
the stretch and held well under urging. AMERICAN ADMIRAL stalked three wide around the first turn, took aim two then three wide on the last turn, chased
behind and to the outside of the leader into the final furlong and could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. PIROLI stalked the pace on the
inside, tipped out at the quarter pole, entered the stretch two to three wide then moved out further and finished willingly for the show honors. ARHAM dueled
for the lead from inside, pressed the leader up the backstretch, fought through the far turn before losing touch into the stretch and flattened in the furlong
grounds. BRAZENLY settled on the inside then moved to the two path on the clubhouse turn, steered out further on the far turn and came four wide into the
drive and lacked a rally.

chased the speed inside a pair of rivals, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, got bumped by BEAUDACIOUS in upper stretch, challenged between runners
in the final furlong and got outkicked by the winner. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) pressed the pace from outside, inched ahead approaching the quarter pole,

pace inside NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) up the backstretch, lost command nearing the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. DIVINE RASCAL tossed
his head at the start to come away slow, chased three deep into the turn, started to weaken three wide leaving the turn and faded in the lane.

SUGAR SUGAR stalked off the inside, angled in to save ground through the turn, rallied up the fence and drove clear in the final sixteenth. CHEVY GIRL
stalked the top pair from outside, went three deep into the turn, took aim five wide into the lane, bid in the final furlong but was outkicked by the winner.
CASIA was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, challenged into the turn, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, led four wide into the lane but faltered in the
final sixteenth. TENNESSEE MOON took control early, pressured from outside into the turn, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage leaving
the bend and flattened in the furlong grounds. CALIFORNIA BLING settled inside, angled out past the quarter pole and had little left for the drive. MY
YVONNE broke a step slow and outward, trailed up the backstretch, angled into the three path on the turn then moved back out and entered the stretch five
wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
YOGI BOY broke a step slow then went up to duel for the lead from outside, cleared rival with a quarter mile remaining, remained clear into the final
sixteenth and lasted. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) hopped slightly at the start but was still forwardly placed, took the turn two wide, got impeded by GIOVINAZZO
coming out in upper stretch, altered inward, chased YOGI BOY into deep stretch, surged late and missed. GIOVINAZZO dueled for command from inside,
was trying to get out on the turn and steadied past the quarter pole, lugged out in upper stretch and flattened to third. WATSONVILLE got bumped in the
beginning, tracked on the inside out of range, moved out at the top of the lane then shifted back inside and kept on to improve position. HULA CANDY was
off very slow from inside, altered out from behind trouble rival early, trailed two then three wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and also improved
position. ACT THREE broke a step slow, dropped back under coaxing, navigated the turn two wide and lacked the needed response. NOBEL GARY settled
outside a rival, went two wide around the turn, raced greenly in the stretch and weakened. NINETEENEIGHTYFOUR came in at the start, traveled in
mid-pack early, dropped back on the turn while saving ground and made no impact. BENELLI was off slow and bumped inner rival, then shifted out and
became hard to ride, pulled up by the rider on the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DR. SCHIVEL bobbled slightly at the start but still came away quickest, set the pace outside C Z ROCKET up the backstretch, cleared past the
three-eighths pole and drew away under light coaxing. C Z ROCKET hopped at the start then went up to force the pace from inside, could not keep up with
DR. SCHIVEL past the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the drive, flattened in the final furlong but was still clearly second best. CLEM LABINE
chased the top pair off the rail, rounded the bend three wide and could not summon the needed response.

Footnotes
OFFLEE NAUGHTY was off a bit slow to begin, settled towards the rear near the inside then outside a rival, moved back inside leaving the backstretch,
lacked room behind a rival and made contact with the rail approaching the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out into the stretch, rallied to the front with a sixteenth
to go and drove clear. PLANETARIO (BRZ) reserved in the early going between rivals then moved to the rail on the first turn, went outside a rival at the
three-eighths pole, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied and got up for second. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) stalked two then along the inside, cut into the
margin on the far turn under coaxing, asked right-handed nearing the stretch, switch to the left-hand and bid between rivals in the final furlong, fought into
deep stretch and faltered late. OPRY cleared early and crossed over, opened up a large lead first time through the stretch, remained well clear to the final
turn, held a diminished lead into the stretch, showed the way into the final furlong but was soon challenged by rivals to the outside and yielded in the final
sixteenth. RIMPROTECTOR broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked off the rail down the hill, traveled in the two path, got floated out by the winner
entering the stretch and lacked a rally. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT settled inside, saved ground through the turns, tipped out into the lane and lacked further
response. MIDCOURT got bumped from inner rival at the start, reserved to the back and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, then came out and was
not a factor.
