Footnotes
TRINGALE took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole and was steadily
handled to late stretch. ROYAL THUNDER raced off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn
but had to settle for second best. FORT FORTITUDE briefly had the lead inside through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, gave chase from the
half mile pole but dropped back approaching the quarter and flattened stride in the lane. CHARLIE POTATOES rounded the first turn about the four path,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced in the five path on the far turn, but showed little in the stretch. HAPPY CHAMP raced in the five
path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. NOMO RON rounded the
first turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, the rider lost his whip leaving the turn and
showed little more. JUNGLE WARRIOR saved ground into the first turn and never factored. SHOULDA HAD IT raced in the six path on the first turn and
was not a factor. This race was hand timed

Footnotes
BERTRAM FLIGHT pressured the pace while between horses, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and dug in determinedly to earn the
nod in later yards. TEACHINTHERELEASE was forced out leaving the gate then pressed the pace inside, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn,
dug in gamely from the head of the lane but relented the nod in later yards. I'LLTAKECAREOFIT was shuffled back on the chute but gave chase through the
backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, finished well while drifting outward through the stretch and was gaining on the top two. DONNIE B gave chase
outside, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. JUBA'S HAT TRICK chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn
and ran evenly in the lane. IN HIGH GEAR came out at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. CATS
DIAMOND BOY set a pressured pace, was met leaving the five sixteenths pole, dropped back past the quarter and weakened in the three path on the turn.
BOBBYS CASE LOAD was not a factor. TALKING TEDDY was forced outward leaving the gate and never factored.

Footnotes
SARGENT KOBE settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came between horses midway on the far turn, took the lead
approaching the head of the lane, dueled briefly clear past the eighth pole but held on under steady handling. BUFF'S EYE VIEW raced well back about the
three path on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and circled rivals in the six path on the far turn, dug in through the stretch and took second in
the final strides. BOSS E BOOGS settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and took a brief slim lead three
wide midway on the far turn, but dropped back passing the eighth pole and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. FEARNOUGHT saved ground on
the first turn, eased out and gave chase leaving the turn, rounded the far turn off the rail then angled to the outside in the upper stretch and ran evenly in the
lane. AARON'S TAP settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the four path on the far turn
but flattened inside the eighth pole. SUPER GARNER stalked the early pace two deep, took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and came under
pressure toward the quarter, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and gave way in the lane. THUNDERINREADYRICK set the early pace inside, was
met toward the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back toward the three eighths and gave way on the far turn.

CASTLE LIGHTS contested the pace from the start and raced close two deep through the turn, took the nod toward the eighth pole and dug in determinedly
to inch away from MACKENZIE'S MUSIC, who contested the pace from the start, kept the edge nearest the rail most of the turn, was met toward the eighth
pole, stayed on gamely to late stretch before relenting and just lasted for second. COACH RUBE chased, rounded the turn in the three path, dug in from the
head of the lane and just missed second. FULL MOON LOVER gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened the final
sixteenth. MOONLIT SHADOW chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five path and finished well outside. JACKS SISTER JILL chased
inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened stride. MANAROLA gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
KUKULKAN accelerated to the lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled in the stretch. MOSS BOSS chased through the backstretch and raced in range of the lead in the four path on the turn, cleared second
mid-stretch and was gaining late on the winner. BIG DADDY D R came away awkwardly and picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail
on the turn and came along for third later yards. STEVETHEVANDRIVER had a brief early lead then pressured the pace from the three eighths pole, raced
close two deep on the turn but flattened toward mid-stretch. WE B SHACKIN gave chase from well back, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little
in the lane. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased inside, raced off the rail on the turn and flattened in the stretch. BIG HAMBONE gave chase toward the outside,
raced in the six path at the quarter pole, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. STARSHIP TAXI gave chase, raced in the six
and seven paths on the turn and weakened in the lane.
