Footnotes
STOMPING HOTROD broke in good order, stalked the pace three wide, challenged turning for home, long drive to the wire, gained a slightly larger
advantage late, enough left to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN lacked speed while racing in the two path, shifted out a
bit for the drive, roused past the furlong marker and finished well to be getting to the winner late while outside that rival. HIGHTAIL COWBOY pressed the
issue off the inside in the run up the backstretch, dueled turn, vied between rivals into the lane, engaged with the winner for a second duel past the furlong
marker, gave ground grudgingly to that one while unable to contain the runner up. MORNING DRIVE off a step slow, raced back, angled out four wide
turning for home, also finished willingly to be closing the gap on the first flight late. OBVIOUSLY TOO in mid pack while racing well wide, four to five wide
exiting the turn, finished with some mild interest. THE HEAT IS ON void of speed off the inside, also came five wide into the lane, improved position.
OJITOS broke well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, gave way in the drive. J'S LITTLE MAN fell back to trail after the show, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals while never a factor. AFRICAN WARRIOR tired while racing toward the inside. HERITAGE PARK broke in the air, was used to move up and
force the issue four wide into the turn, gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
ABBY THE BULL DAWG off a step slow, lagged well back toward the inside, swung out widest for the drive, bothered slightly past the furlong marker when
rallying, continued with good energy to win going away down the middle of the strip. KITIARA lacked speed while outside, steered in to be in the two path
into the stretch, inside bid, no match for the winner while prevailing for the place. DARE ME forced in at the break, raced in the second flight off the inside,
dropped inside late in the bend, bid, narrow lead past the furlong marker, also proved no match for the winner, narrowly missed the place. SMARTY'S
ANGEL with the early pace, fell back off the other speed, moved out three wide into the lane, mild rebid past the furlong marker, not enough in the late
going. FUNTIMEGIRL moved up to contest the issue early, showed the way into and through the turn while remaining in the two path, weakened in the
drive. GUEST IN MY HEART forwardly paced while racing three wide. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN off a step slow, failed to menace. GO GO GO broke out,
backed up while along the inside. CADILLAC LADY broke in, fell far back after a half, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
MOLISE behind the first flight, in traffic behind the first flight through the turn, knifed through a narrow seam into the lane, took over, drew clear, held late.
GRAYDAWN DAY in the second flight toward the inside, checked up in tight quarters into the turn, angled out to be five wide into the stretch, finished
willingly to be getting to the winner late. BAYSHORE FOXES forwardly placed in the two path backstretch, dropped inside, rail bid midway on the turn,
narrow advantage upper stretch, relinquished that lead to the winner soon after and proved no match for that one or the runner up. BIDOFHONEY pressed
the issue early three wide, remained within striking distance late in the turn, had little for the drive. VEGAS BLUE within striking distance while four wide,
also came up empty for the drive. TRIBAL SPIRIT off a step slow, raced back and outside, floated out to be six wide turning for home, little impact. STAR
POSE void of speed, never menaced. SAMMIES SAMURAI flashed speed for a half in the two path, stopped, jogged across.

Footnotes
AUX ARCS bumped lightly break, showed way up the backstretch, edged clear in the turn while continuing in the two path, maintained daylight to the wire
under steady handling. SINGING GROOM back off the pace and the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, dropped inside, finished willingly up the rail.
LOUD BOY forward paced two path, moved out to be three wide into the stretch, set down with a right handed drop,closest to the winner past the furlong
marker, could do little more with that one, caught late for the place. TRAFFIC BOSS broke into the gap, straightened, raced in mid pack, in some traffic late
backstretch, bit rank, saved ground turn, improved with some moderate interest down the lane. KISSOFTHENILE forwardly placed while outside, five wide
into the turn, four wide exiting, went evenly down the stretch in lacking a closing punch. WATER TO WINE settled back off the pace in the two path,
improved a bit while not posing a serious threat. IKE WAZOWSKI bothered at the break, raced in the main body off the inside, four wide turn, also found
lacking down the lane. FALCONITE broke in, lacked speed, four wide turning for home, lacked a response as well. MY KINDA TETON in tight at the start,
trailed early, continued back through the turn inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LAKE HAMILTON back off the pace
four wide, three wide into the lane, tired. MONEYSTRIKE chased the winner for a half from the outside and gave way. DABOOGEYMAN last away after
being bothered slight, raced five wide into the turn, six wide exiting the bend, trailed home in showing little.

Footnotes
MAJOR KONG fractious in the gate prestart, void of early foot, began to advance far turn, lacked room, tight late in the final bend, split foes, challenged
inside the furlong marker, edged clear late under firm handling. ZOFFA well back early along with the winner, rallied four to five wide out of the final turn,
challenged while widest a furlong out, proved no match for the winner late. MAKE NOISE off a step slow, raced mid pack and along the inside early, moved
off the rail far turn, three wide into the lane, along for the show with a mild rally. TOMA TODO forwardly placed off the inside, continued to prompt the issue
up the backstretch, challenged between horses far turn, got out turning for home, weakened. LIARS CLUB sprinted well clear to show the way into and
through the first turn in the two path, continued to show the way backstretch, headed by a pair of rivals in the second turn including his entrymate, battled
back to regain the advantage a furlong out, weakened. GEORGIA DEPUTY off a step slow, raced far back for five furlongs, swung five wide into the stretch,
improved position with some belated interest. HIGHER AUTHORITY mid pack and off the rail, had little for the stretch run. JOLLY TOMMY in the second
flight out in the strip, advanced to challenged on the outside far turn, carried out into the lane, faltered, fell after the wire, vanned off. ATTA PARTY chased
early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
ZAMBEZI broke sharply, forwardly placed three wide, asked along three wide into the lane, challenged upper stretch, drew well clear under a brisk hand
ride. MR PUK broke in, back off the pace off the inside, 4w into lane, dropped inside, rallied up the rail, in time for the place, no match for the winner.
MILLERS RITE forwardly placed along the inside, advanced and challenged inside the early leader into the stretch, flattened out the final furlong, saved the
show. APRIL FOOLS ANDY back off the pace outside, four out to six wide through the turn, mild rally down the middle of the strip to improve position.
DEBATER bumped at the start, recovered to race in the second flight three wide, turned in an even effort down the lane. KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN)
back off the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane, was never dangerous. CONGRATS ON FIFTY away in good order, quickly clear, set the pace for
four furlongs off the inside, faltered when headed upper stretch. MANTA REY in the main body while outside, four wide through the turn, tired. HUSKER
BUTCH bumped start, forwardly placed, steadied in traffic into the turn, faded. LAKESIDE RUMBLE off a step slow, saved ground turn, was never a threat.
TULSAN bothered, bumped at the break, finished up evenly. CRAVENSWORTH off slow, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

while three wide, took over into the stretch, showed the way past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. RIBBONSINHERHAIR bac off the pace
while well wide, five wide through the turn, up late for the show, no threat to the top two. THUNDERS ROCKNROLL away in good order, set the early pace
inside, vied into the lane, weakened when headed. BLAME DAY lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, improved into the stretch, flattened out to
finish up evenly. ALWAYS ANGELS forwardly placed for a half, had little left for the drive. FEE fell back after the start, raced off the rail through the turn,
lacked a serious bid in the drive. GRACIE DIAMOND in mid pack and four wide, tired in the drive. TWIRLING TIGRESS vied early, chased into the turn,
began a steady retreat before a half. SUNSET PAYNTER finished early, fell far back, trailed home.

Footnotes
AIN'T LIFE GRAND settled off the pace while racing three wide, tipped out four wide into the stretch,drifted out upper, was righted and closed with good
resolve under firm handling to prove best. FROSTED GRACE in the first flight while three wide, continued to prompt the issue three wide into the far turn,
bid, took over into the lane, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker but could not contain the winner late, determined for the place. MR.
WIRELESS pressed the issue from between foes, continued to vie the middle half, dueled into the lane, lacked a winning punch. GREAT ESCAPE narrowly
showed the way inside, held a slight advantage through the second turn, faltered when headed turning for home. ICARUS in the second flight while between
foes, remained within striking distance through the second turn, moved three wide for the drive, had little left. MAILMAN MONEY tracked the pace inside,
boxed in along the rail into and through most of the second turn, gave way when clear for the drive.

ITWASTHISBIG in traffic toward the front while three wide late in the first turn, maintained contact with the leader into the far turn, dropped inside, closer into
the lane, eased out into the two path to bump OFFSHORE TIME upper stretch, split foes, collared the leader nearing the furlong marker and drew well clear.
ROYAL AIR FORCE moved closer on the outside onto the backstretch, well clear before a half, continued to maintain a daylight advantage up the
backstretch, moved inside turning for home, offered little resistance to the winner upper stretch, lasted for the place. STORM STRATEGY in mid pack off the
inside, bothered onto the backstretch while four wide, continued outside, lodged a mild rally down the lane to be gaining for the place. HOWL YEAH settled
along the inside, came in the two path for the drive, went evenly through the lane. OFFSHORE TITHE a bit keen early after an alert break, forward, was
tiring when bumped by the winner upper stretch, continued to give way. MR. WULLY BULLY fell far back after the start, raced four to five wide second turn,
displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position. ROSIE'S BOY void of speed, moved out well wide, five to six wide second turn, improved
position, no real threat. MORE MONEY MO got out late in the first turn when with the main body, went along backstretch, traffic midway on the second turn,
had little left for the stretch run. BOLIVER forwardly placed, shuffled back onto the backstretch, lacked a closing response. R R EMPIRE off a step slow,
raced back, bothered in some traffic late in the first turn to float out five wide, failed to rally. SACRAMENT rank, sprinted clear soon after start, relinquished
the lead before a half, stopped, finished far back. SHADY STAR five wide in the first turn, gave way after a half, four wide through the second bend, far
back, distanced.
