Footnotes
WITS AND WAGERS settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide around the far turn, spun into the lane in the five path, and rallied outside of
foes through midstretch to drive past the leaders in the final sixteenth. TOFFEE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter,
was roused in hopes of bidding around the far turn, but was turned away in upper stretch, sustained a chase thereafter, closed back in as the tiring leader
drifted out entering the final sixteenth, shifted ground along with that foe while offering a bid along with an outer rival, but was outkicked while gaining place.
GRACEFUL UNION set the pace along the inside, turned away a bidding rival in upper stretch, held sway through midstretch before being steered
outwardly to meet challenges nearing the final sixteenth, flopped leads and drifted about before being headed leaving that marker and yielded. MISS
ANALYZED was washed out moving to post, laid off of the pace two wide, chased three wide and between horses through upper stretch, closed in along
with an outer rival in the final furlong, but was outkicked by that foe while put to crowded quarters by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, then shied and
backed out in the aftermath. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE chased along the inside and gave way. IZABELLABELLA was washed out pre-race, bumped with an
inner rival at the start and showed little.

Footnotes
JE SUIS RAPIDE tracked four wide, took aim on the top pair in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds and edged ahad. SUPER RENEE pressed two
wide, vied around the turn, led in upper stretch, but met an outer rivals challenge at the furlong pole and got bested. CRACKALACKING set the pace along
the inside, vied with an outer rival around the turn, got headed by that one in upper stretch, and gave way through the final furlong yet held show. MY MY
MUNNY tracked two wide, chased from behind the leaders in upper stretch, but drifted out through the final furlong and lacked a bid. LOVE OF MY LIFE
eased back from a bit of crowded quarters soon after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside into the turn, swung outside of foes entering the lane and
made little impact. LA V. stalked outside of the top pair, chased them around the turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON set the pace along the inside, gamely clung to an advantage from a pair of bidders in upper stretch, repelled those foes in the final
furlong and shook free late. BLUE KENTUCKY tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the turn, bid in the four path
along with an outer rival nearing the lane, sparred between horses through midstretch, but was turned away by the pace-setter in the final furlong.
SOLIDIFY tracked four wide, was roused to offer a bid turning for home, drifted to the six path while under an all-out drive entering the lane, sparred in
upper stretch, but was repelled at the furlong grounds, yet maintained show thereafter. TAPAGE broke a step slow, saved ground off of the pace, improved
in upper stretch, and chased the leaders home. AMERICAN PURE laid off of the pace in the four path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, but took
brushes from an inner rival at the furlong grounds, held his lane while that foe sustained contact through the late stages, and lacked a rally. SOARING BIRD
tugged forward to an inside stalking position early on, pursued from the two path around the turn, shifted out approaching midstretch, brushed an outer rival
at the furlong grounds, remained latched onto that one thereafter and lacked a bid between horses. ATTA BOY ANTHONY veered out at the start, pressed
two wide, but yielded between horses turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
CECILE snagged the gate before being bumped by an outer rival at the start, got forced inwardly and steadied between horses in the after math, trailed in
the two path, swung to the nine path in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead while launching a rally at the three sixteenths pole, lugged inwardly
moving to midstretch, straightened course before changing back to her right lead and gaining place at the sixteenth pole, surged in pursuit of the leader late,
and reeled in that foe nearing the wire. VANISHED set the pace along the inside, kicked away to a clear lead in upper stretch, but was caught in the shadow
of the wire. JUST SAY SO laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to bid for place along with an
outer rival at the sixteenth pole, but was swiftly outkicked for that position. OKAY FINE took a bump from an outer rival passing the wire for the first time,
settled in midpack two wide, pursued from between horses around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, grinded away to bid for place at the
furlong pole, gained that position soon after, but was outkicked nearing the final sixteenth. STAY LOST took a brush from an outer rival soon after the star,
lacked speed along the inside, awaited racing room in the two path turning for home, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up.
SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, but only managed to chase and lacked a bid. MASTERFUL MEG
bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly early on, but was restrained back passing the wire the first time, saved ground off of the pace, tipped
to the four path in upper stretch and lacked a rally between horses. STRATEGERIZED bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, laid far back in the
three path, got floated from the five path to the eight path in upper stretch and yielded. EM KAT bumped an inner rival while keyed up between horses
passing the wire for the first time, pulled forward three wide around the first turn, achieved a stalking position outside of the leading pair entering the
backstretch, inched closer around the far turn to attempt a bid entering the lane, but was quickly turned away in upper stretch, lost place at the furlong
grounds and weakened. EVIE'S ENCORE broke a bit outwardly while off a step slow, moved forward to press outside of the leader around the first turn, but
was outmoved turning for home, and faltered along the inside through the lane. GLAMOUR ANNA broke inwardly and bumped a rival leaving the gates,
advanced five wide around the first turn to a midpack position, then gave way in upper stretch. EXHIBIT HALL laid off of the pace in the four path, fanned to
the seven path entering the lane before being floated to the ten path at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened.

LORD CAPTAIN pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, led in the three path in upper stretch, and held gamely from bidders on either side through the
final sixteenth. MOBSTER GUN raced at the rear two wide, advanced three wide passing the five furlong pole, tracked the top pair around the far turn, took
aim in the five path in upper stretch, progressed to offer a bid entering the final sixteenth but missed. DIGITAL settled off of the pace along the inside, trailed
leaving the five furlong pole, saved ground at the rear around the far turn, rallied inside of rivals in upper stretch to gain place at the furlong grounds,
sustained a bid inside of the leader entering the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. MYSTIC NIGHT checked slightly when easing back into an inside
stalking position entering the first turn, shifted out to take aim in the four path and between horses in upper stretch, but lacked the needed punch. HUGE
BIGLY set the pace along the inside, vied with the eventual winner around the far turn, and gave way between horses. TEST PILOT pursued from midpack
two wide, got outmoved at the nine sixteenths pole, and fanned to the six path in upper stretch while fading.

Footnotes
FLOKI'S FLIGHT pressed two wide, vied into the turn, led approaching the five sixteenths pole, and drew off in upper stretch. GUNTOWN broke a step slow
before being floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, raced well off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, shifted out to
the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly to gain place. RAM tracked in the two path, split foes to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked by an outer rival approaching the final sixteenth. CHARGING AERO stalked three wide, ranged up to bid for place in the four path entering the
lane, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. INVISIBLE WAR broke outwardly, then lacked speed in the four path, and failed to factor.
HEARTBREAKER broke outwardly, set the pace inside of a vying rival into the turn, failed to keep pace with that one at the five sixteenths pole, and
weakened through the lane. RAYMOND broke a step slow before taking back from tight quarters between horses at the start, then made little impact from
the two path. LUCKY BOSS trailed in the five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
F FIVE stalked the run-away leader from the two path, produced a bid along with an inner POLICY OPTION entering the final turn, dueled with that foe
around that bend, then wrestled an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear in the final furlong. POLICY OPTION pursued from midpack two wide,
launched an early advance passing the nine sixteenths pole, bid along with an outer F FIVE into the far turn, sparred with that one turning for home, but was
headed in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong, and desperately saved place at the wire. TRENDING tracked along the inside, vacated the rail
entering the backstretch, chased the dueling leading pair around the final bend, then ran on in the three path through the final furlong to bid for place along
with an inner rival in the shadow of the wire, but just missed. JARREAU bumped with an outer rival at the start, saved ground in midpack, pursued under
urging around the final turn, then sustained stride through the lane to bid for place between horses late, but came up short. ALWAYS ABOVE rated at the
rear in the two path, launched a four wide rally around the far turn, and stayed on willingly for a minor share. BOLD LOOKER tracked three wide, lost
position to inner rivals while four wide entering the second turn, chased from the four path around the final bend, and was one-paced through the lane.
PRINCELY raced at the rear in the three path around the opening bend, improved past rivals to lay far back two wide and between horses into the second
turn, then failed to menace thereafter. COURAGEOUSLY transferred firm contact from an outer rival to an inner foe upon leaving the gates, tracked two
wide and between horses, chased in the three path around the far turn and tired. FOWLER BLUE took a bump from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed
two wide and between horses before saving ground around the second turn, then failed to factor. BOSQUE REDONDO bumped with an inner rival at the
start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SILENT STEVE made little impact from the three path. READ ON broke inwardly and bumped a rival at
the start, ran off in the three path around the first turn, but began to tire along the inside entering the backstretch, got headed entering the far turn, and
readily stopped.

Footnotes
TEPEU bumped an outer rival soon after the start, tracked three wide, pressed the top pair from the four path around the turn, bid entering the lane, led in
upper stretch, then inched clear in the final furlong and held from an outer pursuer late. JR'S GIFT laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, spun
into the lane in the three path and among foes, emerged from between horses to gain place entering the final sixteenth, and was slowly narrowing the
leader's margin late. CRUMP tracked along the inside, pursued under moderate coaxing around the turn, then sustained a rail chase to slip through and
gain show in the final sixteenth. COSTA TERRA took a bump from an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace three wide, was driven in the four
path turning for home, spun into the lane behind the new leader, tipped out to the five path while failing to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, and ran
on while one paced between horses in the final furlong. SEVEN FLAT took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, inched closer in the five path
turning for home before spinning into the lane in the six path, but lacked the needed kick. WAKE SURF pressed two wide, vied in the three path while
between horses around the turn, got headed by his outer counterpart entering the lane, fought on into midstretch, but weakened between horses in the final
sixteenth. TRIPLE ELVIS set the pace, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer rivals while a path off of the rail around the turn, but gave way to them
entering the lane, and weakened through the final furlong. AMERICAN ICON broke slowly, got outrun along the inside, and was eased on his left lead
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ADALINE JULIA pressed the leader from the three path, briefly failed to keep pace with that one while in the four path in upper stretch, yet regained stride
approaching midstretch, closed in to offer a re-bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past. YOUR SO SILLEA set the pace, showed the way in hand while a
path off of the rail as an outer ADALINE JULIA applied pressure, shook free of that one in upper stretch, but met that foe's re-bid approaching the sixteenth
pole, and failed to keep her at bay. MY KENTUCKY GIRL tossed her head at the start while off slow, lacked speed while well back in the three path, swung
out to the eight path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to gain show in the final sixteenth. PORTILLA chased two wide and between horses, spun
into the lane in the three path while behind the leaders, failed to keep pace with them before drifting outwardly in midstretch, straightened to bid for show
entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival. FAST GISELLE raced forwardly along the inside, but was shuffled back at the half mile pole,
pursued from midpack around the turn, then sustained a rail chase through the lane. SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM stalked along the inside, chased the top pair
from off of the rail in upper stretch, but lost show at the sixteenth pole while tiring. MOUFFY pursued from midpack in the three path, tipped to the five path
in upper stretch, but failed to factor between horses. STREET JAM was slow into stride, trailed in the four path around the turn, and improved late. LOVE
OF MY HEART lacked speed in the four path, spun into the lane in the seven path, and tired. WELL SPENT broke a step slow and made little impact from
the two path. IRONIC TWIST tracked in the four path and weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

an outer bidder leaving the furlong grounds, and held place. GASLIGHT DANCER stalked behind the leading pair and from the two path around the turn,
tipped outside of them to take aim between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds, yet kept on and
missed reaching place. CRISPY CAT (GB) vied two wide, but was outkicked by an outer bidder while yielding between horses at the furlong grounds.
PRIVATE CREED stalked in the three path, floated to the four path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering midstretch, and lacked a
bid. AH JEEZ trailed in the two path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to menace. GILCREASE saved ground off of the pace but to no avail.

Footnotes
PATTON'S WAR broke outwardly, set the pace along the inside, met LUPO'S LEGACY's challenge turning for home, repelled that foe in upper stretch, but
flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and lasted. LUPO'S LEGACY stalked three wide, bid turning for home, but was turned away in upper
stretch, kept on in the final furlong to re-bid between horses approaching the wire, but missed. OWN THE FIELD laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted
to the five path entering the lane, rallied to offer a bid coming to the wire, but ran out of ground. ALILNALOT was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe
twice in the early stages, gradually backed out of crowded quarters down the backstretch, pursued from midpack in the three path, gained show entering the
lane, and ran on while aiming inside of the leader through the late stages. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL shied from outer rivals at the eleven sixteenths pole,
pursued from midpack in the two a, spun into the lane three wide and failed to menace. LIBERTY'S HAULER trailed in the four path, fanned to the six path
entering the lane, and failed to factor. LUNDBERG bumped an inner rival twice in the opening furlong, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but
caved in hand entering the lane. MAGNIFICENT MILE took multiple bumps from outer rivals in the opening stages, stalked along the inside into the turn and
faded.
