GAMESTONKS was well rated three to four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn, went on even terms for the lead leaving the turn and hit the front nearing
the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best under a drive. WILL TAKE ROSES pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a
short lead, then was headed by the winner off the turtn and proved to be no match for that rival late, second best. EARLY FROST was bumped at the start,
made a four wide run on the far turn but could not sustain that bid, bested rest. PERKEO was reserved early and lacked a rally. ALONG THE WAY tracked
the early pace on the inside and tired. ESPERANNNA set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped.

SEEKING THE DREAM stalked the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, shook clear leaving the turn and then remained
clear to prove best, sharp. KNICKERSINATWIST was rated between rivals, waited behind rivals by the quarter pole, split horses leaving the three sixteenths
and finished willingly to be clearly second best. STAND BY YOU was settled back early, made a wide rin on the turn and came six wide into the lane and
had a late rally. KILIMANJARA was reserved early, two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. NO EASY ANSWER
set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the turn and weakened. MOONSAFE tracked the pace three wide and made a four wide bid by the
quarter pole but weakened in the drive. LANFRANKOPHILE was settled early, four wide on the turn and came wide into the lane and had no rally.
ECLIPTICALS SARAH was settled early, three wide on the turn and then was empty. BELLA PRIMA tracked the early pace on the inside and stopped.

RECRUITER was four wide into the first turn, then vied for the lead three wide, drew clear entering the turn and then drew off leaving the turn while still
three wide, then was given one right handed pop with the riding crop by the furlong marker and then was wrapped up the final sixteenth to prove much the
best. UPSTATE AND BACK vied for the lead on the inside and then proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award gamely. SPINNING

outfinished for that spot. SPELLED WELL tracked the early pace and tired. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL steadied nearing the three quarter peg on the inside and

WILD CARAMELO was away alertly to set the early pace while two wide, drew clear on the turn and then was kept to mild left handed crop pressure to
prove best. TRIPLE A. PLUS tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, finished willingly to be clearly second best. ROCKET
BLAST tracked the pace on the inside but lacked the needed winning bid, held show. CHARGING LION was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the
lane and had a mild late rally. HASHTAG WINNING was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. EQUAL JUSTICE prompted the pace two to three
wide and was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened.
