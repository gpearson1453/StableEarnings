Footnotes
WONDER WATER broke sharply and secured the inside soon after the break, got into a battle to the inside of ESPRESSO LUNGO around the first turn
while holding a slim lead, continued that scrum through the backstretch run and around the final turn while under a hustling ride, shook clear in mid stretch
and steadily widened while kept to task. FOOD FOODIE broke a step slow, settled outside a rival and off the contested pace, was coaxed along around the
final turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch, leveled off to his best stride leaving the furlong grounds and was along for the place. SPECTRIER saved
ground, was put to a solid ride leaving the far turn, continued to save ground into the stretch, eased out in the final furlong and offered a mild kick.
ESPRESSO LUNGO moved up between rivals to entertain the pace into the first turn, emerged in a battle outside the winner entering the backstretch,
stayed latched to that one and was under coaxing around the final turn, lugged in when failing to keep up leaving mid stretch and weakened. HOT ROD
LINCOLN , with the pace three deep into the first turn, rated back and stalked the embattled leaders while two wide, eased out to have dead aim three wide
in upper stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but no action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
HIDEWRIGHT AWAY sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was under urging in the stretch and eagerly pulled away.
GOLDRUSH HOTTIE saved ground on the turn, chased the winner and faded in the drive. HOW SWEET SHE IS lacked speed, raced inside horses on the
turn and passed tired ones in the drive. LA TRAVIESA circled the turn three wide, was well positioned turning for home and gave way. APPEALINGTOTHE
EYE , swung to the seven path in upper stretch, was not a factor. SHE GOT THE MUNNI , steadied when shuffled back about a sixteenth of a mile after the
break, was taken to the five path in upper stretch and came up empty. RUN AROUND SLEW , swung outside HIDEWRIGHT AWAY entering the turn,
chased that one to mid stretch and gave way. GINGER GIRL , four wide on the turn drifted to the six path entering the stretch.

Footnotes
BOSSERATI vied three wide outside PRINCESS PALMER while under rating, asserted herself into the lane and cleared, opened up under solid asks in mid
stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch but held firm. LADY MOSLER , in the clear chasing the leaders, saved ground mid turn, eased out a bit for the
drive and finished up willingly to be second best. MELIPONINI BEE was rated back soon after the break, raced well off the pace leaving the far turn, swung
out well wide for the drive and found her best too late. TRITONE GAL broke a step slow, edged up outside a rival nearing the turn, chased three wide mid
turn, angled out a bit wider for the drive but came up empty. STRAWBERRY POINT chased two wide, altered out through the final furlong but lacked a
serious kick. CIRCUITT , off the pace, saved ground around the turn and into the lane but failed to rally. MODELO RUBIA dropped in early and raced well
back into the turn, came out through the drive but failed to menace. PRINCESS PALMER sped to an early lead along the inside, dueled with the winner from
the far turn to about the quarter pole, failed to keep pace in mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
WILD BEHAVIOR sped to the early lead saved ground around the turn and was under urging in the drive. PIT STOP MAN chased the winner throughout,
was three wide turning for home and finished gamely. HIS NAME IS SUE , three wide on the turn, drifted to the four path at the head of the stretch and
finished evenly. FREE SQUARE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path entering the stretch and offered a mild gain.
SUBSTANTIAL , outrun outside horses, was four deep leaving the turn. THE CAIRO KID , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a
factor. GREAT GO GO bumped and pinched back THE CAIRO KID when bearing out at the break, rushed up along the rail down the backstretch, remained
along the rail and faltered.

Footnotes
GUNSLINGER (IRE) cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, spurted away after being put to solid asking soon into the lane, kept on under left
handed encouragement in mid stretch and held firm. SPEAK UNITY drafted in towards the rail entering the first turn and tracked the pace, came out for the
drive and gave willing chase to the wire while holding down the place. PETIT FILS (FR) , in hand two wide behind rivals and in range into the far turn,
awaited room near the five sixteenths, dropped inside and moved up under asking soon into the lane, pursued past mid stretch but flattened out late. ONE
TWO KID settled three wide and off the pace, angled seven wide in upper stretch, straightened and closed steadily. MINT GAME , in hand three wide
outside rivals, edged up into the far turn, spun four to five wide under asking into the lane, remained a presence to mid stretch then faded. PRETTY GOOD
YEAR saved ground most of the way but lacked a serious response. U S CONSTITUTION , close up between foes heading to the half, swung five to six
wide for the drive, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faded. KRUG edged up early and gained a stalking spot two to three wide, lacked a
punch in upper stretch and weakened. FERMAT saved ground off the pace, swung out in the stretch but failed to menace. UP AGAINST IT , rated along off
the rail leaving the three quarter pole, faded around the final turn.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN , confidently rated outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep in hand leaving the far turn, secured command in upper stretch,
opened a clear advantage and was under brisk urging late. BOBBY G lacked speed, raced outside horses on the far turn, floated four deep turning for home
and rallied. DOLICE VITA saved ground on the far turn, remained along the inner rail in upper stretch, altered course to the outside of THE KING CHEEK
near the eiighth pole and finished gamely between horses. THE KING CHEEK sprinted clear soon after the break, set the pace near the inner rail and
weakened the final furlong. GUILLAUME raced inside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, raced in the two path turning for home and failed to
rally. ARISTOCAT chased the pace outside THE KING CHEEK to mid way on the far turn then gave way.

rivals leaving the far turn, swung out in the drive and rallied. IN VAIN chased outside the winner and gave way grudgingly between rivals. BELLA BETTINA ,
off the pace, saved ground into the lane and had belated action. ISLAND PHILO , three to four wide, failed to rally. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , bumped at
the break, saved ground mid turn, eased out to chased between foes but came up empty. SMART EULEE failed to menace and raced very wide in the
drive. GRAND SKYLARK broke slowly, was used four wide to get into range, chased off the rail around the turn and retreated.
