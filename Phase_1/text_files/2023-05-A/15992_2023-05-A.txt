Footnotes
SERVICEMAN broke inward, bumping ANUMKA, was rated between rivals, let out three wide on the bend, moved clear under urging in the lane, was
allowed to coast in the waning yards and maintained control under confident handling. HIGHLY UNLIKELY rated from outside, lost ground five wide through
the turn, rallied belatedly the last eighth, gained second with a sixteenth left and proved clearly second best. THACKER FROMM urged to stay close early,
was through wide taking the bend, lacked a stretch rally but caught WEST COAST CHROME for third late. WEST COAST CHROME vied for the lead from
inside for three furlongs, his rider lost her riding crop leaving the bend and WEST COAST CHROME flattened out for the drive. ANUNKA bumped at the
break, disputed the pace outside WEAT COAST CHROME for three-eighths of a mile then gave way.

AMARI S. soon had a clear lead, floated out to path three entering the lane, was challenged from inside midsretch, battled to the wire and kept NOT TO BE
DENIED at bay. NOT TO BE DENIED without early speed, angled to the inside on the bend, engaged AMARI S. midstretch, fought gamely to the wire but
had to settle for second best. FROST WARRIOR pressed AMARI S. from just outside, was carried out some by the latter into the stretch, ran evenly and
was not challenged for the show. BULU a step slow at the start, advanced between rivals, was three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning outside FROST
WARRIOR for the stretch run and gave way. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SCARLET CITY shared the lead from outside, was three wide taking the bend, edged ahead upper stretch and held on under steady handling. SIRCORRI
prominent from outside, took over second four wide on the turn, battled through the lane, did not have enough late but was clearly second best. GEMO
RAIN contested the early pace from inside, did not keep up leaving the turn, fanned out to path four entering the lane, fought inside W W RUSSIAN GOLD
for third, floated out a brush to brush the latter in the late going and edged W W RUSSIAN GOLD out at the end. W W RUSSIAN GOLD forwardly placed
from outside, lost ground four then five wide through the bend, dueled for third in the stretch, was crowded slightly in the waning yards and narrowly missed
for the show. MADE TO FIT hesitated at the break, was without early speed, two then three wide taking the turn, passed between tired ones upper stretch
and was closing in for third late. WILLOW RIDGE displayed early speed but began to yield two wide before finishing three furlongs. JOEY B failed to
menace in a wide trip. JOHNNY LONGBOAT soon trailed, saved ground and was never a factor. RIPE ATTACK in contention between rivals, swung out
seven wide for the drive and gave way. STOSH broke a bit inside then showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
IT'S GREEK TO ME a step slow at the break, was kept close behind the early speed, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, opened up when hand
urged in the lane and proved much the best ridden out. TROUBLE FINDS ME vied for the early lead from outside, moved in beside MISS WINDY SLEW on
the turn, took over second inside the last furlong but was no match for IT'S GREEK TO ME in the late going. MISS WINDY SLEW was hustled to contest the
pace from inside but flattened out for the drive. BETHY pressed the early pace from outside, came four wide into the lane and had no late bid. WITCHING,
fractious in the gate, was taken out, examined by the veterinarian and reloaded, displayed early speed between horses once the race began but yielded into
the bend.

Footnotes
I'M YOUR VALENTINE settled not far off the inside, swung out to path five to make his bid entering the lane, was all out and got up in time. WILDWOOD
RUBEN advanced from outside, was four wide on the bend, angled in some midway on the turn, moved clear into the stretch, began to wear down in the
late going and was outfinished. ON THE MONEY RED came off the rail some on the backstretch, was boxed in on the turn, moved to the rail nearing the
quarter pole, checked behind MEDAL KING at that marker, steadied in tight quarters just inside the latter upper stretch, had a clear path inside the last
furlong just off the rail and was closing the gap. LUKE ATTACK raced in the second flight from between horses, was three wide on the bend, steadied briefly
when his path was taken leaving the five-sixteenths marker, stayed in path three for the drive and lacked a the needed late kick. HIGHLY PERFECT broke
well but was soon in midpack, had the rail on the turn, fanned out leaving the bend and made up minor ground from path four the last furlong. MEDAL KING
was sent to a clear early lead, challenged from outside on the turn, moved toward the rail with two furlongs to go, was overtaken leaving the bend and
steadily faded from just off the inside in the lane. LELAND JOHN void of speed, stayed well off the inside through the turn and had little to offer for the drive.
WYATT SCATES hesitated at the break and was always outrun. The rider of ON THE MONEY RED lodged an objection alleging interference from MEDAL
KING at the quarter pole and the rider of LUKE ATTACK lodged an objection alleging interference from WILDWOOD RUBEN approaching the quarter pole.
After their review, the stewards did not uphold either claim of foul.

Footnotes
CHICKS FOR FREE forwardly placed from outside, was four wide taking the bend, rallied in the stretch, took the advantage inside the last sixteenth and
was drawing off in the waning yards. TAP'S BIG SHOT bumped shortly after the break, was kept close, moved clear for the lead upper stretch, did not have
enough left in the waning yards but was clearly second best. PERFECT WAGER trailed and was angled in early on, came off the rail for a clear path on the
turn, was widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals to gain third late. TIZ APPROVED bumped with TAP'S BIG SHOT after the start, vied for the lead
from outside, was two wide on the bend then flattened out for the stretch run. MUD ISLAND chased from outside, angled in entering the turn, gradually
angled out looking for a clear path in the stretch and leveled off the last eighth. BACKSHOT displayed early speed from inside but gave way for the drive.

ICY RIVER bobbled inward a bit at the start, moved clear of the rest before finishing the first eighth, responded to hand urging upper stretch to lengthen
command, was put to a drive the last seventy yards and maintained full control. GO MADI GO progressed from outside, was three then four wide taking the
turn, gained second midstretch, closed the gap on the leader some in the late going and was clearly second best. AROSE FOR LYLA soon trailed, saved
ground on the bend, came off the rail some for the stretch run and passed between tired rivals to get third late. CARSON RESERVE vied for the lead briefly
outside ICY RIVER, did not stay with the latter nearing the end of the first furlong, came into the lane from path three and began to wear down. THINK BLUE
raced in contention from inside but gave way upper stretch.

Footnotes
PLAY TWENTY a step slow at the start, soon vied for the lead, moved clear after the first sixteenth of a mile, was allowed to lengthen command on the
bend, responded to hand urging upper stretch to draw further away from the rest and was kept to task to the wire. GHAALEB'S APPEAL reluctant to load,
was an early factor between rivals once the race began, did not keep up along the inside on the turn, rallied in the stretch, fought for second in the waning
yards, stumbled badly after the wire, lost her rider and was eventually walked off. ASHLEY ELIZABETH in the second flight early, was forced to stay in path
four through the bend, moved ahead to gain second in the stretch, battled to hold her position but did not have enough left. ALMAFUERTE chased just
outside TWO MORE TIMES, did not keep up on the turn and passed inside weakening rivals in the lane. AH LEAH also somewhat slow at the break,
advanced from outside, was five wide taking the bend and lacked a significant stretch bid. TWO MORE TIMES saved ground through the turn and also
lacked a rally in the stretch. BEIRUT BEAUTY somewhat slow as well at the start, rushed up from inside to race in the second flight, angled out on the bend
then gave way for the drive. MIKE'S LADY a bit slow at the break, failed to menace in a ground-saving trip, veered in after the wire to avoid the fallen rider,
lost her rider as well and ran back to the barn area. LOUIE P a step slow at the start, as well, showed little.
