Footnotes
WHIP showed early interest in establishing command, exchanged command with two rivals through the bend, maintained the inside path at upper stretch
and proved best of the dueling trio in final furlong. YOU SEXY BOY hustled from outset and set the pace in concert while traveling three wide throughout,
but was unable to match strides with that rival in final furlong. RONALD DALE chased the dueling trio along the backstretch, closed the gap through the
bend, tucked to rail at upper stretch, was asked for a rally, but was unable to catch top pair in closing strides. TOAH hustled to share early command,
established a two path position, set the pace in unison, but came up empty in final furlong. SEDARIS showed reserve through the opening half and failed to
menace. CHARING CROSS trailed from outset and was never involved.

Footnotes
RUBY THE DESTROYER chased the pacesetting duo from a two path stance through the opening half, circled those rivals three wide through the closing
bend, and drew clear in final strides. TOM'S GIRL settled into a ground saving stance behind the pacesetting duo, came under rousing at upper stretch, and
finished willingly to secure the place well clear of the rest of field. HONEY CREEK came away alertly and set the pace in tandem from a two path pose, was
challenged by rival inside the half pole, then tired and failed to sustain the bid in homestretch. BILLIE BABY was unhurried through the opening half, angled
out at upper stretch to no avail, and passed tiring rival in final sixteenth. LISA G rushed from outset, established an inside pose and set the pace through the
opening half, then rapidly retreated and eclipsed in final furlong.

SCARLET POSITION showed reserve through the opening half, angled out to circle the leaders four wide at upper stretch, and rallied with strong strides to
earn the victory. LIGHTNING HART hustled from outset and gained first command, trekked the inside around the hook, led the field in deep stretch, but was
unable to fend off the rallying foe in closing strides. OKIE FRONT chased the pacesetter while saving ground through the opening stages before gaining
mildly on leader to procure the show. CASINO QUEEN failed to sustain the bid in final furlong after pressing the pace from a two path position. WICKED
STREET lacked a closing kick after stalking the pacesetter from a three wide stance along the backstretch and through the bend. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE
trailed form outset and was never near top three.

LACEY BOSS trekked the three path early, circled the pacesetters inside the half pole and around the bend, then strode away in homestretch to prove much
the best. SEA LEVEL rushed from outset and pressed the pace along the backstretch, gained brief command inside the half pole, but proved to be no match
for winner in final furlong. CADI DEVILLE was in pursuit from the rear through the first call, traveled widest around the turn, and gained mildly to secure the
show. ROME'S BURNING gave chase from a two path stance along the backstretch, rated between foes and was within striking distance at upper stretch,
but failed to threaten in final furlong. ACERTIVE MISS hustled from outset and established first command then steadily faded in closing portion of contest.

Footnotes
SALADO jumped from outset with purpose, established a comfortable margin on the front end and went wire to wire for a clear and authoritative victory.
SWING WEST chased the wire to wire runaway winner from a two path pose and finished well clear of other rivals. BROTHER AARON settled off the rapid
pace through the opening call, closed the gap on the leaders around the turn, and saved ground in final furlong, but the top pair was too tough. GRAB THE
MUNNY lacked a needed rally to end an eventful three path journey. ELECTORAL gave an even chase from a back rated stance. MAGIC CARPET was
unhurried through the opening half before tiring in closing stages.

MISS M J stalked the pacesetting trio into and around the bend, angled out at upper stretch, and rallied for the score. PEPPERMINT SISTER shared the
early command from between foes, established sole command at upper stretch, but couldnt fend off the late charge of MISS M J in closing strides.
SAILSINTHESUNSET came away alertly, trekked the three path through the opening calls, and finished evenly to hold onto show. NOSTALGIA failed to
match strides with leader in final furlong after setting the pace in concert as the inner most rival. SHA BLUSH failed to threaten from a back rated stance. C
C THE BARTENDER broke alertly and was geared down shortly after the start.

Footnotes
ALTERNATE ABBY shared early command as the outer rival of three across through the opening half, gained sole command at upper stretch, then showed
courage and refused to lose stretch duel to earn the score. YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN rushed from outset and set the pace as the inner most rival of three
abreast, maintained that line to upper stretch, then locked into a stretch duel and was edged in closing strides. GREEN LIGHT GIRL rated in the second
flight around opening bend, trekked three wide, and gained mildly on leaders in homestretch. NAUGHTY NOELLE improved placing in late stages after
showing reserve in opening half and swinging four wide at upper stretch. ENVEY N ICE settled mid pack through the opening turn, angled out near the half
pole, rated five wide at upper stretch, then weakened in closing furlong. MS. MORENA settled into mid pack and lacked a needed rally while travelling
widest of all throughout. NITRO NINA came away alertly and established a two path pose in the pacesetting flight before fading rapidly in final sixteenth.
JANE'S COURSE failed to factor and steadily lost ground to front runners.

Footnotes
CANONIZE rallied mid track for the score after showing reserve early and swinging wide at upper stretch. SWEET BAKER stalked the early pace from a
three wide stance, gained a slight advantage near the sixteenth pole, but was unable to fend off the rally of eventual winner. LOVE MY RIDE settled into mid
pack along the backstretch, trekked wide through the bend, and rallied mildly to earn show honors. STEPPIN SHEP faded fast in final sixteenth after forcing
the early pace from a two path pose and rating close up at upper stretch. AVENGING WARRIOR failed to sustain the bid after setting pace for the opening
half from a ground saving pose. DIXIELAND QUALITY rushed from outset to press the pace from between rivals before retreating in the final furlong.
RAINBOW GOLD came away in tandem with multiple rivals, established an inside stance along backstretch, rated in the three path at upper stretch, angled
in near the three sixteenths pole and tired in final furlong. CRAFTY HEAT was unhurried through the opening half, angled wide at upper stretch, but was no
threat to leaders. LAVA BOMB had an awkward stride shortly after the start and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
KNIGHT DISRUPTOR hurried from outset and established sole command immediately, led the field into the homestretch, came under pressure and denied
that rival for a wire to wire score. WIN FOR FUN rated in the second flight and was in pursuit of the pacesetter throughthe turn while saving ground, then
was outdueled in a stretch duel with that rival. EURONTHEMONEY settled into mid pack and trekked the two path around the bend before finishing willingly
while no match for top pair. RIVER RULER rated mid pack as the widest of all rivals through the opening half before closing fast in final furlong to be gaining
on leaders at finish. AFLEET SNIPER improved placing with a late rush to end a four path journey. TAG ME rated mid pack along the backstretch, rated four
wide at upper stretch, then angled out near three sixteenths pole to no avail. REMEMBER ME TONY was no factor from a back rated stance. BURTNJOE
pressed the pace and traveled four wide at upper stretch before tiring in the end. GONNA GETCHA lacked a needed rail rally after settling in behind foes
and saving ground. OVER EZ trailed throughout and was no factor.
