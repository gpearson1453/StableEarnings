Footnotes
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE lacked speed, circled the turn four deep, bid for the lead in upper stretch, drove clear and drifted out late. BAR DOWN EXPRESS
showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace and finished gamely. ALLIGATOR ARMS disputed the pace outside BAR DOWN EXPRESS to upper
stretch then gradually weakened. BAND CAMP raced well off the rail down the backstretch, was four wide around the turn and offered a mild gain outside
horses late. DIALER raced in the two path inside horses on the turn and in the stretch and failed to rally. MOON SIGN bobbled slightly at the break, raced in
the three path on the turn and was no factor. GENERAL J R , outrun, passed tired horses. LUNAR GHOST , three wide on the turn, was outrun. GREAT
GOOGLYMOOGLY , three wide chasing the pace to the stretch, gave way. BOBSWORTH , a brief factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, faltered
leaving the turn.

Footnotes
PATRIOTIC PARTY stalked early while off the inside, steadied sharply off the heels of NOTIMELIKEPRESENT when that one drifted in entering the turn,
dropped back a few lengths then recovered to gain between runners mid turn, came three wide into the lane, closed in under a drive and gained a slim lead
outside a pair of foes in mid stretch, drifted in some while dueling outside MISS YOU AJAX in the final sixteenth and held firm. MISS YOU AJAX , nudged off
the rail in mid pack, dropped in and made a run to the inside of rivals mid turn, eased out and continued progress past the three sixteenths, drew on near
even terms between runners in mid stretch, emerged in a battled inside the winner, was herded in towards the rail and kept on gamely. THRUSTER , well
back early, progressed between rivals mid turn, altered to the rail to gain into the stretch, swung back out for room in mid stretch, straightened and closed
well to quickly gain. STREET HUSTLE advanced along the rail to take command after a quarter mile, handled some outside pressure then cleared around
the turn, widened a bit heading to the quarter pole, was taken on by a pair of foes leaving the three sixteenths, stayed on to about the sixteenth marker then
faded. CAVALRY COMMAND sped to the early lead, was headed from the inside near the five eighths, forced the issue under a hearty ride mid turn, shifted
out four wide into the lane and came up empty. NOTIMELIKEPRESENT , four then three wide early, drifted in bothering the winner entering the turn, circled
four wide into the stretch but lacked a serious finish. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE broke slowly, lagged well back to mid turn, angled out soon after, shifted back
in through the lane and had belated action. NOTION TO TAPIT saved ground near the half, angled out around the turn, went back in late and faded. HIS
ROYAL G dropped back early, raced very wide into the stretch and failed to menace. HE ROLLS , four to five wide, chased and tired. NEVER SILENCED
saved ground leaving the far turn and tired. PRESSING CONCERN , fractious in the gate, was squeezed back soon after the start, dropped in and rushed
up toward the rail to be in range, angled out three wide leaving the three eighths, pursued, failed to kick on into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
DETERMINED LILLY , in the two path chasing the pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out and
sprinted clear in mid stretch and lasted. CHEZ SOLEIL , well positioned in the two path down the backstretch, eased out to the three path leaving the far
turn, moved back inside near the eighth pole and rallied nicely. GOLD DIGGING BROAD , along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, moved to the three
path leaving the far turn then flattened out. TANKA TOUGH stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses most of the trip and showed a late, mild
move. BRING THE MAGIC , three wide the first turn, was well off the inner rail turning for home and passed tired foes. TIME GOES FAST , five wide turning
for home, failed to rally and was brushed by KRONE in mid stretch. KRONE lacked speed, outside horses down the backstretch, six wide turning for home
and brushed TIME GOES FAST when drifting in near the eighth pole. HAINT BLUE , along the inner rail both turns, was outrun. I CAN DO IT was no factor.
THUNDER BOSS , three wide both turns chased the pace to the stretch, faltered and was eased. POLICE WOMAN advanced four deep on the far turn,
gave way in upper stretch and was eased late. ITALIAN WAR CRY showed speed along the inner rail, faltered in upper stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPY settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out picking up momentum leaving the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane, leveled off
under left handed asks, forged to command in deep stretch and held sway. BADGER TOOTH drafted back off the pace, advanced to the inside of a rival
mid turn, swung out well wide past the three sixteenths and closed nicely. SEANOW accelerated to a clear lead leaving the chute, was nicely rated towards
the inside, came under a strong ride when guided off the rail in upper stretch, spurted away past the three sixteenths, was reeled in inside the sixteenth pole
and gave way grudgingly. GHOSTLIGHTER rated in mid pack and outside a rival, edged up between foes mid turn, was angled four wide in upper stretch
then churned on between foes. NORTHERN THUNDER , sluggish away and under a hustling ride from the start, came four wide for the drive, angled wider
for the final furlong and had belated action. BAHAMA CHANNEL saved ground early while under some rating, was put to pressure mid turn, came out for
the drive but lacked a bid. PEPE AND HEYWOOD had speed three deep prompting the pace, chased four wide into the lane and gave way. HONOR THE
FLEET prompted the pace between rivals into the turn, was under a strong ride past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened
through the final furlong. REMEMBERING WILBUR , wide, dropped back.

GREAT HEAVENS , well positioned outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the turn, secured command in upper stretch, was under
brisk urging and drew off. BOX N BEN hugged the inner rail while disputing the early pace, drifted to the two path leaving the turn, weakened inside the
winner and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. RUNAHOLIC saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail in the stretch, was caught in close
quarters inside the eighth pole, angled out and finished gamely. CALMING STORM walked out of the starting gate, swung four wide leaving the turn and
closed outside horses. ADMIT NOTHING lacked speed raced in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed late response. RUN BUCKY RUN lacked
speed, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. UPSIDEDOWN MAN ,, never a factor, raced along the inner rail on the turn. STORMY SEAS
disputed the early pace in the two path and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN KATIE settled in the clear while not far back early on, edged up while saving ground into the far turn, slipped through to the inside of a rival
past the five sixteenths, eased out a path and split rivals soon into the lane, wrested command past the three sixteenths, responded to a couple of sharp
right handed asks inside the furlong grounds, eagerly widened and was steadily hand ridden the final sixty yards. NAVAL EMPIRE , three wide early on,
angled five to six wide advancing outside foes into the stretch, kept on to gain in mid stretch, churned on and earned the place. SHE IS WISKY broke a step
slow, was taken wide for the backstretch run, edged up between runners into the far turn, angled five wide continuing a move between rivals into the stretch,
switched over to her left lead near the sixteenth marker and was out kicked to the inside of NAVAL EMPIRE for the place. ANGEL ART cleared early and
set a rated pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure around the final turn, ceded to the winner leaving the three sixteenths, stayed on a furlong
more then faded late. ISABELLA'S GLORY rated off the pace, saved ground into the lane, eased out some for the drive and stayed on with some interest.
MAP EM UP tugged her way forward between runners near the three quarter pole, eased out and bid three deep in hand, vied outside foes around the final
turn, failed to kick on past mid stretch and weakened. FLIMSY , under a snug hold just behind the leading trio, angled four wide nearing the lane, failed to go
on soon after, dropped back and was eased late. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA prompted the pace two wide, battled between runners from the far turn to about
the quarter pole then faltered.

Footnotes
BORRACHO broke alertly to make the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and drew away through the stretch while kept to his business. WHERE
PARADISE LAY saved ground on the turn, chased the winner, angled out in upper stretch and held the place. WHISKEY AND YOU bumped CHATEAU
when bearing in at the break, raced in the three path in upper stretch, was taken inside near the eighth pole and closed. EXCULPATORY , in the two path
chasing the pace around the turn, drifted to the four path at the head of the stretch and weakened. GOING TO THE LEAD lacked speed, raced along the
inner rail around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. CHATEAU , bumped leaving the starting gate, was shuffled back
near the five eighths pole, quickly advanced in the four path mid way on the turn, prompted the pace and gave way in the drive. HUNTER JOE , eased
outside mid way on the turn, was fanned five deep entering the stretch and gave way.
