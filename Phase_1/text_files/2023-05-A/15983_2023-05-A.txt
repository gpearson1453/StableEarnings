Footnotes
RED HOT CHICK chased four wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, dug in dueling
through the stretch widening away from the rest a furlong out when taking narrow command, dug in head to head and gamely shook away in the late stages
to prevail. DREAM ROAD prompted the pace of BUSHWICK from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing when taking command at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch under challenge, dug in dueling through the stretch headed for the front at the eighth pole, fought on
game to the finish while safely preserving the place honors. OAK LOVES A FIGHT saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BERNT AGAIN chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. GRACE IN MOTION tracked along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, stayed on one paced to the finish and was outkicked. KARA PARA just off the inside
tracking from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the wire being outkicked
in the final furlong. STRANGE FRUIT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.
FRANCA chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. BUSHWICK
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing under challenge for the initial time near the three-eighths and
yielded the front at that station, swung along the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LISTENTOYOURHEART tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the three path on the turn, drew alongside the runner-up under a hand-ride
in upper stretch, took a narrow lead at the eighth-pole, dueled outside under a strong-hand ride in the final furlong and won the head-bob at the finish.
HARRODSBURG was bumped lightly at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked some while inside on the turn, spun
into the stretch in the two path under increased pressure, lost the advantage to the winner near the eighth-pole, fought on gamely inside that foe under the
crop in the final furlong and was out-nodded on the line while well clear for the place. AMERICAN LAW broke out and made light contact with a foe then was
corrected by the rider, moved up under coaxing to race just off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then moved
further out and weakened but was well clear for third. BATTUTA D'ORO dropped back quickly under urging at the start, showed no speed and dropped well
behind, rounded the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch then angled further outside and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
UNION LIGHTS chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced to take over command continuing four wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive under threat to the outside and held gamely to prevail. LEGENDARY LORE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tipped
three then four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive looming to the outside but was
ultimately repelled to the finish. IN THE UNION chased three wide down the backstretch and into the turn, got floated out four then five wide placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths by the aforementioned foe tipping out to his inside, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. PAPI ON ICE
chased five to six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. HOT ROD LINCOLN a bit reluctant to
load prior to the start, loaded once blindfolded sans rider, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and tired. B C GLORY DAYS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded
the front near the quarter pole and went four wide at that station, then faltered in the drive and was eased home through the final eighth. BASIC TRUTH
coaxed from the start, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired, and was
eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
RADIO RED set a joint pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the three path while still outside that foe on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in
upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. PINEAPPLE MAN brushed with a rival at the start then was
hustled, set the pace in unison with the winner while inside of that opponent, vied in the two path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. BRACIOLE dropped well back on the inside, saved ground around the turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole
then moved further out and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. NINETEEN OYSTERS was off slow then dropped well behind the rest of the
field, traveled four wide around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch then moved further out and was no factor. ZEEBEAR tracked the leading duo on the
outside, chased four wide around the turn and tired. MAJESTIC TIGER brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged in the two path on
the turn and came up empty.

from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and was in the midst of taking
command when the eventual winner went on by, then weakened in the late stages. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. LT. MITCHELL showed the way in hand along the inside coming under

PRINCE OF PHAROAHS bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, issued an outside challenge under some urging while in the two
path on the turn, took over into upper stretch then kicked clear, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under
steady urging. FILM STAR was hustled from the start, advanced to race just off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. BARESE settled on the outside, was urged four then
three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. VIENNA CODE bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, dropped
from the three path to the rail under urging on the turn and failed to threaten. SON OF AN EX settled off the pace, was urged three wide around the turn,
floated five wide into the stretch then drifted out and capitulated. BEZOS angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was
challenged while inside on the turn, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch and stopped. SOUTH STREET dropped well behind the rest of the field,
went around the turn in the three path and was no factor.

before tipping three then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to

Footnotes
PASS THE CHAMPAGNE was rated off the pace, moved closer with six furlongs to run, drafted inside for most of the turn, shifted to the two path while
asked outside the quarter-pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to the lead coming to the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging.
IDIOMATIC showed speed on the inside of a foe, dropped back near the three-quarter pole then tracked outside from that point, made a bid in the three
path on the turn, took a short lead into upper stretch, brushed with a rival outside the furlong marker then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no
match for the winner while able to get the place. GERRYMANDER showed speed on the outside, moved clear with six furlongs to run, was challenged while
in the two path on the turn, came under urging late on that bend, lost the advantage under the crop into upper stretch then drifted out, fought inside of two
foes into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. TIMELESS JOURNEY settled off the pace, moved closer while shifting from the inside to
the three path on the turn and came up empty. KATHLEEN O. was off a couple lengths behind the field while slow into stride, settled at the rear, was urged
five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path nearing the quarter-pole and failed to respond in a dull effort. MOMMASGOTTARUN was rated off the pace,
came under urging while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner and was roused into upper stretch straightened away, edged clear to the
eighth pole, dug in under a drive and held safe from a fast closing rival. ONE HEADLIGHT settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside
with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and closed well to just latch on the winner as he
hit the wire. DREAMPOINT tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. LOCKE AND KEY chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly to the finish. STOW ON THE WOLD just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive but was out-finished in the late stages. THETHRILLOFVICTORY broke in at the start and
was corrected, chased three then two wide, offered up a bid taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was out-finished in the late
going. JOINT RESOLUTION chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened.
LEFTEMBEHIND got bumped at the start by JUST FOR LUCK and was forced to steady conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two then three wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. ATLANTA'S ACUNA chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. VINCE THE PRINCE tracked from just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. JUST FOR LUCK broke out at the start bumping LEFTEMBEHIND, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, tipped three wide for home and trailed.
