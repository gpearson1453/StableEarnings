Footnotes
THERIDEOFALIFETIME was the fastest out of the gates and took the lead early on, she traveled in the two path around the track as she set the fractions as
she pleased, was given the cue at the quarter pole where she drew off and won by many. POST CLOSE settled off the pace in the seven path, angled in a
bit into the four path while stalking the early leaders, edged out at the the half mile pole to the five path where he passed horses on the outside while gaining
position, stayed four wide into the turn, angled down to the rail leaving the turn taking advantage of a hole that opened up and closed along the rail getting
up for second. WEDINGTON vied for the lead early, smartly settled off the pace from the three and four path, settled in that position and maintained that
position through out. BODEE BODEE was off a step slow and trailed early on, was given time to find his stride, was asked to start gaining ground at the half
mile pole, he started to gain ground and build momentum, was encouraged and kept gaining ground while circling the field through the turn, angled in five
wide in the stretch where he passed tired foes and out finished the rest. TROPHY DADDY made no impact. SUN SQUALL stalked and then faded.
REDIVIVUS showed brief speed and faded.

SCARLETTA stalked the early pace while racing in the three path, was pressured by an outside competitor until the half mile pole, shook that that
challenger, advanced and gained ground through the turn, challenged the early leader at the seven sixteenth pole, over came that foe, was challenged by
an inside foe who was racing along the rail, battled with that rival down the stretch, while having an outside rival threaten, was kept on point and driven and
proved the best today after racing a game race. REAUX BINA rated off the pace along the rail early on, took a ground saving trip through out, was able to
advance along the rail after the three eighths pole, continued to gain ground and passed up the fence at the quarter pole, was driven and encouraged,
battled for the win but came up short today and had to settle for second. DREWSILLA went six wide through the first turn, stalked from the outside down the
back stretch, gained ground while in the four path through the second turn, was asked for more in the stretch to no avail. RELAY vied for the early lead while
taking a ground saving trip along the rail, was pressured after the half mile pole by a rival closing from the outside, was collared by the quarter pole and
faltered after that. SMART IZZY four wide early and made no impact. GRACEFUL STREET trailed through out.

SADIE'S RANSOM took the lead early, was able to attend the pace, was uncontested and drew off for a win by a large margin. B B GUN BULLSEYE raced
from the inside while off the pace, asked and gained ground after the half mile pole, continued to close and make up ground into deep stretch, up for
second. DONTFORGETRDREAMS was off a step slow, settled off the pace while racing mid pack, gained ground and moved into a stalking position, was in
contention then faded late. AGGIE DOCTOR settled off the pace early, raced in mid pack, showed little after that. OUR CUSTOM DARLING showed brief
speed early on while stalking the leader, then faded through out the lader part of the race. DORGENOIS was never involved. GATSBY'S GIFT made no
impact.

CARLEA'S DREAM set the early pace while matching strides with another rival, patiently waited for the cue to take the lead, was given the cue and drew off
to take the win after the sixteenth pole. SMARTY ALEX settled off the pace for the first half mile, was asked and responded by gaining ground and building
momentum while closing in on the early leaders, passed one of the early leaders at the quarter pole, had aim on the other one but couldn't get there in time
and had to settle for second. I'M D'CAT ran even. AVAILABLE STAR was never involved. RIPITTOTHERIGHT was a bit fresh going into the first turn, vied
for the early lead, was challenged and stalked by an outside rival throughout while setting the early fractions, tired at the sixteenth pole.

HEATED ARGUMENT raced from off the pace early while encouraged to improve position, advanced in between horses to settle on the outside just off of
the the early leaders, was pushed and encouraged to continue to close ground, was ridden out of the turn and five wide in the upper stretch, was driven to
stay on point and raced determinedly to take the win. HAPPY SAILOR vied for the early lead, managed the pace, took a a ground saving trip, showed
confidence the whole trip but was collared late by a determined foe and settled for second today. LEGENDARY GIFT showed little. FABS raced in a
forwardly placed position early, was challenged from an outside rival and raced in between horses, then had no late kick. MY LADY LUNA was no menace.

Footnotes
ORDER OF MERIT settled off the pace while racing seven wide early, was encouraged and kept on point to continue to close ground, angled into the three
path in the stretch and was able to over come a tired leader in the last sixteenth of a mile and was up for the win. PRINCE COSMO showed natural early
speed, took control of the race early, managed the pace, while racing along the rail, raced game but tired after the last sixteenth of a mile and settled for
second. READY SHOES was off a bit slow and was given time to find their stride, settled five wide, was kept on point and encouraged to keep closing,
closed and finished well. EL GABRIELO settled off the pace and raced mid pack while saving ground, improved position late. ROULETTE was off a step
slow, closed late. MR. TEXAS CHARM showed little. KNOCK'EM OUT JERRY flashed early speed, settled just off the pace, while being forwardly placed
then tired after the quarter pole. TULSAN broke sharp, settled into the race mid pack, then faded. HE'S TROUBLE was never involved.
