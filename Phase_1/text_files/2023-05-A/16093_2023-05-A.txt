Footnotes
SPANISH BEAUTY took command soon after the start, continued unchallenged up front running on the turn, opened up on her rivals at the top of the
stretch, was kept to the task while on the the wrong lead throughout the lane to hold safe at the finish. SILVER BULLET LADY was content sitting off the top
two outside five sixteenths from the prize, angled out to the four path at the top of the lane and closed well outside to win the secondary battle nearing the
finish line. UNABLE tracked behind the winner at the half, kept in close range to the frontrunner through the turn, shifted out to the three path to offer a bid
but could not find another gear and stalled late losing the place award. GOLD FORESTER settled near the back on the rail in the early going, offered a mild
move outside at the midpoint on the turn and found some late energy to get up for a minor share outside winning the nod at the wire. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ
stalked in mid pack inside in the beginning, was nudged along on the rail three eighths from home, could not gain on the leaders and levelled out in deep
stretch. GOLDEN TRAIN was off slow to trail the field down the backstretch, was hustled inside saving ground three furlongs from the finish to be in touch
with the field at the quarter pole and had no response through the stretch drive. LADY IN RED settled near the rear down the backside, could not make up
any ground on her rivals on the turn and was not a factor turning for home.

Footnotes
PETTINARI took command from the start, set the pace uncontested running on the turn, opened up of the field in upper stretch and was getting a little leg
weary late but held safe when they reached the finish line. MIA AND ME was off a touch slow at the start, settled in midfield down the backstretch, was in
with a chance three wide as they turned for home, angled in to the rail at the furlong marker and closed belatedly inside to get up for the place prize.
TREBUCHET tracked the top two early on, rallied outside five sixteenths from the finish, had dead aim on the winner running three wide turning for home
and could only finish evenly in the late stages of the race. CHUNKY MONKEY stalked between foes in the two path situated near the back to start, began to
gain some with runners on either side to be in the mix for a share when they turned for home and finished with interest to get up for a minor share in the
end. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was unhurried early on trailing the pack down the backside, could see the field running on the turn and split foes in deep stretch
passing tired horses. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY broke well with the field but was slow to find his feet and was shuffled to near the back outside at the half, put
in a brief run around foes three furlongs left to go, angled widest at the top of the stretch to be six wide and could not threaten. NGABE travelled in mid pack
racing three deep in the early going, shifted to the rail at the half mile marker, made little impact on the fence throughout the turn and had nothing to offer for
the stretch drive. OPEECHEE chased the loose leader on the rail in the beginning stages, started to weaken inside midway on the turn and retreated on the
fence the last eighth.

Footnotes
SOLO ALBUM took control from the onset, led the field into the first turn, continued to set a soft pace running down the backside, opened up on the field as
they entered the top of the stretch and had more in reserve to win comfortably in the end. INDY CHAMPAGNE was allowed to settle at the rear on the inside
into the first turn, advanced smartly on the fence in the backstretch entering the final turn, shifted outside five sixteenths from home commencing his rally,
chased the winner in the three path throughout the stretch but could not gain and had to settle for second best. JANIS JOPLIN travelled four wide watching
the winner into the first turn, continued to track outside at the half, was ridden to go after the loose leader at the quarter pole and could only finish up evenly
settling on a clear third when they hit the line. ELLA FRANCES was nestled on the rail behind the frontrunning winner in the beginning, stayed in the same
position down the backstretch, was scrubbed on the keep up with rivals at the two furlong pole and could make little impression throughout the stretch.
INSCRUTABLE broke out at the start, stalked four wide into the first turn, trailed the field down the backside, saved ground on the rail in the final turn but
could not be a presence running inside to the finish line. MILAGRE DO SOL settled in mid pack outside of rivals at the half mile marker, was coaxed for
more run three furlongs to go, could not match strides with foes and gave way at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
LETS RUN TWO tracked inside the leaders saving ground on the turn, angled out five wide leaving the bend and was a bit wider in upper stretch, took aim
on the leaders and gained steadily, was lightly bumped late but up in time. SNEAKY REBEL switched outside the leading pair and stalked just off them,
went three to four wide on the turn, came out while taking the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted out late and lightly bumped a rival and was simply
outfinished while second best. MURDER HORNET was lightly bumped at the start, settled off the pace mid-pack near the rail, fanned six wide coming out of
the turn, gained show honors. MY GIRL HOOTER was unhurried at the rear, saved ground on the turn, gained willingly in the stretch. HOT OMELET broke
a step slowly and appeared to bump with the hind end of an adjacent foe, was coaxed along and made an early advance outside rivals to be mid-pack and
within range of the leaders five wide into the turn, swung eight deep out of that bend and ran on. SHELLY THE ROCKET moved clear and shifted in, set a
pressured pace on or just off the rail, weakened in the stretch. FOREST CHOICE pressed the pace from outside two to three wide, weakened. PRACTICAL
GIZMO raced off the pace, moved out from four to six wide on the turn but failed to rally.

Footnotes
LOADED QUESTION was unhurried on the rail in the beginning to be near the back of the pack, began to rally with a smart rail move with three eighths
remaining, shifted out at the quarter marker for clear run, was five wide at the top of the lane and closed well wearing down her rival at the shadow of the
wire. SUGAR IS GOLDEN set the fractions in the early stages, determinedly dug in on the rail up front entering the stretch, continued to battle on at the
furlong marker but needed another gear late to hold off the closing winner in the end. SYSTEMATIC sat behind the frontrunner under a snug hold down the
backside, waited inside throughout the turn, angled out bumping her rival at the eighth pole and needed more late to threaten for the win. OLD SECRETS
travelled in the last flight with runners on either side at the half, was ridden between horses midway on the turn, found some late interest in mid stretch and
passed tiring runners getting up late for a minor share. STERLING SPEED had a tracking position between foes in the second flight into the turn, bid three
wide in upper stretch, was bumped by her inside rival at the furlong marker, lost action and lost a position late at the wire. VERY SAVVY stalked four deep in
midfield at the half, was asked for more run three eighths from home, could not quicken with runners and weakened six wide at the top of the stretch.
CLEOMENES was slow into stride at the break, trailed the field down the backside, stalked three wide outside runners at the rear three furlongs left to run
and had nothing to offer between horses in the stretch drive. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY AT THE EIGHTH POLE REGARDING
#1 SYSTEMATIC AND #5 STERLING SPEED RESULTED IN #1 SYSTEMATIC BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
SOUPER FLASHY tracked the early speed on the rail, was patiently handled inside throughout the turn, rallied between horses in the two path at the furlong
marker, got clear late and was drawing away at the wire. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING broke a touch behind the field at the start, took command down the
backside, repelled a brief outside challenge at the quarter pole, stubbornly fought on in deep stretch but could not hold off the closing winner at the finish.
SWINGING MANDY was shuffled back to last running on the fence down the backside, was behind runners on the rail looking for a path as she turned for
home, drifted in under right handed urging in upper stretch and straightened out late showing energy to get up for third at the finish line. SACRED DANCER
settled down the backstretch in the middle of the pack in the three path, was under a hold between horses at the three eighths marker, shifted outside
midway on the turn to start a rally, loomed five wide in upper stretch and ran evenly late losing third at the wire by a nod. AMERICAN GAMBLE tracked
outside in the five path in the early going, began to take closer order three wide into the turn, battled outside for the lead two furlongs from the prize, was in
with a chance as they turned for home but stalled in mid stretch. ANAM CARA broke with the field but quickly was relegated to trail at the half, offered a mild
move four wide entering the turn and had nothing to give for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MILLIE GIRL was on hold in last nearing the half on the rail, had a good inside position watching the three horses battle throughout the turn, angled out four
wide at the top of the lane for run and wore down her rivals in the stretch edging clear in the final one hundred yards. CATICHE forced the issue between
horses down the backstretch, continued to engage with rivals on either side on the turn, put away those challengers turning for home but could not hold of
the winner in late stretch for the victory. LADY MOONSHINE broke in at the start, pressed for the lead on the rail into the turn, fought on gamely inside at the
top of the stretch, could not match strides with the top two in mid stretch and settled for a clear third in the end. MY GIRL SKY stalked between runners in
the second flight down the backstretch, ran three wide making little impression on the turn and finished up evenly when asked in the stretch to get up for a
small share in the end. TEMPEREYA had a stalking position three wide at the half near the rear, ran four wide on the turn making no headway, angled in to
the rail for the stretch drive and had little to show running late. NOVEMBER FOG led the field leaving the chute, challenged up front three wide at the half,
contested outside in the front trio through the turn, was the first to give way at the three sixteenths marker and retreated the final furlong.

Footnotes
STOLE THE RING got away alertly but was soon outsprinted, raced outside off the leaders, went four wide on the turn coming into upper stretch six deep,
ground on to gain steadily, struck the front a sixteenth from home and edged clear under steady handling. SOCIAL DRINKER broke a step slowly, settled at
the rear angling in, saved ground early on the turn, gradually moved out coming to the quarter pole, entered upper stretch seven wide, was gaining too late
but got up for second. SPEED CHESS vied inside runners just off the rail, drifted out a hair turning for home, led to the sixteenth pole and was just
outkicked. DAWN PHAROAH attended the pace outside, challenged turning for home after going four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
HEKLA'S AURA raced between foes in the second flight early on the turn chasing three wide in behind the leaders, came into upper stretch four deep, ran
on. FEDALINE chased from inside, came out three wide at the top of the stretch, ran on without threatening. KIMONO KATE prompted the pace between
runners three wide, began to weaken late on the turn and moved nearer the rail, continued to fade in the stretch. MOET MONET appeared to be getting out
badly nearing the three-eighths and was strongly corrected by the rider and steadied some, made no bid.
