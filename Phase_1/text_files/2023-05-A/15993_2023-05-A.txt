GRIFFITH PARK showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early running, set decent fractions through the turn while pressed by BUTTONWOOD
TREE, extended the lead at the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker and drew
off in the final stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS stalked the decent pace from the inside, lost ground along the turn, made a mild late bid in the stretch run,
was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch and ran on to secure second. BUTTONWOOD TREE prominent in the early running, pressed the decent
pace into the turn, kept attendance to GRIFFITH PARK through the bend, lost ground to that rival at the quarter pole, chased GRIFFITH PARK into upper
stretch, gave way in the drive, was outfinished for second in the late stages and held safely for third. FANTASTIC DREAM chased the decent pace from the
inside, was coaxed three wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
STEIN'S GIRL allowed to settle, raced three wide into the first turn then slipped to the two path into the backstretch run, was unhurried to the half-mile
marker, roused four wide into the stretch, loomed at the furlong grounds, made a sustained rally while outside of rivals into deep stretch, drew to even terms
in the final strides and was up on the wire to prevail in a blanket finish. DANGEROUS ILLUSION raced closest to the loose pacesetter through the
backstretch run, kept a two wide path into the second turn, overtook LADY BLACKBIRD in upper stretch and assumed command into the drive, was set
down at the furlong marker, came under pressure nearing the sixteenth-pole, met the bids of oncoming rivals in the final strides, was gamely bested at the
finish for the win and just held for the place. MOONSHINE CAT unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, was
roused three wide for the stretch drive, came within aim at the furlong pole, closed between runners into deep stretch, vied for the lead in the final strides
and just missed for the win and place on the wire, while well clear for show in the end. SNOW HILL took back off of the quick early pace, raced two wide into
the backstretch run, was steered four wide into the stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong pole but was unable to threaten in the final stages. LADY
BLACKBIRD sent leaving the break, established the early lead and sped to a clear advantage into the backstretch run, set solid fractions to the quarter
marker, came back to the field along the second turn, stopped in upper stretch and did not have a late response.

Footnotes
EDDIE CROSSWIRE stalked the decent early pace from the inside, tipped two wide nearing the quarter marker and was roused into the stretch run, ran in
pursuit of TEAGANS ATM to mid-stretch, reeled in that rival nearing the sixteenth-marker and drove clear in deep stretch to prevail. TEAGANS ATM
showed speed in the early going, set a pressured pace to the turn while carving solid fractions, shook free along the bend, drew to a clear lead into upper
stretch, was set down at the furlong marker, was caught by EDDIE CROSSWIRE nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch
and held well in the final stages for second. MIGHTY RULER prominent in the early running, pressed the decent pace into the turn, kept attendance to
TEAGANS ATM to the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch, weakened in the drive and outfinished HOWDOYALIKEMENOW in the final
strides to secure third. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide to the quarter marker, was roused
four wide into the stretch, made a mild bid at mid-stretch, could not sustain that bid in the late stages and was outfinished for third in the final strides.
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE fractious prior to loading, ducked in at the start and was off slowly, was a bit green in the early running while trailing and did not
factor in the stretch.

EXTRA INNINGS was well placed in the early stages, stalked the decent pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, loomed at the quarter
marker, assumed command in upper stretch, kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. LIBERTY
WOLF settled in the second flight early on, kept a two wide path into the backstretch run, advanced two wide approaching the quarter marker, angled three
wide for the drive, loomed at mid-stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished, while holding for second at the
wire. START THEM UP allowed to settle, made a steady advance along the backstretch run while saving ground, was steered to the two path into the
second turn, roused four wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong pole, closed willingly in the late stages and missed for second at the finish, while
clear of the rest for third. LIVERMORE HEAT unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the backstretch run, made a steady advance while outside of
rivals heading to the far turn, came three wide to the quarter pole, swung widest into the drive, mounted a five wide rally in the stretch run and offered a mild
late bid. ONE BIG SMILE was a bit keen early on, stalked the decent fractions from a rail position through the backstretch run, was steered two wide along
the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms
into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the
furlong pole and faded in the late stages.

left lead to deep stretch, came under pressure inside of the sixteenth-marker, kept to task while fully extended in the final stages and held on for the win on
the wire. STRENGTH OF AUTISM chased the solid early pace from the inside, gained ground on the turn, swung three wide for the drive, rallied inside of
the furlong marker, pressured IDAHO ONCE inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the win, while holding for second at the finish. WELTON
broke out at the start, brushed with IDAHO ONCE and was off a step slowly, chased the solid early pace while not far back, advanced while two wide on the
turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the top pair in the final strides and
held safely in the end for third. MILA'S PAPA was sent leaving the break, showed good speed into the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was

HOUSE OF LORDS settled in the early running, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained his position to the half-mile marker, made a mild gain
on the second turn, waited a bit for racing room in upper stretch, was roused at the furlong marker, closed fast along the rail into deep stretch, overtook
CAISSON inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. CAISSON settled in the early going while not far back, saved ground
while advancing along the backstretch run, loomed at the quarter marker, battled for the lead with BANDERA AZTECA into upper stretch, took command
into the final furlong, was confronted by HOUSE OF LORDS inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the quickly closing winner in the final stages,
was outfinished and just held for second at the wire. BANDERA AZTECA forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run, took command along the second turn, battled for the lead with CAISSON to mid-stretch, could not match strides with the top pair in the late

GOLDENSUNRISE broke alertly, showed early speed and set the pace into the turn, set solid fractions while well handled to the quarter marker, drifted out
a path in upper stretch, drifted back in nearing the furlong pole and impeded SLEW'S JOY, drew to a clear lead into deep stretch, was kept to steady urging
inside of the sixteenth-marker and remained clear to the wire. SLEW'S JOY chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost a bit of ground on the turn,
re-rallied in upper stretch, came in tight nearing the furlong marker, steadied off of heels and altered course at mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the
winner in the final stages and just held for second at the finish. MY BUCKET LIST tracked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide
on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed late response, was outfinished in the late stages and missed for second, while clear at the end for
third. CAPTIVATED DRAMA chased the early pace, kept a two wide path to the quarter marker, lost ground at mid-stretch while still within aim and gave
way in the final furlong. RAYS REGAL a bit slow into stride early on, lacked speed into the turn and did not factor in the stretch. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN A UNANIMOUS RULING, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT GOLDENSUNRISE DRIFTED IN
AT MID-STRETCH AND INCONVENIENCED SLEW'S JOY BUT THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST SLEW'S JOY OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING
AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CONUNDRUM well placed in the early going, tracked the solid pace into the backstretch run while three wide, made a steady advance to the half-mile
marker, loomed three wide along the far turn, vied for the lead with ANITANEWMERCEDES in upper stretch, overtook that rival at the furlong marker, kept
to task to the sixteenth-pole and drove clear under steady hand urging in the final stages. ANITANEWMERCEDES showed good early speed and
established the lead into the first turn, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run while carving solid fractions, maintained a narrow lead to the
quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, was overtaken by CONUNDRUM approaching the furlong pole, was outfinished by the winner in the late stages
and held well in the end to be second best. TABLE FOR TWO was unhurried in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch run while two
wide, continued that gain into the far turn and slipped to the rail nearing the quarter marker, came within aim at the furlong pole, was outkicked in the final
furlong and held safely for third at the finish. RUNKERRY close up in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, stalked the decent pace to the
half-mile marker, maintained an inside path to the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the drive, remained within aim to the furlong grounds and weakened in
deep stretch. GALLANT WARREN allowed to settle off of the contested early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the
second turn, was steered two wide into the far turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, angled four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
could not muster the needed late response. ENOS SLAUGHTER allowed to settle in the early running, gained ground along the backstretch run, improved
position three wide on the second turn, was coaxed five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not sustain that bid in the final stages and
did not factor. SECRET CLUB allowed to settle, raced three wide along the first turn then was steered four wide for the backstretch run, made a mild gain at
the half-mile pole, advanced four wide on the second turn, was roused six wide for the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not rally in the final
furlong. TRIBAL NATION sent leaving the break and contested the solid early pace, kept close attendance to ANITANEWMERCEDES through the
backstretch run and into the second turn, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.
