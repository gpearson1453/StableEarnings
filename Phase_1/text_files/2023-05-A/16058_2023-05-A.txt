Footnotes
CYNANE broke in and brushed the gate then was hustled, showed speed on the outside of two foes, moved clear in the two path early on the turn then
dropped to the rail, remained clear into upper stretch, responded well when roused outside the furlong marker, came under a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. SAM'S TREASURE showed speed on the inside of two rivals then inside of the winner, dropped back early on
the turn then moved to the two path, chased under a drive in the stretch and earned the place while unable to reach the winner. MARCO T. brushed with a
rival at the start, showed speed between opponents, was taken back off the pace late on the backstretch then dropped back, went three then two wide while
asked on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. LONCHURA
broke a half-step slow, was taken in hand when foes crossed in front early then settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was taken in
hand briefly behind a foe around the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. CHITARRA (IRE) brushed with a foe while off a half-step slow, went three wide on
the turn, leaned inward into upper stretch and came up empty. AMIRATI bobbled ever so slightly after the start then dropped well back, went two to three
wide on the turn and was no factor. JUST THE OAKS was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, saved ground at the rear and failed to threaten.
HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA STEWARD DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
ORMSTOWN broke out a step at the start bumping BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD, showed the way in hand just off the inside, spun two to three wide for
home, got roused near the three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive, then got geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish, the outcome in no
doubt. BOURBON CHASE six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. MORETHANAFEELING four to five paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while keeping on to procure the show honors. BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD got bumped at the start, chased four then three wide, came under
coaxing at the half mile pole and tucked to the two path through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SQUID GAMER
shied out a step filling the space left vacant by ORMSTOWN, came under coaxing and chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn, got placed to prolonged urging from the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. RED D G P chased
just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DREAMS OF TOMORROW traveled around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the
final turn, gained the advantage at the quarter-pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and proved
best under steady urging. DAUNT went three then two wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path while just behind
the leaders on the far turn, chased outside in the stretch and finished willingly for the place while unable to seriously threaten the winner. ST ANTHONY
went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked while being headed by the winner at the quarter-pole, battled with that foe under a drive in upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. RICHIESGOTGAME broke near the back, was urged in the four path
on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, was roused late on the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the far turn and came up empty.
BOURBONIC was last to commence, dropped well behind while inside on the first turn, lagged at the rear, went around the far turn in the two path under
urging and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

rallying to take command with three-sixteenths to go and edged clear under a drive kept to task. LIBERTY FLAME established the front and showed the way
in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and
kept on to secure the place honors. SWEETIE just off the inside early on, tipped four wide at the seven-eighths, went four wide into the turn coming under
coaxing at the half mile pole and tucked inwards to the rail with three furlongs to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to the finish just
missing for the place honors. SILVER SKILLET broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and tired. RACING COLORS chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, tired.

DADDY KNOWS went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace well out in the track, vied outside of a foe while in the four then three path around
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under coaxing, spun four wide into the stretch under pressure then responded well when put to a drive around the
three-sixteenths, fought inside of the runner-up from that point to the finish and gamely prevailed under steady urging. HUSH OF A STORM brushed with a
rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn, made a bid in the five path into upper stretch, battled outside of the
winner to the finish and missed while able to get the place. OLYMPIC DREAMS was urged early then settled off the pace, came back under urging late on
the backstretch, chased three then two wide on the turn, pursued the top two under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the show.
AGGREGATION was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, made a bid leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to
the rail early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and tired. FULL MOON FEVER broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken up with a tug of the
left-rein, angled in while settling at the rear, moved out around the five-eighths, went five then four wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond.
WILD BANKER bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and was
no factor. MASKED MARAUDER had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, moved in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPIRIT tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the stretch taking narrow command a furlong out and clung to the lead through to the finish to gamely prevail
on the wire. TIMBUKTU tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch in
behind the aforementioned foe, nudged his way out to the three path against SHINSUN, dug in under a drive getting on track to surge late loosely between
foes and missed for it all. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat dueling with ROYAL SPIRIT straightened away and was headed for the front a
furlong out, fought on gamely inside to the finish getting shaken off only in the last jumps to the line. SHINSUN just off the inside just off the pace, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide at the quarter pole and was nudged and leaned on and pushed four wide into upper stretch by
TIMBUKTU, dug in under a drive the outermost of a quartet in contention through the final eighth running on for the last major share while clear of the rest.
SKYLANDER tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but
was outkicked. PARQUETRY got pinched at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. OUR COUNTRY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. ACHILLES HEEL tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three to four wide for home and made no headway. URAGANO chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch, made no impact. GREAT WORKOUT settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing along the rail with five-sixteenths to
go, took the inside route into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PIONEERING SPIRIT was taken in hand at the start, raced off the pace under reserve while given cover, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied to get
the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear into the final furlong and powered away under steady urging. VARIABLE COST (GB) was taken up sharply at the
start, spotted the front many lengths, was reserved towards the rear, rounded the turn in the three path, came five wide into the stretch and willingly secured
the place. STEADY SCHEMING was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging in the two path on the turn, chased under a drive into upper stretch
and weakened while clear for the show. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. PEJA DU went to the front, showed the way in hand with a clear advantage, raced inside on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. STORMANDY was reserved off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out under
a drive in the stretch and failed to rally. EAST SIDE was taken up at the start, spotted the front several lengths, settled near the back, was roused in the two
path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SECOND AND REED broke towards the back then settled near the rear, went
two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and was no factor. LOOKIN GRAND came away from the gate alertly, was rated just off
the pace, saved ground while just off heels part way through the turn, saved ground into the stretch and came up empty. STJAMES dropped back on the
outside, went four wide on the turn and showed little. MOONFLYER tracked the pace, bobbled midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
capitulated. MAD MAGIC angled in after leaving the initial dogleg from the chute, dropped to the rear near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and
faltered.
