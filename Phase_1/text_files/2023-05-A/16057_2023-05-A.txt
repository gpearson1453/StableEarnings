HE'S MUNNIE vied two across to the turn, drew clear and extended the lead under mild urging. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP was unhurried early and raced in the
back, rallied around the turn, went widest in the drive, closed willingly and got up late for place while no threat to the winner. FRESH ONE vied inside to the
turn, fell back, leveled off and was caught for second. RELEASE THE BEAST was slow early, raced inside, offered a mild bid only and failed to menace.

PISSARRO'S MANDATE pressed the pace while racing outside, assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while under
urging. ELUSIVE FREUD pressed the pace along the rail, fell back into the turn, angled out in the upper stretch and closed well. WHO'S BIG DADDY
dropped inside early, angled out for the drive, bid five wide and got up for show. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE raced between horses early, vied to the turn, fell
back, altered course near the eighth pole and leveled off. JOAN'S JUNIOR settled off pace, shifted out for drive and lacked the needed late rally.

GENUINE DRAFT broke slowly, was hustled along inside to set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew clear and held well. MISS RITA got away
well, led early, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and was all out for place. SPELL FREEDOM was reluctant to load, bid inside on the turn, closed
well and didn't have enough late. MO ARETHA went five wide along the backstretch, raced close to the pace, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid.
PICAFLOR was hard to load, trailed and failed to respond.

Footnotes
EURO TRACKING set the pace, was headed on the turn, regained the advantage, inched away and held under pressure. BIG CITY BOY lagged early,
advanced outside, bid five wide, couldn't gain on the winner and was outfinished in a good effort. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME stalked the pace while racing
outside, rallied on the turn, took command, led briefly, fell back and held for show. FRANZ pressed the pace, lacked the needed late response and hung
late. HE'S A ROCK was slow early, advanced outside and finished well. JUST OKIE was fractious in the gate, was hustled along to show speed inside and
lacked a stretch rally. KICK IT AGAIN BOB showed speed to the turn and faded. MINGUS stalked the pace to the turn and gave way. LOCK UP YOUR
PETS pressed the pace along the inside, was checked hard into the turn and stopped.
