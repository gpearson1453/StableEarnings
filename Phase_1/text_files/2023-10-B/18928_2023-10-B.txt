wide bid off the turn and dueled for command by the sixteenth marker but was out-kicked by the winner, second best. MY BLUE EYES set the pace on the
inside, then was headed and dueled for command on the turn, then dug in leaving the turn but faded late, held show award. MERU was reserved early,
came six wide into the lane and had a late rally. MANAHAWKIN was void of early speed, saved ground on the turn and had a belated rally. NAUTICAL
NATURE prompted the pace and then went up to duel for command two wide on the turn but weakened the final furlong. ZOOMSTER stalked the pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. DARK HEDGES broke outwardly and raced four wide and stopped.
