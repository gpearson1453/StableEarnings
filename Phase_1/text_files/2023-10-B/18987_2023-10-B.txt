JOB SECURITY settled off the early pace while moving from the inside to the three path down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, dueled with
the runner-up through the turn and into the lane, was still on near even terms approaching the sixteenth pole then inched clear late. GET THROUGH vied
from the outset while in the three path, was joined by the winner to make it a trio into the far turn, continued to duel with the winner through the lane and just
gave way late. JOHNNY'S MOMENT chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. WEEKEND IN
COURT was in the two path while near the back down the backstretch, continued near the back into the lane and passed a tiring rival through the final
eighth. SUBURBAN PRINCE vied for the lead two wide into the far turn and gave way. GIVE GOD PRAISE was in the three path throughout and steadily
lost ground at each call.

Footnotes
ICICLES vied for the lead three wide through the turn, inched up into the lane, cleared with an eighth to go while in the three path, drifted from the three to
five path near the sixteenth pole, drifted back to the two path and lasted. EMPIRES PRINCESS saved ground through the turn while trailing the field, guided
to the four path for the drive, steadied and altered in when leader drifted into her path, continued with good energy near the inside and missed. STAGE
BELL raced in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the four path and was gaining to the end. ARMY GIRL vied for
the lead along the inside with two others into the lane, lost contact with the top one, was steadied when another came over nearing the eighth pole and was
not a threat thereafter. FLYIN BESSIE vied for the lead from between rivals through the turn into the lane then could not keep up while drifting to the rail.
SIMPLY COMPLICATED chased the pace from the five path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and tired. LITTLE HOT MESS
pressed the pace four wide into the turn, taken off the duelers through the turn while still in the four to the three path and was empty turning into the lane.
AFTER AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #4 EMPIRE PRINCESS, #5 ICICLES WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST (1ST) AND PLACED SECOND

ACE REPORTER cleared early while in the two path, widened through late turn, continued near the inside into the lane and held while being kept to the
task. TU CHA saved ground through the turn when never far back, cut the corner into the lane then finished evenly from the two path to be clear for the
place spot. ADDICTED TO LOVE saved ground through the turn, bid into the lane while being guided into the three path, was no threat to the top two while
staying on to save the show spot. Z ZS RED raced in the two or three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and
finished evenly. QUILTER settled off the pace while in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path into the lane and never factored. CASTLE
MAGIC chased the pace from the four path into and through the turn then faded. ARDIS was pushed hard to chase the winner through the turn then was
empty through the lane.
