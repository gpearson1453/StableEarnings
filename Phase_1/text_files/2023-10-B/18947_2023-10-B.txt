Footnotes
MALIBU SECRET emerged from the pack to have the outright lead at the five eighths marker, dictated the terms alone up front throughout the turn, opened
up at the top of the stretch and comfortably came home for the victory. KID FORESTER chased for the lead in the early going, was shuffled back when he
could not maintain position tracking the top two leaders running between horses at the three furlong marker, resurged in the three path with a sixteenth to
run and got up in the last jump for the place share. DIXIE GIANT had an awkward start, recovered down the backstretch, was coaxed for more getting a
better position improving on the fence at the seven sixteenths marker, urged at the quarter pole going with outside rival to be in the hunt in the two path at
the top of the stretch and finished with intent to just miss getting up for place at the line. JAMIESTA tracked the front duo three wide outside runners with
three furlongs remaining, was asked for more closing in midway on the turn, loomed in the four path driving to the wire but was outfinished in the final few
strides before the wire to settle for a minor share. RACE FOR PINKS was unhurried trailing the field down the back straight, saved ground, still seeing the
field with one other on the turn, found his best stride late closing in on rivals between runners in the five path at the sixteenth pole but could not get there at
the wire in a blanket finish for the place share. TRICKY MAGICIAN prompted the pace outside at the half, chased the winner but to no avail around the
bend, was hard ridden clinging to the place share in mid-stretch and faded at the seventy yard pole to be involved in a tight photo for the minors in the end.
FORESTER'S TURN stalked outside under a tight rein down the backstretch, co-trailed on the outside in midturn, offered a mild run to be in range five wide
turning for home and was one paced to the wire but was was bot beaten that far in a compact finish for the minors in the end.

Footnotes
PREETZAH'S STAR travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail, roused on the fence at the quarter pole lengthening stride, angled outside in the four path
to be in the hunt turning for home, found more at the sixteenth pole to take control and kept on gamely to the wire for the win. OPEECHEE settled in
mid-pack with runners on either side, rallied three wide at the quarter pole, was in the mix of things five wide driving to the finish line, was gaining in deep
stretch but could not collar the winner late. JUST THE MAX stalked near the rear in the beginning, started a rally between foes in the two path at the quarter
marker, weaved through runners in upper stretch, split foes with a sixteenth to run and closed in the capture third money. HOLIDAY IN CHILE trailed down
the back straight, began to pick up horses three wide at the quarter pole, swung outside in the six path gaining momentum, was full of run late closing in to
settle on the fringes in the end. STREET SERENADE had one beat down the backstretch running on the fence, was asked to go with runners on the rail two
furlongs from home, put in a good fence run through the lane and willingly finished up passing foes in deep stretch. IT'S ME MARIO stalked in midfield
between foes early on, offered a mild run three wide midway on the turn, was in range in the five path straightening out for the drive, mildly finished in deep
stretch but needed more late to threaten the leaders in the end. SMOKIN HOLIDAY chased the lone speed running on the outside down the backstretch and
throughout the turn, could not find another gear at the top of the lane and yielded between horses at the eighth pole. VENTI took command under a snug
hold separating himself from the pack down the backside, had a commanding lead at the quarter pole setting a brisk half mile, began to get leg weary
clinging to the lead at the furlong marker and was swallowed up in the final seventy yards. DISCOVERY CHART was brushed outside on the break, tracked
between foes in the second flight down the backside, came under a ride chasing the frontrunner on the rail through the turn and faltered inside at the
sixteenth pole. PRINCE FOR A DAY tracked the pacesetter on the rail down the back straight, could not keep up with rivals through the turn and retreated in
upper stretch. LITTLE DOMI was brushed inside to begin, settled in mid-pack between runners under a hold down the backside, could not quicken with
others starting a run on the inside three furlongs out, lost touch with the field around the bend and galloped across the finish line.

DOLDER GRAND was content trailing on the outside of this compact bunch down the backstretch, started a four wide run circling around runners three
furlongs from the finish, loomed the only threat in the four path outside at the top of the lane, took control with a furlong left to run and was going away from
rivals at the finish. HEMLO GOLD watched the trio travelling in the second flight between horses down the backside, could see the field but was not all that
far off with five sixteenths remaining, swung out widest in the five path for the drive to the finish line and surged late to be a non threatening runner up at the
wire. BRINGER OF RAIN prompted the pace three wide on the first turn, shadowed the duo outside down the back straightaway, bid for the lead three wide
at the three eighths marker, braced for the challenge outside turning for home, could not fend off the winner at the furlong marker and faded just at the wire
losing the place share in the end. HANK OLLIE stalked on the rail keeping in close range of this bunch down the backstretch, nudged on the rail three
furlongs out, could not match strides with the front pair midway on the final turn and passed the tiring early leaders in upper stretch running on willingly to the
finish line for a minor role. KEEP GRINDING had a narrow lead around the first bend, pressed the issue on the rail down the back straight, inched closer to
the pacesetter into the turn, poked his head in front briefly three furlongs from the line, dueled inside turning for home and tired on the fence at the furlong
marker. STORMIN DAVE pressed between horses on the first turn up top, had a slim advantage down the backstretch, was roused for more battling up front
with runners around each flank at the three furlong pole, could not find another gear running throughout the far turn and gave way at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
STYLISH GENT moved forward under mild encouragement to take the lead and set the pace in the clear racing inside, was off the rail coming into upper
stretch still with the advantage, drifted out late while strongly urged and desperately lasted. SPANISH PRINCE stalked the eventual winner from outside
three wide into the turn, drifted out for the stretch run, gained steadily but just missed. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS lacked early speed racing at the back, shifted
in at the half, advanced inside foes about two wide early on the turn moving out three wide by the quarter pole, swung eight deep into upper stretch, finished
strongly but too late. TOURIST'S DREAM advanced five wide on the turn into upper stretch, kicked on well but was too late. COPINSAY exchanged light
bumps at the start, settled at the back off the inside, moved out five wide early on the turn to avoid a steadying rival, fanned nine wide into upper stretch,
kept on. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN raced outside and up close five wide into the turn, clipped heels behind past the seven-sixteenths, moved in a path later
on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. SENSING HOLIDAY exchanged a very light bump at the start, settled well back inside, saved ground and ran
evenly. IT WORKED exchanged very minor contact at the start, chased with good position three wide, came out a bit on the turn, had no extra for the drive
while running on evenly. FIRST SPRING was lightly bumped and bobbled just slightly at the start, settled at the back, moved out from four to six wide on the
turn, ran on mildly. EXECUTIVE GIANT advanced inside leaving the turn gaining on the leaders and coming off the fence a bit for the stretch run, flattened
out. HIGHLAND SOCIETY was in just a bit tight at the break, shifted in and moved forward two wide between foes, raced two to three wide through the turn,
faded. LUCYS CHILD raced three to four wide steadying on heels coming to the three-eighths and was not a factor thereafter. GUS'S GAMBLE chased
while close up going four wide into the turn, clipped heels past the seven-sixteenths and dropped back toward the rear, failed to rally thereafter.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

GIANT TEDDY quickly led, set the pace just off the inside, drew away in upper stretch and drifted out a bit late while kept to the task. THREEFIFTYSEVEN
moved forward between runners tracking in behind, was within range and the lone challenger coming to the top of the stretch three wide, could not kick on
with the winner and just saved place. LONG POND settled off the pace, advanced outside four wide, just missed second. MT LOGAN raced mid-pack off the
inside about three deep into the turn, swung five to six wide for the drive, ran on. PRINCE OF THIEVES shifted in saving ground early on the turn racing well
back of the leaders, moved out three to four wide turning for home and kicked on mildly. POINT TO THE STARS was urged from the break but lacking
speed, raced toward the back off the inside, failed to menace. CITRUS BOY pursued from outside four then three wide, dropped back and faded.
MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN chased briefly from inside, steadied slightly near the three-eighths, retreated.

RICHIESINTHEHOUSE hopped slightly missing the break, had a good position nevertheless watching the engaging duo down the backstretch, crept closer
three wide around foes midway on the turn, posed the main threat in the three path in upper stretch, kept to the task battling for the lead at the sixteenth
pole and determinedly held off the closing rival in a tight photo at the wire. SALVATOR MUNDI was all alone rating kindly in the third flight stalking the
leaders, rallied three wide at the quarter pole, swung outside in the six path driving to the wire, closed strongly down the lane drifting in late and just missed
surging at the wire for the win in a gutsy effort. DOWNY BOY travelled on the rail part of the quartet watching the front pair down the backstretch, edged
closer on the fence going around the bend, shifted just outside to be in the hunt at the top on the lane, dueled stubbornly with runners on each side at the
sixteenth pole and was just outkicked late settling for the show award in the end. FEELTHEBEAT cleared for the lead on the rail taking this field down the
backstretch, continued up front with a narrow advantage inside through the turn, put away the pace foe turning for home, fended off the winner running on
the fence until the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. BIG EXECUTIVE travelled in the second flight in the two path with a half left to
run, was urged for more keeping pace with the leaders around the turn, angled out to be in range in the five path straightening out for the drive but stalled in
the last furlong. TEMPO MADNESS pressed the issue outside down the back straight, hounded the frontrunner on the turn, could not quicken with rivals
turning for home and gave way in the three path between horses in upper stretch. CALL MY BANKER was unhurried trailing down the backside, made no
headway at the rear running around the bend and showed some interest passing stragglers on the fence in mid-stretch. DIAMOND CRUSH stalked near the
rear in the early going, offered a mild run on the fence on the turn and had little to give down the stretch. SPITE STORE was part of the foursome tracking
the contesting duo in the second flight at the half, was shuffled back three furlongs out losing position and ground, roused midturn, offered little response
and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) co-trailed outside four wide in the first turn, was allowed to find her stride seeing the pack down the backstretch on the outside,
cruised around four wide uncorking a run three furlongs from the finish, looked to be the main threat at the top of the stretch outside of horses and wore
down her rivals through the lane to edge away for the win just before the wire. LIAM'S GIFT had the lead on the rail on the first bend, set a mild pace down
the backstretch up front, opened up a touch running throughout the final turn, gamely found more fighting on the lead in mid-stretch but could not hold off
the winner in the last few jumps. WICKENHEISER co-trailed on the inside in the first turn, improved tracking between runners down the backside, lacked
running room behind horses on the far turn, swung outside finally getting a clear seam in the four path at the furlong pole but could not rally in time to pose a
threat to the winner. ANITA MARGARITA rated kindly outside down the backstretch keeping track of the front pair, began to close in offering a brief run
three wide three furlongs from home, loomed in the three path in upper stretch but levelled out in the final eighth settling for a small share in the end. DIOSA
CATRINA was content to just sit off the soft pace down the backstretch, nudged along in the two path between rivals at the three furlong marker, could not
accelerate with others, lost position through the final turn and picked up a runner in the late stages but failed to menace in the stretch. COURTLY RO was
tucked in on the rail in hand behind the front pair in the early stages, improved on the fence when nudged to go on through the far turn, was in the mix
having a chance on the rail straightening out for home but offered little finish in the final furlong on the fence.

Footnotes
RED ENSIGN prompted the pace in the four path with runners on either side down the backstretch, pounced to the lead outside at the quarter pole, edged
away the early speed rival at the top of the lane, was kept to the task down the stretch and held safe by a diminishing margin at the finish. MYRA'S BOY
was caught five deep in the mix on the outside at the half, lost a little ground outside but not position running five wide three eighths from the prize, rallied
four wide at the quarter marker outside of rivals, was in with a chance at the top of the lane, steadily gained through the stretch run and inched ever so close
at the wire but could not get there in the end. MATICULANT dueled on the rail for the lead down the back straight, emerged up front on the fence with three
furlongs remaining, was collared by the winner outside at the quarter pole, could not offer any resistance in upper stretch and faded at the sixteenth pole but
held on to be a clear third at the finish. SAMURAI CHALLENGE was bumped outside taking the worse of the exchange to trail the field down the backside,
caught up to the pack by the half, was hard ridden while gaining on runners outside at the quarter pole, angled out six wide driving to the finish line and
offered a strong finish to close in for a minor role in a good effort considering the poor break. NEEDS FULFILLED was coaxed on the rail to get a little more
involved at the half, started a run with outside rival at the quarter pole, angled to the five path straightening out for home, drifted inwards even with left
handed encouragement down the stretch but could not be a factor in the last furlong. NOTACHANCEBRO engaged in the two path with multiple foes down
the back straight for the front, chased the pacesetter into the turn, was roused for more five sixteenths out, could no match strides with others and backed
away on the fence turning for home. CONTRIVANCE contested for the lead in the three path with others at the half, was the first of the five to weaken up top
running midway on the turn and tired at the furlong pole. HAAHEE travelled in mid-pack watching the group of five up front at the half, offered a mild run on
the rail through the turn until the quarter pole and retreated in the two path in upper stretch. GUARDTHEROCK bumped inside rival on the break, had one
runner beat stalking down the backstretch, made little impression at the back of the pack running around the bend and could not get involved driving to the
finish line.
