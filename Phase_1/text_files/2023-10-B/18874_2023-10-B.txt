Footnotes
ICE THE KICKER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, held well and clear to the finish to prevail. DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY broke out at the start bumping
SWEPT twice, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner
home clear of the rest and second best. ROB THE BANK coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. GOLDFIRE coaxed from the start, chased along
the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the two path into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. RETAIL
MAN was hard to load prior to the start, broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, raced forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch and through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened. SWEPT broke in at the start and was bumped by
DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY twice as that foe broke outwards, conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased six paths off the inside
down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing midway, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
MISTER J T broke out at the start bumping QUICKFLASH, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the far
turn, remained patiently handled swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, was under a hold behind a wall of rivals slugging it out on the front nearing
the eighth pole, opted to tip out bulling his way out by bumping STRIKING SPEED twice and nearly forcing that rival to clip heels to make a lane for himself
at that station, then forged clear in hand much the best in the late stages. MR PHIL hustled from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
narrow and brief command inside the eighth pole, got overhauled inside the sixteenth marker and ran on to safely preserve the place honors. BLAKE B.
chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied up the rail
with a mild kick briefly pausing inside of ENSIGN PARKER when that rival drifted in a furlong out. QUICKFLASH got bumped at the start by MISTER J T,
came under hustling and chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out before being headed for the front just inside that station, then
weakened in the late stages. ENSIGN PARKER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand four then three wide before tucking inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared nearing the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late going. BOURBON'S HOPE coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide, tipped out four wide near the three-eighths, went five to
six wide into upper stretch and weakened. STRIKING SPEED seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to latch on outside a quartet with three-sixteenths to go, had MISTER
J T angle out from his inside nearing the eighth pole when still latched on and was bumped solidly twice and nudged out of the way for a clear path, then
weakened through to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on MISTER J T before the result was allowed the stand and the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
DUKE OF GLOUCESTER went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth then maintained a safe advantage while eased up
in the final strides. BOLT D'PLATA was rated while off the inside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, swung out four to five wide
into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, dropped in near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. BRAGGADOCIOUS stumbled at the
start, settled on the outside, moved closer in the five path on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response but
just earned the show. SIXWILLBERICH was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn and tired then just missed the show.
COLLECT FROM IKE was rated just off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and came up empty. THE ELUSIVE DRWONG dropped well
behind, lost action nearing the seven-eighths, settled at the back, went three wide on the turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch and was no factor.
TIMO settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. FIRE BARON was reserved off the
pace, moved from three to five wide while roused on the turn and failed to respond. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE settled off the pace, was urged along late on
the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
LIBBAN showed the way early on from the two path before being engaged in head to head combat with SISTER BRIDGET to the inside five furlongs from
home, got given a notch to work with three furlongs out and shook off that rival coming inwards slightly, widened away when swinging three wide into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive and held well to the finish. LISA'S VISION bobbled at the start and was bumped by SISTER BRIDGET breaking outwards
and in turn brushed ROYAL DAME, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
chasing the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) broke out at the start bumping LISA'S VISION, raced
forwardly placed along the inside before advancing to duel with the top one from the five-eighths to the three-eighths marker, got shaken off and spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish. ROYAL DAME got brushed at the start by LISA'S VISION, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch offering little and was eased to the finish. THOUGHT EXPERIMENT chased five wide, angled six wide
into upper stretch, proved no factor and was eased home to the wire.

Footnotes
HOWZYOURCASHFLOW showed good early speed, lost the lead just inside the half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the turn, regained the advantage into
upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. SOLIB was hustled from the gate, moved up to get the lead
just inside the haff-mile pole, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, fought on well with that foe in the final
furlong but missed. EVERLYS GIRL settled off the early pace, was rated behind horses late on the backstretch, raced inside to the three path while let out
on the turn, came out a bit into upper stretch then had the rider lose his crop, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick but was clear for
the show. PROUD FOOT broke out then was corrected by the rider, raced just off the pace, chased four then three wide on the turn and tired. CUPIDS
GIRL was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to rally. DIAMOND COLLECTOR broke out then was corrected by the rider, was
urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. ROJA LIGERA showed early speed on the outside,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, fell to the rear in the three path on the turn and capit.ulated.

and was collared seventy yards from home while along well clear of the rest and second best. CAPONE broke in at the start bumping DAUFUSKIE ISLAND
