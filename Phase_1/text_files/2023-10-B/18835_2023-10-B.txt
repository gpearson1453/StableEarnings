Footnotes
GOVERNOR ATWOOD well placed and off the rail, held position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and drove clear late. CHIEF REIDER broke out, bumping a rival at the start, rushed up to be well placed outside, gained a striking position on the two path
through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held
the place. SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the
show. VELOCIMO unhurried, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled four wide for clear racing
room and edged up for a share. VOORHEES allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals.
WORTHTHEMONEY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. BLAME B B
bumped and pushed, clipped heels at the start, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong.

RICHARD HOOTY unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late.
FASTBYTE tracked the pace, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. WORLDS ON HIGH vied for the early lead on the outside, held
position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. SHOSHA set a pressured
pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. MCSTEAMY never involved, inside.
