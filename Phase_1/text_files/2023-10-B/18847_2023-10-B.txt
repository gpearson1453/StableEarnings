Footnotes
CAPTAIN CARDO , no factor outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn four deep, gradually closed under steady urging and was up
approaching the finish. PUDGE BOY PALACE , three wide under urging mid way on the turn, bid for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and missed.
PRESSING CONCERN hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the sixteenth pole and weakened. RASCALLY REBEL saved ground around the turn,
remained along the rail in the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. ISLAND D'LITE dueled outside PRESSING CONCERN to mid stretch and gave way.
NOTION TO TAPIT , along the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path for the stretch run and weakened. SHACKINTHEBOX was outrun.

Footnotes
SURPRENANT COCCA edged up three wide and under confident handling into the backstretch to gain a stalking spot, remained under rating three wide
into the far turn, cruised up to engage TWIRL THE FLAG leaving the five sixteenths, took over without much asking soon into the lane, spurted away when
given her cue in mid stretch, eagerly kicked away and was mildly ridden to the wire. VICTORY BADGE , away in good order, tracked the leaders while
saving ground, eased out three wide and under some coaxing into the stretch, straightened and closed willingly though no serious threat to the winner.
TWIRL THE FLAG , unruly behind the gate when reluctant to load, broke towards the front then assumed command heading to the first turn, set the pace
towards the rail while handling some outside pressure, came under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, ceded to the winner in upper stretch then gave way
grudgingly through the final seventy yards. FONDRE steadied between rivals early, regrouped and stalked off the inside, edged up into the far turn, angled
four wide under a ride nearing the lane, raced on her left lead past the three sixteenths and faded. VIENNESE WALTZ hopped at the start, moved up three
wide in early backstretch to stalk, came under pressure leaving the far turn, failed to make an impact on the leaders but kept on with some interest between
rivals in deep stretch. ELUSIVE EMPRESS , off the pace while saving ground, worked outward in the lane and had some belated action. STARCRY bobbled
at the break, quickly recovered and moved up in hand into the first turn, applied some pressure outside the leader mid way through the backstretch run, was
under a ride chasing to the inside of the winner past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch nearing mid stretch and weakened. FUNZALO failed to menace.
FANTASY PERFORMER hopped outward at the break, raced forwardly through the initial furlong then drafted back, raced in the clear while not too far back
heading to the far turn, failed to go on while saving ground past the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
NOTTOWAY chased the pace outside horses down the backstretch and on the turn, raced in the three path entering the stretch, was forced in by HIS
NAME IS SUE when challenging for the lead near the eighth pole and edged clear late. DR. DOYLE hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out in upper
stretch, was advancing between, checked when shut off near the eighth pole, altered course to the outside and closed gamely. HIS NAME IS SUE , three
wide on the turn, fanned four deep at the head of the stretch, forced in NOTTOWAY when drifting in while gaining the lead near the eighth pole, flattened out
and continued to get in. SPITBALL lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied. SAVOY lacked speed off the
inner rail around the turn, swung to the six path in mid stretch and failed to menace. LOADED SNIPER sped to the early lead and moved to the inner rail
leaving the backstretch, set the pace along the rail and gave way the final furlong. CRIMSON ROCKET , wide on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
CHARMED WAY rated three wide around the first turn, raced between foes heading to the half, commenced her run leaving the far turn, shifted out four
wide for the drive, made a grinding run under left handed asks, drew alongside the leader in deep stretch and got the bob. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE pulled
her way clear along the rail into the first turn, set a rated pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted nearing the lane, shook back clear under a drive
inside the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly while wandering outward in deep stretch and lost the bob. MORE THAN GLORY settled off the pace while
saving ground, worked outwards past the three sixteenths and finished well. DIVA READY , keen while getting the early outside foes, was rated off the
leader into the first turn, prompted into the far turn, bid to threaten approaching the stretch, forced the issue past mid stretch then faded very late. ARIANA
VALENTINA , pinched back soon after the break, regrouped and settled in last while saving ground, stayed towards the inside in the drive and churned on.
NOTHINGMAKESENSE broke a step slow, was carried out a bit soon after, dropped back off the pace and saving ground, came out through the drive and
finished with interest. CORINNA drifted out at the break, settled off the pace while four wide, came under a ride leaving the far turn, angled five wide nearing
the lane but could only muster up a mild run. GETAWAY PALACE saved ground stalking the pace, was under a ride mid way on the final turn, lacked a
punch in upper stretch and faded. LOUISE BROOKS unseated her original rider when rearing up in the post parade, went back to the paddock for a rider
change, steadied back from between runners heading to the first turn, angled out, made a mild wide move into the far turn, gave hard chase to mid stretch
then gave way late. OLKOVSKHA (FR) drifted out multiple paths at the start, corrected and settled off the pace while about five wide, dropped in to chase
between runners past the five sixteenths but came up empty. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY , three wide to contention, stalked outside a rival, failed to kick on
leaving the three eighths and faltered.

inside of foes with a sixteenth to go, switched over to his left lead but held firm to the wire. TALL ORDER stalked off the inside, advanced three to four wide
in upper stretch, closed in under a drive and challenged outside rivals nearing the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but was denied late. UPSIDEDOWN MAN
flashed speed inside foes then drafted back off the pace while saving ground, steadied when shuffled back near the far turn, recovered and gained off the
inside in upper stretch, was guided well out in the course through the final final furlong and finished well. ONE TRUTH took over from between rivals early,
set a rated pace off the rail into the lane, kept on after being put to a drive past the three sixteenths, showed some resistance when surrounded near the
sixteenth pole then faded very late. FRIAR TUCK rushed wide to contention, stalked outside the leader, came four wide with pursuit in upper stretch then
lacked a solid finish. SMITTEN ENOUGH had speed then was taken off the leaders near the half, gained along the inside nearing mid stretch, failed to go
on near the sixteenth pole and faded. HEMP , five wide outside rivals early on, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to follow through. HELDISH broke

Footnotes
MARGIE'S FUN SON lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the six path at the head of the stretch, closed determinedly outside horses, led late
and drove clear. CATCHING STARS advanced four deep leaving the turn to take the lead, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch, failed to hold off the
winner and finished willing. INFINITE SERIES , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, found room along the rail
through the stretch and rallied. SUPER BOURBON , in hand waiting for room mid way on the turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch for a
clear path, advanced to mid stretch then flattened out. MONEY ROOM , two wide on the turn, moved to the three path turning for home, was caught behind
horses in mid stretch, altered course to the six path near the sixteenth pole and showed a late move. KASIMBA showed speed in the two path between
