near the rail, drifted leaving the turn but dug in under steady stretch encouragement and held on. RUSH TO CANDY settled in the three path the first turn,
started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. REMASTERED stalked off

flattened inside the sixteenth pole. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS stalked from the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
flattened in the three path on the far turn. WAVE ACTION rounded the first turn in the five path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven

Footnotes
GET OFF MY CLOUD tapered in and stalked into the opening turn then took the nod into the backstretch and rated the pace, came under pressure toward
the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the quarter and raced close at the rail through the far turn, recovered the edge passing the eighth pole and dug in
determinedly to hold off the game challenge of MODERN DAY ROMANCE, who veered out leaving the gate and made contact with Curb That Tiger then
rated close inside, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, took the nod two deep passing the quarter pole, contested the edge through the turn, was met
past the eighth pole, though, dueled gamely to the finish. AIR MEDAL raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out approaching the eighth pole and finished well to take third mid-stretch. MEETMARYSMAN was
bumped leaving the gate then rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, stayed in range of the lead in the four
path on the far turn but flattened in the lane. SIENTE EL AMOR rated a slim lead inside on the first turn, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from
that point but faded at the rail on the far turn. CURB THAT TIGER was bumped outward and into Meetmarysman leaving the gate and raced well off the
pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four and five paths on the far turn and showed little
further. WELL EQUIPPED rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn,
lugged in past the eighth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
WINDSOR'S TRACKER raced with the pace three wide through the front stretch then stalked on the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the
seven sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn but dug in under determined handling and took the nod under the wire.
NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE raced with the pace inside through the front stretch then showed the way into the opening turn, came under pressure approaching
the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but missed the nod under the wire.
FELICIAS CASTLE rounded the opening turn about the four path, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved two deep on the far
turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SARGENT KOBE rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. RUN TO DAYLIGHT saved ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. SPECTACULO raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn about the three path and weakened in the stretch. RED DEVOLUTION raced with the pace two deep and between horses through
the front stretch but faded at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole. THUNDERINREADYRICK dwelt at the break and never factored.

Footnotes
HERECOMES SCARLETT was jostled leaving the gate and settled close off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on
the far turn, drifted leaving the turn then angled in past the eighth pole, took the lead in later yards and raced clear nearing the wire. LADY CAIRO
exchanged contact with Herecomes Scarlett leaving the gate then took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but was met, and relented in later yards. GOLDEN BLOSSOM rated close inside on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, flattened inside the eighth pole and just lasted for third. RED RIVER SUSI saved
ground, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased to the outside of Golden Blossom into the lane, finished
evenly and just missed third. MOONTAP rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far
turn, eased outward into the stretch and passed some rivals. HEY RIRI exchanged contact with Herecomes Scarlett leaving the gate and rounded the first
turn in the four path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and passed rivals in
the lane. DEAREST M. A. saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the
lane. PRINCESS LEXI was reluctant to load, rounded the first turn in the four path and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on
the far turn and weakened in the stretch. WAVERLEY showed little response through the backstretch. NO SHARING showed little response.
