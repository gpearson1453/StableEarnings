Footnotes
GIVE ME THE LUTE went up to duel for command from outside, cleared leaving the backstretch, urged right handed outside the eighth pole and remained
comfortably in front under a drive to the wire. JAMMING EDDY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, traveled along the inside then tipped two wide
approaching the quarter pole, finished determinedly through the lane and edged PERFECTIONISTIC for second. PERFECTIONISTIC broke well then
settled off the pace in the two path, tipped three wide around the bend, chased within striking distance through the lane and got edged for second. MY
SUMMER DREAM reserved early on the inside, pushed on while saving ground through the turn, steered out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally.
SUBSIDIZE sat off the pace between rivals at the back, rounded the bend two wide and lacked a rally. WESTWARD LOOK away quickest to clear and
crossed over to the inside, dueled with outer rival up the backstretch, ceded command approaching the turn, chased along the rail to the stretch and
weakened. MONGOLIAN LEGEND raced outside a pair of rivals at the back, trailed two wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
COURT SNORT broke well then took a stalking position between rivals on the first turn, pushed on two wide outside a rival on the last bend, angled four
wide into the stretch, closed in on the top pair from outside entering the final sixteenth and got up late. ZZYZX coaxed to the front and moved inside, set the
pace under pressure through the middle stages, dueled with MIDNIGHT SILENCE around the far turn and down the lane, battled into deep stretch and was
overtaken by COURT SNORT late. MIDNIGHT SILENCE chased four wide early, went up to press the pace three deep then outside the leader, dueled
around the far turn and stretch, fought head to head into the final sixteenth and went gamely to the wire. MISS KALINE tossed head head and came away
last, tracked two then three wide early, bid four wide then three deep on the far turn, lost touch with the leaders entering the lane and flattened to fourth.
POINT AND SHOOT coaxed early, stalked along the rail, pushed on through the second bend, asked right handed leaving the far turn and failed to respond.
MODERA raced up close in the three path, traveled outside the leader briefly on the backstretch then chased three deep and between into the far turn,
dropped back to last on the second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
ALTERNATE ROCK coaxed from the gate then settled off the pace, on the move two then three wide around the turn, collared the leader with a furlong
remaining, took over shortly after and kicked clear approaching the sixteenth pole. STRESSED stalked from outside then steered to the rail, got blocked
from the five-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, altered to the two path late on the bend, angled out in upper stretch and beat SHE'S BULLETPROOF for
the place honors. SHE'S BULLETPROOF trailed on the inside into the turn, angled three wide around the bend, finished willingly down the lane but got
outkicked for second. PHENOM dueled for command from outside, kicked clear on the turn, collared at the eighth pole and yielded. KO OLINA brushed with
inner rival at the start, showed brief speed three deep then stalked the dueling pair to the turn, rounded the bend three then two wide and weakened in the
lane. SHE'S RESILIENT went up to duel from inside, failed to keep up with PHENOM around the bend, chased along the rail into the drive and faded. DUE
TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FIRST QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
NO SECRET chased briefly then took control from inside around the clubhouse turn, set the pace inside a trio of rivals up the backstretch, dueled with
TOKAMAK around the far turn and lost command at the quarter pole, battled back through the length of the stretch and edged that rival for the victory.
TOKAMAK broke well then ceded command to NO SECRET on the first turn, pressed that rival while between foes in the middle stages, dueled on the far
turn and put a head in front at the quarter pole, battled head to head down the lane and was bested in the closing moments. SOUTH COAST ROUTE
stalked from inside then moved into the two path early, gave chased two then three wide on the second bend, could not make any headway on the leaders
in the stretch run but churned on for a clear third. DONTTESTYOURLUCK coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide on the first turn, navigated the
far turn four wide and lacked a rally. CHURCHMEISTER climbed early and tucked inside at the back, trailed to the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and
passed tired rivals. NON TOXIC prominent early in the three path, pressed three deep between on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and tired.
BUFFETT stumbled outward in the beginning, chased four wide into the first turn, went up to prompt the pace four deep in the middle stages, could not go
on with the leaders and chased three deep into the far turn, lost ground through the bend and tired.

Footnotes
BOSS SULLY stalked off the rail early then moved up three deep, dueled outside GEEZER around the bend, put that rival away in upper stretch and was
ridden out to the line. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, tipped out across the dirt, moved out at the eight pole
bothering a rival and rallied to best the rest. BARELY FUNTIONAL also unhurried from inside, went between rivals into the turn, remained two wide then
altered out across the dirt and was along for the show honors. DISCRETIONARY DAY forwardly placed in the early going, stalked along the rail through the
turn, tipped off the inside midstretch and lacked the needed rally. GEEZER jumped out to the front and set the pace under pressure, dueled with the winner
through the turn, lost touch with that rival in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. MYSTIC FLYER pressed the pace while fighting the rider a
bit early, chased the top pair in the two path through the turn, angled out across the first, got crowded between rivals at the eighth pole and weakened.
BUCK OWENS was off a bit slow to begin, raced three wide at the back into the turn, came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. DOS VICIOS
chased outside a rival then three deep into the turn, got carried six wide across the dirt and weakened.

TORQUEWRENCH got fanned four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path around the bend, bid three deep midway up the backstretch,
cleared inner pair past the five-sixteenths pole, led three wide into the lane, opened up outside the eighth pole and was put to right handed urging,
continued to widen through the late stages and was geared down late. RANGER JOE sprinted clear and moved across to the inside early, challenged from
outside around the clubhouse turn, cleared briefly at the five-eighths pole before taking pressure again, vied with outer rivals leaving the backstretch, could
not kick on with TORQUEWRENCH past the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and churned on to best GRANNY'S IPA for the place.
GRANNY'S IPA chased two wide into the first turn then got floated out a bit to the three path early on the bend, moved up to duel three deep, fought
between rivals on the backstretch, was no match for the winner midway around the far turn, chased outside RANGER JOE into the lane and flattened to
third. LEVON broke a step slow and was hustled from the gate, began to pull from inside and had to shift to the two path into the first turn, continued to pull
while between the front runners around the bend then early on the backstretch, chased the leaders through the middle stages, traveled along the inside then
two wide on the second bend and tired. CRYPTOHOLIC broke a step slow on the outside, got fanned five wide into the first turn then angled to the four
path, lagged behind to the stretch, eased and pulled up in deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DR. SOULFIRE dropped back early, went two wide outside a rival into the turn, angled to the three path briefly then steered back inside, angled out again
leaving the bend, closed five deep in the final sixteenth and overhauled inner rivals. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) steadied cautiously early and moved inside,
coaxed along the rail in range through the turn, lacked room from the top of the stretch to the eighth pole, altered out midstretch to unleash a rally but was
outkicked by the winner. PETCOFF got bumped on both sides crossing the dirt, chased three then two wide on the turn, launched a bid while drifting in and
brushing rival in the lane and was outfinished in deep stretch. VEGAS BURNER broke well from outside, came in and bumped rival crossing the dirt, cleared
after and moved inside, met the challenge from PIONEER PRINCE on the turn, dueled down the lane, brushed with that rival midstretch and faltered late.
PIONEER PRINCE bumped hard crossing over the dirt with outer rival, chased after the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved out and launched a bid on
the turn, fought between rivals while getting brushed and faltered late. SIX MAGPIES (IRE) broke a step slow, traveled along the inside at the back, made
progress through the turn, tipped out into the lane, forced to check midstretch and was not persevered with after. MOBE TOWN got sandwiched crossing
the dirt early then put tight and steadied shortly after, rounded the bend in the two path and could not rally. CLASSICAL got bumped between rivals crossing
over the dirt, chased four wide around the bend and came up empty. THERE WAS A PAIR OF STEWARDS' INQUIRYS INVOLVING THE SEVENTH
RACE. FIRST THE STEWARDS RULED THAT VEGAS BURNER BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH TO LAST FOR COMING OVER AND CAUSING A
CHAIN REACTION CROSSING THE DIRT. THEY ALSO REVIEWED THE INCIDENT BETWEEN NEON LIGHTS (IRE) AND SIX MAGPIES (IRE)
MIDSTRETCH AND RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
DADDYSRUBY took control from inside, showed the way around the turn while getting pressured a bit at the quarter pole, kicked clear when roused at the
top of the lane and drew off under hand urging. REPORT away quickly then stalked the leader from outside up the backstretch, drew alongside around the
bend, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. JENSCO chased in the two path into and around the bend, was unable
to find the needed response in the drive but kept on for a clear third. KRISTI'S TIGER taken back early and moved inside trailing the field, moved out to the
two path briefly around the bend then trailed on the inside into the lane, remained near the fence in the stretch and passed tired rivals. SWEET MOTHER
MARY chased along the rail through the turn, moved out in the lane and weakened. GOOD AS GONE tracked four deep into the turn, spun three wide into
the lane and weakened. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN chased three deep between foes leaving the backstretch, moved into the two path late on the turn and also
weakened.

Footnotes
GRAZED dueled inside SPIRITUAL ADVISOR early, fought with outer rivals with a quarter mile left to run, battled GYPSY TEARS in the late stages and dug
in to prevail. GYPSY TEARS stalked from outside then drew alongside the top pair on the turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, dueled outside GRAZED
in the furlong grounds and got outkicked by the winner. MEESH stalked the dueling pair, moved inside for the turn, saved ground to the lane, roused at the
top of the stretch, steered out past the eighth pole and finished gamely for third. TOM AND JAZZY tracked two wide into the turn, moved out and came four
wide into the lane and lacked a necessary bid. CATEMACO sat off the pace, raced along the inside then two wide on the turn, angled out and lacked a rally.
SPIRITUAL ADVISOR dueled outside GRAZED for command, fought between rivals approaching the quarter pole, stayed on to the top of the stretch and
weakened. LUKA GRAZIE traveled towards the rear in the early going, rounded the bend two to three wide, tipped out across the dirt and into the lane but
weakened in the stretch run. MY RANSOM lagged behind early, drifted out across the dirt and was never a factor.
