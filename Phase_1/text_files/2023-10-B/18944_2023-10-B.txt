UNION FOLLY dueled for the lead to the outside of NAIL POLISH made a bid leaving the quarter pole and drew clear in the lane to prove best, driving.
PEACE OUT chased the pace on the outside, made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out late, clearly second best. NAIL POLISH dueled for the
lead on the inside and weakened in the drive, stayed on to best the rest. DOWSER chased the pace in between rivals, then saved ground on the turn and
swung out three wide leaving the turn but faded. SWEET BEAUTY was bumped at the start, then was hustled up the inside to chase the pace, then fell back
on the turn and shifted out and came four wide into the lane but had no late rally. ARROGANTE was settled early and three wide on the turn and was not a
threat.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S DREAM was allowed to settle early, three wide on thee wide entering the turn, then made a three wide move leaving the five sixteenths and
continued that bid off the turn and drew away in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. POSITIVE FORCE dueled for the early lead and made a two
wide bid to draw clear leaving the three eighths, then was put to a left handed crop leaving the turn and floated out five wide off the turn, then could not go
with the winner while staying on for the place award. POWWA OF LOVE was rated early on the inside, made a three wide bid on the turn, then was carried
out six wide off the turn by the front runner, flattened out in the final furlong while besting the rest. BILLIEANNE was off slowly, three wide on the turn, then
had a belated rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. EARLY FROST was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled off the inside in the lane but
offered no serious rally. SHATTER ME dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened.
