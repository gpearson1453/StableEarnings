SARATOGA BANKER edged in taxing duel inside, shook loose into the stretch and stayed safe under steady encouragement. HOT LOVE saved ground off
the dueling leaders and continued well to gain the place. BOBBY'S CANDY dropped far behind, angled wide on the turn and rallied gamely. JEWELS IN
THE BAY trailed far behind then finished strongly through the stretch. IF WE GET LUCKY dueled outside winner to the stretch then raced an erratic course
tiring. MIDNIGHT CAT lacked speed, moved inside then angled wide with little response. SPIRIT'S HERO chased off the pace in the two path and began
tiring on the turn. BRONX TALE saved ground within range and gave way readily.

up, angled out on the final turn and was up for the place. YES SIR COLONEL dropped far behind then advanced between rivals and rallied strongly. FAST
BREAKIN CASH hustled to the lead inside, vied through the final turn and weakened. KINGSVILLE dropped off the leaders in the two path and proved in
the empty in the stretch. HEY PORTER trailed for half a mile inside then passed rivals without menacing. RON DON SCORESE raced off the leaders three
wide and gave way readily. AWESOME LAUNCH moved closer outside into the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
COCOA'S VIVIAN stalked the pace three wide, took over into the stretch and edged off under moderate pressure. CONFIRMED STAR broke very slowly,
advanced wide and finished strongly too late. MIDNIGHT WONDER settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out into the stretch and closed. NANCY
SPAIN chased off the leaders inside, angled out on the turn and rallied willingly. CAST YOUR NET led narrowly along the inside for half a mile then
weakened. SPATIAL REALITY dropped back inside and was never in contention. WILD GIRL lacked speed chasing wide and was always outrun.
EXPECTATIONS MET flashed speed between rivals for half a mile and gave way. FLIRTING dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

GOLDEN MOONLIGHT set a clear pace off the inside, repelled challenges into the stretch and stayed safe under steady handling. MOONBOOTS urged
close up in the two path and made a gradual late gain. OUR UPTOWN GIRL chased inside, made a menacing move on the turn then flattened out. BOSS
LIKE BETH settled close up four wide down the backstretch then lacked a rally. JEZEBEL JADE trailed for half a mile then caught tiring rivals.
SHETALKSTOMUCH lacked speed, moved inside on the turn and failed to respond. MORE RANSOM hustled off the pace three wide in the opening quarter
and stopped.

evenly late. TRAFFIC MASTER reserved close up four wide to the stretch and faltered. AHSAD led narrowly in hand for three quarters and weakened.
