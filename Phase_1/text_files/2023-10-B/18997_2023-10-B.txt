Footnotes
HOLD THE IRISH surged out of the far turn clearing in upper stretch drawing off as much the best. DYNAFORM slow early came five wide to upper stretch
rallying late at mid track to save place. FIND YOUR BOAZ off slowly lagged to the far turn coming six wide down the lane rallying late. LIL MR MATT
prompted the pace chasing on the inside to upper stretch weakening late. BOB'S CALLING slow early passed a few down the lane on the inside. MARSALA
MONARCH played no factor. CHASING A PAYDAY stalked the pace pressing to lead on the far turn then faded down the lane. LIGHTNING JACK was
never involved. HONKY TONK HERO failed to respond. SMOOTH PAPA set the pace being hooked on the far turn giving way abruptly down the lane.
