Footnotes
DANCIN' DEPUTY had a slim advantage while pressed inside down the back straight, battled outside for the lead into the turn, put away the early pace foe
by the five sixteenths marker, spurted away from the closing in rival when encouraged right handed at the furlong marker and comfortably glided in for the
win with an impressive front running score. HEEZESPEEDY had a good position watching the contesting duo on the outside through the turn, took closer
order gaining on the leader to pose the only threat at the top of the stretch, was repelled by the winner at the eighth pole and was kept to the task late to
best the rest crossing the line. YODDHA travelled three wide in the second flight three furlongs from the line, was urged to go at the quarter pole to be in the
mix of things in the three path turning for home, posed no threat to the top two in upper stretch but did battle on to be a clear third at the wire. HARPER
CITY was tucked in on the rail spotting the front three down the backside, angled outside off the tiring co-leader in midturn, battled on the fence for the show
money in upper stretch but could not find more late finishing on the wrong lead to settle for a minor role in the end. BROTHER BELEN settled in the three
path close to the back of the pack in the early going, began to pick up rivals four wide on the outside through the turn, swung out to the six path for the drive
and ran on willingly to the wire passing runners to the finish. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was unhurried trailing down the backside, made little impression
travelling three wide between horses running around the bend and could not get involved down the lane. COMMANDER AT SEA was steadied when in tight
quarters behind and between runners with seven sixteenths to go, lost ground when shuffled into the turn, regrouped on turn making a mild run but levelled
off in the final sixteenth. IT'S ME MARIO travelled in midfield on the rail in the beginning, was coaxed for more shifting out three wide at the three furlong
marker, offered no response and failed to menace driving to the finish line. EL BANDOLERO broke out brushing the gate at the start, stalked near the back
down the backstretch, saved ground seeing the field on the turn but could not make any headway and had nothing to show in the stretch run. HARD
RELOAD pressed the issue inside down the back straight, dueled up front on the rail into the turn, gave way to the frontrunner midpoint on the turn and
backed through the field on the fence at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
FOUR K FORCE broke a step slowly, was encouraged forward and tucked in behind the leaders tracking, steadied slightly near the six-and-one-half
dropping back a couple lengths, switched out and advanced three wide on the far turn, took aim in the stretch while drifting out a bit, surged to the lead
seventy yards out and clear. GIANT ONE hit the gate and was very awkward out of the stalls veering out and having to steady to avoid rivals, settled off the
pace and racing off the inside, edged nearer on the far turn still removed from the fence, rallied between foes in late stretch for the place. KILLARY was
forced out a bit at the start, settled off the pace racing wide, moved nearer the inside to begin the advance on the far turn, swung out six wide leaving that
bend, finished up well but missed second. BAJAN BULLET tucked in behind while forwardly-placed stalking three wide, advanced outside to the lead about
the five-eighths, moved clear past the seven-sixteenths, extended the margin on the far turn, faltered and faded. CHAIRMAN LAYLA pressed early, was
within range two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE was quite hard to control into the first turn racing a bit rank, steadied
and was guided out several paths nearing the three-quarters, made no bid. C R HOT SHOT moved to the lead, set the pace inside, was overtaken at the
five-eighths, chased in behind, came off the rail turning for upper stretch, failed to rally. SILENT WARNING broke outwardly, rated off the pace and off the
rail, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
NEWPORT AGENT tracked the front duo on the first turn inside, was shuffled back on the rail to be near the rear when entering the final turn, advanced
through the turn on the fence while still not asked for more run, shifted out to the two path at the quarter pole weaving through runners, found a clear path
inside at the furlong marker and surged late to be edging clear in the final few strides. HULLABALOO took control from the onset, was prompted outside
with a half mile to go, opened up on the chasing rivals through the far turn, stubbornly found more at the top of the stretch clinging determinedly to the lead
but gave way late to the winner in a gutsy frontrunning to still best the rest at the finish line. MAMBOINTHEFOREST made a four wide move looking strong
at the seven sixteenths marker around horses, then stalled some in midturn, re-engaged to be in the thick of things in the six path straightening out for the
drive and willingly ran to the wire holding off challengers on either side for third while still trying to reel in the front two at the line. STOP THE HUMBUG
trailed on the rail for most of the race, began to start a rally at the quarter pole picking up rivals, swung out widest in the seven path turning for home and
showed good late energy gaining with each stride to the wire but could not get there in time. BET stalked near the rear on the rail in the early going, angled
outside runners at the half, made a strong move three wide between horses at the quarter pole, loomed in the five path at the top of the lane and was
outfinished in the final sixteenth to settle for a small piece of the prize at the wire. SOLAR chased the pacesetter in the first turn, was throttled down between
rivals to track the front pair at the half, crept closer to the lead on the fence running on the final turn, could not offer a run when roused at the quarter pole
and yielded on the fence in upper stretch. FINALIST was under a tight rein settling in midfield on the outside, galloped strongly improving position outside
down the backstretch, was checked mildly between runners when the field bunched up at the three eighths pole, could not recover through the stretch and
was not a factor driving to the wire. SOCIETY JOE tracked the top pair outside on the first turn, made an early move entering the backstretch to prompt the
pace outside at the half mile marker, chased the frontrunner in vain on the final turn and retreated in the four path turning for home.

Footnotes
GUARD OF HONOUR was intent on the lead early, moved forward setting the pace with moderate outside pressure, faced a new challenger at the top of
the stretch, was overtaken by that foe nearing the furlong grounds, dueled and fought back to regain the lead and get the nod. THIS DUDE A BREEZE
settled outside three to four wide early, advanced steadily outside into and on the far turn, bid in upper stretch putting a short head in front nearing the eighth
pole, dueled, was outfinished. CHASING TROUBLE settled just off the leaders tracking inside, angled five wide coming to the top of the stretch, was carried
out a bit in mid-stretch, finished well to be gaining but too late. WAR IN CHARGE pressed the eventual winner from outside two to three wide, had no extra
for late stretch while drifting out just a bit and running on evenly late. GREYSTONE settled at the back between runners early then continued at the back two
to three wide, fanned six wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. ENAHM dwelt at the start, brought up the rear early, advanced outside foes about four
then five wide while ridden along early on the far turn, fanned seven deep and evened out thereafter. PAT'S GAMBLE settled off the pace, saved ground,
cut the corner advancing inside on the far turn but flattened out in the lane. MASON'S MUSIC stalked from in behind outside a rival two to three deep
mid-pack, was carried out leaving the far turn, altered inside a rival at that point and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RED SNEAKERS bobbled at the start, was scrubbed on four wide outside runners making a move three eighths from the line, swung out widest in the seven
path at the top of the lane, wore down rivals by the sixteenth pole to take command and was extending the margin at the finish. BE ON NOTICE ducked in
at the gap leaving the chute, regrouped to be in a good spot at the half, rallied three wide between foes three eighths from the line, had a narrow lead in the
five path turning for home but was no match for the winner in deep stretch. COMPUTER HACKER had a good position watching the contesting trio down the
backside, improved on the rail three furlongs from the prize, dueled for the lead between horses in the four path in upper stretch, could not pose a threat to
the top two late but and held for third at the finish line. DUBAWI BULL was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed on the inside with four furlongs to go, started to
lengthen stride picking up runners three furlongs out, advanced smartly going by runners impressively at the quarter pole and was full of run to the wire
closing in to just miss getting up for the show at the finish. SCAT FACTOR was steadily briefly soon after the start, offered a mild run just outside in the two
path with five sixteenths from the wire and finished up with intent but did not not switch leads down the lane. HIGHLAND ROCKY was situated on the rail in
mid-pack in the beginning, came under a ride on the fence making little improvement in the turn and found some late interest passing tired runners down the
stretch. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN prompted on the rail in the early going, emerged with the lead heading into the turn, was collared outside at the top of the
lane, offered no resistance in upper stretch and wilted at the furlong marker. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE had a slim lead in the four path down the back straight,
chased the pacesetter three wide on the turn, was in the thick of things in the six path straightening out for the drive and tired in the last sixteenth. TRUE
SHOT hopped at the break, settled near the rear in the early stages, was hard ridden outside in midturn making no impact and and had little to give driving
to the finish. STILL WICKED co-trailed on the outside at the half, could not keep up losing ground to all throughout the turn and could not get into contention
in the drive to the wire. VISITOR'S WELCOME pressed the issue three wide between down the back straight, began to weaken chasing the pace three
furlongs from home and flattened out at the quarter pole on the fence.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA settled in behind the leaders under light rating tactics, went three then four wide on the turn fanning six wide into upper stretch for room and full
of run, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drew clear. BLUE MAX pressed the pace from early on, drifted out four wide while commencing a bid leaving the
turn, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, was outkicked. GUILDSMAN (FR) tracked in behind along the inside, shifted out four wide leaving the turn then
altered back inside the leader in upper stretch, ran on to get show. SOUPER RIVER settled outside at the rear, was forced six wide through the turn coming
seven deep into upper stretch, ran on, missed show. SYNCHROMESH shifted in racing near the inside at the back, rallied mildly from between runners
through the stretch but ultimately needed more. C C'S KINGDOM was forwardly-positioned briefly in the early stages, dropped back three wide soon after,
kept on evenly. READY HERO was caught five wide heading into the turn racing at the rear, eased back and shifted in three deep about the five-sixteenths,
needed more in the lane. DOT'S VISION bobbled just slightly at the break, was coaxed to the lead, set the pace inside facing some pressure, weakened.
KING ALFREDO attended pressing from outside three to four wide, floated out six deep leaving the turn, faltered and faded. CONFUSING chased mid-pack,
dropped back four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CARMENOOTZ stalked near the rear three wide on the first turn, took closer order edging nearer to the leaders three wide three furlongs out, poked his
head in front by the time they turned for home in the five path, was clinging desperately on the lead with an eighth to run and stubbornly kept on going to last
in a photo at the finish line. MUSKOKA GIANT co-trailed on the outside in the early going, continued to see the field down the back straight, started a run
looping around rivals three furlongs from the line, loomed the threat outside runners widest in the seven path driving to the finish and was edging closer with
every stride down the lane but came up one stride shy at the wire. OCTOBER FROST was in tight at the start, co-trailed on the inside into the first turn,
began to creep closer three wide outside down the backstretch, followed the winner on the final turn, bid in the six path turning for home, lugged in under left
handed encouragement with a furlong to go and was steadied fighting for the lead nearing the wire with runners on each side. ROCKLAND EXPRESS rated
kindly alone in the third flight stalking down the backside, was nudged on the fence keeping pace with the leaders through the final bend to be in range if
good enough turning for home but offered only a mild finish on the rail late to settle for a small piece of the prize in the end. THREE SONNY SIDEUP
prompted the pace outside in the early stages, assumed command when the frontrunner gave way at the half, dueled inside around the final turn for the top
spot and stayed on gamely until deep stretch. FIRST SPRING travelled five wide outside in midfield on the first turn, improved outside runners down the
backstretch, watched the lead trio at the half, inched closer to the contesting pair on the lead at the quarter pole but could not find more late and stalled with
a furlong to go. THY KINGDOM broke outwards to begin, was situated near the rear on the fence down the back straightaway, made no gain on rivals on
the final turn and showed some late interest inside in the final sixteenth. SILENT LUCIDITY lost some position when forced out by inside runner into the first
turn, settled in the third flight inside four furlongs from the prize, put in a mild run with five sixteenths remaining and had nothing to show driving to the finish
line. CANYOUHEARMENOW was bumped on the break inside, had a good spot under a snug hold tracking the engaged front duo at the half, battled for the
lead outside on the final bend and came up empty with a furlong to run. BAYTOWN ELVIS stalked on the rail in mid-pack down the back straight, offered no
run losing sight of the field running on the final turn and passed a straggler in upper stretch. SAME AGAIN DOC took this into the first turn, continued up
front until the half mile marker, gave way under a ride into the far turn and stopped abruptly at the quarter pole. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 OCTOBER

Footnotes
SPEEDY RIVER was brushed, bobbling slightly on the break, recovered to track the pacesetter outside down the backstretch, was content on the turn
watching the lone speed upfront, pounced outside at the quarter marker, battled the length of the stretch and got the better of the rival nearing the wire to
edge away at the line. HIPNOTIZADA took command down the backside, continued to set the fractions up front comfortably around the bend, was headed
outside by the winner at the quarter pole, dueled gamely inside to the wire through the entire stretch and just gave way late to be second best at the finish.
QUIET MADDELENA was three deep on the outside tracking the front two in the beginning, took closer order three wide gaining on the leaders with a
quarter mile to run, loomed a threat in the four path at the top of the stretch and evened out in the last eighth to hold for third money. PINO IN A PURSE was
nudged on the rail in the third flight entering the turn, kept up to the leaders when roused on the fence midturn, battled inside turning for home for the show
share, was just outfinished late and settled on the fringes when crossing the line. CRUMLIN BIRD settled in the third flight between foes under a hold three
eighths from home, was in range four wide on the outside of the leaders at the top of the stretch but could only finish up mildly in the final furlong to be in the
mix for a minor role in the end. MI TORMENTA stalked near the rear down the back straight, was urged left handed midway on the turn not offering much of
a run and could not get interested to be a factor driving to the finish line. BRIENNE OF TARTH came under a ride just trying to keep up to the pack down the
backstretch, showed little making no impression running on the turn and lacked a rally through the stretch. BABY MO was away slowly to trail down the back
straight, could not get into contention running around the turn and galloped to the wire never getting involved down the stretch.

Footnotes
MO TOURIST was quite content sitting all alone watching the pacesetter through very quick fractions at the half, began to reel in the speedster at the half,
quickly went by to seize control at the quarter pole, had a commanding lead by mid-stretch and was much the best at the finish line. GROOM LAKE was
eager behind runners fighting the rider on the first turn, started to gain on rivals extended his stride three furlongs from the finish on the rail, shifted just
outside picking up runners through the last turn and closed belatedly to nail the frontrunner at the wire for second place. STRONGER TOGETHER set a
torrid pace in the first half, had a commanding but quickly diminishing lead entering the final turn, offered no resistance to the winner who blew by at the
quarter pole, was getting leg weary in upper stretch and faded at the wire to lose second money in a photo. ROBITAILLE stalked near the back between
runners in the early stages, began to pick up runners making a running while weaved through horses at the quarter pole and finished up with intent down the
stretch on the rail for a small share completing the superfecta. COACH ABERNATHY settled in mid-pack between horses down the backstretch, was urged
at the quarter pole keeping pace with rivals, had a chance for a little piece of the prize in the two path straightening out for the drive but was one paced in
the final eighth. GOOD SOLDIER was forwardly placed in a very strung out field at the half mile marker, chased but to no avail the front two around the final
bend, had a chance for piece of the prize inside at the top of the stretch, could not find more late and stalled with a sixteenth to run. GUNGI stalked three
wide in the first turn outside runners, travelled near the middle of the field three deep down the back straight, could not advance running around the final
bend, resurged in mid-stretch but could not be a factor in the stretch drive. DAWSON SILVER was under a snug hold on the fence in midfield, offered a brief
rally three wide midway on the final turn, was in range for a small share running in the five path turning for home but faltered in the final furlong. MISTER
MESEEKS was unhurried on the rail to co-trail inside down the backstretch, caught up to runners with three furlongs to go, offered a brief run three to five
wide outside foes on the far turn and could not be a presence in the stretch running. PERFECT PLAY co-trailed on the outside in the first turn, made no
pression down the backside, could see the field running through the far turn and passed some tired rivals driving to the finish on the fence. SOCIAL
JUSTICE stalked close to the back outside three wide on the first turn, made a move four wide circling around foes three furlongs out until the quarter pole,
could not sustain the run and weakened behind runners at the top of the stretch. GLENHOLME was part of the tracking trio watching the loose speedster
down the back straight, came under a ride to go after the front pair on the final turn, could not make up any ground at the quarter pole and stopped in
mid-stretch. BLONDE DYNAMO was nestled on the rail in third on the first turn, was hard ridden on the fence three furlongs out going in the wrong direction
and emptied out having nothing to give in upper stretch. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FRACTIONS FOR THIS RACE WERE HAND TIMED
