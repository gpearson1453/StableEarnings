Footnotes
JACKIE THE JOKER settled comfortably behind the leading trio, stalked three then four wide on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, rallied to the
lead in upper stretch, drifted in under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop inside that marker and held under
strong urging. MERAVIGLIOSO was hustled from the gate, showed good speed on the inside of two foes, chased along the rail onthe turn, came off the
inside into upper stretch, moved further out near the furlong marker and safely secured the place. QUEEN ARELLA showed speed on the outside, chased in
the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the leader into the final furlong and weakened. MISS DOMINA was hustled to the
front, showed the way while off the inside, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and
gave way. DIVA BANKER bumped with a foe early, was urged along at the rear on the outside, went four wide o n the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. ALPINE QUEEN bumped with an opponent early, moved in while hard ridden near the back, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor.

Footnotes
MOST OF ALL showed early speed then tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, took the lead in the three path outside the
three-eighths, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well when shaken up some in upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong and proved much
the best while geared down to win handily. MAGIC EIGHT BALL ducked in at the start, moved up to get the lead outside the three-quarter pole then went
clear inside that pole, was challenged by the winner at the half-mile pole, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage outside the three-eighths, dropped back
coming to the quarter-pole and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place. PAST TENSE was unsettled in the gate then off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, moved out early then settled on the outside, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response while
best of the rest. TRUE MYTH showed speed then chased the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and came up
empty. NOT TONIGHT JOE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into
the stretch and was no factor.

SUN AND WIND coaxed along lightly showing the way from the two path under pressure from MEL'S ANGEL to the outside, tucked inside through the turn
and dueled with that rival, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take back the front at the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive kept to
task. POSEIDON'S MIST six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, was approaching the quarter pole when appearing to
spook outwards bobbling before ending up just off the heels of ELLA SPEED, bobbled again when making some clipping contact with the rear of that rival,
the rider showing strong balance to remain upright through both bobbles, took the inside route into upper stretch roused and offered up a mild kick showing
good courage to close in for the place honors clear of the rest. MEL'S ANGEL prompted the pace five to six paths off the inside before tucking three wide
into the turn advancing to duel for command, took over with five-sixteenths to go, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, drifted out and yielded the front
at the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late stages. BORNFORGREATNESS coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the last major share. LET'S CONNECT chased three to four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. LONE STAR WILDCAT chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired foes to the finish. NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE chased three to four wide until tucked to
the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, weakened. ALOTTA JAYS coaxed from the
start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the drive. ELLA SPEED chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, appeared to get clipped behind by
POSEIDON'S MIST nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the stretch. SONG OF SOLOMINI coaxed from the gate,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, tired. REGENERATOR chased five wide under
coaxing from midway on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. PRINCESS BECCA chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, made no impact.

Footnotes
MAMA'S GOLD went to the front, showed the way off the rail, traveled around the turn in the two path, extended the advantage coming to the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down in upper stretch and held under strong urging. AMEDEUS MUSIC was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved
up to track the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and willingly earned the place. BOYS CODE was
urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and was along for the show. BOURBON CHASE bobbled slightly at the
start then was hustled, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. UNCLE MARTY settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn and was no factor. HERE'S WALDO was hustled
from the gate then raced just off the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, fell further back while three then two wide on the turn and
retreated. VETERANS BEACH reared at the start then came outward while off slow, spotted the front several lengths, moved up be forwardly placed on the
outside, dropped back while moving from the four path to the two path on the turn and faltered.
