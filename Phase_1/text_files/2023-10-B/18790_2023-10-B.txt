Footnotes
AIRBORNE ELITE stalked in the three path and between horses, bid turning for home, led entering the lane and drew off. SUNSET TOWN bumped an
outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, tipped from the two to three path in upper stretch, ran on to gain place at the furlong grounds and was
second best. BATTLE BORN laid off of the pace in the four to five path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, sustained stride to reach show leaving the
furlong grounds and held between horses. GO CATS broke a step slow, raced at the rear outside of rivals in the five to seven path and moved up.
DREAMWITHINADREAM was urged along in midpack two wide and between horses, entered the lane in the four path and failed to menace. DARIO lacked
speed in the three to four path and between horses into the turn, then made little impact. JUL QUIST broke a step slow, stalked in the four path, ranged up
outside of the top pair turning for home but weakened in upper stretch. LOTS OF MISCHIEF took contact from an inner rival at the start and was outrun
along the inside. DERRICK set the pace in the two path, met challenges from an outer pair of bidders turning for home, got headed by the eventual winner
entering the lane and weakened in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead then was found to have bled.

Footnotes
COURBE lacked speed along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, circled rivals in the five path around the far turn to bid in hand at the quarter
pole, forged an advantage from an inner RIPERTON shortly after and held sway from that persistent foe through the lane. RIPERTON broke a bit outwardly
at the start, set a comfortable pace in the three to two path around the first turn, showed the way in hand into the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder
leaving the quarter pole, fought on grudgingly but failed to regain even terms. PEIGNOIR raced forwardly in the two path into the first turn, but got rank as
the leader shifted down ahead of him around that bend, steadied entering the backstretch, stalked into the far turn, took aim two wide and between horses
while getting outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, and chased the top pair home. FLOORED broke a step slow, tracked in the three path and
between horses, backed out of cramped quarters to trail the field approaching the quarter pole, then improved inside of foes entering the lane and failed to
menace. SHOW OFF tracked in the four path, but was outmoved by an outer bidder around the far turn and gave way. UMEBOSHI stalked outside of the
leader and from the four to three path around the first turn, vied down the backstretch, but came under urging approaching the far turn and faded between
horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
YOLANDA WHO leaned out at the start, stalked in the four path, got outmoved by an outer foe while pausing behind the leaders at the five sixteenths pole,
shifted out to the five path nearing the lane, tipped inwardly while leaving the three sixteenths pole, yet sustained a grinding rally to bid in the final sixteenth
and edged an advantage late. SHIP IT tracked in the five path, produced an early bid while tucking to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear
entering the lane, held sway to the sixteenth pole, but was caught by an outer bidder late. MISS FOXANN chased along the inside, tipped to the three path
entering the lane, steadied when an outer rival shifted inwardly passing the three sixteenths pole, altered out entering the final furlong and stayed on late.
LIAM'S LASS lacked speed while hung in the five to six path, attempted to bear wider around the turn, shifted inwardly in midstretch and moved up between
horses late. GORMLEYESQUE prompted outside of the leader and from the four to three path into the turn, but was outmoved by an outer rival at the five
sixteenths pole and gradually yielded between horses. BEACH KITTEN set the pace inside of a pressing foe while in the three path, tucked to the two path
entering the turn, got headed by an outer bidder turning for home and gave way. DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE broke multiple lengths slow, lacked speed in the
three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. GIN N SIN saved ground while lagging behind and got outrun. SUNDAY GRACE
prompted inside of the leaders while in the two path through the early stages, but faltered approaching the turn, weakened and was found to have bled. THE
RIDER OF MISS FOXANN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER YOLANDA WHO FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION
WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
DESERT WOLF set the pace along the inside, built a loose margin entering the far turn, widened under moderate urging in upper stretch and was geared
down with a sixteenth to go. THE GATEKEEPER tracked along the inside under a snug hold, inherited place nearing the far turn and held that position while
never threatening the leader. MO MOVES stalked the top pair from the four path, failed to sustain forward position entering the backstretch, chased from the
three path around the far turn and lacked a bid. MY UNCLE FRANK pressed the leader from the three path early on, failed to sustain pressure entering the
backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and yielded between horses in upper stretch. JAY BIRD tracked two wide, but lacked a response to strong
urging in the three to four path around the far turn and failed to menace. HONOR GOLD saved ground off of the pace, came under urging around the far
turn and gave way. COAL BOSS bobbled slightly while not costed position at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, trailed along the inside around the
far turn and surpassed tired rivals. EXEMPLIFIED laid off of the pace in the three path, got floated six wide by an inner rival around the far turn and tired.
GOLDEN FLASH lacked speed in the two path, fanned five wide around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
HEAVEN STREET stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, tipped to the four path entering upper stretch, rallied to bid along with
an outer rival at the furlong pole, forged an advantage nearing the final sixteenth and held firm. MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE tracked in the three path and
between a pair of foes around the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to bid along with an inner rival at the furlong grounds, vied as that one
wrestled a margin in the final furlong and was kept at bay through the late stages. MARK OF THE Z bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from
midpack along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane, was bottled up just behind the leaders and among foes through midstretch, found a narrow
seam at the furlong grounds to attempt a bid, but needed more late and saved show. CLOUDY broke a step slow, pursued from midpack two wide into the
turn, but was blocked behind the leaders three wide through upper stretch, ran on once finding clear sailing nearing the final sixteenth but missed reaching
show. EVAN SING broke a step slow and bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the seven path in upper
stretch and rallied. GO BEARS GO (IRE) raced at the rear in the four path into the turn, fanned out to the eight path entering the lane and rallied willingly.
BIZ BIZ BUZZ laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the six path in midstretch and failed to menace. TUT'S REVENGE saved ground at the rear
and failed to factor. JUST MIGHT prompted three wide, vied around the turn, led via a narrow advantage coming to midstretch, but was headed by an outer
pair at the furlong grounds and weakened between horses. PLANE TALK prompted two wide and between horses, sparred with those rivals into the turn,
vied through upper stretch but weakened at the furlong pol. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS took light contact between rivals soon after the start, tracked in the four
path, then gave way in the six path and between horses in upper stretch. BODENHEIMER moved forward to set the pace along the inside, dueled with a
pair of outer rivals around the turn and weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
COZEE RAGS tracked four to three wide and between horses, tipped back four wide turning for home, grinded away outside of the leaders to produce a bid
in the final furlong, drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. SWEET VIOLET laid off of the pace in the three to four path, bumped an
outer rival while shifting five wide in upper stretch, rallied while flopping back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole, yet sustained progress to reach place late.
NANDINA rushed to set the pace along the inside, sparred with a pair of outer rivals around the turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was bested
by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, yielded and saved show. LITE IT UP LOUIE dueled three wide around the turn, failed to sustain vying position with
an inner rival in upper stretch, lost place to an outer rival at the furlong grounds, kept on to rebid for place position in the late stages, but was outfinished by
an outer rival and hung to miss show. HAPPY TALK raced off of the pace while hung in the six path around the turn, took contact from an inner rival in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. SHILOH'S MISTRESS chased three to two wide and between horses, tipped three wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid and
gave way. STEAMPUNK rushed inside of rivals with eleven sixteenths to go to achieve a pocket stalking position entering the turn, but only chased in upper
stretch before fading. SWEET SUNSHINE dueled two wide and between horses, yielded entering upper stretch, then weakened further after being put to
crowded quarters at the furlong grounds. GRINNING trailed in the two to four path and failed to factor. FINAL DRAFT pursued two wide and among foes
early on, but faltered entering the turn. RUBY QUEEN lacked speed in the two path and tired. ABUNDANT LIFE leaned outwardly at the start, tracked in the
five path and weakened turning for h ome.

Footnotes
TONY ANN broke sharply, tracked in the three path into the turn, shifted to the five path while ranging up outside of CARAVEL in upper stretch, rallied along
with that one to offer bids at the sixteenth pole, sparred with a very slight advantage leaving that station and gamely prevailed. CARAVEL stalked in the two
to three path around the turn, rallied in the four path along with an outer rival to bid with that foe at the sixteenth pole, then battled with that one through the
late stages but missed. TRAIN TO ARTEMUS saved ground off of the pace, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to take aim on the new
leaders entering the final sixteenth, but only managed to chase them through the late stages while edging show. TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) dueled for the
lead inside of a vying rival, drove clear of that one passing the three sixteenths pole, held sway through midstretch, but was caught by an outer pair at the
sixteenth pole and yielded. WAKANAKA (IRE) trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on between horses in the final furlong
but missed reaching fourth. BAY STORM pursued from midpack in the two path, then only managed to chase and lacked a bid. LINGUISTIC laid off of the
pace two wide, got floated to the four path entering the lane, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and made little impact. B G WARRIOR leaned out at the start,
dueled two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds while hanging on
her left lead.

Footnotes
MR BOB got loose pre-race, chased in the four path, floated to the five path entering the lane, lacked progress through upper stretch, yet kicked in leaving
the furlong grounds, offered a good late kick and reeled in the leading pair at the wire. BOURBON BASH brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked
between a pair of rivals into the turn, crept closer in the three path around the bend, took aim on the clearing leader from the four path entering the lane,
sustained a grinding charge to bid entering the final sixteenth, wrestled an advantage with twenty yards to go, but got nailed by an outer bidder at the wire.
PENSACOLA stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, led turning for home, drew clear entering the lane, held sway through midstretch, but was
collared at the sixteenth pole and got bested late. YOU AIN'T POPPN broke a step slow, lagged behind into the turn, cut the gap while fanning to the six
path entering the lane, then rallied while shifting ground inwardly. TALKIN' CASH set the pace along the inside, sparred with a pair of outer bidders into the
turn, got headed nearing the five sixteenths pole and gave way. BILLY JACK prompted two wide and between horses, vied around the turn, but weakened
nearing the lane. OLD ALLIANCE lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. LARRY THE POET brushed with an outer rival at the start and was
outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
R CALLI KIM dropped out early on, trailed two wide, gained while fanning five wide entering the lane, then unleashed a good kick to sweep past the leaders
approaching the final sixteenth. CREATIVE CAIRO stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but was outkicked in the
final furlong before edging place. SAND AND SEA set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin around the final turn, but proved no match for an outer
bidder approaching the final sixteenth and lost place. SHE'S GONE laid off of the pace two wide, saved ground around the final two turns, shifted to the five
path in upper stretch and rallied willingly. MALLEYMOO pursued from off of the pace three to two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn, but was
outkicked while leveling off in midstretch. GOOD AMERICAN (GB) tracked two wide and between horses, pursued three wide around the far turn and lacked
a bid while hanging on his left lead. SABALENKA settled far back along the inside, then in the three to four path around the far turn before floating six wide
entering the lane and lacked a rally. BRAVO KITTEN tracked three to two wide, encountered traffic among foes entering the lane and came up empty.
AMANI'S IMAGE pressed outside of the leader and faded around the final bend. LUCY'S CAKES FLY saved ground off of the pace but to no avail.
