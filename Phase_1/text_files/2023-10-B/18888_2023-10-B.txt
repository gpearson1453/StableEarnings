Footnotes
HOLY ZAGS settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed while tracking the moderate pace through the backstretch
run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, split rivals inside of the furlong marker, overtook SHE'S SO SHINY inside of the
sixteenth-marker and edged away to prevail. SHE'S SO SHINY broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set moderate fractions while well
handled into the backstretch run, carved out the pace while prompted into the far turn, extended the lead into upper stretch and was kept to task to the
furlong grounds, felt pressure from HOLY ZAGS nearing the sixteenth-pole, was overtaken into deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding for second.
WESTWARD BREEZE was forwardly placed away from the start, prompted the moderate pace into the backstretch run and kept close attendance to the far
turn, lost ground to SHE'S SO SHINY into the stretch, lacked a response in the final stages, weakened and just held for third. DENDERA was a step slow
away from the gate, tracked the early pace outside of runners, maintained a three wide path into the backstretch run and was well positioned heading to the
half-mile marker, gained ground three wide at the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch, was able to mildly re-rally in the late stages but was outkicked
and just missed for third. OAT MILK LATTE was allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the stretch and finished
evenly. BUSKER ALLIE never far back, tracked the moderate pace two wide through the backstretch run, was asked four wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
BLAZEN GRAZEN tracked the fast early pace from the inside, saved ground along the turn while well placed, tipped two wide into the stretch, responded
nearing mid-stretch and vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker, shifted to the three path approaching the sixteenth-pole, took a narrow lead into deep
stretch and dug in to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. HYDRO FROST took back off of the fast early pace, improved position three wide on the turn,
came in a bit tight entering upper stretch and angled four wide at the three-sixteenths marker, gained ground four wide at the furlong marker, rallied in deep
stretch, pressured BLAZEN GRAZEN in the final strides but could not get by the determined winner and bested the rest. SHARONA'S WILD BOY tracked
the solid early pace from the inside, shifted to the two path entering the turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained a two wide path into upper
stretch, advanced at the furlong marker, could not impact the top two in deep stretch but closed well and was up in the final strides to secure third.
GOLDENSUNRISE broke out at the start and crowded ALMOST SNOW, straightened and sped to the early lead, set as fast pace while clear into the turn,
extended the lead while carving out quick fractions approaching the quarter marker, was set down in upper stretch and maintained a clear lead to
mid-stretch, felt pressure from oncoming rivals nearing the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken into deep stretch and was just edged for third in the final strides.
ALMOST SNOW was crowded and bumped by GOLDENSUNRISE at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the fast early pace, raced outside of
GOLDENSUNRISE into the turn and ran in pursuit of that rival to the quarter marker, swung three wide into the stretch, could not muster a response in the
final furlong and gave way. TOWN PERFORMER was bumped by ALMOST SNOW at the start and was away a step slowly, chased three wide in the early
stages, ran in pursuit five wide into the stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong grounds and weakened in deep stretch.

Footnotes
BERRY VALLEY tracked the fast early pace from the inside, saved ground along the turn while in pursuit of MEADOWOOD, chased that rival into the
stretch, tipped two wide approaching the furlong marker, steadily advanced on MEADOWOOD into the final sixteenth, reeled in the runner-up in deep
stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail. MEADOWOOD showed good early speed and dictated terms away from the start, carved out fast
fractions on the turn and drew to a clear lead at the quarter marker, extended the lead into the stretch while under a hand ride, was asked for more into the
final sixteenth, was overtaken by BERRY VALLEY in deep stretch and was outfinished for the win, while clear of the rest for second. SING A HAPPY SONG
was bumped by MOONLIT MISCHIEF at the start and in turn bumped SELSAE leaving the break, was hustled to be forwardly placed and was close up in
the early running, came two wide into the turn, lost ground along the bend and chased to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch, lost position
at the furlong marker, did not offer a final response and held safely in the end for third. MOONLIT MISCHIEF broke in at the start and bumped SING A
HAPPY SONG, tracked the quick early pace three wide, lost ground along the turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained a three wide path into the
stretch and finished evenly. ANDRAMADA tracked between runners in the early stages, was hard to place in the run to the turn and steadied nearing the
three-furlong marker, lost position and chased from the two path to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and did not factor. SELSAE was
bumped and shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, chased into the turn, could not make headway into the stretch and did not have an impact.

Footnotes
LEXINGTON HUMOR tracked the fast early pace from the outside, improved position three wide on the turn, shifted to the four path into upper stretch and
chased the pacesetter to the furlong grounds, responded to firm urging nearing the sixteenth marker and closed on QUEEN MOLOTOV, rallied into deep
stretch, overtook QUEEN MOLOTOV in the final strides and edged away at the finish to determinedly prevail. QUEEN MOLOTOV was asked for speed
away from the start and assumed command in the early running, set fast fractions into the turn and was prompted to the quarter marker by BABY KRISTEN,
shook loose into the stretch and drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong marker, was all out to hold off oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth, was
overtaken by LEXINGTON HUMOR in deep stretch and dead heated for second. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL was allowed to settle early on, saved ground along
the turn, maintained an inside position into the stretch and advanced approaching the furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch, could not reel in the
winner in the final stages and was up in time to dead heat for second. MISS UNION broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace, tracked from a
two wide path into the turn, improved position approaching the quarter marker, raced in traffic into upper stretch and angled five wide at the furlong marker,
needed more in deep stretch and offered a mild late rally. PRIMROSE RIDGE (GB) tracked the fast early pace from the inside, tipped two wide into the
stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. BABY KRISTEN chased the fast early
pace three wide, moved up approaching the turn and pressed QUEEN MOLOTOV through quick fractions while two wide heading to the quarter marker, lost
ground into the stretch, could not muster a response in the late stages and faded. HIIS REINA chased the fast early pace while between runners, lost
position two wide into the turn, dropped back heading to the quarter marker and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ELCONDOR hustled to the front from the break, established a clear lead before a furlong was run, extended a little through the turn, responded when
roused at the top of the stretch and won going away under intermittent urging. MR. FIGHTER was last away then chased the field down the backstretch,
went into a drive before the half-mile pole, circled the field five to six wide through the turn then put in a massive run down the middle of the track to gain the
place. PINEAPPLE JUICE broke well then stalked EL CONDOR from the inside, checked slightly approaching the seven-sixteenths marker then was set
down to go after the leader passing the quarter pole, got within a length of that rival then could not keep pace in deep stretch and lost the place in the final
yards. WESTERN CAPE broke well but was being pushed on to keep pace with the stalking group racing two deep, kept to task turning for home up the rail,
was still in contention to mid-stretch then flattened out. MISTER BEAMS raced up close but five wide down the backstretch, bid from the quarter pole, had a
little trouble changing leads at the top of the stretch then finished evenly. TALISKER BAY bobbled slightly at the break then got squeezed a bit by the
runners in the adjacent stalls, later checked off the heels of MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE before the eleven-sixteenths pole, tried to launch a bid on the turn but
was stuck behind a wall of horses, got clear run before the furlong marker but was unable to mount a late rally. CHIPPEWA BUD was encouraged to get
forward position from the break, raced three deep with the stalking pack through the turn then struggled to keep up in the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE
broke well then was hard to place racing between horses down the backstretch, backed out of there going into the turn, attempted to re-rally from the
quarter pole but did not go on. GULARA broke alertly then settled behind all the action taking place up front, made a four to five wide bid on the turn but
could not improve position.

VILLA NOVA settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed while along the rail through the backstretch run, chased
to the quarter marker and saved all of the ground to the top of the stretch, rallied along the inside approaching the furlong pole, responded to firm urging and
vied for the lead into the final sixteenth, met the bid of THE FLYING PHAROAH in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. THE FLYING
PHAROAH bobbled leaving the start, was off a step slowly and settled along the inside into the first turn, tracked the decent pace from the inside through
the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the far turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, encountered a bit of traffic and angled five wide
into the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker, vied for the lead into the final sixteenth, battled to the finish and just missed for the win, while holding safely
for second. CRESCENDO MOLTO vied for the early lead with I'M GONNA SHINE then assumed command into the first turn, set decent fractions into the
backstretch run, was prompted to the half-mile marker then was pressed by I'M GONNA SHINE to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and was
set down approaching the furlong marker, was confronted by VILLA NOVA and was overtaken inside of the furlong pole, fought back into the final sixteenth,
came in a bit tight and steadied in deep stretch, was outfinished by the top two and held for third in the end in a good effort. SOO BROOKLYN tracked the
early pace while two wide and between runners, held her position while between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, gained ground at the quarter marker,
swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, lacked a final response in deep stretch and missed for third. VIOLET CROWN settled off of
the decent early pace, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide along the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could
not muster the needed response in the final stages and finished evenly. I'M GONNA SHINE vied for the early lead, conceded to CRESCENDO MOLTO and
prompted the decent pace into the backstretch run, moved up heading to the half-mile marker, pressed CRESCENDO MOLTO to the quarter marker, lost
position into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and weakened in the final sixteenth. WIRLY GIRLY was forwardly placed in the early stages and
stalked three wide into the first turn, stalked the decent pace while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, lost position three wide along the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and tired in the drive.

LIGHT UP was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run and came four wide into the far turn, was asked for run five
wide into the stretch and loomed nearing the furlong marker, vied for the lead and took a narrow advantage approaching the sixteenth-pole, dug in in deep
stretch and determinedly kept to task in the end to prevail. CHARLOTTE HARBOR settled along the inside to begin, was steered to the two path into the
backstretch run and maintained her position to the half-mile marker, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn and was roused four wide into the stretch,
improved position at the furlong marker, raced in traffic inside of the eighth pole, shifted out in deep stretch and surged in the final yards, just missed for the
win at the finish and was up in time to claim second. MISTY CAT was close up leaving the break and stalked the pace into the first turn, attended to the
decent fractions through the backstretch run, was given her cue entering the far turn and gained command heading to the quarter marker, was set down in
upper stretch and held a narrow lead approaching the furlong grounds, could not quicken when asked in the final sixteenth, was outfinished and was just
edged for second at the wire. SHERILINDA tracked the early pace while outside of rivals and raced three wide into the backstretch run, was roused three
wide along the far turn and came within aim nearing the top of the stretch, continued to gain into the drive and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, battled
while on the left lead into deep stretch, was outfinished in the final strides and just missed for third. DRAMATIZER settled along the inside in the early going
while not far back, saved all of the ground while well placed into the far turn, mounted an inside rally into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong
marker, needed more in deep stretch and was outfinished. NORTHERN ROSE broke a step slowly away from the start and was allowed to settle early on,
maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, saved ground while trailing into the far turn, advanced
into the stretch and came within aim nearing the furlong marker, was blocked behind rivals into the final sixteenth, was able to gain a bit of ground in deep
stretch but could not find room in the final stages. LYINATTHEBAR was sent away from the start and assumed command into the first turn, set the early
pace into the backstretch run, carved out solid fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, came under pressure and lost the lead midway through the
far turn, drifted to the two path nearing the top of the lane, chased to mid-stretch and tired. STATEFOREST was forwardly placed in the early running and
tracked the pace three wide along the first turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide along the far turn, steadied off of
heels at the quarter marker when LYINATTHEBAR drifted out, dropped back into the stretch, gave chase in the final furlong and did not offer a late
response.

QUE SERA SIR RALPH was sent hard from the break, seized the rail and a short but clear lead going into the first turn, relaxed nicely in hand for the
backstretch run, held sway through the turn, responded when asked to go on at the head of the stretch and held gamely under intermittent urging. SHOT OF
A LIFETIME was unfocused at the break and left well behind the others, seemed content to race at the back of the pack through the first half mile, patiently
waited for a clear path through the turn, started to rally from the quarter pole, had to pause briefly passing the three-sixteenths marker then made a big run
under strong handling, pressured the winner in the final yards and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure the place. BLACK CASPIAN
(IRE) was encouraged for speed from the break then was allowed to settle in a stalking position behind the QUE SERA SIR RALPH, moved to challenge for
the lead at the quarter pole, chased that rival determinedly for the length of the stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was just edged for second,
while holding for third. HEAT N REHEAT backed off the early pace for better position through the clubhouse turn, then raced between horses under a light
hold to the far turn, waited for some racing room while in the two path through the far turn, then was set down near the five-sixteenths pole, came into the
stretch about four wide then ducked in under right handed urging near the three-sixteenths marker, almost running into the back of BLACK CASPIAN (IRE),
angled five wide in the stretch, finished well and missed for third. RESPECT THE HUSTLE not asked for speed from the break and allowed to settle on the
rail through the opening stages, responded when asked to pick up the pace with three furlongs to run, took the opening along the rail and ran on well under
strong handling but could not sustain the bid to the wire and weakened a bit in the final sixteenth. JACKS OUTLAW got good early position without having to
be asked, settled in hand just behind QUE SERA SIR RALPH while racing in the three path, was still forwardly placed to quarter pole, came four wide into
the stretch and lacked a late response. DESCARTES was caught four wide through the first turn then raced mid-pack and still wide through the initial
stages, tried to improve position through the far turn still in the four path, chased into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

ZOE'S PRIDE broke well, raced on the outside of the tracking group then forged ahead to engage with HARBOR DEAREST on the lead, traded blows with
that one to deep stretch, gained the advantage inside the furlong grounds and surged clear. VALERIE was up in the mix through the initial running then
backed off the pace before the turn, started a bid with three furlongs to run and got a clear run three deep through the turn, responded to strong handling
down the stretch and got up for second in the final yards. HARBOR DEAREST emerged from the pack with the early lead, was taken on by ZOE'S PRIDE to
the outside passing the half mile marker, battled that rival to the furlong pole then gave way. PLEASANT WARNING broke with the pack then raced
between horses in the tracking group, responded when asked to pick up the pace past the three furlong pole, came three wide into the stretch with good
momentum was making a serious bid for the lead when blocked just before the furlong marker, lost momentum and could not recover. CALIGRAPHY broke
well and was on the inside of the tracking group down the backstretch, came under pressure from the quarter pole, got the inside run into the stretch then
ran on well but needed more. FOREVER LOVELY veered out sharply at the break but managed to avoid contact, raced close up and held the rail position to
the turn, backed out of a potential duel before the turn, tried to re-rally but did not summon the needed response in the stretch. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM was
hustled to get forward position and raced forwardly through the initial furlong, dropped back while three wide along the turn and tired in the stretch.
AMMARA hit the inside of the gate and was off awkwardly, spotting the field a big head start, chased to the turn, regained contact near the three eighths
pole but was unable to sustain the bid and had nothing to offer in the stretch.
