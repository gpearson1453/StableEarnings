stretch and won the bob. CANE CREEK ROAD stalked along the inside into the turn, tipped out and bid between foes in upper stretch, dueled with

midstretch and gained late on the top pair. GYPSY KING set the pace under pressure, maintained command along the inside through the turn, vied with
outer rivals in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. JETOVATOR trailed along the inside then two wide on the turn, summoned a mild rally but
could not threaten. REDLINE broke a step slow, raced near the back widest up the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, steadied when losing path
midstretch and could not rally. GOLDEN ALE pressed from outside, dueled into the stretch, vied three deep between foes in upper stretch and flattened.
PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) broke a step slow, tracked three wide into the turn, chased two wide into the drive, got floated out midstretch and weakened.

not threaten after.

Footnotes
SAKURA BLOSSOM coaxed from the gate and raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, bid outside midway around the turn, three wide into the
stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well late. INTO YELLOWSTONE broke in a bit and made light contact with rival, chased widest up the
backstretch, came five wide into the drive, closed in and drew alongside the winner past the sixteenth pole but lacked the needed late punch. SCREAMING
VIRGINIA had to steady early, saved ground through the turn and was along for the show. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST raced up close three deep, chased three
then four wide around the bend and weakened. GREENTEAZE sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, pressured from outside midway around
the bend, lost command entering the stretch and weakened. LITTLE LADY LOU brushed leaving the gate, chased four deep early on, traveled four wide on
the turn then angled in a path with a quarter mile remaining and faded out of contention. ELEVEN OUT OF TEN brushed the gate and outer rival at the start,
chased three deep between early then dropped back, trailed around the turn and was not persevered with in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BEEF WINSLOW stalked up close two wide early, moved up to press the leader in the middle stages, dueled into the far turn, cleared at the quarter pole
and drew off under strong hand urging. MEGA MOON stalked off the rail then started to pull and had to take hold approaching the first turn, stalked three
wide into the far turn, took aim entering the lane, was no match for the winner in the stretch run and stayed on to secure second. SINGLE TRACK MIND
(IRE) rated between briefly then moved inside, went between rivals again into the far turn while inching forward, chased within range entering the final
furlong but flattened out. REMOTE stalked along the inside and started to pull into the first turn, continued to tug up the backstretch, got boxed in on the far
turn then shuffled back, gained a clear path and kept on for a minor award. WORSE READ SANCHEZ was off slow to begin, unhurried on the inside, tipped
three wide into the lane, angled out further in upper stretch and failed to menace. TOUCH OF ZEN tracking while keen early, went three then two wide
around the clubhouse turn, rounded the far turn three deep and weakened. RAHM showed good early foot to take control, set the pace under pressure in
the middle stages, dueled into the far turn, could not go on with the winner at the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. DUAL THREAT broke a step
slow, eased around the first turn and into the backstretch, pulled up near the half-mile pole and walked off.

Footnotes
TOP GUN TOMMY vied between up the backstretch and around the turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and drew away.
MOLTO VIVACE vied three deep for command, fought three wide through the turn, could not keep up with TOP GUN TOMMY in upper stretch and churned
on to hold the place. BIG SWEDE brushed with inner rival at the start then had to steady off heels while bumping with inner rival again, chased two then
three wide around the turn and kept on for the show honors. TEMBO brushed with BIG SWEDE at the start then bumped again shortly after, chased along
the inside through the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten. ROOKIE MISTAKE vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, fought along the
rail through the turn and into the stretch, then weakened down the lane. HANDSOME GARY chased three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and
also weakened.

Footnotes
GRACELUND GRAY showed keen early foot while clearing and moved to the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, saved ground to the stretch, roused
and put to right handed urging in upper stretch, switch to the left hand midstretch and drew away under strong handling. LINDA'S GIFT closest in pursuit to
the top of the stretch in the two path, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on for a clear second. KITTY KITANA (GB) settled inside, gained
two wide around the far turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the show honors. VERY SCARY stalked from inside, tracked out of range in the middle
stages, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and lacked a rally. ARINA (GER) avoided a tight spot between rivals early then moved into the two path, saved
ground around the far turn and lacked further response. WED (FR) trailed on the inside around both turns and failed to make an impact.

SCARY FAST RIDE vied outside rivals early and three deep leaving the backstretch, shook free on the turn and drew off under a tap of right handed urging
and steady handling. SAND TO SEA vied between rivals for command, chased the winner past the five-sixteenths pole and finished willingly to best the rest.
BAJAN BASHERT chased between then got crowded a bit and dropped back early, chased three wide into the turn, angled out and entered the lane five
deep and gained the show. RYDER'S CANDY bobbled a bit at the start, settled inside, chased tow wide into the lane, came out in upper stretch and
flattened. MAGIC SECRET vied for the lead up the backstretch inside a pair of rivals, failed to kick on with the winner past the five-sixteenths pole and
faded. MAGIC WANDERER raced up close then chased the trio two wide into the turn, came out and brushed rival three deep entering the stretch, shifted
out at the eighth pole and weakened. RHYME OR REASON broke a step slow, stalked four wide into the turn, moved in a bit around the bend then got
brushed four wide entering the lane and weakened.

KINGS RIVER KNIGHT settled out of range, went two wide into the turn, angled out crossing the dirt, surged to the front with a furlong remaining, put away
BRICKYARD RIDE shortly after and held safely under a drive. JOHNNY PODRES sat off the pace outside a rival then three wide into the turn, came four
wide into the lane, moved out widest in the lane and closed willingly for second. NONE ABOVE THE LAW off slow in the beginning, trailed along the inside
around the bend, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch, gained a clear path approaching the eighth pole and was along for the show. BRICKYARD RIDE
went up to take control and set the pace under pressure from LIL NAS, cleared that rival across the dirt, roused in upper stretch, yielded to KINGS RIVER
KNIGHT at the eighth pole and weakened in the furlong grounds. IRISH HEATWAVE settled early and moved inside, tipped two wide around the bend,
angled to the fence in the lane and flattened out. BILLY'S BET stalked the top pair early, saved ground through the turn lost his path briefly in upper stretch
and weakened in the lane. LIL NAS pressed BRICKYARD RIDE early from outside, lost contact with that rival crossing the dirt and faded down the lane.

WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ settled inside, moved into range in the middle stages, angled out and bid three then two wide on the far turn, dueled outside
EXCLUSIVE JONI in the stretch and dug in late to prove best. EXCLUSIVE JONI raced up close four deep on the first turn, continued outside the leaders up
the backstretch, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, inched ahead around the far turn, dueled along the inside into the lane, battled WARREN'S
SHOW BIZZ through the stretch and yielded grudgingly. BOGINSKAYA broke out, settled outside a rival, drew closer two then three wide on the far turn,
moved out in the lane and bested the rest. IPANEMA GIRL stalked from inside early, move up to duel into the backstretch, inched ahead at the half-mile
pole, fought through the far turn, could not kick on with the new leader past the quarter pole and faded out of contention. ROUND IN CIRCLES broke out,
showed keen early foot and led two wide into the clubhouse turn, dueled into and up the backstretch outside a rival, weakened around the far turn and
retreated in the lane. MOROCCAN QUEEN got bumped from inside at the start, chased four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, angled in on the
backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and tired. YALEO fractious in the gate, got forced into outer rival at the start, raced up close three deep early,
started to weaken up the backstretch, eased on the far turn, pulled up past the eighth pole and walked off.

IDESSIA off slow in the beginning and trailed early, went three deep into the far turn, rallied while easing further out and came five wide into the stretch,
reached the front with a furlong left to run and drove clear. GOLDEN AGAIN stalked along the inside, challenged KO OLINA along the rail at the top of the
stretch and got put in tight quarters shortly after, continued gamely once in the clear but got outkicked by the winner. KO OLINA cleared quickly from outside
and crossed over, controlled the pace early on, came off the rail a bit allowing GOLDEN AGAIN to challenge at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit to crowd
that rival in upper stretch, lost command at the eighth pole to IDESSIA and weakened in deep stretch. SENSIBLE MOVE drifted in early and put a rival in
tight quarters, moved into the two path, tracking the pace out of range, moved closer and waited for room on the far turn still two wide, tipped three wide and
given her cue entering the stretch but flattened in the furlong grounds. I HAD THAT ONE TOO bumped with outer rival at the start, traveled along the inside
towards the rear early, trailed around the far turn, moved out in the lane to launch a rally but lacked room in traffic to midstretch, then gained a clear path
and kept on to improve position. WARRIOR LADY bumped with inner rival at the start, steadied between between shortly after, raced two wide off the pace
through both turns, angled out leaving the second bend and could not rally. TIZZY TWISTER sat off the pace along the inside, worked on through the far
turn, stayed on the fence in the lane and lacked the needed response. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY fractious in the gate, closest in pursuit early, roused two
wide on the far turn and weakened down the lane. SHE'S A BIT SASSY tracked in the three path through the early stages, chased four wide into the lane,

Footnotes
WYNSTOCK sent hard for the lead from inside, dueled into the first turn then cleared around the bend, set all the pace to the stretch, asked left handed in
upper stretch and drew off. ARIO showed early speed and dueled outside WYNSTOCK into the first turn, ceded command to that rival around the bend,
closest in pursuit from the two path to the top of the stretch, proved no match for the winner in the lane and churned on to best the rest. AMERICAN FLYER
bumped with outer rival and bobbled in the beginning, trailed two to three wide early, had one rival beat entering the stretch and showed a mild response to
gain the show honors. CONCORD BRIDGE brushed inner rival leaving the gate, chased four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, advanced three wide
around the second bend, drifted to the inside in the stretch and saved the show. MALIBU RAIN chased three then two wide early, raced along the rail
leaving the backstretch, swung out approaching the stretch and could not rally. MR. LEASURE chased three deep into the clubhouse turn then moved into
the two path, dropped back under coaxing on the far turn and tired in the lane. LAKE SUPERIOR bobbled leaving the gate, settled inside, saved ground
through the far turn and came up empty.

far turn, tipped out into the stretch, drew alongside KAYLAS JOY and could not go by. JESSEBEAR tracked three then two wide around the first turn, moved
in to save ground on the second bend, moved out and rallied under the right in the lane and finished a game third. WARREN'S PARADICE stalked the pace
along the inside, tipped out on the far turn and chased three wide into the lane, then finished evenly in the final furlong. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE broke out
and was quickly corrected, unhurried after, had to alter a bit from trouble rival early, went three wide into the first turn then angled down to the inside trailing
the field, traveled two wide into the second bend, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and improved position. ANNIE'S HOPE bumped with outer
rival and checked early, saved ground off the pace through both turns and lacked a rally. YVETT'S SURPRISE brushed leaving the gate, had to alter when
racing outside a trouble ANNIE'S HOPE early, reserved after in the two path, moved out and came four wide into the drive and failed to threaten. CANDY
ON TOP stalked outside a rival, traveled three deep at the quarter pole, roused four wide into the lane and weakened. BETSY IS THE CODE chased briefly
then cleared inner rival and moved inside to set the pace, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost command in
