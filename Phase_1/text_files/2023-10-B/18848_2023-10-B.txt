HONEY PROOF stalked the pace from the inside, then inched up to edge clear on the turn and drew off in the stretch and held sway till the end. AA TAKE A
CHANCE saved ground along the inside, circled four wide on the turn to rally in the stretch, lacked the winning bid but bested the rest. FLEET DE SAND set
the pace while three wide, was in a long drive then faltered after the turn and held show in the end. RB TEXAS HOLD EM advanced swiftly in the early
backstretch from the three path to gain third position, was in a hard drive on the turn then flattened in the stretch. KISSOUUR was unhurried early racing at
the back of the field then bid two wide on the turn and was no threat. LIKE MOULIN ROUGE race in the back pack while four wide then bid mildly on the
turn and was no threat. VAZS DANCING HESS stalked the pace early while two wide then settled back along the rail down the backstretch then faded after
the turn.
