Footnotes
HALMSTAD prompted along the inside into the turn, vied with an outer pair around the bend, led in hand entering the lane, responded readily when set
down in upper stretch and kicked away with good energy. HOLLYWOOD ENDING stalked three wide, prompted the top pair around the turn, but failed to
keep pace with the clearing eventual winner in upper stretch and kept on well to prove second best. REMARKABLE MO broke a step slow at the start,
chased the top trio from the four path and under urging around the turn, drifted outwardly in midstretch and edged show in the late stages. ATLANTIC
DANCER trailed along the inside, improved position in the final furlong and was found to have bled. LEVEE WAS DRY rushed to show the way in the five
path outside of a prompting rival passing the half mile pole, shifted down to the two path into the turn, vied two wide and between horses around the bend,
but gave way in upper stretch and weakened while hanging on his left lead. CITIZEN pursued from off of the pace in the five path and gave way.

Footnotes
BAYOU SPIRIT tracked along the inside, loomed a danger just off of the fence while blocked behind the leading trio entering the lane, bumped and impeded
an inner MICROBEASTIE leaving the three sixteenths pole in order to take aim inside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, bid passing that juncture and
edged clear. RUNANDSCORE vied two wide and between horses, sparred with only an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, was joined by an
outer bidder entering the lane, dueled gamely between foes through upper stretch, but was bested by an inner bidder in the final furlong and fended off an
outer counterpart for place. HIJACK THE PARTY took contact from an inner rival soon after the start while off a bit slow, pulled forward between horses, but
checked out of crowded quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, settled into a two wide tracking position into the turn, gained between horses turning for home
to offer a bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch, leaned in slightly at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner
bidder soon after the yielded in the final sixteenth. VALUABLE CARGO broke slowly, raced off of the pace in the three to two path, improved entering the
lane, tipped out slightly in upper stretch and ran on. NIGHT CHANT prompted the pace four wide and between horses, but gave way turning for home.
SERPA broke outwardly and squarely bumped a rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the five to six path, hung on his left lead in upper stretch, changed
over and shifted in greenly entering the final furlong then lacked a bid. TEXCOCO transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer for at the start, trailed in
the four path and passed rivals rivals. MICROBEASTIE led from outer pressers into the turn, dueled for the lead inside of a rival while a path off of the inner
railing around the turn, but took contact from an outer bidding foe while beginning to yield inside the three sixteenths pole, was forced inwardly and caused
to steady at the furlong grounds, then weakened. FEELING FREE prompted three wide and between horses under urging, then weakened turning for home.
TRIPLE OPTION raced forwardly five wide and gave way turning for home.

CELTIC CHARM pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked two wide and between horses with run around the far turn, swung out to the six path
entering upper stretch, rallied and offered a bid while being slightly floated out by the new leader at the furlong grounds, then drove past and drew clear in
the final sixteenth. EGYPTIAN CANDY saved ground off of the pace, pursued from midpack around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch,
produced a bid between horses at the furlong grounds, vied with an outer pair into the final sixteenth but was bested. MOONLIGHT GAMBLER tracked two
wide, ranged up in the four path around the far turn, hung on his left lead while offering a bid in upper stretch, narrowly led nearing the final furlong, but
drifted out at that marker as an outer foe joined the fray, then was bested by rivals on both sides in the final sixteenth. TONALITE pursued from midpack two
wide, then in the three to four path around the far turn before being floated to the seven path in upper stretch, ,but only offered a mild kick and edged fourth
at the wire. TONY BLUE TAPE set the pace inside of a pressing rival while in the three path around the first turn, moved to the two path into the far turn,
showed the way turning for home before meeting bids on either side in upper stretch and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. SALTWATER
TAFFY stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leaders entering the lane, vied into midstretch but flattened out. GOLDEN STORM lacked speed, drifted
outside of a trio of foes into the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and failed to factor. SEDATELY hopped slightly at the start and was slow into
stride, trailed, moved out of last five wide around the far turn and failed to threaten. FLY HIGH BIRDIE laid off of the pace three wide and faded in the six
path around the far turn. ADELLEGATOR brushed an outer rival soon after the start, prompted the leader from the four to three path but weakened between
horses entering the lane. SAVANNAMARIE took light contact from an inner rival soon after the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses and
faded.

Footnotes
KING'S OVATION broke a step slow but was sent forward to reach the front in the opening stages, set the pace along the inside, met a pair of outer bids
around the far turn, yet shook free of them entering the final furlong and drove clear. TRIDENT HIT stalked two wide, floated three wide by an inner rival
approaching the far turn, prompted into that bend, bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the pace-setter in upper stretch, dueled for place in the
final furlong and narrowly prevailed. BUCK MOON hopped slightly at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader to press from between
horses approaching the far turn, prompted and bid turning for home, but was turned away by the pace-setter in upper stretch, dueled for place with his outer
counterpart through the final furlong but was bested. NAUTILUS (BRZ) tracked four wide, chased the leading trio around the far turn and lacked a bid.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE broke a step slow, trailed along the inside and made little impact. UNINVITED GUEST raced off of the pace two wide, had to tap
on the brakes behind rivals entering the backstretch, shifted out to the five path with a half mile to go and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
CALLIE'S GRIT set the pace, showed the way from a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, shook clear of them at the three sixteenths pole and held
sway. HAY STACK tracked two to three wide, bid turning for home, but was turned away by the leader at the three sixteenths pole and was second best.
LAST CALL saved ground in midpack, gradually shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, then offered a late kick to reach show in the closing stages.
MIRABELLA stalked along the inside, ran on to split foes in the three path in midstretch and gain show approaching the final sixteenth, but was caught by an
outer rival late. CANT KEEP ME DOWN broke outwardly, pressed outside of the leader, vied between horses around the far turn but faded in upper stretch.
SAHLABIYA pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, chased in the four path in upper stretch but yielded between rivals at the
sixteenth pole. QUEEN'S GARDEN laid off of the pace in the four to five path, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to menace. AUTISM
COMMUNITY settled back in the two to four path, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. POR UNA CABEZA trailed, saved ground
while moving out of last around the far turn, improved in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ROBIN SAGE pursued from midpack in the four path, floated to
the six path while between horses in upper stretch and lacked a rally. VIVA LA RED lacked speed in the two to four path, pursued between horses around
the far turn and failed to factor. RED HOT AND BLUE laid off of the pace in the three path but was outrun around the far turn.

Footnotes
CORNINGSTONE stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid with five sixteenths to go, led entering the lane, kicked away in upper stretch
and held sway safely from an outer on-charging rival late. CHOP CHOP took contact from an inner bobbling foe at the start, settled off of the pace in the
three to two path around the first turn, pursued in hand behind the main group around the far turn, steadied while blocked entering the lane, split foes two
wide in upper stretch, shifted out to the five path passing the three sixteenths pole, offered a late kick to gain place nearing the final sixteenth and belatedly
closed in on the clear leader. FUN AND FEISTY tracked along the inside, managed to slip through tight rail quarters to bid for place in upper stretch, but
was outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer outside of rivals approaching
the far turn, tracked four wide around that bend,, ranged up to take aim entering the lane, but only managed to chase and faded in the late stages.
CHIQUITA MOSCA broke a step slow while last away, lacked speed along the inside, improved before tipping outwardly nearing midstretch and ran on.
THUNDERS ROCKNROLL set a comfortable pace in the two path around the first turn, met an outer challenge around the far turn,, got headed entering the
lane and weakened. COTTON CANDY ANNIE lunged inwardly at the start, then checked while forward along the inside into the first turn, tracked two wide
and between horses, but yielded three wide entering the lane before shying from an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole. FLAMAND pursued from
midpack three wide and between horses, steadied among foes around the first turn then faded four wide entering the lane. ALEXA LOU stumbled outwardly
and bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, but weakened between horses nearing the far turn, was done early and eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
SURGE CAPACITY shifted inwardly many paths while not clear of inner rivals early on, stalked along the inside under a snug hold around the first turn,
loomed a danger with run from the pocket around the far turn, steadied subtly behind the leader entering the lane, shifted two wide while regaining
momentum in upper stretch, rallied to bid inside of the leaders entering the final sixteenth and edged ahead. HEAVENLY SUNDAY stalked along the inside
before tipping outside of the leader nearing the backstretch, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, gamely resisted an outer challenge through
midstretch, sparred as an inner rival joined the fray at the sixteenth pole and was bested. BLING was floated inwardly early on, tracked two to three wide
around the first turn, inched closer within striking range turning for home, vied into the final furlong, but yielded in the final sixteenth and lasted for show.
SACRED WISH took back from crowded quarters early on, rated far back along the inside, picked up stride in the four path in upper stretch, shifted out in
the final furlong and sustained a late charge to miss reaching show. SAFEEN pursued from midpack three wide, inched closer four wide nearing the lane,
but hung on her left lead, needed more to bid entering the final furlong and tired. ETERNAL SILENCE broke a beat slow while bumping with an inner rival
and being put to crowded quarters among foes at the start, altered across a rival's heels into the first turn, trailed, and improved between horses. PRIDE OF
THE NILE laid off of the pace along the inside, fanned to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SPEIRLING BEAG (IRE) lacked speed three wide
and failed to menace in the seven path. SECRET MONEY pursued from midpack along the inside, crept closer to be two wide and between horses turning
for home, chased through midstretch and weakened late. FLASHY GEM laid off of the pace four wide, then yielded in the six path and between horses in
midstretch. ABUNDANCIA was reluctant to load, bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed two to three wide and gave way. YESTERNIGHT set
the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the lane and caved.

Footnotes
YOUALMOSTHADME prompted the leader from the three path, bid turning for home and kicked away under moderate urging. HOT BEACH bobbled and
bumped an inner rival at the start before being floated into an outer foe shortly after, tracked two wide, took aim four wide on the new leader entering the
lane, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and edged place at the furlong grounds. FIBBER bobbled at the start before being bumped by an
inner rival into an outer foe shortly after, steadied out of crowded quarters in the aftermath, settled off of the pace along the inside, entered the lane in the
two path, tipped back inwardly at the furlong grounds and ran on to gain show from outer rivals late. COPPER EM leaned outwardly and brushed a rival at
the start, stalked along the inside, tipped off the fence while chasing in upper stretch, vied for show with inner rivals into the final sixteenth but got
outfinished. FIELD LASS took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, set the pace in the two path as an outer presser bid turning for home, got
headed entering the lane and weakened between horses in the final furlong. XTREME SMOKE SHOW raced off of the pace in the five to six path and gave
way. WELLAREYOUHAPPYNOW broke outwardly, trailed and made little impact. XTREME DIVA was bumped by an inner rival soon after the start, laid off
of the pace three wide and tired. LET THEM WATCH stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, but weakened five wide entering the lane.
