Footnotes
CLASSY CITY assumed command away from the start, set moderate fractions mildly pressured into the backstretch run, was well handled while showing
the way into the far turn, was given rein heading to the quarter marker and extended the lead nearing the top of the lane, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch,
drew away under a hand ride in deep stretch and was much the best. TWELVE VOLT stalked the early pace two wide and between runners, took back
along the backstretch run and tracked between rivals, saved ground into the far turn, was roused two wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner in
the final furlong and ran on in the late stages to be second best. ROAD HOUSE broke in at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled along the inside into the
first turn, improved position into the backstretch run and saved ground into the far turn, came in tight and waited for racing room nearing the top of the
stretch, tipped to the two path for the drive, could not muster the needed late response but ran on to be clear in the end for third. RIGHT HAND RYDER
tracked the early pace two wide and between runners, was steered to the three path into the backstretch run and took back off of the moderate pace, raced
two wide into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, did not offer a rally in the final furlong and passed tired rivals in deep stretch.
RANDY'SFURRYFRIEND was prominent into the first turn, was a bit keen while inside of rivals into the backstretch run, made a middle move to contend for
the lead a the half-mile marker, chased CLASSY CITY two wide to the quarter pole, swung three wide for the stretch drive, lost position at the furlong
grounds and gave way. KLIMT A. P. stalked the early pace from the outside, came four wide into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the
half-mile marker, advanced four wide along the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the late stages. SIR GEORGE ARTHUR mildly pressured the
early pace while three wide, lost position into the backstretch run but remained close up approaching the half-mile marker, remained within aim while three
wide and between rivals at the quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
PACIFIC ZIP tracked the moderate pace from the inside and saved ground into the turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, tipped two
wide into the lane and rallied nearing the furlong pole, vied for the lead approaching the sixteenth-marker and took command into deep stretch, kept to task
in the late stages and held safely in a drive at the finish. MAJESTIC OOPS broke alertly conceded the early lead, tracked the moderate pace two wide into
the turn, swung three wide into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, closed in the final sixteenth and was up in time to secure second. BLURSDAY

safe lead into upper stretch, came under pressure approaching the furlong marker, could not hold off PACIFIC ZIP into the final sixteenth, weakened late

Footnotes
BEACHGRASS settled off of the early pace and came two wide into the first turn, gained ground into the backstretch run and maintained that two wide path
to the half-mile marker, was roused three wide approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow advantage at the furlong
marker, responded to firm urging into the final sixteenth, dug in in the final strides and lasted at the finish to prevail. BUSKER ALLIE was unhurried in the
early stages and saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked the pace while not far back approaching the far turn, was guided outside of runners and
came three wide to the quarter pole, swung four wide into the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker, closed well while widest into deep stretch, pressured
the winner in the final strides but could not get by and missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure second. KITTEN'S KID threw her head at the
start and was off a step slowly, was keen in the early running and tracked the pace from the rail into the first turn, raced close to the front while continuing to
pull on the rider through the backstretch run, chased from the inside along the far turn, came in a bit tight while behind runners into upper stretch, advanced
and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, battled from the inside into deep stretch, was outfinished in the final yards and held for third at the wire.
BLOSSOMING assumed command away from the start and dictated terms into the first turn, was confronted into the backstretch run by BESTRELLA and
contested the pace with that rival to the half-mile marker, dueled inside of BESTRELLA into the far turn and took a narrow lead to the quarter pole, met the
bid of BEACHGRASS in upper stretch and fought to the furlong marker, gamely battled against oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth and was outfinished
in deep stretch. BESTRELLA (IRE) was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the pace into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and
contested the pace with BLOSSOMING, battled with that rival into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BRANNIGAN broke well, sat just off the pace in the two path, was asked to go on from the five-sixteenths marker, moved up to challenge EL CAPRICHO at
the top of the stretch, brushed lightly with that rival near the three-sixteenths, drew off under strong handling then held off a late charging COUNT ASHER to
prevail. COUNT ASHER took a bump from the inside after the break, had to regroup behind the field then was pushed to regain contact with the body of the
field, bided time near the back to the turn, then took a five wide path to launch a rally, came out another couple of paths for the stretch run and continued to
close ground stoutly under intermittent urging and gained the place. ANTHONY'S BEST settled well in hand in a stalking position behind the pacesetter, was
set down just past the five-sixteenths marker but lost some ground, then came back on, found his best stride a bit too late and was gaining in the final yards.
BRONZE ONE stumbled a couple of strides after the break then raced between horses through the turn, tried to rally when clear but did not have the
needed response. ONE LITTLE INDIAN saved ground racing mid-pack to the turn, made a mild run from the the three furlong pole up the rail, loomed a
threat passing the three-sixteenths marker but could not sustain the bid in the final stages. TITOS WITH A TWIST raced close up through the early stages
but was hung five wide down the backstretch, continued to race forwardly through the turn while still wide, was making up some ground in deep stretch then
had to alter course when a tiring EL CAPRICHO drifted in front and lost all chance. APLOMBADO broke out at the start and made contact with COUNT
ASHER, then lagged well behind the field down the backstretch, made a nice run through the turn saving ground all the way, tipped out to the three path for
the stretch run but stalled passing the furlong marker and did not go on. EL CAPRICHO quickly seized the early advantage, led the field by an open length
or two to the top of the stretch then gave way readily under pressure. G'S LAST CHANCE broke well and raced forwardly to the turn then struggled to keep
up from the three-eighths marker and faded to last.

Footnotes
NOLDE bobbled at the break then was allowed to settle well behind the field into the first turn, relaxed nicely to the half, circled the field four wide with an
eye-catching run through the far turn, swept past TERRY'S BOY at the head of the stretch then out-gamed a stubborn DULAS (IRE) in the final sixteenth.
DULAS (IRE) was allowed to settle inside, raced mid-pack to the halfway point then started to make steady forward progress through the far turn, got a clear
run up the rail, squeezed through a narrow opening between horses at the eighth pole, dueled gamely with NOLDE to the wire but came up a head short.
ENOS SLAUGHTER was unhurried early and raced two deep around the first turn, started to make a move passing the three furlong pole, had to wait for
room before the stretch then was beaten to a hole at the top of the stretch, swung out into the clear near the eighth pole and was able to gain third.
TERRY'S BOY broke well and was one of the first to the clubhouse turn, then was content to cede the lead to MR. T'S THIRSTY and track that one to the
far turn, went up to challenge that one just past the three furlong pole, took a short lead turning in the stretch but was immediately passed by NOLDE to the
outside and DULAS (IRE) to the inside and was unable to hold third. KINGMEISTER raced three wide through the clubhouse turn, pulled forward under
some light restraint down the backstretch, loomed a threat while still three wide through the far turn then was forced to steady in tight quarters at the top of
the stretch and could not recover. MR. T'S THIRSTY made the lead going into the first turn without being asked, set reasonable fractions while leading the
field down the backstretch, had no response when challenged in the far turn then had to steady late when DULAS (IRE) pushed through a narrow opening in
deep stretch.

Footnotes
ACCLAIMED PREACHER let the pace scenario play out heading into the first turn, then decided to go forward and press the pace near the three-quarter
pole, sat just of PONDERGATING under a stout hold, took over the lead with ease passing the five-sixteenths pole, pulled clear in the stretch and drew off
under steady handling. BEADS came away from the gate awkwardly and trailed into the first bend, made steady progress to the half mile marker then
launched a bid from with three furlongs to run racing three wide through the far turn, continued the run through the stretch and chased the winner home, well
clear of the third horse. DESERT RUMBLE broke sharply and was sent to the front, gained the lead and the rail coming out of the first turn, set moderate
fractions to the far turn, had no response when challenged by ACCLAIMED PREACHER but kept to task to hold third. UNION HEIRESS was content to
track the early pace alongside ACCLAIMED PREACHER then went along when that one decided to go for the lead but had to steady hard near the
three-quarter pole when unable to find a clear path through, moved into contention on the rail down the backstretch, had to wait behind horse on the far turn
then had no response when called upon once clear. PONDERGATING broke well and vied for the lead going into the first turn, allowed DESERT RUMBLE
to set the pace, was put into a drive from the three furlong pole but was unable to quicken with the rest and was outrun from that point.

Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE tracked the early pace from the outside, was well positioned through the backstretch run, maintained an outside path into the far turn and
raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch and shifted five wide at the furlong marker, responded to steady urging into
the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and was up in the final strides for a determined win. TAM'S TIME stalked the early pace from a two wide position,
tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, chased two then three wide to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch and ran evenly
to the furlong pole, closed willingly in deep stretch, vied for the lead in the final yards and just missed for the win, while holding for second. WILL IS CHILL
took back off of the early pace, improved position three then two wide along the first turn, moved up into the backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace
to the half-mile marker, mounted a two wide bid at the quarter pole, chased ROISTER into the stretch, vied for the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker, was
outfinished by the top pair in the final strides and just held for third at the finish. SEA OF LIBERTY was crowded a bit by neighboring rivals and was away
from the gate a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages and raced two wide into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker,
was roused three wide into the far turn and improved position at the quarter pole, continued that gain while four wide at the furlong marker, found his best
stride late, came within aim in deep stretch and just missed for third at the wire. ROISTER was hustled leaving the start and assumed command into the first
turn, cleared to the rail and dictated terms into the backstretch run, set a moderate pace while prompted to the half-mile marker, showed the way to the
quarter pole and held foes at bay into the drive, was set down in upper stretch and dug in while leading to the sixteenth-pole, lost the lead in deep stretch
and was outfinished at the wire by oncoming rivals. MY DAD IS THIRSTY was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground
to the far turn, was held up briefly nearing the top of the stretch, found room into upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. DI LAURIAN was asked to rate in
the early stages while not far back, raced three wide along the first turn, was keen and pulled on the rider into the backstretch, continued to be hard to
handle through the backstretch run, settled heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn and improved position at the quarter pole, tipped
two wide for the drive, lost ground at the furlong marker and gave way in deep stretch. BENNY THE JET was prominent in the early running and stalked the
pace from the inside, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run, dropped back into the second turn, was eased through the stretch and
walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
DECIMATE broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed good speed and set a quick pace into the turn, drew to a clear lead and set
fast fractions heading to the quarter marker, widened the lead into mid-stretch, was tiring a bit into the final sixteenth but kept to task in the late stages and
held for a clear win at the finish. SPEEDING STYLE was prominent in the early going and tracked the fast early pace from a three wide position, ran in
pursuit three wide to the quarter marker, could not impact the winner in the stretch and stayed on in the final sixteenth to be second best. DEALERS HAND
was forced in soon after the start, steadied while in tight quarters and in turn impeded a pair of rivals behind him, recovered and chased the fast pace from
the inside, improved position on the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and continued to advance at the furlong marker, needed more in the late stages
but offered a mild late bid and held safely at the finish for third. HARBOR SKY steadied off of heels soon after the start and lost position in the early stages,
chased from the rear into the turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and closed willingly in the final stages. MIGHTY
MATT chased outside of rivals in the early stages, improved position four wide on the turn, raced three wide into the stretch, offered a mild late rally and
improved position in the final sixteenth. ARTHUR SPOONER was forwardly placed away from the start, drifted in in the opening furlong and caused
DEALERS HAND to steady, rated off of the fast early pace while not far back, lost ground on the turn and chased two wide into the stretch, did not offer a
response in the drive and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. WALKING BOSS was allowed to settle leaving the break, was asked for speed heading to the
half-mile marker and chased three wide into the turn, lost position along the bend and shifted to the rail nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the
stretch and weakened in the final stages. SURPRISE FASHION came in tight soon after the break and took up off of heels, lost position and chased the fast
pace from the inside, trailed to the quarter marker, saved ground into the stretch and could not muster a late rally. MUAY THAI (IRE) stumbled leaving the
break, rushed up in the early stages and stalked the fast pace heading into the turn, lost ground to DECIMATE along the bend and chased to the quarter
pole, ran in pursuit two wide into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and faded in deep stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE INVOLVING ARTHUR SPOONER DRIFTING IN. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
WARD 'N JERRY tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was well positioned through the backstretch run while saving ground, shifted to the two
path into the far turn and was given his cue at the three-eighths marker, took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane and drew clear
at mid-stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and extended his lead in deep stretch while under a hand ride to the finish. GALLANT WARREN was
allowed to settle, came two wide into the first turn and tracked from that two wide path through the backstretch run, maintained a two wide position into the
far turn, came in tight and waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, found room nearing the top of the stretch and chased two wide to the furlong
marker, was not able to keep pace with WARD 'N JERRY in the drive, battled with GORDY'S BOY into deep stretch for place honors and held well for
second at the finish. GORDY'S BOY was prominent leaving the start and stalked the early pace, attended to the moderate pace along the backstretch run,
vied for the lead three wide approaching the quarter marker and chased three wide into the stretch, battled with GALLANT WARREN for the place honors in
the final furlong, was outfinished for that position at the wire and held for third. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was squeezed leaving the start and was off a step
slowly, was unhurried in the early going and saved ground into the backstretch run, chased the moderate pace and saved all of the ground to the far turn,
came in tight nearing the quarter marker, was shuffled back and swung three wide into the stretch, made a mild rally in the drive and missed for third at the
finish. LOOKOUT POINT settled outside of rivals in the early going, raced four wide into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile
marker, was guided three wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive, closed well in deep stretch and improved position at the finish.
BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, dictated terms into the first turn and set a moderate pace into the
backstretch run, showed the way to the half-mile marker, was overtaken by WARD 'N JERRY midway through the far turn, chased into the stretch and faded
in the late stages. J T'S WATCH tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path through the backstretch run, gained ground
three then four wide along the far turn, could not sustain that bid into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.
