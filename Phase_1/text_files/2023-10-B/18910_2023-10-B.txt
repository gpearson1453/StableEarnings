Footnotes
TEAKETTLE set the pace into the far turn, was put under pressure when attempting to get out, rider kept strong hold on inside rein, waited to ask for more
until straightened in the lane then cleared when asked and widened to the wire. KENNEDY HEIGHTS raced along the inside when tracking the pace, came
into the lane along the rail with an open rail then lacked the needed response while gaining the place spot. REDHOTJUSTICE trailed through the far turn,
bid into the lane from the three path, shifted abruptly into the seven path inside the eighth pole and was gaining too late. LUNAR LACE raced in the four
path throughout when never far back, bid into the lane from the four path, moved to the winner and loomed a serious threat then could not sustain the effort.
HEAVENLY RICH stalked the pace from the three path through the turn then weakened turning into the lane. GOLDEN HEIST never was a factor while
saving ground. GRANNY REWARD raced in the two path through the turns and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
EKATI FLATTER was close up early while in the three or four path, bid three wide in late turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the leader,
caught that one just inside the eighth pole, cleared with a sixteenth to go then held. ZAPPLE pressed the pace along the inside early, settled back through
the turn and appeared done, re-fired into the lane and was finishing with good energy to be 2nd best. LA V. vied for the lead while on the inside of two
others, came into the lane with a short lead, continued to lead after straightening in the lane, was no match for the winner inside the eighth pole then was
kept to the task to hold the show spot. FABULOUSLY FUNNY was in the two path through the turn when near the back, continued in the four path for the
drive and offered a mild gain. BRITTANYSGLDNFAITH raced near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, was put in tight
between rivals outside the eighth pole and moved up while not a menace. RILEYS REDEMPTION vied for the lead into the turn while two wide and between
rivals then gave way into the lane. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY settled early while off the inside, bid four wide in late turn then faded through the lane. VALE
MALE was done early and entered the the lane from the five path.

Footnotes
LEAVE IT TO KITTEN chased the pace from the two path from the outset, bid into the lane from the three path, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and
inched up to clear. DRIFTWOOD set the pace when near the inside through the turn, was challenged inside the eighth pole and gave ground grudgingly.
NICHOLAS JONES was unhurried while off the inside, angled five wide in mid-turn when gaining momentum, continued five wide into the lane, straightened
from the seven path and finished willingly. ENGLISH CHALLENGE trailed early while off the inside, moved four wide through the far turn to get to a
contending position, came into the lane from the five path and offered a mild gain from mid-track. GRACEFUL KITTEN saved ground through the turn when
never far back, came off the inside into the lane then lacked the needed response. MAJOR SPARKS raced along the inside into the far turn, continued
along the rail into the lane, came off the rail through the lane and moved up while not a threat. GREY STREAK two wide through the turn when moving
closer, bid into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. POET OF LIFE (IRE) saved ground through the far turn when never back then weakened in
the drive. COURAGEOUSLY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn then faded. CASANOVA KITTEN raced three wide and between rivals
through the turn, came into the lane from the nine path and tired.
