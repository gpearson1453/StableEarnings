Footnotes
GLITTER LAKE stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, asked for run late on the turn and kept under a drive in the
lane to close best and get up in the final fifty yards. QUEEN VERRAZANO away well, failed to keep up with speedy inside rival, stalked said clear leader on
the backstretch, continued well placed on the turn, in striking range entering the lane and caught the leader late but outclosed by rallying outside rival. BLUE
BUTTERFLY away well, hustled to clear off on the backstretch, kept clear advantage through the turn, began to get weary in the final sixteenth and
overtaken in the final fifty yards. AFTER SUNDOWN stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and responded
mildly to urging to make mild progress late. SHVERE ARBETER broke cleanly, then drifted in to lose ground early, settled along the inside on the
backstretch and failed to make any headway. JOE'S PASSION lunged right when gate opened and came away slow, trailed while two wide on the
backstretch and never threatened.
