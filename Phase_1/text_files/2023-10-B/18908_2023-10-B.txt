Footnotes
DOC ADVANTAGE broke a step slowly and hopped at the start, settled at the rear racing off the inside, advanced outside foes four to five wide on the far
turn, struck the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear. WYNN GIANT had forward position pressing three wide early, made the lead briefly about the
furlong marker, was second best. STREET COP OFFICER was under a very tight hold in the early going tracking in behind two wide, exchanged a bump
about the five-sixteenths, came out three to four wide turning for home, kicked on belatedly to get up for show honors. POMPOUS PRINCE set the pace
racing off the rail, had no extra for the drive. CRYPTO CAUSEWAY saved ground tracking inside, failed to rally. COLTEN GOES was within range three to
four wide on the first turn and up the backstretch, began weakening on the far turn bumping with a rival about the five-sixteenths and faded thereafter.

MY INNER VOICE attended the early pace outside, took the lead two to three wide about the seven-sixteenths, edged clear on the turn widening leaving
that bend, held safe. ROSEINTHESKY was between the early leaders, eased back content to track in behind racing off the rail, was second best.
BENEVOLENTLY broke just a half-step slowly, moved up inside early on the turn before being guided out two to three wide coming to the five-sixteenths to
pass a tiring rival, continued to gain late but needed more. MY LITTLE ONE moved out from two to four wide on the turn racing outside a foe and well back
of the leaders, ran on. SLY SLOANE was within range three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. JOURNEY OF FIVE coaxed to the early lead setting a
pressured pace inside, faded. SARAH'S PRIDE broke a step slowly, was kept well off the inside and failed to menace.

ALL TIME CLASSIC was up close early, loomed three wide through the turn, took control through the turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner.
MARGARITA SUNRISE set a clear early pace while racing off the rail into the turn, was collared by the winner through, couldn't match strides with the
winner and finished second best. DR. LLOYD was allowed to settle early, advanced between rivals passed tired foes and was along for third. MIAMI
CHROME was unhurried early, raced five wide through the turn and offered no late rally. MASSEY HALL was taken back early from between rivals and
never fired. SMOKIN' ALONE chased the early pace from the inside and tired. MAGNIFICENT CHROME was void of any early speed, angled out to the
seven path through the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
NORTHWAY was reserved early, raced three wide through the second turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy winner. DONS LAST
CALL was unhurried early, raced four wide through the second turn, passed rivals, was no match and finished second best. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE set a
clear early pace from the inside opened up and faded. INDYAN PENNY hopped at the start, was void of any early speed, raced between rivals into the
second turn and offered no late rally. FRANKIE C raced in mid pack early, went six wide through the second turn and flattened out. BARBARA'S SPIRIT
was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide out of the second turn and never fired. GIANT BOTTLE was taken back early, raced three wide into the
second turn and was no factor. PAULIES ANGEL followed the early pace and was finished early.
