Footnotes
DADDY INDEED rated nicely off of the solid early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn and was asked for run four wide into the stretch, ran in pursuit
to the furlong pole, vied for the lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, took command into deep stretch and edged away under firm urging to prevail in a
good debut. MERRY BLUE was hard to load prior to the start and was away a bit slowly from the gate, improved position on the turn while outside of rivals,
was roused four wide into the stretch, chased to mid-stretch, closed willingly while five wide into deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages
and was up in time to secure second. NORTHERN LINCHPIN never far back early on, tracked the solid early pace into the turn, came two wide to the
quarter marker, chased two wide into the stretch, responded to urging in the final furlong, closed in the final stages and gained third at the finish, while just
missing for second. GRAZED N' CONFUSED broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, pressed the sold pace between runners into the turn,
disputed the pace two wide to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and led to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with oncoming rivals,
weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for second and third. HEY BARMAID pressed the solid early pace outside of a pair of rivals, raced close to
the front on the turn while three wide, lost position into the stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages. AFTER MY OWN
HEART bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, lacked early speed, improved position two wide into the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the
stretch, was gaining in the late stages but failed to threaten. SPAIN MOONLIGHT (IRE) contested the solid early pace from the inside, lost position on the
turn and faded in the stretch. HARBOR'S BEAUTY chased from the inside, came in tight and waited for racing room at the quarter marker, shifted to the two
path into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
AMANDA ROSE settled in a tracking position early then quickly moved into contention going into the turn, awaited room two deep to the top of the stretch,
responded when roused turning for home, took the advantage passing the furlong marker and won clear under intermittent urging. SEASON TO
REMEMBER broke a step slow then hustled to the lead, held a slight advantage through the turn, dug in under pressure when AMANDA ROSE offered a
challenge at the top of the stretch but could not match strides in the final stages. TIME TO SMILE broke well then stalked the pacesetter under light
handling, went to press the issue passing the three furlong pole, ran on well down the stretch but was outfinished by the top pair. ENGEE OMBEE broke in a
the start and bumped with OUT OF STARS, was outrun in the early going and chased the field to the turn, made a four wide bid into the stretch and showed
some late interest but could not make up the needed ground. OUT OF STARS was bumped at the start then became hard to handle for most of initial
furlong, fell far behind the field, stayed to the inside but was never a threat. JERSEY BIRD got away well and raced close up while three wide through the
early running, came under pressure from the three furlong marker and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
WINE AND WHISKY raced three wide into the first turn contending for the early lead then was content to drop back and track the moderate pace from a few
lengths back, was always traveling well racing two deep on the far turn, got stuck behind horses as the field turned for home, squeezed through a hole near
the furlong marker and responded to strong handling to prevail. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE tracked mid-pack to the far turn, made a sustained run from the
three furlong pole, swung four to five wide into the stretch and finished strongly to just miss. SUGAR BEETS settled at the rear of the compact field and was
content to race there to the far turn, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole while looking for a path up the rail, could not find racing room then
switched out to the three path, made a nice late surge once clear but came up short. SEA OF LIBERTY pressed the pace while under a stout hold, was set
down passing the three furlong pole, made a three wide bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, dueled to deep stretch but was outfinished in the final
yards. COBRA JET showed good speed from the gate without being asked, seized the lead and the rail into the first turn then was allowed to set very
moderate fractions while being stalked by SEA OF LIBERTY, hung in to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RANDOS LADY was green leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the turn, picked off rivals
along the bend and angled four wide nearing the top of the lane, loomed at mid-stretch and took command at the sixteenth-marker, was a bit green into
deep stretch but drew clear under hand urging in the final stages to prevail in a promising debut. STAY UP chased the early pace from mid-pack, advanced
two wide on the turn and was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, came in a bit tight at the furlong pole when BROADWAY TIGER drifted out, steadied
slightly and altered course into the final sixteenth, was not able to keep pace with the winner in deep stretch, was bumped in the final strides by
BROADWAY TIGER and outfinished that rival for second at the wire. BROADWAY TIGER contested the decent early pace with LONGHORN LASSIE,
pressed outside of that rival into the turn, took command into upper stretch and held a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker, drifted out inside of the
furlong pole, was overtaken by RANDOS LADY approaching the sixteenth-marker, raced on the left lead while in pursuit in deep stretch, weakened in the
late stages, drifted out and bumped STAY UP in the final strides and was just edged by that runner for second, while holding safely for third. ENGLISH
DANGER bobbled a bit leaving the break, was off a step slowly and was allowed to settle in the early running, gained ground while trailing approaching the
quarter marker, stuck to the inside into the stretch and continued to advance nearing the furlong pole, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch
and was outkicked. LAST ELIZABETHAN chased the early pace from the inside, improved position on the turn, tipped two wide into the stretch and gained
ground to come within aim at the furlong grounds, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and tired in the final stages. LONGHORN LASSIE was away
in good order and assumed command away from the start, set a pressured pace from the inside into the turn, disputed the pace with BROADWAY TIGER
along the bend while carving decent fractions, lost the lead to BROADWAY TIGER into the stretch and fought back against that rival to mid-stretch, could
not match strides into the final sixteenth and faded late. YO BABY forwardly placed in the early running, tracked between runners approaching the turn,
checked while in tight quarters entering the turn and lost position heading to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch and could not muster a late
response. VHAGAR took back off of the decent early pace, chased five wide to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and did not threaten in the
final stages. PRINCESS K close up early on, lost position on the turn while four wide and between runners, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
STRAIT OF GEORGIA broke well then relaxed nicely while allowed to set pedestrian fractions, had HICKORY WIND pressing the issue to the outside but
kept that one at bay throughout, opened up on the field turning for home, responded when roused at the top of the stretch and won as much the best of
these. MOVIETIME was a bit keen going into the first turn then pulled the rider to a forward position as the field emptied to the backstretch, settled down
when put clear four wide down the backstretch then put in a sustained rally from the five sixteenths and was no threat to the winner. YOU KIDDING ME
settled inside, unhurried early, saved ground to the far turn while racing mid-pack, bided time through the turn then swung out to the four path for the stretch
run, put in a good effort down the lane to gain the third placing. HOT JOURNEY saved ground, raced near the back of field to the far turn then made a mild
run down the stretch while racing on the wrong lead. DE LA LUNA was floated three wide on the first turn, tracked near the rear of the field down the
backstretch, took a three to four wide path through the far turn, came into the stretch in the five path and finished up even paced while never a serious
threat. HICKORY WIND pressed the pace just off the flank of STRAIT OF GEORGIA, made a challenge near the quarter pole, was quickly rebuffed but
soldiered on before tiring in mid-stretch. TITOS WITH A TWIST broke with the early leaders then had to steady off heels going into the first turn then
became rank and pulled hard on the rider through that turn, raced close to the leaders down the backstretch and into the far turn then came up empty in the
stretch.

Footnotes
UNCLE LEON was prominent away from the start, tracked the quick early pace inside of RAMATHORN, lost a bit of ground on the turn while tracking from
the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch and advanced on RAMATHORN at the furlong marker, made a quick move to draw to even terms inside of the
furlong pole, battled with RAMATHORN while on the left lead into the final sixteenth, shook free from the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and edged
away in the final strides to prove best. RAMATHORN was hustled away from the gate and assumed command in the early stages, showed good speed and
dictated terms into the turn, set a decent pace to the quarter marker while unchallenged, showed the way into the stretch and had the lead cut into a bit by
UNCLE LEON, was confronted by that rival at mid-stretch, stubbornly met the bid of UNCLE LEON into the final sixteenth, grudgingly gave way in deep
stretch and was well clear of the rest for second. KEEP MOVIN' ON was a bit hard to place and green in the early stages, came in tight approaching the
half-mile marker and checked out of tight quarters, regrouped and was steered outside of runners into the turn, raced four wide into the turn, was asked for
run three wide at the top of the stretch, was not able to impact the top pair in the late stages but finished well in the final furlong and was up in the final
strides to claim third. OLD TRIANGLE tracked the solid early pace from the inside, improved position two wide on the turn, lost ground into the stretch, ran
evenly into the final sixteenth and was just edged for third in the final strides. BABY WAYLON chased the solid early pace from the second flight, moved up
approaching the half-mile marker and raced close to the pace heading into the turn, improved position two wide along the turn, could not keep pace into the
stretch and tired in the final sixteenth. CROWN MAGIC was slow away from the start and spotted the field early on, saved ground into the turn while trailing,
improved position into the stretch but was unable to threaten in the final stages. DAD'S JUBILEE chased from the second flight in the early running, lost
position on the turn four wide, lacked a response in the stretch and did not have an impact. PRECEDENT LUKE lunged at the break and was off a bit slowly,
recovered to chase the quick early pace outside of rivals, improved position five wide into the turn, chased four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace
into the drive and weakened. IM GUNNA chased the early pace from the inside, lost position along the turn, came in tight and steadied approaching the
furlong marker and could not muster a late response. MOOLA MAN was forwardly placed in the early running and chased the solid early pace while
between runners, lost position on the turn three wide, swung four wide into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MOONRISE DRIVE tracked the decent early pace while outside of runners, was well placed three wide into the first turn, moved up along the backstretch
run and maintained a three wide path into the far turn, continued to gain ground approaching the quarter pole, chased four wide into the stretch, responded
to firm urging into the final furlong, drew to even terms with WAY TOO HOT nearing the sixteenth-marker, gained command into deep stretch, dug in under
firm handling in the final strides and held for the win over the oncoming runner-up. CAPIAT tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was coaxed along
in the two path heading into the far turn, shifted to the four path into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, closed willingly in deep stretch,
pressured MOONRISE DRIVE in the final strides but could not get by the determined winner and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second.
WAY TOO HOT was prominent away from the start and stalked the early pace into the first turn, stalked from the two path into the backstretch run and
attended to the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, was given his cue into the far turn and confronted DEO heading to the quarter marker, vied for
the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow advantage to the furlong grounds, met the bid of MOONRISE DRIVE into the final sixteenth, was overtaken in
deep stretch and was outfinished by the top pair in the final stages, while holding for third. THE SLAP was allowed to settle early on, gained ground heading
to the half-mile marker, was roused outside of rivals into the far turn and mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and
chased to the furlong marker, needed more in the final sixteenth and was outkicked, while just missing for third. SON OF SHANGHAI was hustled away
from the start and was prominent in the early running, was a bit keen in the first furlong and steadied off of heels entering the clubhouse turn, stalked the
decent pace from the inside through the backstretch run, ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, waited for racing room for a few strides nearing the top of the
lane, gained ground approaching mid-stretch, failed to respond to firm urging into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. EXCESS ENGLISH
never far back early on, tracked the decent pace while between runners into the backstretch, was well placed into the far turn two wide and between rivals,
came in tight nearing the top of the stretch, navigated traffic into the drive and remained in contention to the furlong grounds, was outrun into the final
sixteenth and could not muster a late response. DEO was asked for speed away from the start and assumed command in the early stages, set a decent
pace from the inside into the first turn, showed the way through the backstretch run while prompted, was confronted along the far turn by WAY TOO HOT,
lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch and faded through the final furlong. TRIBUTE TO M hesitated at the start, was away slowly and spotted the field
several lengths to begin, raced from far back to the quarter marker, was able to improve position into the stretch but did not threaten. LUCKY RAPPER
lacked early speed, chased from the three path through the backstretch run while trailing, saved ground into the far turn, was outrun in the stretch, was
eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
ZAZEN came away from the gate in good order, got forward position while racing widest in the group chasing the runaway leader, navigated a clean three
wide trip through the turn, went after DOLCE GHOST from the quarter pole, collared that rival in mid-stretch then held off a late challenge from the outside
to prevail. SWALL broke a step slow then had to check when EM N HOLL'S FIESTA cut across after the break, stayed to the outside in the clear for the run
down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the turn, had a little trouble changing leads at the top of the stretch but straightened out and put in a good
run down the lane to gain the place. DOLCE GHOST broke well then easily sped away to lead by open lengths, was still going well at the top of the stretch,
responded when set down for the stretch run but gave way in the late stages. HOUSE OF MAGIC broke well and settled behind the runaway leader, came
under a ride when that foe slipped away on the turn, battled back but could not summon another gear when needed. BREVE broke well, tracked outside in
the early stages, was three to four wide through the turn and found his best stride late under steady handling. LADY'S SERMON got shuffled back after the
start, lost momentum and fell far behind, went into a drive from the five furlong pole and made some improvement but had too much ground to make up.
GRAZEN IN THE SUN raced between horses in the tracking group down the backstretch, was making a forward move through the turn then had to steady
twice near the five-sixteenths, lost momentum and could not recover enough to pose a threat. SHEZARUNAWAY could not keep up through the first quarter
and dropped far back, was kept to task and passed a few stragglers in the later stages. MY YAMMY LADY was outrun down the backstretch and dropped
far behind, made a mild late run and gained a few places but was never a factor. A DIME FOR ME raced in the middle of the strung out field down the
backstretch, saved ground, then swung out to the four path for the stretch run but could not muster a rally. WARRIOR'S MOON broke with the pack then
struggled to keep contact with the field. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA broke well and was forwardly placed to the half mile marker then lost ground steadily through
the turn and faded down the lane.

MISCHIEVOUS PADDY tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, gained ground on the turn while four wide, came five wide into the stretch and
loomed approaching the furlong marker, took command while on the left lead, drew clear into deep stretch and drew away in the final stages to be much the
best. RUNNING ON FIRE tracked the solid early pace while between runners, ran in pursuit three wide to the quarter pole, shifted to the four path into the
stretch, could not match strides with MISCHIEVOUS PADDY inside of the furlong marker, ran on in the final sixteenth and outfinished COLLECT DIS
MONEY to secure second. COLLECT DIS MONEY was away in good order and was prominent in the opening stages, tracked the solid early pace from the
inside, saved ground along the bend and gave chase to the quarter marker, was asked for run nearing the top of the lane and gained command heading to
the furlong marker, was overtaken by MISCHIEVOUS PADDY inside of the furlong pole, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth, weakened in
deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. PASS THE BATON came out of the gate awkwardly then got bumped by
DESERT ROCKET and was off slowly, chased the solid early pace outside of a rival, was guided three wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker,
improved position into the stretch, needed more in the final furlong but offered a mild late bid and passed tired rivals in deep stretch. ATTA BOY LLOYD was
asked for speed away from the start and assumed command in the early running, set a solid pace into the turn while off of the rail, showed the way to the
quarter marker while carving decent fractions from the two path, lost the lead in upper stretch and battled with COLLECT DIS MONEY to mid-stretch, could
not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the solid early pace three deep
heading to the half-mile marker, improved position from that three wide path into the turn, lost ground into upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.
DANZING ALYDAR broke out at the start, made contact with PASS THE BATON and was off slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages, came in tight
entering the turn and checked in tight quarters, chased two wide to the quarter marker, swung to the five path into the stretch and did not make an impact.
DESERT ROCKET lost his path at the start and was off slowly, spotted the field in the early stages and raced well behind the others into the turn, trailed into
the stretch, improved position in the final furlong but was unable to threaten. CARDINAL TRICK veered out after the break and caused a chain reaction of
bumping, chased the solid early pace from the inside, gave chase from the rail heading to the quarter marker, swung to the two path into upper stretch, lost
position approaching the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch. WHENTHEFOGLIFTS chased the solid early pace from a two wide path, ran in pursuit to
the quarter marker, slipped to the inside into upper stretch, lost position heading to the furlong grounds and tired in the final stages.
