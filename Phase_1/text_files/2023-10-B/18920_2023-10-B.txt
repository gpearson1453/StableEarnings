Footnotes
MARTINI MARTIN came away in good order and raced two to three wide into the first turn, remained unhurried off the pace while never too far back, edged
a bit closer two wide mid-way around the far turn, shifted to the three path entering upper stretch, responded willingly called upon, seized command near
mid-stretch and finished going away. SILENT MODE bobbled outward a step at the start, was forwardly placed two wide heading into the first turn, tracked
the pace three deep mid-way up the backstretch, advanced to challenge the leader at the quarter pole, vied with JERSEY PERFECTION to mid-stretch then
failed to be a match when the winner swept by. JERSEY PERFECTION rated in early stages then edged up closer racing between foes midway up the
backstretch, challenged DANGEROUS MIND for the lead entering the far turn, got by rival then took on SILENT MODE near the quarter pole, vied into
upper stretch then gave way. PAPA FUNNY raced up close inside around the first turn, continued forwardly placed up the backstretch, weakened near the
inside around the far turn and had no further punch. DANGEROUS MIND led the way around the first turn and set the pace with rivals in close contention up
the backstretch, dueled with JERSEY PERFECTION entering the far turn then faded.

Footnotes
REMEMBERING WILBUR sped to the lead at the start and continued to hold a narrow advantage around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, hustled
along two to three wide through the lane, had plenty left in reserve and pulled away. EDWARD MADDEN hustled up out of the gate and raced up close
three wide in the early going, edged up closer but could not reach the eventual winner around the turn, continued to chase after rival into the lane and
stayed on for second best. HE'S A SHOOTER tracked the top pair in early stages, picked up the tempo three wide nearing the quarter pole, ran on through
the lane and secured a share. CREATIVE CLOUD was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and needed
more for impact. JIMMY THE KID was not too far back on the inside into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane then gave way. MINISTER QUINN was
forwardly placed in early stages, weakened around the turn and had no further response.

WILPIC coaxed along early from the outside, made a strong three wide bid near the three eighths pole, drifted through the stretch and was well clear late
under strong handed pressure. BIG BOLT raced off the early pace, moved up two wide between rivals around the far turn but was no match for the winner in
the drive while racing near the inside. UPTOWN JIVE settled off the early pace, raced four to five wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive while
racing from the far outside. HURRICANE BON dropped back to race mid pack early, was five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. FAYTASTIC
vied for the early lead near the rail and gave way. JUST THE THING pressed the early going between rivals and tired readily.

ROBINSON was off a step slow, settled off the early pace battle near the inside, raced three to four wide in the drive and rallied for the place position.
THROWBACK vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way to the top pair late grudgingly. WIN OR CELLAR pressed the early pace racing between
rivals early on, raced three deep around the far turn and weakened through the drive racing five deep. LUCKY BREEZE dropped back to race mid pack,
raced two wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. UNBRIDLED SASS dropped back early, raced from the inside around the far turn and had no late
response. RUBY DOOBY DOO raced at the back of the pack early on, was six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. JIMMYDABOOK
raced with the second flight early, was six deep into the upper lane and never was a factor. EXCLUSIVE ROSE was coaxed along from the inside and

Footnotes
I'M BLEU TOO was quick to begin, overtaken early to press My Sassy Valentine early from the inside and kicked clear under steady pressure. MY SASSY
VALENTINE vied two deep from the outside of foe, kept on but was no match for the winner. CHERIE AMOUR stalked the top pair, raced two deep around
the far turn and kept on to the wire. I LOVE MARIA dropped back to race mid pack early, saved ground and had no rally. BOUNTY KILLAH raced near the
back of the pack early, was along the inside into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. LIL JERSEY GIRL raced off the early pace setters, was three to four
wide in the drive and lacked a bid. TACHEENE took up break, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, was four wide around the far turn and never
threatened.
