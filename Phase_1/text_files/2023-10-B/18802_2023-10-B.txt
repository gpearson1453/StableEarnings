Footnotes
ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE unhurried, saved ground on the two path through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late.
TIZ PROMISING RVF tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at
the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. PROPER MANNERS well placed and outside, looped up three wide
through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned
back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. WATERLOO SUNSET rated outside the leader, gained a
striking position and bid outside that one into the stretch, then had no rally. SALLY'S MUSTANG unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned
five wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FROST eased to the lead through the first turn, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. TWISTED
TREASURE well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out at the furlong
marker for clear racing room, then made a steady gain and missed. LIGHTNING ROUND allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside into the stretch, angled out for racing room, then found room inside, angled back in, closed fast and edged for the show. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL hard
to rated inside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, angled widest and missed
the show. NEVISIAN SPIRIT tracked the pace, angled out and moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch
and flattened the final furlong. THISAINTJUMPSTREET rated outside, pulled to contention down the backstretch, held position three wide through the
second turn, then had no stretch rally. NOT ORBINARY was a brief factor, outside.

UNSEEN unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four and five wide into the stretch, drifted in to the three path, made a steady gain
and edged up late. CLOUD IN THE WIND stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, then drifted out in the stretch,
holding sway, then was no match late and held the place. A ROSE FOR TINA well placed, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, then was carried out by the leader and lacked the needed late kick. FIGHT IN THE DOG set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged
through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. WARRIOR BERNICE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on
that path into the stretch and improved position. VERSACE SUMMER passed tiring rivals. ANY FOOLS GOLD mid pack, lost some position four wide
through the turn, then faded into the stretch. MY JENNY ran evenly and faded through the turn.

MARY KATHERINE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late. I'M GLAD
(IRE) unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drew off inside the furlong
marker and was outfinished. FINE FABRIC hopped at the start, pulled to contention inside, tracing the pace, raced boxed through the second turn, angled
out and found room on the two path into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. DETERMINED EMPIRE well placed and outside,
looped to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted out and weakened. OUTTA THE CLOUD sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. LEAPIN LEVA well placed bearing out, gained position into
the second turn, then faded through the turn.

STANHOPE unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong
marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. BALISTICO tracked the pace, angled out and moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. SPEEDY MOONLITE sent from the gate, set the pace inside, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. SOUTH SEA rated in the early going, looped up three and four wide through the turn,
angled widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. FUNKY MUSIC well placed and outside, faded three and four wide through the turn. RUNAWAY
STAR vied for the early lead on the outside, bid outside the leader into the stretch and had no rally.

pressure. DANCING SPIRIT well placed and off the rail, moved to position inside through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and missed. CANDY REWARD unhurried, saved ground through the turn, gaining position, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady
gain and lacked the needed late kick. REIGERT GIRLS never far back, gained position two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch
and flattened the final furlong. DEWEY DOIT well placed and between, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch and ran
evenly. NOISY ON THE BAY unhurried, moved up while saving ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and flattened out. TWISTED
EMPRESS allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. WILD CREATION passed

Footnotes
LUCKY SMILE stalked the pace on the outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and drove clear late. JOSH'S HONOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held
the place. BACKDOORPARTY allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain
and missed the place. LARZ mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, had a mild late gain for a share.
DONTINVADEMYSPACE well placed and off the rail, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and flattened out.
ASPLUNDER unhurried, moved up four wide through the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch and evened out. GRAVE DANGER steadied at the start, was
allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. SILVER TOKEN passed tiring rivals,
widest. BUFF AND SHINE tracked the pace back, lost some ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and had no rally.
AEGONTHECONQUEROR well placed and outside, faded through the turn.
