Footnotes
BINDING HEART rated on the front end from inside, moved clear and was just off the rail then maintained control under steady handling in the lane.
SHEBA'S PAL bumped shortly after the break, was hustled along while toward the outside, took over second three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late
kick but lasted for the place. NOBLE CREEKER broke inward starting a chain reaction of bumping, veered out and bumped solidly with SHEBA'S PAL,
progressed widest after a quarter mile, came four wide into the lane, drifted out some approaching the last eighth, held a straight path the final furlong, found
best stride too late but was easily best of the rest. CHERRY ORCHARD bobbled slightly at the start, was then bumped and forced inward, raced in
contention between rivals, did not keep up and moved to the inside on the turn then has no stretch bid. ALPHA LEA bumped and forced into CHERRY
ORCHARD at the break, angled in early on and failed to menace. STORMYSTORMYNIGHT unruly in the gate, dwelt at the start and was never a factor.
FLYING CRICKET pressed the early speed from just outside and gave way the final two furlongs. PLAY THE BLUES faded from inside after a quarter mile,
swung out widest for the drive and had little to offer.

Footnotes
ZARMAE settled early, picked up his pace after a half mile, came into contention from outside on the second bend, continued to rally from path five in the
lane, gained a slight advantage inside the last furlong and edged ahead late. CHANGE DIRECTION reluctant to load, progressed from outside once the
race began to vie for the lead three wide on the second turn, battled through the lane and did not have enough left deep stretch. READY REDDING lugged
in some just after the break, shared the early lead from inside, dropped back and angled out some once on the backstretch, went for the lead again between
rivals on the second bend, moved clear and gained the rail leaving that bend, was challenged from outside upper stretch, fought to hold on but gradually
wore down the last sixteenth. COPPER CROSSING raced in contention between horses, was two wide on the second turn, angled outside CHANGE
DIRECTION upper stretch and leveled off. CAMPAIGN SPY forced inward shortly after the start, was soon well back and well off the inside, came widest
into the lane, passed tired ones upper stretch then also leveled off. SUPER SILVER was away slowly and never a factor. SHOBIZ STAR forced inward just
after the break, advanced three wide to gain the lead on the backstretch, moved to the rail after a half mile, was overtaken from outside on the second turn
and gave way the last two furlongs. CAMARGO was sent to contest the pace just outside READY REDDING, gained the rail on the backstretch then quit
after a half mile.

Footnotes
BILL'S HONOR soon had the lead, showed the way just off the rail, was roused on the bend then steadily opened up under a drive in the lane. DENNIS'S
PRIDE prompted the early pace from inside, moved clear for second along the rail on the turn, no match for BILL'S HONOR when set down for the drive and
was unchallenged for the place. RED ROIL broke inward, bobbled as he jostled with GOD GUNS N GUTS leaving the chute, progressed from outside, was
five wide on the bend, angled in some leaving the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch then could only hold his position late. WIN THE CUP trailed,
advanced behind RED ROLL on the turn, came five wide into the lane, improved position some upper stretch then leveled off. SPAN chased while toward
the outside, was four wide on the turn, drifted out to path seven for the drive and advanced without threatening. ITS MAMBO chased from off the rail, lost
considerable ground widest through the bend and passed outside tired ones the last furlong. GOD GUNS N GUTS jostled between rivals at the break, raced
in midpack toward the outside on the backstretch, was four then five wide taking the turn and gave way for the drive. PONCHO ATTACK was bumped at the
start, raced in contention between horses, progressed three wide on the bend the also gave way in the stretch. LONE RETURN chased behind PONCHO
ATTACK on the backstretch then faded two wide on the turn. KRUELESS broke inward, was well placed not far off the inside on the backstretch but gave
way along the rail into the bend.

Footnotes
BRIANS WAY rated in the second flight, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane, engaged XPRESSIR near the sixteenth
marker, exchanged bumps with that one shortly afterward then edged ahead in the final strides. XPRESSIR shared the early lead inside EL MUCHO, moved
clear on the turn and gained the rail, drifted out some upper stretch, was straightened, began to wear down inside the final furlong, drifted out again under
left-handed pressure nearing the sixteenth marker, bumped BRIANS WAY, was then bumped by that one, fought to the wire but did not have enough left
nearing the wire. GRAYHOP was away slowly, lost ground four to six wide taking the bend, rallied in the lane, steadily angled inside horses after entering
the last eighth, closed strongly along the rail through the waning yards but was too late. TRUIST raced in contention toward the outside, advanced four wide
on the turn, lost further ground fanning wider entering the stretch and found best stride too late inside the final furlong. DIAMND CON SUERTE reluctant to
load into the gate, threw his head into the air several times when the race began, lost ground five to six wide through the bend, also rallied belatedly deep
stretch and proved easily best of the rest. RUN THE TABLE forwardly placed inside, gave way after a half mile. RA'DOM chased from off the rail, came into
the lane from path four, lugged in some upper stretch, held a straight path the last furlong but had little to offer. EL MUCHO displayed early speed outside
XPRESSIR but began to fade before finishing four furlongs.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S APPEAL settled early, circled foes on the bend, angled in beside HIDDEN FIGURE nearing the end of a half mile, took a narrow advantage
with seventy yards to go then lugged in some as she edged ahead nearing the wire. HIDDEN FIGURE shared the early lead off the rail but inside rivals,
edged ahead into the turn, battled between horses in the lane, did not enough left the inside the final sixteenth, was overtaken with seventy yards left and
steadied in tight quarters just before hitting the wire. MINI DRESS altered to the inside after travelling the first eighth, moved clear for third on the bend, had
every chance along the rail in the lane, lacked the needed late kick but was unchallenged for the show. RANK AND FILE prominent from outside, failed to
keep close four wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning wider into the stretch and only made up minor ground the last furlong. WITCHING disputed the
pace while in tight quarters between rivals but began to yield nearing the end of three furlongs. VIVA VIOLENCE brushed WITCHING a couple times
nearing the end of a quarter mile as she contested the pace outside that one, did not keep up three wide on the bend then gave way four wide in the lane.
BAILESTON LASSIE trailed from just off the rail, angled out through the turn, came widest into the lane, lugged in some upper stretch, was corrected then
failed to have a significant response. BUMPER GIRL chased from between rivals, lost ground four to six wide taking the bend and also failed to have a
stretch bid.

Footnotes
TWIRLING ROSES rated from outside, commenced his bid after two furlongs, came into contention along the rail on the bend, quickly moved clear inside
the final furlong and held sway under steady handling. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY began to close the gap while just off the inside on the turn, fanned out some
entering the lane, altered inside JACK VAN BERG upper stretch, began to drift out inside the last eighth, was steadied while boxed in behind the latter
nearing the sixteenth pole, altered in and took over second soon after. MON AMI FUZZIE trailed from between horses, progressed on the bend, moved to
the rail at the top of the lane and rallied belatedly. UPBEAT MELODY vied for the lead outside JACK VAN BERG on the backstretch, did not stay with that
one on the turn, stayed outside JACK VAN BERG entering the stretch, gradually wore down the final furlong and was crowded by the latter in the waning
yards. JACK VAN BERG shared the early lead from inside, moved clear through the bend, floated out to path three into the lane, floated slightly in and out
as he began to wear down and drifted out deep stretch. VIOLENZA D'ORO chased from inside, swung to the outside for the stretch run and had little to
offer.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S RANGER hesitated then left the gate awkwardly, began to advance between horses on the backstretch, came into contention three wide on
the second bend, fanned outside THINK BLUE entering the lane, took the lead inside the last furlong and drew off with a sixteenth left. THINK BLUE
pressed FREE LOVE from just outside, went for the lead on the second turn, did not stay with the latter entering the stretch, came again inside the final
eighth, was no match for GHAALEB'S RANGER but caught FREE LOVE for second near the wire. FREE LOVE soon had the lead, showed the way in hand
just off the inside, was roused leaving the quarter pole, floated out some as she moved clear into the lane and began to wear down inside the last furlong.
ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE bumped with ENGLISH at the start, was forwardly placed from inside, did not keep up on the second bend, angled out some for a
clear path upper stretch but had no late bid. JERSEY GOLD raced in contention while toward the outside on the backstretch, angled in some on the second
turn, took the rail upper stretch and began to fade. MIKE'S LADY chased from outside and was never a factor. NO NANNETTE NO chased from inside,
gradually angled out through the stretch but had no rally. ENGLISH bumped with ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE at the break, was prominent between horses but
gave way two wide on the second bend.

ROCK N RYE broke outward, bumping MKAR THE FAST, stalked the early speed from inside, angled outside FASTNFURIOUS midway on the backstretch,
went for the lead from path three on the bend, moved clear upper stretch, angled in some and gradually lengthened command under mild urging. TRY TRY
AGAIN chased from inside, floated out some entering the lane, altered in midstretch and took over second with a sixteenth to go. CHICKS FOR FREE
hesitated then threw his head about leaving the gate, was soon far back, stayed well off the inside through the bend, moved to the rail with a furlong left,
rallied behind TRY TRY AGAIN and got up for third late. MKAR THE FAST reluctant to load, was bumped at the break, chased just off the rail, swung out
four wide into the stretch and lacked a significant response. NOT AGAIN JACKIE stayed off the inside and failed to menace. LAYTON THE DAY was an
early contender outside rivals, moved to the rail on the turn, angled outside ROCK N RYE midstretch and faded. FASTNFURIOUS was soon clear of the
rest, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from outside on the bend and gave way between horses in the lane.

Footnotes
PACHI stalked the early speed from outside, took the lead outside TAPIT SAM on the bend, floated out some entering the lane then steadily drew away
under urging. TAPIT SAM emerged with a narrow lead just off the inside on the backstretch, was overtaken from outside on the turn, no match for PACHI
when set down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for the place. CURRENT without early speed, was taken to out widest midway on
the backstretch, lost considerable ground six, then seven wide through the bend and rallied belatedly the final furlong. SOUPER FORTUNE was soon
pressing TAPIT SAM from just outside, fanned four wide into the lane and flattened. R H SMOAKEM was a contender between horses on the backstretch,
improved position along the rail on the turn, came off the inside some for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. W W RUSSIAN GOLD chased
from outside, retreated four wide on the bend then steadily improved position between rivals in the lane without threatening. CARL G progressed four wide
on the turn, swung out to path six for racing room entering the stretch but failed to rally. STOSH well placed from inside on the backstretch, did not stay
close two wide on the bend, regained the rail into the stretch and had no late bid. TRIPLE CHROME dwelt at the start then broke in the air and was never a
factor. KING TITO rank at the start, was soon under control, moved up to contention from outside but gave way five wide on the turn.
