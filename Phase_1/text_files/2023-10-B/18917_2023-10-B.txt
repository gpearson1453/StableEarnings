four wide on the turn making a strong bid to mid stretch but flattened out in late stretch. GOSPEL EXTRA broke in the air at the start then was unhurried
early on, rallied on the turn and made up ground but was no threat in the end. DA LAST TEQUILA chased the early pace while inside, was used up then
