Footnotes
MAGIC BEAUTY set the pace at once while clear, continued on a clear lead into the turn while in the two path, continued in the three path into the lane,
widened to the sixteenth pole then held. Z ZS RED was in the two or three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path,
commenced a rally inside the eighth pole while in the five path and was closing in late to settle for second best. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE chased the pace
from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the winner then weakened. MISS LUV SHACK raced near the rail
through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing kick. MS. THE LAW trailed into the lane while saving ground and showed good energy to move up
while not threat. SKYLERVILLE chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and faded. QUIET DAWN never
a factor while in the four or five path through the turn. GO STORMIN GIRL raced in the four path through the turn and into the lane and tired. CANT BE
TOUCHED broke a step outward, chased the pace along the inside into the turn then steadily faded.

BAYTOWN ANGEL dueled inside of a rival before drawing off at the quarter pole under steady handling. GREEN CHILE raced in the four path, lacked a late
bid but was up for the place. C C GRAND saved ground and nabbed the show spot late. LUNA DIVA dueled outside of the winner before giving way at the
quarter pole. CHANNAH DEL MAR raced in the four path with no late move. DESPEIGHTFUL was bumped at the start, stalked the pace inside, then faded
in the stretch. SWEET ENCHANTMENT saved ground. LUCY THE GOOSE stalked the pace between rivals, then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
MONUMENTALJUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, moved three wide into the turn, continued with momentum through the turn and into the lane,
came three wide nearing the eighth pole to be a serious threat, continued to inch up on the leader inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed late. SARGENT
HULKA chased the two rival duel into the far turn, bid along the inside to gain the lead into the lane, cleared with an eighth to travel but could not hold off the
winner while clearly second best. PAIGE PERFECT pressed the pace two wide into the turn, lost the lead in late turn, stayed on until inside the eighth pole
and could not keep up while clearly best of rest. CHARMING VICTORY was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three or four path through the
turn and into the lane and moved up while never a threat. ORA CERTA saved ground throughout and lacked a response. SUNDAY TRYST bobbled outward
at the start, raced in the three path through the far turn and never was a factor. REVS MEDAL was in the two path through the far turn when never far back
then faded through the lane. MOTION TO ADJOURN vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn and was empty in mid-turn. IMPLODING was three
wide through the first turn, continued well off the inside into the far turn and was done.

Footnotes
OCEAN SPIRIT (GB) was in the two or three path through the far turn when near mid-pack, came into the lane from the three or four path, gained
momentum approaching the eighth pole then quickly moved past the dueling pacesetters late and cleared. PRINCESS BRITNI settled very early, moved to
vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, continued on near even terms through the lane, was inching up to the lead inside the sixteenth
pole when passed by the winner and stayed on to be well clear for the place spot. CAVU vied for the lead throughout while along the inside, was still dueling
for the lead in deep stretch and could not keep up while settling for being best of the rest. LILY'S HOME was in the three or four path through the turn when
near the back, began gaining momentum in late turn, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a threat to the top ones. THE PRINCESS
SAYS raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was a threat. CRIMALDI never a factor while near the
inside. RUTH OF JUDAH was along the inside through the turn and was empty after straightening in the lane. RUBY TAP vied for the early lead three wide,
chased the pace through the turn while in the four path and was empty turning into the lane. NGALA was near the back into the turn, getting out through the
turn, came into the lane from the nine path and was never a menace. FLOR DE GRAY vied for the early lead two wide into the turn, chased through
mid-turn then faded through the lane.

Footnotes
GET N TIPSY raced three wide from the outset, gained momentum through the far turn when still three wide and into the four path, entered the lane from
the four path and launched a long bid from mid-track to just get up. FIRESIDE KITTEN chased the pace while in the three path into the far turn, moved to vie
for the lead three wide into late turn, continued dueling with another into the lane, inched to the front nearing the eighth pole, widened the advantage inside
the sixteenth pole and was just caught. WITH THIS VOW pressed the pace from the outset, vied through mid-turn while between rivals, continued on near
even terms to inside the eighth pole then could not keep up late while staying on to hold the show spot. MIZZEN ASH raced in the two path when never far
back, bid into the lane from the five path and was gaining to the end. WAY TOO SMARTE in the four path through the turn, came into the lane well off the
inside and passed a few and was gaining late while not a serious menace. AZAMANA EMPIRE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was
still a contender into the lane then weakened in the drive. KICK OUT THE JAMS saved ground throughout, cut the corner into the lane to pass a few then
flattened. FAT AND FURIOUS never a factor while in the four path through the turn and straightening in the seven path in the lane. APRIL'S GEM chased
the pace along the inside through the turn then faded down the lane. NORA'S STAR was off the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the eight
path and tired. DAISY BEE vied for the lead through the far turn then retreated through the lane.
