Footnotes
DINOS DIXIE was sent leaving the break and assumed command, set a solid early pace into the turn, extended the lead while well handled approaching the
quarter marker, kicked clear into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth while maintaining a clear lead and was hand urged to the wire to win
convincingly. RESPOND tracked the solid early pace from the inside, chased DINOS DIXIE to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the stretch, could not
match strides with DINOS DIXIE at the furlong marker, finished evenly in the final sixteenth and was second best in the end. LASMUIGH (GB) was allowed
to settle early on, saved ground along the turn and advanced approaching the quarter pole, maintained an inside position into the stretch, could not impact
the top pair in the final furlong, finished evenly and held for third. STRENGTH OF AUTISM was prominent in the early running, stalked the decent pace from
a two wide path into the turn, chased two wide into the stretch, lost position at the furlong marker, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for third.
WEE BEASTIE chased the decent early pace from a two wide position, swung three wide into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. IN HONOR OF
AUTISM tracked the decent early pace from the outside, came three wide to the quarter marker and was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, could not
keep pace approaching the furlong grounds and gave way.

Footnotes
SHEZA GIRLY GIRL tracked the solid early pace while between rivals, raced two wide into the turn, shifted to the three path approaching the top of the lane,
came a in bit tight in upper stretch while between runners, responded to urging inside of the furlong marker, finished well in deep stretch, caught AUSTRAIN
NAVY in the final strides and edged away to prevail at the finish. AUSTRIAN NAVY was asked for speed leaving the start and gained command in the early
running, set a solid pace into the turn, drew to a clear lead along the bend, was well handled to the quarter marker and held foes at bay to the top of the
stretch, extended the lead at the furlong grounds, was kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch
and just held for second at the wire. TRULY FABULOUS was allowed to settle in the early going while not far back, tracked outside of rivals along the turn
and was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied while widest in the final sixteenth, just missed for second at the finish and was up in time to secure the nod
for third. GET'EM TIGER tracked the early pace from the outside, came three wide into the turn then gave chase two wide into the stretch, chased to the
furlong marker, was gaining in the late stages but needed more in deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. THREAD COUNT close up in the
early stages, took back to track from the inside, saved ground into the stretch, lost position at the furlong pole and weakened. SPUN BEAUTIFUL was
bumped and crowded by neighboring runners at the start and was away a step slowly, rushed into contention early and tracked the pace into the turn,
chased two wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LADYWEARSTHERING broke well but was content to cede the early pacesetting duties to MADEIRA WINE, then put some pressure on halfway down the
backstretch while racing two deep to the far turn, responded when roused at the top of the stretch and wore down that rival passing the eighth pole with
enough in reserve to hold off a fast closing challenger to the outside. SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) settled off the two leaders while racing in the three path
under a stout hold, was asked to pick it up near the three furlong marker and responded, entered the stretch in the three path and produced a strong late run
but came up short. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled along the inside, inched closer heading to the quarter marker, rallied into upper stretch and came
within aim at the furlong marker, needed more in the late stages, was outkicked and held safely for third, . MADEIRA WINE broke from the gate intent on
getting to the front, gained the lead going into the first turn then was allowed to set sensible fractions, met a challenge by LADYWEARSTHERING heading
into the stretch, held on to mid-stretch then gave way. ASSIGNATION broke outward at the start then was devoid of early speed, raced three to four wide at
the back of the field through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, made a four to five wide rally through the far then then flattened out in the
stretch. A CROWN FOR KITTEN was not asked for speed in the early stages, settled near the back of the pack racing in the two path, inched closer
heading into the far turn, was asked in earnest at the quarter pole then raced on the wrong lead down the stretch and was unable to improve position.

Footnotes
BOSS OF THEMOSS was hustled away from the start, contested the early pace with RALLY CAT and showed speed into the turn, carved out fast fractions
along the turn while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and extended the lead at the furlong marker, responded to urging and held
foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, met the bid of GRIT AND CURIOSITY into deep stretch, dug in in the final strides and lasted at the finish for a
determined win. GRIT AND CURIOSITY was away in good order, tracked the fast early pace between runners, improved position on the turn while three
wide, continued to gain three wide into the stretch, rallied while on the left lead in the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in the final strides but could not
get by the determined BOSS OF THEMOSS and was clear for second. REFI NOW tracked the fast early pace while two wide and between runners, raced a
bit in tight while two wide nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch, ran on in the final
yards and just held for third at the wire. SUMMANUS chased the fast early pace from the outside, improved position four wide on the turn, drifted out a bit at
the top of the lane and lost ground heading to the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. RALLY CAT was
asked for speed away from the start and disputed the fast early pace with BOSS OF THEMOSS, pressed from the three path into the turn and shifted to the
two path nearing the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked a response in deep stretch and tired. THE
CALABRESE KID was a bit slow into stride leaving the start and settled at the rear to begin, chased five wide along the turn, ran evenly in the stretch and
did not threaten in the late stages. STRETCH RUN was a bit hard to load prior to the start, lunged at the break and was off a step slowly, rushed up in the
early stages and tracked the quick pace from the inside, lost position while inside of rivals heading to the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and gave
way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CHARLENE'S DREAM was prominent away from the start and raced close up to the early pace, prompted the pace into the backstretch run then advanced
to contest the pace to the half-mile pole, took command from TOUR QUEEN along the far turn and showed the way into upper stretch, was given a reminder
tap and held foes at bay to the furlong marker, dug in under firm urging into the final sixteenth, repelled the bid of ANGIOLLETA in deep stretch and held in
a drive to prevail. ANGIOLLETA (IRE) settled along the inside into the first turn, was taken off of the rail and tracked two wide along the backstretch run,
raced three wide into the far turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied approaching the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and came
within aim at the the sixteenth-pole, was repelled by the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely for second in the end. SOHO
tracked the moderate pace from the inside, saved ground into the far turn, was taken off of the rail and was roused two wide at the quarter pole, shifted to
the three path into the stretch and vied for the lead approaching the furlong marker, needed more in deep stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and
held safely at the finish for third. TOUR QUEEN broke alertly and was forwardly placed early on, engaged with CHARLENE'S DREAM into the first turn and
contested moderate fractions with that rival into the backstretch run, disputed the pace to the half-mile marker then lost position into the far turn, chased
CHARLENE'S DREAM into the stretch and faded in the final stages. SUSIE CRU was unhurried to begin, raced three wide into the backstretch run and
tracked to the half-mile marker, lost contact with the others along the far turn and chased three wide into the stretch, lacked a response in the drive and did
not factor. KRISTIN LEE was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run, gained ground
heading to the half-mile marker and came three wide into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TESORO tracked behind AMERICAN FARMER three wide through the first half mile, moved to challenge that one to the outside passing the half mile pole,
had that bid rebuffed but regrouped mid-stretch, came back on and was able to reel in that stubborn rival the final yards. AMERICAN FARMER got away
from the gate very quickly and was able to lead the field through a pedestrian first quarter, then got pressed by LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF down the
backstretch, kept that one at bay to the half mile marker then was challenged on the outside by TESORO, rebroke and held that rival at bay to deep stretch
then was outfinished in the shadow of the wire. KENNEBEC hustled to get position going into the first turn, the settled three wide and kept close while under
a bit of a hold, attempted to re-engage passing the three eighths pole then put in a late run down the middle of the track to grab third. NO ICE NO GLASS
stumbled at the start, broke a bit behind the others, then was floated five wide into the first turn, got over to the inside for the backstretch run, raced near the
back, rallied through the far turn, came into the stretch three wide then ran on well while chasing the top pair but was nailed at the wire for third. AMERICA
GREAT broke inward at the break then got bounced around once clear of the gate, took to the rail and raced close up to the half mile marker then struggled
to keep up when the pace quickened in the middle of the far turn and ran on evenly to the wire. FLASHIEST was held up near the rear of the field through
the first half mile, set down passing the three furlong marker and attempted to rally but could do no better than chase the field home.
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF broke alertly then steadied repeatedly through the first turn while between horses and hard to place, once clear pulled the rider to
the lead then settled down approaching the half mile pole, could not go on with the top two when they quickened away with three furlongs to run, then had
nothing to offer down the stretch.

RESERVE PROOF was hustled leaving the break, showed good early speed and disputed the fast pace into the turn, dueled through fast fractions along
the bend while inside of AS LUCK HAPPENS, continued that battle into the stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, kept to task while firmly
handled into deep stretch, held the runner-up at bay in the final strides and determinedly prevailed. AS LUCK HAPPENS broke out leaving the start and
crowded a neighboring rival, was prominent three wide in the early stages and pressed the fast pace into the turn, dueled outside of RESERVE PROOF
heading to the quarter marker, continued that battle into the stretch, drifted out under firm urging in deep stretch, was held at bay by the determined winner
in the final strides and held clearly in the end for second. TIGER TOO bobbled at the start, was away slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, saved
ground into the turn and improved position heading to the quarter marker, made a steady gain into the stretch, sustained his rally through the drive, could
not impact the top pair in the final stages but was gaining in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. JOHNNY PAYCHECK tracked the
fast early pace while between runners, moved up three wide into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch,
chased the top pair into the final sixteenth, did not offer a late response and was just edged for third at the finish. WESTERN SIERRA broke alertly and
established the early lead, disputed the fast pace two wide between runners into the turn, lost position entering the bend and chased to the quarter marker,
ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and weakened. SHAUN'S JAZZ was crowded by a neighboring rival at the start and was away
a bit slowly, chased the fast pace from the outside, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch and did not threaten. R HEART OF GOLD chased the fast
early pace from the inside, improved position along the turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, lost a bit of ground at the furlong marker and finished evenly.
UNCLE DUSAN chased the fast early pace from the outside, slipped to the two path entering the turn, lost position at the quarter marker, raced three wide
into the stretch and gave way. GONNA GETCHA GOOD took back off of the fast early pace, was green and hard to place in the first furlong, drifted out

Footnotes
RAVEN'S QUEST showed speed away from the gate, assumed command and set a pressured pace from the inside in the opening furlong, dueled along the
turn with BOBBY'S GENIE and set a fast pace to the quarter pole, shook free into upper stretch and drew clear while in hand approaching the furlong
marker, was given a pair of reminder urges into the final sixteenth, drew off in deep stretch and was hand ridden to the finish to be much the best. MO
TOWN GAL tracked the fast early pace from the outside, came five wide into the turn, shifted to the four path heading to the quarter marker and improved
position nearing the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive but stayed on in the late stages and held safely at the finish for
second. CRY ME A RUNNER tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, came in tight entering the turn and steadied behind a weakening rival while
four wide, gained ground heading to the quarter marker, came in tight approaching the top of the lane and shifted in for the stretch drive, lacked the needed
response in the stretch but stayed on in the final sixteenth and was up in time to claim third. CHIC SAMARAI chased from the second flight, improved
position two wide on the turn, was urged along three wide into the stretch, could not muster a rally in the final furlong and was just edged for the third at the
finish. BOBBY'S GENIE was hustled leaving the break and was prominent in the early running, pressed the fast pace outside of RAVEN'S QUEST, dueled
outside of that rival into the turn and disputed the fast pace to the quarter pole, could not match strides into the stretch and faded in the late stages. BLUE
EYED JO chased the fast early pace and lost position heading to the half-mile marker, raced in the three path into the turn, was asked for run four wide into
the stretch, was able to improve position in the final furlong but failed to threaten. GETAWAY CHARM broke through the gate prior to the start, was
forwardly placed in the early stages and chased the fast pace from the outside, gained ground three then two wide along the turn, could not keep pace into
the stretch and tired in the final furlong. LISA'S VALENTINE was prominent in the early stages and raced close up to the fast early pace, lost position two
wide along the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. PATSY MONTANA was unprepared at the start and was away slowly, chased the fast
pace from the inside, saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
A MAN'S MAN came away well, raced in hand up close with the early leaders through the clubhouse turn then stalked the slow pace being set by LAW
ABIDING to the far turn, moved to challenge for the lead passing the quarter pole, met brief resistance at the head of the stretch, sprinted away at the
furlong marker and won handily. MOOGIE SON settled inside well off the pace through the initial stages, bided time through the turn waiting for room, took
advantage of a big hole up the rail into stretch, ran on well, tipped out a path near the eighth pole to get around a tiring LAW ABINDING but was no match
for the winner. ECOLOGIST raced three wide through the first turn then worked into a forward tracking position while still wide down the backstretch, was
put into a sustained drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, soldiered on down the middle of the track and just got up for third. RODRIGOKNOWS was able to
get good forward and inside position behind the pacesetter into the first turn, bided time inside just off the leader to the far turn, came under pressure near
the five-sixteenths pole, had a mild response but could not summon another gear when needed. BUENISIMO broke a step slow then was hustled to keep in
contact with the pack, then was content to settle near the back of the field, tried to rally through the far turn, became stuck behind horses as the field
bunched up, found some room along the rail into the stretch and was able to improve position in the late stages. HOUSE OF LORDS raced mid-pack
between horses to the far turn, moved closer in tight quarters going into the turn, waited for room through the turn, attempted to rally inside under urging but
lacked the needed response. COUSIN RICHIE raced near the rear of the field and three wide through the first half of the race, started a mild rally while still
three wide on the far turn then swung five wide into the stretch and finished with some gain on the outside of the group behind the top pair. HARMON lacked
any speed from the gate and lagged at the rear of the field, could not keep up through the far turn when the pace quickened, came under a ride but did not
offer up a response. LAW ABIDING broke best and came away with the lead going into the first turn, held sway through the turn, was challenged by A
MAN'S MAN near the quarter pole, battled back briefly to mid-stretch then was spent and passed by the entire field in the final furlong.
