Footnotes
TORTUGA ISLAND hustled to vie for the early lead, gradually angled in on the backstretch, moved clear on the bend, lengthened command under urging
upper stretch then continued to open up while ridden out in the late going. RISKY SPIRIT prominent between rivals, found herself in tight quarters while
boxed in behind TORTUGA ISLAND midway on the backstretch, jostled with MISS TENA MARIE briefly past the half mile marker, came into the lane just off
the inside, edged ahead for second and battled to hold her position in the waning yards. RED MOSCATO also gradually angled in as he raced in the second
flight on the backstretch, jostled with MISS TENA MARIE from the half to seven-sixteenths poles, lost ground four wide through the turn, lodged a mild bid to
vie for second in the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. MISS TENA MARIE jostled with SUNDAY SPEIGHT nearing the end of the first furlong, was
caught in tight quarters leaving the half mile marker, jostled between RISKY SPIRIT and RED MOSCATO until nearing the turn, angled out through the bend
and found best stride too late deep stretch. SUNDAY SPEIGHT gradually angled in leaving the chute, jostled briefly with MISS TENA MARIE nearing the
end of the first furlong, was squeezed and checked midway on the backstretch and had no late bid. MOCOWBELL was away somewhat slowly and never a
factor. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS displayed early speed from inside but began to fade with a quarter mile to go. The rider of MISS TENA MARIE lodged an
objection alleging interference from RISKY SPIRIT approaching the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
MARIA'S GIFT in reserve early along the rail, was roused on the second bend, angled to the outside upper stretch, soon dueled for the lead, edged ahead
inside the final furlong, drifted out late under left-handed pressure but held sway. CLOSE TO ME prominent just off the inside, went for the lead three wide
on the second turn, battled through the stretch, could not stay with MARIA'S GIFT in the late going but proved easily second best. DEAUVILLE MIST vied
for the lead outside BOBBIE TOO TOO on the backstretch, was challenged from outside as well on the second bend, fought in the lane but wore down
inside the last eighth. GHAALEB'S DREAMS settled outside, picked up her pace after a half mile, progressed just off the rail on the second turn, fanned to
path four entering the stretch and lacked a significant response. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke in stride, was hustled clear and to the inside, shared the lead
while in hand on the backstretch, retreated a bit on the second bend and gave way along the rail the last furlong. WEEKEND PASS soon trailed, stayed well
off the inside nearly all the way and showed little. BEING CREATIVE raced in contention outside DEAUVILLE MIST, began to fade after a half mile, was
unresponsive to urging in the lane, eased deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SHORT STRAW was quickly clear of the rest, showed the way just off the rail, widened command when allowed on the bend, was under urging in the lane,
gradually drifted out inside the last furlong but was clearly best. HARPER BRIANA in contention early toward the outside, did not keep up four wide on the
turn, angled in some for the stretch run, took over second from between rivals, gradually angled out as SHORT STRAW came out inside the final eighth and
narrowly lasted for the place. I DID THE MATH without early speed, swung out through the bend, came five wide into the lane, rallied belatedly but was
clearly best of the others. W W VALID raced evenly in a ground-saving trip. KONA KONNECT just off the inside on the turn, fanned out four wide into the
stretch and had no late bid. FANCY HILL helped prompt the early pace, moved clear for second from path three on the bend, floated out further entering the
lane then began to wear down. THIS IS ANFIELD showed little. RAIN ATTACK raced in the second flight between horses then began to fade on the turn.
COLLIE WRAYS KITTY very green at the start, was always outrun.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME rated off the early speed, was let out after a half mile, engaged PRINCE OF MAYHEM from outside approaching the quarter pole, moved
clear leaving the second turn then gradually drifted out as he lengthened command the final furlong. PRINCE OF MAYHEM sprinted away from the rest at
the start, was challenged on the second bend, no match for ONE WAY HOME when set down for the drive, began to wear down from inside deep stretch
but lasted for the place. CHERNYAHOVSKIY settled inside for six furlongs, commenced his bid leaving the second turn, gained third as he gradually angled
in the stretch then leveled off in the late going. KEEN RESPONSE hesitated then made a leap from the gate, was settled inside, angled out to commence
his bid on the second turn and also rallied belatedly through the stretch. SON OF GRACE hesitated at the break, was void of speed, though urged along,
chased from off the rail, lodged his bid just off the inside leaving the second bend, angled out some to stay clear of SON OF GRACE in the stretch and
flattened out the final furlong. TROY OUNCE stumbled a few strides from the gate, chased from path three, closed the gap on the top pair on the second
turn, drifted out some upper stretch, began to weave from between rivals inside the last furlong, was steadied and finished in hand.

Footnotes
ARGYBARGY BUCK soon had a clear lead just off the rail, was encouraged to keep the advantage when challenged from outside on the backstretch,
moved clear again on the second bend, gradually drifted out through the stretch but kept MAPACHE G at bay. MAPACHE G broke somewhat slowly and
soon trailed, commenced his bid after a half mile, lost ground circling rivals five wide through the second turn, angled out some as ARGYBARBY BUCK
came out with a furlong to go, gradually closed the gap deep stretch but was too late. STORM BORN prominent from the beginning, progressed from
outside on the backstretch, was three wide taking the second bend, ran evenly through the stretch but proved easily best of the others. FUTURE VISION
was caught five wide on the first turn, came into contention on the backstretch, improved position four wide on the second bend, altered to the inside for a
clear path nearing the last furlong then flattened out in the waning yards. TEA AFTER BALLET crowded briefly at the start, was an early factor between
rivals, failed to keep up three wide taking the second turn, moved to the outside upper stretch and only passed a few tired ones. MEMPHIS PRAYER
chased from outside, advanced two wide on the second bend, also angled out some upper stretch and improved position late between horses without
threatening. TENOR vied for the lead between horses on the backstretch, began to yield on the second turn, lugged in upper stretch, altered out from
behind FUTURE VISION once inside the last furlong and continued to fade. OPTION was well placed from inside for six furlongs, began to fade leaving the
second bend, altered out when TENOR took his path nearing the eighth pole then was steadied behind the latter deep stretch. OKLAHOMA HEAT chased
from between rivals, retreated along the rail on the second turn, angled out some upper stretch, was caught in tight quarters between OPTION and
MEMPHIS PRAYER after entering the final furlong and steadied behind TENOR shortly after that. RIP IT RYAN was also away slowly and never a factor.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONER GULCH was bumped and forced into BE MY BESTIE at the break, progressed from outside, was four wide taking the bend, rallied to gain
the advantage with seventy yards left then began to draw off. MOON PIES IMAGE bumped with CANDY LOOKER leaving the chute, chased from just off
the rail, angled out into the turn, lost ground fanning outside COMMISSIONER GULCH entering the lane, made a strong move the final eighth, was too late
but caught STACY ATTACK for second. STACY ATTACK broke on top, set a pressured pace between horses, moved ahead on the bend, stayed just off
the inside, lengthened her lead upper stretch but began to wear down in the late going. BIG SALLY pressed the early leader from outside, stayed in path
three taking the turn and flattened out the last eighth. BE MY BESTIE bumped at the break, raced in contention just off the inside, had the rail through the
bend then began to flatten out for the drive. COWGIRL FRANKIE was away slowly, chased from inside, fanned out some entering the lane, moved to the
outside midstretch and passed some tired ones the final furlong. SHINE DOWN also bumped with CANDY LOOKER leaving the chute then failed to menace
in a ground-saving trip. TIME BREAK broke inward, bumping solidly with COMMISSIONER GULCH, was a factor between rivals on the backstretch but
faded two wide on the turn. CANDY LOOKER was squeezed between horses briefly leaving the chute, raced in the second flight along the rail on the
backstretch but gave way three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
PAPA ROCKET kept close from outside, angled in midway on the backstretch, progressed two wide on the bend, swung out four wide for a clear path
entering the lane, rallied and got up in time. MEGAN'S HONOR pressed the early speed from outside, went for the lead four wide on the turn, angled in
some leaving the bend, slowly lugged in while he battled under right-handed pressure, moved in beside RACE DRIVER inside the last eighth, edged ahead
in the waning yards but was outfinished. RACE DRIVER vied for the lead outside BOOTDADDY JUSTICE, gained the rail into the stretch, fought gamely but
began to wear down with seventy yards to go. BEEASY contested the pace outside RACE DRIVER from the beginning, was two wide into the lane, began
to yield with a furlong left, was steadied briefly when his path was compromised by MEGAN'S HONOR inside the last eighth and altered out some.
DIAMOND MAXIMUS soon trailed, advanced two wide on the turn, fanned out to path four for the drive, altered in some for a clear path nearing the eighth
pole then only made up minor ground late. ONE PUTT RICHIE raced in the second flight toward the outside on the backstretch but faded four wide on the
bend. TONYS MORNING LINE was a factor from inside in the early going but gave way on the turn. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE displayed early speed from
inside, began to yield before finishing a half mile, angled out upper stretch and continued to fade between rivals.

JAMAICAN TRAFFIC entering the lane, steadily angled in for a clear path, was too late along the rail deep stretch but caught MYSWEETANNALYZE for
third. MYSWEETANNALYZE shared the lead off the rail but inside MOVE IT BABY, took the rail into the turn, drifted out to path four into the stretch and
slowly wore down in the waning yards. TAPICITA chased from inside, lost considerable ground fanning to the middle of the track for the stretch run and
rallied belatedly the final furlong. BALI BABY just behind MYSWEETANNALYZE on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide on the turn and had no stretch

ST. LOUIE LOUIE shared the lead outside I'M YOU CAPTAIN, moved ahead on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch, opened up under a drive
and maintained control. EMPTY HOLSTER rated from outside on the backstretch, lost ground four wide through the turn, angled out widest upper stretch,
rallied the last eighth and caught FAST CROSS TRAFFIC for second. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC chased from inside, swung out into the bend, lost
considerable ground four to six wide taking the bend, bumped with U S HONOUR NAP as he took over second upper stretch, threatened with a furlong to
go but leveled off in the waning yarfds. HIGHLY PERFECT stumbled at the break then was bumped and forced into AFTER MY BROTHER, saved ground
on the turn then passed between tired ones in the stretch. U S HONOUR NAP broke inward, bumping HIGHLY PERFECT, loomed a threat three wide on
the bend, swung outside ST. LOUIE LOUIE into the lane, bumped with FAST CROSS TRAFFIC as he began to yield upper stretch and continued to
gradually give way. AFTER MY BROTHER bumped at the break, raced in the second flight between rivals on the backstretch, found himself boxed in behind
ST. LOUIE LOUIE on the turn, gained a clear path inside that one entering the stretch but gave way for the drive. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN displayed early
speed from inside but quickly faded the last two furlongs.
