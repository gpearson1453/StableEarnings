Footnotes
LEAP YEAR NIGHT ran off pace in the two path then coming down the stretch made a closing drive that allowed them to draw off from the pack mid stretch.
CANDY TRACK ran in the middle of the pack then took to the rail on the stretch to have a clear path to over take foes. CHARLIENE ran with early speed
then shuffled back slightly to the middle of the pack then on the stretch started to make a closing bid down the middle of the track. ZAPPIN ran with an even
pace at the beginning of the race then very late in the race shuffled back barely. WHISPER'S MARK ran at the back of the pack then had a mild gain mid
turn then evened out on the stretch. MI PRINCESA ran at the back of the pack then passed tired foes late stretch. SPLISH SPLASH set the early pace drew
off in the middle of the race but the pace was too much and they faded hard mid stretch. OLIVIADIDIT ran in the middle of the pack then coming down the
stretch hung slightly as they shuffled back to last. THERE WAS AN OBJECTION FROM WHISPER'S MARK ON CHARLIENE AND ZAPPIN FOR
IMPEDING FOES PATH, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE. THIS RACE IS HAND TIMED.

FEEL THE BERNING ran at the back of the pack then took the turn wide coming on to the stretch paired strides up with KEEN CAT and they drove to the
finish line, eventually getting the edge and taking the win. KEEN CAT ran in the middle of the pack then took the corner in the five path coming on the
stretch seeing FEEL THE BERNING on their outside started to make a bid and dueled for the remainder of the race, just missing the win. MR. WHO dueled
RECKONING DAY to the wire, but lost the lead with twenty yards left in the race. RECKONING DAY dueled MR. WHO to the wire as they pressed the pace
then eventually got passed on the outside just before the wire. SILVER DASH ran with an even pace throughout in third then maintained pace as the foes
on the outside advanced passed. DIXIE STREET ran with a steady pace in the middle of the pack made a slight bid coming out of the turn but it was not
enough to keep up with the leaders as they drew off. GRAY MAGICIAN ran in the middle of the pack but after the turn shuffled back slightly as the foes
passed on the outside. EAST RAND ran in the middle of the pack but the pace was too quick as it appeared as they were slowing throughout. ITS FIVE
SOMEWHERE trailed throughout the race. THIS RACE IS HAND TIMED.

BYE BYE BOBBY was settled early towards the inside, made a inside bid by the three eighths marker to vie for command, then came off the inside leaving
the turn while leading, then turned back a bid from TRUTH SEEKER despite being on the left lead and edged clear to prove best, driving. PRESIDENTIAL
was reserved early on the inside, saved ground on the turn while advancing, then finished willingly to gain the place award late. TRUTH SEEKER was off
slowly, then settled back early, shifted out and made a five wide move by the quarter pole, continued that move to loom boldly in the lane but hung late.
MINE THAT STAR was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four to five wide, made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out, bested rest.
ARHAM was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened. BIGFOOT CITY was off a step
slow, set the pace while racing removed from the rail, headed by the three eighths marker and gave way. THIS RACE IS HAND TIMED.
