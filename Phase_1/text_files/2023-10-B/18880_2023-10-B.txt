Footnotes
FOOTPRINT lacked speed in the two path, launched a rally in the five path entering the far turn, progressed quickly and swept past the leader while tucking
to the three path at the quarter pole and drew clear. TIS CHARMING laid off of the pace in the three path, gained inside of rivals into the far turn, attempted
a two wide bid for the lead along with an outer rival approaching the quarter pole, but was quickly outkicked by that one at that marker, gained place
entering the lane and was second best. TOWN HALL set the pace with a clear margin, but was overhauled with a quarter mile to go, weakened yet lasted
safely for show. TITLE CONTENDER laid off of the pace in the four path, but was outmoved by rivals on either side around the far turn and failed to
threaten. STONE HARBOR chased in the two path, weakened between horses with five sixteenths to go and was eased up through the lane. T B TWELVE
ALWAYS trailed along the inside, was done into the far turn, eased and jogged home. MIDNITE LUMBERJACK tracked in the two to three path, but
weakened between horses entering the far turn and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
FLASHY LASS trailed in the two path early on, moved out of last leaving the first turn, lacked a response to heavy urging entering the far turn, yet finally
picked up stride four wide turning for home, drove past the leading trio entering the lane, drew clear while shifting inwardly in upper stretch and held sway
from an outer pursuer late. MEDAGLIA FOREVER tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, awaited racing room from the pocket while an outer
FLASHY LASS got a jump nearing the lane, split foes three wide in upper stretch with multiple lengths to find, rallied and closed in on the clear leader in the
final furlong, attempted a late bid but was kept at bay to the wire. COLETTE'S JOY stalked in the three path and between horses, got outkicked by an outer
bidder entering the lane, then by an inner rival in upper stretch, yet kept on mildly to edge show late. SASSY WALKER vied for the lead inside of a rival, got
headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and gave way. STAGFLATION vied two wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane and
weakened between horses. MISINTENTION laid off of the pace in the three path, then along the inside around the far turn and failed to factor.
PERCEPTIVE stalked in the four path, but yielded position outside of rivals with five furlongs to go, failed to respond to urging approaching the far turn and
faded.

Footnotes
ALLEGE pressed two wide, bid at the three furlong pole, dueled through midstretch, inched a narrow margin as an outer THE REDS menaced entering the
final sixteenth and gamely held to the wire. THE REDS was off slow, stalked three wide, pursued the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, slowly grinded
closer while hanging on his left lead in the final furlong, ranged up to offer a bid at the sixteenth pole, but missed at the wire. KOUFAX set the pace inside of
a pressing rival, dueled with that one passing the three furlong pole, gamely sustained the battle after getting headed nearing midstretch, but yielded inside
the final sixteenth. DEVIL VISION lacked speed in the two path and never got involved. DERBY CODE trailed throughout.

INSIGHTFUL MISS tracked along the inside, gained inside of rivals entering the lane, tipped three wide to take aim at the the three sixteenths pole, but
shifted inwardly and bumped the leader while producing a bid at the furlong grounds, shifted out in the aftermath and edged clear. SOULFUL TARA vied two
wide, led turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, but was bumped and headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded late and narrowly
saved place at the wire. BELLE OF THE BALL laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five to six path entering upper stretch, rallied but missed
reaching place. MRS. SPEAKER laid off of the pace, gained turning for home while floating to the five path, but leveled off. MAMBA OUT lacked speed in
the four to six path and moved up. TESHIMA broke a step slow, tracked in the three to two path into the turn and gave way. LADY ROBO broke multiple
lengths slow, trailed in the two to three path and made little impact. CHANEL POINT stalked three wide but faltered between horses in upper stretch. MY
BEST DAY EVER set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed at the five sixteenths pole and caved.

ALL THAT MAGIC laid off of the pace along the inside, split foes five wide at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid leaving the furlong grounds, forged an
advantage entering the final sixteenth and inched clear. MARISSA'S LADY chased from midpack in the two path, fanned out to the six path entering upper
stretch, got outkicked by an inner foe-splitting rival at the three sixteenths pole, yet offered her own rally in pursuit of that one in the final furlong and gained
place late. GOIN' GOOD broke a step slow and took contact from an inner rival at the start, saved ground while unhurried around the turn, sustained a rail
rally to vie for place in the final furlong, but was outkicked late. CARIMBA set the pace along the inside, built a clear advantage approaching the turn,
maintained that margin into the final furlong, but was headed by an outer bidder nearing the final sixteenth and yielded late. TOP GUN GIRL stalked the
leader from the two path while inside of rivals, took aim in the three path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid, got outkicked by rivals on either side passing the
furlong grounds and chased among foes late. QUEROBIN DOURADA leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path,
swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but only offered a mild kick and failed to threaten. CURRENT CLIMATE broke a step slow, trailed into the
turn and passed tired rivals. OPENING BUZZ tracked in the four path but faltered between horses in upper stretch. MINER'S QUEEN raced forwardly in the
three path and between horses but weakened in upper stretch.

ESCAPOLOGIST rated at the rear two wide, gained four wide around the far turn to range up to the leading trio turning for home, wrestled a narrow
advantage while dueling in upper stretch, sparred with an inner pair in the late stages and just held. LEADING CONTENDER tracked two to three wide, bid
with five sixteenths to go, led as an outer rival challenged nearing the lane, got headed by that one in upper stretch yet fought on gamely, sparred between
horses in the final furlong and narrowly missed. GRAND ASPEN stalked along the inside, got outmoved by outer rival while tracking behind the leaders
around the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane while in pursuit, split foes in upper stretch to take aim inside of the top pair entering the final furlong,
offered a bid but needed more late. REDEEMER raced at the rear along the inside, lagged behind the rest around the far turn, shifted out in midstretch,
offered a late kick to close in on the top trio in the final furlong but ran out of ground before reaching contention. MOREAU set the pace along the inside,
clung to an advantage from an outer pair around the far turn, but was headed at the quarter pole and weakened. SEEKING UNITY pressed two wide, vied
between horses around the far turn but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
ROMAGNA MIA (GB) laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out four wide with five furlongs to go, inched closer before coming under strong urging
within striking range around the final turn, spun to the five path entering the lane, rallied to drive past the leader at the furlong grounds and drew clear.
TRANSIENT (GB) tracked four wide early on, moved forward into and around the second bend to press the leader two wide entering the backstretch, vied
around the far turn as outer rivals ranged up, led in the three path entering the lane, leaned inwardly while changing leads at the three sixteenths pole, but
was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded late and narrowly saved place. LOVED REIKO raced at the rear in the three path around the
first turn, saved ground around the second turn, got hung five wide around the final bend, entered the lane in the six path, offered a mild kick, gradually
gained to bid for place in the final sixteenth but missed. LOVELY PRINCESS stalked three wide, prompted between horses around the final bend, floated to
the four path entering the lane and yielded between horses. VERGARA pressed two wide, failed to sustain pressure and backed off to midpack between
rivals around the second turn, tracked three wide around the final turn, took aim between horses in upper stretch, but was subtly herded inwardly at the
three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. HENRIETTA TOPHAM set the pace along the inside, but was headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened.
PERSONAL BEST tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket, but was blocked behind rivals around the far turn, got stymied behind foes in upper
stretch, checked back to trail into the final furlong and made no impact.

AGOO tracked in the four path, floated five wide at the five sixteenths pole, ranged up four wide nearing the lane, closed in on the clear leader to bid at the
furlong grounds, forged an advantage while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. MYSTIK DAN set the pace along the inside,
shook clear entering the lane, met AGOO's challenge at the furlong grounds, was bested entering the final sixteenth and lasted for place. LINEBACKER

along the inside, was urged along in the two path around the turn, tipped to the four path in midstretch and ran on. LEGALIZE stalked along the inside,
shifted outside of the top pair at the five sixteenths pole to take aim, but failed to bid before getting outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, delayed a lead
change until the furlong grounds and gave way. ETHAN ENERGY broke slowly, raced at the rear along the inside and improved between horses in
midstretch. GOLDENTOWN raced off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. MANFREDI lacked speed along the inside, shifted three wide at the

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE MUD (IRE) tracked two wide and between horses, shifted from the four path to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to offer a late bid and
gained an advantage in the shadow of the wire. JUST A CARE (IRE) set the pace along the inside, shook clear entering the lane, maintained a clear margin
through while hanging on her left lead, drifted out slightly leaving the furlong grounds, met challenges from rivals on both sides in the late stages and got
caught. HURRICANE DEBBIE broke a step slow, pursued from midpack along the inside, chased along the rail to take aim inside of the leader in the final
furlong, but was outkicked late and needed more for place. PROUD MARY stalked along the inside and chased two wide and between horses through the
lane. FIRING BULLETS broke a step slow, trailed in the two to three path, fanned to the six path entering upper stretch, shifted inwardly at the furlong
grounds and stayed on. ALL I WANT IS YOU raced off of the pace in the four path and between horses, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and
moved up. GET TWISTED bumped the inner part of the gate while off slow, raced off of the pace in the five to seven path and failed to factor. EMPIRE OF
MY OWN lunged forward just as the gates sprung, bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four path, chased in the five path in upper stretch and
faded between horses. CORNER KICK broke half a beat slow and made little impact from the two path. JENNIFER MY LOVE pursued from midpack in the
three path and faded. D'ORO STREET took contact from an outer rival at the start, prompted from the three path and weakened between horses entering
the lane.
