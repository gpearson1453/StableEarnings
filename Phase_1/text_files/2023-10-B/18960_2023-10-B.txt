Footnotes
SOUTHERN LAD angled toward mid track while closing to early contention and stalked two deep into the first turn, challenged and took the lead two deep at
the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear toward the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling.
AKINGISALWAYSKING veered out and made contact with Stavanger leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the four path and gave chase from the half
mile pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and closed the gap through the lane. CENTRAL PRIDE raced well back off the rail the first turn, gave chase
nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the seven path and came along to take third the final strides. SPEAKERIT steadied soon after
the start and again off the heels of Southern Lad into the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then
flattened in the lane. GABRIEL'S WING was shuffled back early then hustled inside to catch up to contention, raced in the four path the far turn and
weakened in the lane. SCOOTSCOOT set the pace inside, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped
back toward the five sixteenths pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. STAVANGER was bumped leaving the gate and never factored. The Stewards
reviewed then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Southern Lad for alleged interference soon after the start, lodged by the rider of Gabrie'ls Wing.

that point, took the nod leaving the three eighths pole, drew clear toward the five sixteenths and held well under vigorous hand urging in the lane.
O'CONNER SUNSET settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and was steadily
handled to hold second. OVERLY CRITICAL stalked off the rail the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far
turn, ran evenly in the lane and was gaining on the runner-up late strides. ONE TEN raced well back saving ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. LIKEABLE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and dueled at even terms from that point, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. BRISTOL CHANNEL saved
ground.

even terms from that point, took the nod two deep leaving the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold on. ADVANCE CASH raced boxed off the heels of
Auburn Mill through the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn and finished well to duel for second.

third late. ZEN MASTER rated close off the rail the opening turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly
in the lane. AUBURN MILL took over and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested even
terms from that point, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and flattened later yards. ROYAL PAIN saved ground. MARK DID IT saved
ground well off the pace on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn, left the turn outside and flattened

Footnotes
LORD OF CORK hit the gate causing the rider to lose an iron and after recovering the iron, settled off the rail on the first turn, rallied from the three eighths
pole and surged to the lead two deep toward the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. REMYS SHOWTIME
raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead nearing the half mile pole and showed the way from there, drew clear toward the five sixteenths but was
caught approaching the quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in under steady handling and just lasted for second. CAPTAIN CREED raced two deep
the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the three path on the far turn, finished evenly and just missed second.
MINISTRY OF MAGIC raced well back inside on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the six path on the far turn then flattened later
yards. HOT FUDGE SONDE rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in range of the leaders in the four path
on the far turn but flattened in the stretch. YO VINNIE showed little response. BUDDY BUDDY showed little response after the opening quarter mile.
CHANGE YOUR LUCK rated a slim lead inside, was met nearing the half mile pole and gave close chase from that point, but dropped back approaching the
five sixteenths pole and gave way at the rail on the far turn.

MIDNIGHT REGRET stumbled to her nose leaving the gate then settled off the rail on the first turn, started a three wide bid approaching the five sixteenths
pole, took the nod in the four path toward the eighth pole and dueled clear later yards. MISS ANTIETAM closed to contention and stalked in the three path
the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms between horses midway on the far turn but was met entering the stretch and
dug in to hold second. DALLAS saved ground on the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved her position in the four path on the far turn
and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. SWEET FACTOR rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at
the rail midway on the far turn and weakened nearing mid-stretch. HOVEL rounded the opening turn off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and showed little more. WATERLOO ROSE rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole but
weakened at the rail on the far turn.
