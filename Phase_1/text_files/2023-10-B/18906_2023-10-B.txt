Footnotes
LACIE BE GOOD stalked the leaders in the early going, raced outside around both turns, took the lead around the final turn, drove clear down the stretch
and finished well. YELLOW TOPAZ pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. PACIFIC VIEW
raced evenly near the back in the beginning, showed late interest, proved no match for the top two, but got by REAUX BINA for third. REAUX BINA lacked
early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, went to the wire evenly and was oufinished for third. PETTICOAT pressed the early pace,
weakened and was no threat late. SASSY FLYER sprinted to the front, drove clear and dropped back. BABY LOCKOUT trailed throughout and showed
little.

WORLD WAR vied for the early advantage, drove clear around the final turn and was kept to the task. BIRDIE CALL raced within contention, was forwardly
placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SHE'S GONE D'WILD lacked early speed, moved up on the inside around the
final turn, made a mild bid and proved third best. BLESSED ANNA had a tight start, racing from the rear, moved up, raced within striking distance, faded and
went to the wire evenly. LOVERS NEVER SAY broke out, racing in the back and passed tired ones late. MS. CAJUN QUEEN raced in the middle of the
field, saved ground around the second turn, faded and was no threat late. SUMMERTIME BANDIT challenged on the front end in the early going, dropped
back and was outrun.

Footnotes
UNFATHOMED steadied early, racing in the back, made a steady gain, racing outside around the final turn, made a bid, racing four wide and proved the
best late. SPERLE pressed pace, came around the first turn wide, made a bid, took the lead, but was outfinished for the win. STATE OF THE UNION lacked
early speed, moved up on the inside around the final turn and was a clear third. SEEHOSS lacked early speed, gained ground, but was no rear factor.
MEAN CRUISER dueled on the front end, faded and finished evenly. SPECIAL OPERATOR raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide
and put forth an even effort. REVENIR vied for the early lead, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CAEUS IN PASADENA always
raced near the back and was outrun. SPECIAL PRYCE showed early speed, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
FRENCH COMPOSER pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear and was kept to the task. QUATERNION raced within striking distance,
came around the final turn on the outside, finished willingly and was a clear second. KID SHELLEEN raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and
was a clear third at the wire. UXMAL dueled on the front end, saved ground around the second turn and faded. DONEGAL FACTOR challenged on the front
end in the early part, racing outside around the first turn and faded. BUD WON lacked early speed, raced wide around the final turn and was never close.
HE GOTS TO GO broke out, void of early speed and was never a threat. LOOKIN AT BETTY always raced near the back and showed little. LOVE A
FIGHTER flashed early speed, dropped back and lost contact with the field.
