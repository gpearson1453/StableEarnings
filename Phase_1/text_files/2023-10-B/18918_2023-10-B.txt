work with through swift splits, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing lone threat to the outside and held on to prevail.

challenge inside the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish. STRICTLY TABOO got bumped at the start by the veering out CERRETTA and in
turn bumped NEIGH JUDE into SPLASHY knocking that rival sideways, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. CERRETTA veered out at the start bumping STRICTLY TABOO into NEIGH

then along the inside through the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. NEIGH JUDE got bumped at the start by

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED BOMBER was brought back to the paddock and had his bridle adjusted, stalked the pace on the outside in the three to four path, made a bid
leaving the backstretch, fought on gamely with the runner-up in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. DAYDREAMING BOY made light
contact with a foe just after the start, went around the turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path the
far turn, rallied outside to get the lead in the five path into upper stretch, led while battling outside the winner into the final sixteenth but was denied. BOLD
ENDEAVOR came out slightly while hustled from the start, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage with
three furlongs to run, fought under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SYSTEMIC CHANGE bumped lightly with a
rival just after the start, prompted the pace on the outside in the two to three path, took the lead with three furlongs to run, lost the advantage into upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
DUNEEN BAY three wide through the first turn, chased two then three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong closing in on the once clear leader with a pair of rivals and was up in the
final jump to the finish to prevail. KATIE'S CHECKRIDE three wide through the first turn, settled three wide in pursuit just off the pace, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, lugged inwards straightened away clear of any rival, issued a challenge through the final furlong
and missed at the end. VOLATILITY attended the leader to the outside in the two path, took over command at the five-sixteenths and was set down taking
the two path into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a trio and was nailed in the final strides by a pair.
ADDRESSABLE MARKET (IRE) broke out at the start bumping IT WASN'T ME, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. IT WASN'T ME got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. EXOTIC CAT saved ground at the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BETTER JUSTICE just off
the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole to keep pace with KATIE'S CHECKRIDE to her outside, swung three
wide into upper stretch as that rival went four wide and came inwards bumping the retreating AVALANCE IS COMIN, then stayed on one paced through to
the finish. KEEP IT SEXY broke open the stall door of the starting gate prior to the start, tracked the pace along the inside just off the top pair, had the
leader begin to stop and was caught behind her and shuffled back from inside the five-sixteenths to the quarter pole before being able to tip to the two path
around that foe straightened away, then made no late headway. RAPID MISS TAPIT just off the inside through the first turn, chased three paths off the
inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. AVALANCHE IS COMIN established the front and was rated along on the pace along the inside, yielded the front just inside
five-sixteenths to run, faded and was bumped by BETTER JUSTICE after straightened away into upper stretch along the inside route, then folded in the
stretch. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of BETTER JUSTICE alleging interference against KATIE'S CHECKRIDE in upper stretch. After review
the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
JOLLY MISS JILL broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, took
the advantage into upper stretch, shook clear while remaining on her inside lead until near the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and proved
best under steady urging. AMITY ISLAND settled at the rear of the field, was urged two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
finished willingly for the place. MAGGIE was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out into
upper stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick then just missed the place. DUFRESNE broke out at the start, was coaxed to the
front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch
and weakened. LUNA LOCA was coaxed along off the pace, raced in the two path under stronger encouragement on the turn and lacked the needed
response. EXOGEN brushed the outside of the gate at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, remained
on her left-lead in the drive and was no factor.

Footnotes
AUTUMN GLORY chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch let out for the drive, rallied in tandem with LINARITE, had that rival lean in on her in the late stages and was up in the final jumps to prevail.
LINARITE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, rallied leaning on the aforementioned
foe inside the final sixteenth and missed at the end. WEEKEND RAGS chased three wide, got let out spinning five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong from home, dug in under threat from a pair and was nailed in the final jumps to the wire. LATEST EDITION five paths off the inside
in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two and advanced in the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
taking command straightened away, got collared for the front a furlong out, ran on to the finish. BELLA PRINCIPESSA coaxed from the gate, chased three
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced. ROYAL DANCER chased along the inside,
had THREE UNIONS tuck to be directly in front from the five path to the rail near the half mile pole and got placed in tight by BERN ROSEY BERN to her
outside while being off heels of that leader, was unable to settle through until the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. ROBYN AND ELI coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered no response. CANDY MONET coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside, got forced to
steady out at the nine-sixteenths as rivals tucked in from the outside losing about a length of position to the front, tucked inside through the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the two path into upper stretch and weakened. BERN ROSEY BERN coaxed from the gate, chased four then two
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch, weakened. THREE UNIONS coaxed from the gate, showed the way
narrowly five to six paths off the inside early on, tucked all the way to the inside at the half mile pole just when getting about a length clearance forcing rivals
in tight and off heels inside that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch yielding command straightened away
and faltered.

stretch, dueled with that opponent under a drive into the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. HEARTENED went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was roused three to four wide on the far turn, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining fast near the sixteenth-pole and just
missed. RIGHT TO VOTE went two then three wide on the frrist turn, settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, rallied outside
into the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while up for the show. HOULTON went to the front, showed the way along the rail while inside of a foe,
was asked near the quarter-pole, bumped soundly with a rival in upper stretch, dueled with that foe into the final sixteenth and just missed. MARCEAU
saved ground under restraint on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, moved out while asked for his best in
upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, gained between horses into the final sixteenth and missed while in tight in traffic at the finish. LIVE TO RIDE (GB)
went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, angled from three to five wide on the far turn, gained in the stretch and improved position with
late energy. ROCKET NIGHT moved in early, was rated on the inside, came under encouragement on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. SKYLER'S
ARTEMIS tossed his head while tugging at the bit nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was rated on the outside, came under urging with
three furlongs to run, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. TEAM CAPTAIN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground
towards the rear, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. MIGHTY GLORY dropped in early, settled in the two path, was roused on the far turn, spun
four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

MURSAL seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide
into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with ICY REPLY to overthrow the leader just inside the eighth pole, seized command and was bumped a sixteenth out
and gamely prevailed at the finish. ICY REPLY four then three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat head to head and bumped with MURSAL when that rival took command a sixteenth out, fought on to the wire.
ROMAN GODDESS chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show
honors. BOSS LADY KIM coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented just inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. VAX chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. GHOSTLY
GIRL seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six
wide into upper stretch and weakened. TRY IT AGAIN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TIMBUKTU was reserved on the outside in the three to four path, came under urging near the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid into the stretch then took
the lead at the three-sixteenths, responded well under threat from the runner-up in the final furlong and held under strong urging. ONE HEADLIGHT broke
out but was corrected very quickly by the rider, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, went three then four wide on the far
turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid into the final furlong, fought outside the winner to the finish and missed. LAUREL VALLEY
was asked from the gate then taken in hand early, tugged keenly at the bit then was taken back before the first turn, raced in the two path while rated off the
pace, drafted behind horses on the far turn, waited into upper stretch, was roused inside the three-sixteenths and willingly earned the place. INDIAN
MISCHIEF was hustled from the gate then taken under a snug hold, tracked the leader while rated outside in the two path, took the advantage at the
three-eighths pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. LACHAISE bumped with an opponent at the
start, was reserved in the two to three path, raced between horses on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and gained mildly but failed to impact.
CLEAR CONSCIENCE stumbled outward at the start then bumped with a foe, was reserved on the inside, angled out four wide on the far turn, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KINGDOM ON PAWS settled on the outside while three to four wide, made a bid on the far turn, dropped back
under a drive in upper stretch and tired. GEM MINT TEN was taken in hand early then reserved on the inside, came out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. SPIRITUAL KING went to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead with three furlongs to run and gave way. DR. MARBOOZ
was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, angled in at the rear, went around the turns in the two path and was no factor.

a trio of rivals in tight briefly, showed the way through the turn and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got displaced from the front with
three-sixteenths to go and kept on to preserve the show honors. SWEET LIBERTY three wide down the backstretch, got placed in tight briefly at the
nine-sixteenths, prompted the pace along the inside through the turn and into upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. GOTHAM GRAY chased
