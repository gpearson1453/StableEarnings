Footnotes
LITTLE NI was sandwiched and slammed at the start, shifted out and got into stride and quickly advanced up to duel for the lead three wide, then made a
bid off the turn and drew off smartly while just given one left handed pop with the crop to keep his focus and was ridden out to prove much the best, sharp.
MELT WITH YOU was outrun early on the inside, saved ground on the turn and began to unwind by the five sixteenths, then angled out in the lane and
finished with good energy to get up for the place award. COLLECTED SPECIAL was away alertly and crossed over to set the early pace while in the two
path, then was confronted nearing the half mile marker by the winner, dueled with that rival on the turn on the inside, ridden along by the five sixteenths and
weakened in the drive, bested rest. SPINNING HEART broke in at the start bumping the winner, then tracked the pace four wide on the turn and then came
up empty. NOTORIOUS broke outwardly and bumped with a rival at the start, then tracked the front runners three wide on the turn and stopped. NIGHT
OUT was sandwiched at the start and bobbled between rivals and lost the rider, then walked off after the race. STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the start,
after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
LADY JEAN stalked the early pace three wide under a hard hold, made a three wide bid nearing the five sixteenths to vie for command on the outside, took
over and was clear by the quarter pole, drew off leaving the turn and then was kept to right handed crop pressure to prove much the best. KIRBY was away
in good order, settled and was taken back three wide early, between rivals by the three eighths marker, then advanced nearing the quarter pole, came five
wide into the lane and finished well to be clearly second best. JACK'S LILLY was reserved early on the outside, four wide on the turn, came six wide into the
lane and had a belated rally to best the rest. CALYPSO GHOST dueled for the early lead two wide, between rivals by the five sixteenths, came three wide
into the lane and weakened. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN chased the pace two wide and weakened. BACI was off slowly, saved ground on the turn and was not
a threat. INSIGHTFUL dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered.

EXIT RIGHT set the pace while clear and in the two path, dawdled along while in hand, drew out on the turn, then drew off in the lane to prove much the
best while being under a hammerlock hold, easily. MYSTERY MO tracked the early pace two wide, then was on the inside on the far turn, proved to be no
match for the winner while getting the nod for the place award gamely. RUNAWAY READY stumbled at the start, tracked the pace three wide, then chased
the pace on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and was outfinished for the place award. PRALINE'S CAT tracked the pace on the inside into the first
turn, then was in tight and was bumped and knocked sideways by the thirteen sixteenths and then never threatened.

margin to the wire to prove best, driving. I AM THAT I AM was rated early while two wide, advanced by the quarter pole, then angled out by the sixteenth
marker and rallied well to be gaining late, second best. GOODLUCKCHUCK was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace four wide, made a three
wide bid on the turn but flattened out the final furlong, bested rest. ZIPPER ZAPPER set a pressured pace on the inside, then vied for the lead on the inside
and weakened. GREYZER broke in the air at the start, rider lost an iron also, then got it back before entering the first turn, had a five wide pursuit on the
backstretch, thedn was four wide on the far turn and had no rally. GREAT FACES was close up on the inside early, checked while boxed on the inside on
the first turn, then tracked the pace on the backstretch and tired on the turn. PER RULING 2023-00976 FROM HISA, GREYZER WAS DISQUALIFIED
