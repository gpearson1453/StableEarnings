Footnotes
DREAM SEQ scurried along the inside to set the pace down the backstretch, then drew clear on the turn and was ridden out in the home stretch to prove
much the best in the end. ERIN MHF saved ground along the inside, then moved up to the third position leaving the backstretch, rallied in the upper stretch
bur was no match in the end. AA BURNING TEMERITY chased the pace while three wide into the turn, rallied in the upper stretch and came up empty.
FLEETS DELITE AA raced towards the back of the field while three wide, urged steadily on the turn from the two path then rallied in the upper stretch and
came up empty. PSC MADISON stalked the pace from the two path, was in a long drive on the turn before flattening out in the stretch. WMA WILD ROSES
raced in the middle of the field while five down the backstretch then rallied on the turn and came up empty in the end. WMA TORCH LIGHT settled back in
the two path throughout and was no threat. FLYINGJ JOYCE settled behind the field in the early stages of the course and was no threat in the end. RB
MAMA WINGATE chased the pace while four wide made a mild bid from the inside on the turn then gave way in the stretch. WMA DIAMOND GIRL chased
the pace while four wide in the early furlongs then faded and was no menace.
