Footnotes
TEMPUS rated in the early going, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear
late. CREATIVE CHOICE sent from the gate, set the pace inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, then stayed on when challenged at the furlong marker,
came again late, edged ahead, then was no match for the winner and held the place. SPETTACOLI (ARG) mid pack and inside, saved ground through the
turns, got through inside the leader into the stretch, edged ahead of that one inside the furlong marker, then flattened late and held the show.
TAMANRASSETT well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the
stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. YADI unhurried, angled out and moved up into the second turn, gained position three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch lugged in and had no rally. NOT YET CHARLIE was a brief factor, inside.

HUSH OF A STORM unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at
the furlong marker, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. GOODIE GOOMER well placed and off the rail, angled in and tracked the pace through
the second turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, came through, angled out, then angled inside a drifting leader, made a steady gain and lapped onto
that one late. MASON MANIA hard to rate in the early going, settled down the backstretch, moved up while angling out through the second turn, fanned
widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. PAYNTED WARRIOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway
unchallenged to the furlong marker, stayed on, then weakened late and held a share. SARANAC (FR) well placed and outside, held position on the two path

KINGPIN stalked the pace on the outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a
steady gain and edged up in the final strides. LYRICAL POET sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook
clear, then was no match late and held the place. BLUEBERRY well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, then closed well late and edged up for the show. BEACH HOLIDAY well placed and between, moved up on the two path though the turn, came
through on that path into the stretch and evened out. CITY TRIPPER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch
and flattened the final furlong. HINDENBURG unsettled in the gate, broke slightly awkwardly, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the
stretch, then angled four and five wide and could not gain. LEGIO was never involved.

TRIPLE R RATED hopped at the start, was allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady
gain and edged ahead in the final strides. WHATCHAMACALL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the
stretch, then was outfinished in a good effort. QUEEN WIGGY stalked the pace on the outside, moved to a striking position on the two path through the turn,
bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides, and held the show. NEW WAYS TO DREAM unhurried, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no raly. CAN I GET AN AMEN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside and faded late.

HENRY'S WORLD sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway without challenge, then lasted under steady pressure. MERLIN'S SONG
unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain, closed the gap on the winner late and edged for the
place. COMMODORE BARRY well placed and between, lost some position through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out late for clear
racing room, made a steady gain and missed the place, gaining the show. J W RUCKUS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn,
came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. MORE THAN GOOD well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out late. TAPSOLUTION well placed and off the rail, moved up on the two path through the turn, came
three wide into the stretch and flattened out late. LORD OF LEGENDS tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path into the stretch, made a steady gain, then weakened late.

SHAKIN IT UP LARRY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the
task. COLONEL POPPY well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed
well for the place. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY never far back, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had a mild late gain.
OUTHUSTLE tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong.
BRADITUDE stalked the pace on the outside, moved to a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
faded the final furlong. KEYSTONE HANK passed a tiring rival, inside. YANKEE HUMOR was no factor.

Footnotes
STRONG HEADED allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged
up in the final strides. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch,
angled four wide for racing room, made a steady gain and missed, finishing on equal terms with AULT. AULT tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turns, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook clear late, then was outfinished and finished on equal terms with DIGITAL
FOOTPRINT. PERCENTAGE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, then
weakened late and held a share. ARTEMUS EAGLE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch
and passed tiring rivals. GIANT PAYDAY set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then flattened the final furlong.
CLEMSON TIGER well placed and between, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final
furlong. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE well placed and outside, steadily lost ground. POLLOCK showed little.
