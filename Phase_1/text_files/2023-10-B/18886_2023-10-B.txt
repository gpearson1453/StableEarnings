Footnotes
RAPPER ZAPPER stalked near the back of the pack on the first turn, was allowed to find his stride trailing at the half mile marker, started to rally picking up
horses on the rail midway on the far turn, was full of run bursting through on the fence at the furlong pole and edged away for the win crossing the wire.
JIM'S HOPE travelled in mid-pack on the inside early on, settled into a good rhythm tucked in on the rail behind the engaged twosome at the half, was
coaxed to keep up five sixteenths out, was gaining momentum when encouraged left handed five wide to be in range of the leaders straightening out for the
drive, closed strongly late but could not get there in time. CALUSA DONNIE settled in midfield on the outside in the beginning, had a good position keeping
a close touch to the front duo on the the outside at the half, was urged to go after the pair up top with three eighths to go, loomed four wide turning for home
and was outfinished by rivals in the late stages. UNDER SURVEILLANCE took command on the rail entering the first turn, had a slim advantage while
hounded outside down the backstretch, came under a ride relinquishing the lead with three eighths to run, resurged on the inside in the two path to regain
the lead briefly at the furlong marker but could not hold off the closers in deep stretch and settled on the fringes in the end. QUIET INTENT tracked outside
into the first turn, was content to just sit off the pacesetter on the outside down the back straight, began to inch away up front three furlongs from the finish,
was headed on each side at the top of the stretch, dueled up top through the stretch and faded in the last sixteenth. GOODLUCKMATE hesitated on the
break slightly to trail in the early going, improved a position taking closer order to the leaders along the backstretch, could not make up any ground
throughout the far turn and had little to give in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SERENADE AT SEA tracked in behind racing near the inside, came out a bit turning into upper stretch before moving back nearer but off the rail, rallied
between rivals splitting foes and taking the lead seventy yards out before inching away. AMAZON FORESTER switched out after clearing the gap,
advanced outside foes four wide late up the backstretch and on the turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch, ground on steadily to get up for second but was
outfinished for the win. HEY LUIGI quickly took the lead, set the pace racing inside and hounded by an outside foe, edged clear turning into upper stretch,
drifted out a bit late and was outfinished. PREETZAH'S STAR settled off the pace about mid-pack near the rail, came out through the stretch, ran on
willingly late. SUNYANI pressed the pace from the outset racing two to three wide, had no extra. DIXIE'S FLATTER was lightly bumped at the start, settled
outside at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, ran on willingly. SEATTLE POINT raced about mid-pack four wide through the turn, went evenly.
MANETKA bumped a rival lightly then bobbled at the start, brought up the rear inside, steadied on heels past the five-sixteenths altering outside a tiring foe,
failed to menace. NO MORE SALT was among the leaders very early then pursued the leading pair from outside a foe, retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
AIM FOR THE SKY was hustled to take control quickly on the fence down the back straight, continued setting the pace uncontested up front running around
the bend, had something left in reserve turning for home and repelled the mild challenge by the runner up in mid-stretch. SHEKKY SHEBAZ was nestled on
the fence in midfield after the start, was urged getting better position on the rail entering the turn, took up the chase on the winner with five sixteenths
remaining, loomed the only threat outside at the top of the lane but was warded off by the winner in mid-stretch and comfortably bested the rest in the end.
LUV TO WIN broke out at the start, tracked three wide in the second flight down the backside, started to rally with inside rival at the quarter pole, angled
outside in the four path driving to the wire and won the show battle nearing the finish. WESTERN TROUBLE was brushed inside on the break, stalked near
the rear at the half, began to extend his stride midpoint on the turn on the rail, fought on gamely inside for third money but lost the duel nearing the wire to
settle for a minor share in the end. KAWACATOOSE pressed with runners on each side down the backstretch, was throttled down between foes seven
sixteenths to the wire, shuffled back a touch into the turn and was one paced in the drive to the finish line. LENNY K was outrun trailing down the back
straight, could not keep up losing touch running on the turn and showed some late energy to pass a tiring rival in deep stretch. HALFINTHEWRAPPER
prompted the pace three wide in the early stages, chased the frontrunning winner but to no avail through the turn and retreated between horses in upper
stretch.

MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU settled off the pace, raced inside just off the rail through the turn, was blocked twice in upper- to mid-stretch while taken hold of and
altered out, finally found room five wide by mid-stretch, edged past in the final sixteenth. BATTLE STRIKE stalked from between runners in the second flight
two to three wide on the turn, moved out four to five wide leaving the turn, struck the lead about the three-sixteenths while drifting in just a bit, led till late,
was second best. GUNS N' ROJAS settled off the pace, entered the turn three deep, moved out five wide by the end of that bend beginning to pick it up,
altered outside a foe seven wide in upper stretch, kept on late. HALL OF DREAMS tracked in behind the second flight inside runners but off the fence,
moved out three to four wide at the top of the stretch, needed more. MOON LANDING got away well and had the early lead, shifted in and pressed the new
leader two to three deep, took a brief lead about the quarter pole exchanging a light brush with the tiring pacesetter, was soon overtaken and outkicked.
TIBURON raced mid-pack four wide through the turn, swung out seven deep turning for home, drifted in a bit, evened out. SAMMY STONE settled off the
pace, raced near the inside and went evenly. FANORE (IRE) moved quickly to the lead, set the pace inside facing pressure, was overtaken at the top of the
stretch while drifting in and out a bit and brushing a rival, tired. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE got away several lengths slowly, switched out and moved forward
some four wide entering the turn, fanned seven wide, failed to menace. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE stalked from outside four to five wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
MACLEAN'S POSSE took control right from the start, set the fractions while in hand with no one around to apply any pressure running around the turn and
was finally turned loose at the eighth pole and cruised home for the impressive victory. SCOOT DADDY was unhurried trailing inside down the backstretch,
started to pick up runners three wide three furlongs out, continued the sustained run in the four path straightening out for the drive and closed in to be a
distant second at the finish. FORESTER'S FORTUNE stalked three wide down the backstretch outside foes, cruised around runners three wide midway on
the turn, had to wait behind rivals in the three path entering the stretch, finally angled out five wide with an eighth remaining and finished up passing tired
foes to garner third money in the end. COTTON tracked the frontrunner down the backside, chased throughout the turn, tried, but could not reel in the
winner who had it all his own way through the race and evened out in the final furlong for a small piece of the prize at the wire. THE GREAT OZ broke
outwards brushing fellow runner at the start, was nestled just behind the winner on the rail at the half, was roused on the fence midturn but could not close
the gap on the leader, ran in the two path turning for home to be in range if good enough, could not find more late and levelled off at the furlong pole. ARMS
was situated in mid-pack outside foes down the backside, came under a ride between runners three furlongs from the wire making little impression on the
turn and failed to menace on the fence down the lane. ASYOUBELIEVE broke inwards brushing rival at the start, stalked in the two path inside down the
backstretch, could not keep pace with horses running around the bend and had little give in the stretch run.

PERFECT CRIME stalked from outside mid-pack just off the leaders racing mostly two to three wide, moved to challenge in upper stretch, took the lead past
the eighth pole, edged away and held. MASON'S GAMBLE was well-placed heading to the first turn but taken hold and eased back off the leaders tucking in
behind, saved ground while biding time dropping back a bit on the far turn, advanced leaving that bend into upper stretch, came out three wide and
continued to gain steadily to get up for second. TOWN CRUISE pressed two to three wide early then took the lead to force the pace up the backstretch,
raced nearer the inside in the clear on the far turn, was overtaken in mid-stretch, kept on gamely but lost place late. DUN DRUM was urged forward from the
break to take the early lead, dropped back off the leader early up the backstretch, stalked that one while switching out, came into upper stretch four wide,
kicked on evenly. LAC MACAZA settled inside at the back, swung seven wide into upper stretch, needed more. BANFF raced between two to three wide at
the back early, swung six wide turning for home, needed more. PHILIP MY DEAR was reluctant to load, moved forward three to four wide up the
backstretch, flattened out.

Footnotes
HUNT MASTER took control right from the start, was unopposed up front setting a lively pace, asked for more in mid-stretch, quickly found another gear and
held safe easily at the finish. CAUSIN' MAYHEM settled in the third flight on the outside in the early going, started to mount a rally four wide at the quarter
pole, posed the only threat straightening out for the drive and chased the winner home but was a non threatening second best on this day. U S ARMY
CORPS stalked three deep near the back of the pack, began to pick up rivals three wide with three eighths to run, angled outside continuing to rally in the
seven path in mid-stretch and closed in to be a clear third at the finish. PROVEN STRATEGIES stalked outside in the middle of the pack, improved around
runners in midturn, was in the mix of things five wide driving to the finish and ran on well to hold for a minor role crossing the line. HALLIE'S HERO watched
the frontrunner in the two path down the back straight, settled in the third flight on the rail at the half, angled to be four wide in range at the top of the stretch,
drifted inwards driving to the wire in mid-stretch and ran on willingly in the late stages of the race. QUITE READY travelled on the rail part of the quartet
tracking the winner down the backside, was shuffled back some on the fence at the five eighths marker, made little impact in midfield on the turn and
finished with intent inside in the final furlong. CLASSY WHISPER stalked close to the rear in the early stages, made no impression inside running on the
turn, angled out widest in the eight path in upper stretch and could not get into contention down the lane. FORESTER HUMOR was off a bit slow trailing
down the back straight, co-trailed on the outside running around the oval, was floated out by the inside rival straightening out for home, angled in to the four
path in upper stretch and passed tired runners late. MONET NEVER (IRE) stalked near the rear on the rail, co-trailed on the inside running around the bend,
swung out in the seven path for the drive, shifted inwards in upper stretch but offered little down the lane. SILENT MIRACLE tracked the winner in the three
path between foes down the back straight, chased through the turn on the rail but could not close the gap on the leader and gave way in the two path at the
furlong marker. BEAU GUEST was part of the foursome tracking the winner down the stretch running four deep outside, chased throughout the turn and
wilted between horses in three path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FASHIONABLY FAB lightly bumped a rival at the start, pressed the pacesetter from outside, put a very short head in front in upper stretch, dueled to the
wire finding a stern opponent, got the nod. BREATHING FIRE moved to the lead inside, set the pace facing pressure, was headed in upper stretch, dueled
to the wire fighting on gamely but lost the nod. TALK TO YA LATER settled outside at the back four wide, began to pick it up only late on the far turn, fanned
seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on well to gain show honors. TAQUANYAH was forwardly-positioned in behind the leaders racing between foes three
to four wide, kept on evenly in the drive. MY GIRL SKY settled at the back between runners two to three wide, improved willingly in the lane. PLEASURE'S
GOLD was lightly bumped at the start, settled off the pace inside but just off the fence, lacked the needed late kick. HELLO FRIENDS bumped with a rival
then was squeezed back at the start, settled at the rear, began to swing out while advancing late on the far turn, came to the top of the stretch ten deep,
needed more. TRADING BAY was lightly bumped at the break, came in and moved forward racing just off the leading pair three to four wide, weakened in
the stretch. STREGA was forced four to five wide outside foes on the first turn while gaining forward position, stalked from outside the second flight, faded in
the stretch. GAMBLE'S SILVER saved ground inside racing at the back, failed to menace.

Footnotes
TRUE TEMPER seized control from the beginning, set the pace while mildly pressured around the turn, was headed outside at the top of the lane, had
something left and stubbornly kept on the prevail at the wire. CITY FEVER was tucked behind the winner on the rail in the early stages, slipped up the fence
moving into second at the quarter pole, shifted out three wide bidding for the lead in upper stretch, determinedly ran to the wire but just could not get by late.
SOUPED UP stalked near the back on the rail in the beginning, waited patiently behind runners on the fence through the turn, advanced on the rail in upper
stretch and put in a good late finish to win the battle for third. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI was allowed to settle trailing by many down the backside, started to
get into stride closing strongly on the field midpoint on the turn, circled around foes to be in with a chance eight wide driving to the finish and closed to settle
on the fringes in the end. DERIVATIVE prompted inside along the backstretch, chased the pacesetting winner inside on the turn, battled four wide between
horses in the hunt at the top of the lane but faded late and could not hold for a small share in deep stretch. ONE MORE BREW chased between runners in
the three path running through the turn, was in the mix five wide turning for home and faltered in mid-stretch. KING ELVIS stalked near the rear on the
outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden between foes midway on the turn, could not make any headway and yielded in upper stretch. MESA SPIRIT
bore out on the start, tracked the frontrunner four wide outside rivals into the turn, angled out seven wide for the drive to the wire and weakened at the
furlong marker. NINETYFOUR EXPOS broke with the field to begin, could not match strides with others, losing positioning at the half, offered little run
around the turn, emptied out in upper stretch and was not asked in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PARK PLACE broke sharply, sped clear, set the pace inside, drew away in the stretch when asked. LEGAL CATCH stalked from outside mid-pack, swung
six wide, gained the place. ALPHA MEISTER broke a step slowly, settled at the back, went two to three wide on the turn, came out a bit for the drive, rallied
between runners late exchanging minor contact but got up for show. ROYAL QUALITY was forwardly-positioned early, steadied slightly as the leader
crossed in, tracked from in behind two to three wide, exchanged a light bump late, was outkicked for the placings. TOWN'S WARRIOR was
forwardly-positioned stalking three to four wide on the turn, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch, was outkicked. THE NEW MAYBE was up close early, forced in a
bit and ducked further clearing the gap, needed more late. ITS JUST MONEY broke a step slowly, switched out racing off the rail up the backstretch mostly
two wide, kept on evenly in behind foes. DARE TO BE KING raced off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to menace. MIDNIGHT
TEMPESTA settled at the rear, swung eight wide, was never near enough to threaten. PROUD RONIN went four to five wide on the turn, fanned seven wide
into upper stretch, made no bid. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ROYAL QUALITY AGAINST ALPHA MEISTER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
