Footnotes
COMISKEY PARK stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path, slowly closed in on those sparring rivals in the final furlong, ranged up to them to
bid entering the final sixteenth and edged an advantage late. VULCAN was hustled forward to engage the leader from the outside early on, dueled two wide
with a narrow advantage around the turn, clung to that margin vie a long duel into the final furlong, inched ahead as an outer rival menaced entering the final
sixteenth, but was outkicked late. THEALLIGATORHUNTER dueled inside of a rival while slightly headed around the turn, sustained the long battle while
hanging on his left lead into midstretch, changed over inside the final furlong but yielded in the final sixteenth. CALL ME MIDNIGHT raced at the rear along
the inside, gained two wide and between horses turning for home, then closed in on the leaders willingly through the final furlong. MAC DADDY TOO raced
at the rear while kept in the five path by the loose horse around the turn, got carried out to the ten path by that rival entering the lane and failed to factor.
JOHNNY UNLEASHED chased along the inside and faded around the turn. COLD AS HELL stumbled at the start and lost his rider, then walked off.

them turning for home, loomed a danger while bidding entering the lane, led in upper stretch, drove clear entering midstretch and held sway safely late.
FASTA LAVISTA BABY was jostled between horses and steadied back early on, pursued the main group from the two to three path around the bend, tipped
to the six path entering the lane split foes in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole and slowly narrowed the leader's margin late.
PLEASINGLY bumped with an outer rival at the start, vied two wide and between horses, got outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, kept on
thereafter but lost place a sixteenth from home. DANCING NANCY bumped with an inner rival in the early stages, tracked three wide, took the turn in the
four path, got floated five wide while getting outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, lost position in the six path entering the lane, yet kept on for
a minor share. WRECK IT RUBY raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, shifted to the six, then eight, path in upper stretch and moved
up. LOVEYA LOVEYA MORE bumped with an inner foe leaving the gates, prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, sparred between horses
entering the lane but weakened in upper stretch. THIRSTY ACCOUNTANT chased along the inside and gave way. LINDSEY raced off of the pace in the
four path and failed to menace. WIND CHASIN set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, dueled with them around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
RED SUN DRESS propped slightly a stride after the start, trailed in the two path, shifted out in midstretch and made little impact. REDHEADEDSTRANGER

Footnotes
BOURBON FEVER vied two wide, led turning for home, drove clear in the three path in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and
widened his margin. SPANISH DOUBLOON tracked in the three path, tipped to the five path entering the lane to split foes in upper stretch, progressed to
produce a bid for place in midstretch and inched away from inner rivals in the final furlong to secure that position. SOLEVO was urged along in midpack
along the inside, split foes two wide in midstretch to offer a bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay by an outer rival. BACK TO REALITY
stalked outside of the top pair, floated to the four path entering the lane, vied for place between horses while hanging on his left lead coming to midstretch,
lugged inwardly a touch at the furlong grounds and yielded soon after. THE BIG MOZZ laid off of the pace in the two path, chased along the rail in upper
stretch, shifted ground outwardly at the furlong grounds and ran on between rivals late. COLONEL BARTON raced off of the pace in the three to four path,
swung to the seven path entering the lane and moved up. MR. COMMANDER vied inside of the eventual winner, got headed at the five sixteenths pole and
weakened. GOD OF WINE trailed in the three path and failed to factor. SHOCKWAVE pursued from midpack, gained four wide and outside of rivals turning
for home, but flattened out while floating to the six path entering the lane. CHARTED bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, failed
to sustain midpack position with nine sixteenths to go, dropped back while repeatedly steadying into the turn, weakened to trail approaching the five
sixteenths pole and was outrun thereafter. KINGMAKER exchanged contact with an inner rival at the start, chased in the two path into the turn, then
weakened between horses in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
OEUVRE tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to take aim outside of the top pair in upper stretch, bid and drove clear entering the final furlong,
veered outwardly many paths from a left handed crop in the final furlong, yet held sway after being straightened. SWEET DANI GIRL stalked two wide, bid
for the lead turning for home, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder nearing the final furlong, kept on as that rival lugged badly in
the final furlong, but failed to produce a re-bid while maintaining place from an inner foe. DO YOU LOVE ME set the pace along the inside, met SWEET
DANI GIRL's challenge turning for home, dug in a sparred with that rival through upper stretch, but offered little resistance to OEUVRE's bid nearing the
furlong grounds and gradually yielded place. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) trailed in the two path under snug restraint around the first turn, improved past an outer
rival while entering the lane in the four path and failed to threaten the top trio thereafter. BRAGANZA tracked three wide but gave way in the four to five path
nearing the lane.

DENIM AND PEARLS vied along the inside while headed by her outer dueling counterpart around the turn, gained an advantage entering the lane, drew
clear in the two path in upper stretch, shifted outwardly while meeting outer challenges entering the final sixteenth, got caught by her widest challenger at
the wire but prevailed via a head-bob. SWEET GAL OF MINE prompted between the top pair early, backed off and stalked two wide and among rivals into
the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied in the final furlong to offer a late bid, but missed via a head-bob. CLEOPATRA SELENE bumped an
inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three to four path into the turn, sustained a grinding charge to slowly gain on the clear leader in the final
furlong, bid as that one drifted entering the final sixteenth, sparred between foes as an outer rival joined the fray coming to the wire but missed. IRINA'S
CHARM broke inwardly, chased along the inside, yielded turning for home, yet regained stride along the rail in the final furlong, attempted to offer a late bid
inside of the leaders but needed more. BEDAZZLE 'EM veered in while off slow at the start, shifted out and climbed leaving the chute, surpassed rivals but
raced off of the pace in the four path into the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and stayed on. AUNT FANNIE lacked speed in the two path,
gradually shifted outwardly at the furlong grounds and improved position. SUMMERINTAHOE vied three to two wide into the turn, led narrowly outside of the
eventual winner around the bend, relinquished the advantage to that one entering the lane, yielded in the three path in upper stretch and weakened
between horses. SHEZTHEFACTOR hopped slightly at the start, stalked forwardly in the four to three path, but was outmoved by an outer rival entering the
lane, chased between horses and gave way. LITTLE JAMIE lacked speed in the four to five path and made little impact. MARCO SUNSET pursued from
midpack along the inside, paused behind a rival turning for home but came up empty thereafter. BEST OF ALL was a bit tough to load, then got floated
inwardly by an outer rival at the start, lagged well behind around the turn and cut the gap on the rest in the final furlong. MAXISUPERFLY was bumped by
an outer rival at the start and got outrun along the inside.

RAISE CAIN stalked the leading trio from the inside into the turn, tipped outside of them at the five sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid in the six path and
outside of a leading DR. VENKMAN entering the lane, gamely sparred neck-and-neck through the final furlong and prevailed. DR. VENKMAN prompted
three wide while perched outside of the top pair, led in hand turning for home, tipped to the five path entering the lane as an outer RAISE CAIN loomed a
danger, dueled with that one into the final furlong, gamely battled through the late stages but got outfinished. POST TIME trailed the short field around the
turn, pursued in hand in the four to three path entering the lane, moved up once set down between horses in uppers stretch, shifted to the five path at the
furlong grounds, gained show entering the final sixteenth and slowly gained on the leading pair late. LOYAL COMPANY tracked two wide, got floated to the
five, then six, path nearing the lane and lacked a rally. VERIFYING vied inside of pair of rivals, got headed turning for home and yielded in upper stretch.
CONFIDENCE GAME vied two wide and between horses, but yielded entering the lane and weakened.

SINFILTRE pursued from midpack along the inside, loomed a large danger while gaining behind the leaders turning for home, paused behind them while
entering the lane in the three path, tipped four wide in upper stretch, ranged up to bid while flopping back to her left lead at the furlong grounds and drove
clear. SEISAI (IRE) stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the top pair turning for home, bid three wide entering the lane, wrestled a brief advantage at
the furlong grounds but was outkicked by the eventual winner leaving that marker and safely maintained place. WALKATHON trailed in the two path, picked
up stride in the three path around the far turn, swung to the five path entering the lane and rallied widest to edge show in the final sixteenth. NOT SO
CLOSE set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge around the far turn, clung to an advantage while sparring with a pair of outer rivals in upper
stretch, but was headed entering the final furlong and gave way. HAUGHTY pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, then between horses entering the
lane but yielded in midstretch. SISTER LOU ANN pursued from midpack two wide and lacked a bid. STRONG ODOR tracked in the three path and faded in
the four path with five sixteenths to go. BALI BELLE saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. FAST AND FEMININE lacked speed in the three to four
path and was outrun around the far turn.

Footnotes
VAHVA bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, was coaxed along in pursuit around the turn, shifted out to the four path entering the
lane to take aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, slowly grinded away at that one's margin to bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged past in the
closing stages. ALVA STARR set the pace along the inside, showed the way with a comfortable margin into the turn, kicked away once set down entering
the lane in the three path, held sway from an outer chaser through midstretch, but met that foe's challenge at the sixteenth pole and was bested late.
DAZZLING BLUE bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide, floated to the six path entering the lane, gained show at the three sixteenths pole,
then held that positioin from an outer bidder late. APPLE PICKER was simultaneously bumped by rivals on either side at the start, trailed in the two to three
path, then ran on in the final sixteenth to miss reaching show. LILY POO broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the two path, lacked a response to
urging along the inside around the turn and failed to rally. LADY RADLER stalked forwardly two wide and between horses but gave way in upper stretch.
ANCIENT PEACE prompted three wide, pressed around the turn but yielded between horses entering the lane in the five path.

Footnotes
ZOOMBIE set the pace, built a clear margin into the turn and held sway. WILLTORUN leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, stalked along the inside,
took aim off of the fence nearing the lane, but lacked a bid, sparred with an outer rival for place and prevailed. AXTHELM took contact from an outer rival at
the start, pressed two wide and between horses, got floated to the four path by an inner foe nearing the lane, dueled with that one for place through
midstretch but yielded late. B D VALESKI bumped with an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, fanned six wide entering the lane
and rallied. GREGORY'S PRIDE laid off of the pace along the inside, then stayed on in the two path and between horses but failed to menace. LEGAL
ATTACK (GB) broke a step slow while taking contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses but gave way. ZATIP tracked
three wide and between horses and faded. FAUCI trailed two wide, shifted out in midstretch and made little impact. SAMBURU (GB) stalked three wide, but
gave way in the five path turning for home and weakened between horses. OF THE MOMENT bounced off an outer rival into an inner foe at the start,
pursued from midpack four wide, fanned seven wide into the lane and tired.
