SILKSTONE vied three wide in the opening stages, emerged the leader into the backstretch, repelled a bid at the head of the stretch, and kicked clear under
mild handling. MORNING RAIN vied between foes entering the first turn, cut the corner into the backstretch, shifted out to the two path tracking the leader,
and was no match for the winner late. BROKEN PROMISES trailed the field early, went in pursuit of the leaders but was unable to get near. KULSUM vied
inside, checked when leaving the opening turn, and yielded. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry in the opening turn and
after review determined that MORNING RAIN caused interference to KULSUM. MORNING RAIN was disqualified from second and placed fourth for
interference.

BABS DELIGHT tracked the pace in the three path, pressed the issue nearing the final turn, inched clear and won driving. WITT'S TENNY TEN emerged
the leader into the backstretch, responded to a challenge from BABS DELIGHT, and was out-finished. STOLEN JEWEL vied three to four wide into the
opening turn, prompted action nearing the far turn, hung in the final turn, and finished with good energy for show. TAKE CHARGE GWEN tracked inside
early, loomed boldly at the head of the stretch, and weakened late. CAPA BELLA broke awkwardly, was gapped, and unable to recover ground from the
poor start.

DOUSEAWHATISEA broke alertly then quickly secured a satisfactory lead, continued on with good margins, was showing signs of tiring but had enough
cushion late. FOUR O SIX CREED allowed to settle early, asked to quicken from along the rail in the far turn, was gaining late but didn't have enough
ground, and finished up clearly second-best. KAUAI DAN raced four wide into the opening turn, and improved position late. READYTOTAPNSING fractious
in the gate, tracked the eventual winner while three wide, and had nothing left in reserve. SAXON SAGA chased four to five wide early and tired.

Footnotes
GWIZZ showed early speed then stalked the early pace, moved up alongside MILITARY SASS to challenge the front, dueled through the stretch, dug in the
final yards, and inched clear. MILITARY SASS set a pressured pace, dueled inside of GWIZZ through the stretch, and was narrowly out-finished.
DARKCLOUDOFSMOKE trailed the field throughout and closed late to earn show honors. HERE'S LEXIE reserved off the early pacesetters, was no match
for the leaders through the stretch and was edged out late for third. SHES A COOL CAT showed a mild interest late. BONNIE AND MOE lacked early speed
and was outrun. GOTTALOVETHATGIRL outrun throughout.

Footnotes
THE ITALIAN MAN tracked from the second flight while four wide, exchanged bumps with LAHUN in the backstretch, rallied five to six wide at the head of
the lane, match strides with LAHUN through the drive, and narrowly prevailed. LAHUN returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment, reserved off the early
pacesetters, exchanged bumps inside of THE ITALIAN MAN, drove three to four wide in the final turn, dueled in the stretch and was out-finished. AMEER
trailed the field early, bid inside then lacked running room into the stretch, and improved late to score show. DADDY'S PEPPER prompted the early pace
outside of FAVORITE LIGHT, flattened in stretch then was caught. BOBS BUDDY went three to four wide into the opening turn, gained closer order in the
final turn, and passed tiring rival. FAVORITE LIGHT returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment, set a pressured pace, was overtaken nearing the final
turn and wilted abruptly. CAROSWAY showed little.
