Footnotes
CHARMING WAY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way from the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and held clear to the wire. TOO MANY KISSES tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming
around the bend and chased the winner home in the lane. WILL OR WON'T pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the two path and kept on to the finish but was outmatched by the top two. BELLA PALOMA raced off the pace on the inside through
the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. APROPOS bumped with the horse to his inside
at the start, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and never threatened.
MADEMOISELLEJACKIE stumbled badly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the
bend and weakened in the final furlong. ISABELLA'S GLORY trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid.
SIX THE HARD WAY stalked the leader between horses through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the three path and tired from there.
