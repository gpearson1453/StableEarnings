COUNTRYGIRL PRIDE stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and slowly edged clear in the furlong grounds under left
handed crop urging to prove best, driving. PINK SUNSET set a pressured pace along the inside, shook clear on the turn, then was headed by the winner by
the furlong marker and was out-kicked by that rival while fighting on to the wire, clearly second best. MAKE MINE A STELLA pressed the early pace three
wide, dropped back on the turn and came four wide into the lane, weakened, bested rest. RAIN OF BLESSING chased the early pace, three wide on the
turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. HOME TOWN FAV tracked the early pace two wide, fell back on the turn towards the inside and stopped.

FAST MULE prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to go on even terms for command on the far turn, then took over and drew off, then
remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. MY CAJUN LADY was well rated early on the inside, saved ground to the far turn, eased out leaving the
five sixteenths and came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to be clearly second best. MY JO JO was reserved early, angled out in the lane and
was up for the show award. PUSH set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed on the far turn by the winner, angled off the inside in the lane and
weakened, lost show award late. ALWAYS FORWARD tracked the early pace in between rivals, then settled on the inside on the far turn, and offered some
mild late gain on the inside. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was reserved early, made a five wide middle move on the backstretch to be in range by the half mile
marker, chased the pace four wide on the far turn and had no rally. CIRCLE OF COURAGE chased the early pace three wide, then was four to five wide on
the far turn and tired. HARPER'S DO prompted the pace four wide on the first turn, then stalked the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
TAPORICAL was off slowly, then was four wide by the half mile marker, advanced on the turn and made a three wide move by the quarter pole, then drew
off to prove much the best, driving. MITHRIDATES bobbled at the start, then rushed up to set the pace while racing in the two path, then was headed by the
winner by the quarter pole, proved to be no match for that rival while staying on for the place award. CHARLIE TOUGH stalked the pace three wide, then
was between rivals by the five sixteenths, had no kick in the lane and just missed the place award. CLEVER TIGER was well placed along the inside,
steadied slightly leaving the three eighths marker, swung out five wide leaving the turn and faded. MALIBU BRAD was rated three wide early, dropped to the
inside by the quarter pole and had no response.

Footnotes
LINAHASPECSHOES was rated early from between rivals, dropped to the inside on the turn, was boxed by the quarter pole, swung out four wide leaving
the turn and made a bid, drew off smartly to prove much the best, driving. SANSA ARIEL dueled for the lead two wide, made a bid leaving the turn but could
not go with the winner in the furlong grounds while staying on to be clearly second best. DANCE STEP stalked the pace four wide and made a five wide bid
off the turn but flattened out, bested rest. RATIONALMILLENNIAL was off a step slow, settled three wide on the turn, improved position late to get the last
spot in the superfecta. PRUSSIAN BLUE was off a step slow, saved ground throughout and passed the tiring rivals. ELLIE VICTORINA rushed up the inside
to duel for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. CHECKCASHINGCONNIE tracked the pace and was five wide on the turn came six wide into
the lane and came up empty. MERGER OF EQUALS lacked a rally. R LOVE ON THE RUN was away alertly to lead for the first furlong while in the three
path, then prompted the pace three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and was empty. MY TRUE PASSION tracked the pace six wide and was
extremely wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
HAY CHIEF was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn, closed full of run on the outside to get up late and win going away late,
driving. RANSEUR set the pace while clear, drew out on the turn and was still clear by the furlong marker, but was caught in deep stretch, second best.
STEADY JOHN was off a step slow, settled four to five wide on the backstretch, made a three wide move on the far turn to move into contention, but
flattened out, bested rest. THAT SUN OF A GUN tracked the pace along the inside and weakened. DEPUTY CONNECT chased the pace four wide, ridden
along on the far turn and weakened. ENTRUST was bumped at the start, between rivals into the first turn while being a little tough to handle, then settled
and tracked the pace three wide and tired.
