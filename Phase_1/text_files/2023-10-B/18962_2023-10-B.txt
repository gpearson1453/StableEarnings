BORN FLAWLESS stalked inside of the leader early on, switched out and pressed from the three path into the turn, bid before gaining an advantage at the
five sixteenths pole as an outer rival pressed, then drove clear in upper stretch and held sway late. JEWELSTOWN stalked the top pair from the four path
around the turn, ranged up turning for home, gained place nearing the lane but failed to keep pace with the new leader in upper stretch and chased him
home. BRUCE BANNER raced off of the pace in the two path, moved up turning for home and ran on. COX CANYON trailed in the two path, fanned out to
the five path in upper stretch and improved. CITY OF CLOUDS chased four wide, yielded around the turn and made little impact. DREAMING OF SMARTY
showed the way and crossed over to the two path approaching the turn before feeling outer pressure into it, got headed while inside of a pair of bidders with
five sixteenths to go and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
BUFFOON (FR) stalked three wide, chased the top pair from the two path and under urging around the far turn, drifted out to the five path entering the lane,
sustained a charge to gain an advantage from inner rivals at the furlong grounds and drove clear. RAGUEL hopped slightly at the start, tracked along the
inside, saved ground around the bends, closed in along with an outer rival to offer a bid two wide and between horses at the furlong grounds, but failed to
keep pace with the outer leader entering the final sixteenth and held place. LAT LONG was keen between horses nearing the first turn, settled in midpack
along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, offered a grinding charge to bid for the lead three wide and between horses entering the final furlong, but
only managed to chase thereafter and was denied place. FORT THOMAS laid off of the pace in the two to four paths, floated seven wide entering the lane,
ran on mildly and drifted inwardly in the final sixteenth. DISATTACHED saved ground far back, rallied in the three path and between horses before pausing
briefly in midstretch, sustained progress splitting rivals three at the sixteenth pole and missed reaching place between horses. TRANSCENDENTAL pursued
from midpack two wide and between horses, laid further back around the far turn, stayed on to split foes at the sixteenth pole and missed reaching a minor
share. PUBLIUS pursued from midpack three wide, tracked the leading pair around the far turn, but was floated to the six path by the eventual winner
entering the lane and gave way. COASTAL BRINK vied two wide, led in the three path entering the lane, but drifted out while hanging on his left in upper
stretch and faltered between bidders at the furlong grounds. BATTLE OF DOVER bobbled a bit at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to two path and
made little impact. ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT vied along the inside, got headed turning for home and weakened entering the final furlong. CALON LAN broke
a step slow and was put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, then trailed and was outrun.

Footnotes
DUBYUHNELL pressed two wide and between horses early on, bid outside of the leader turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane, gamely
maintained that margin through midstretch, inched ahead in the final sixteenth and lasted from an outer on-charging bidder late. DENINGTON trailed in the
two path, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to gain show in midstretch, yet sustained a good late kick to close in on the top pair in the final sixteenth,
but only managed to reach place at the wire while running out of ground to reel in the leader. PROMISE ME A RIDE set the pace along the inside, met an
outer challenge turning for home, dueled while getting headed entering the lane, sustained the battle through midstretch, but yielded grudgingly in the final
sixteenth and got caught at the wire for place. BROMLEY stalked three wide, chased under urging turning for home but yielded to the leaders in upper
stretch. KING ICE broke half a beat slow, raced off of the pace three to four wide, but was outmoved by an outer rival entering the lane and made little
impact. TAHOE RUN tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. CURLY JACK laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued between
horses around the far turn and faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HOWL pressed four to three wide into the turn, vied in the four path while in hand turning for home, gained an advantage via her own power in upper
stretch, then drew off when let out a notch at the furlong grounds and won with plenty left. BOURBON TO BLAME prompted two wide and between horses,
chased turning for home and kept on among foes to edge place at the sixteenth pole. KID'S LAST LAUGH pursued from midpack outside of rivals, gained in
the five path around the bend to be within striking distance entering the lane, chased the clearing leader in the final furlong, vied for place but was kept at
bay. RUBIA tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch, tipped out in the final furlong and edged fourth. MUSICAL PRAYER set the pace in the two
path inside of prompting foes into the turn, got headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, proved no match at the furlong grounds and weakened.
FOXFIRE bumped the gate upon leaving it, raced off of the pace along the inside, subtly dropped back around the bend, shifted out in upper stretch and
moved up. A DOLLAR A DAY broke a step slow and failed to menace in the three path. INSENSITIVE raced off of the pace in the five path and failed to
factor. RARE AFFAIR was off a step slow, trailed in the three path and never got involved. NIKKI M P brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, pursued
from the two path and faded. CRUSHED ICE lacked speed three wide and weakened. ADIVA raced forwardly three wide and between horses, but
weakened two wide around the turn.

Footnotes
KIGALI tugged to the front moving through the lane for the first turn, set the pace in the two path, opened up a wider margin with nine sixteenths to go,
gradually padded his margin around the far turn, but began to tire entering the final furlong, weakened as a pair of outer rivals quickly closed in inside the
final sixteenth yet narrowly found the wire in time. HILLIARD laid off of the pace three wide, took closer order approaching the far turn, rallied between rivals
in upper stretch, sustained progress along with an outer rival in the final furlong to attempt a late bid, but just came up short. CLEVER THOUGHT broke a
step slow, settled well back in the two path, gained three wide approaching the far turn, sustained progress three to four wide around the far turn, rallied
along with an inner rival to close in on the clear leader in the late stages, but ran out of ground. SPIRIT MAKER was a bit antsy awaiting the start, pulled
under a tight hold while off of the pace into and around the first turn, pursued three wide around the far turn, fanned five wide entering upper stretch and ran
on. TRULY QUALITY raced off of the pace two wide and moved up late. OUR DREAM RYE'D pursued form midpack two wide, emerged from between
horses to gain show passing the three furlong pole, but altered course inwardly around traffic while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and
flattened out. BOCO stalked three to two wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn and weakened between horses in midstretch. BRIGHT SPARK
broke a step slow, lagged behind, moved out of last in the four path around the far turn and made little impact. HORACE MANN tracked in the two path and
faded along the inside around the far turn. JUST A PHOTO pursued from midpack along the inside but was done with a half mile to go. FLEET OF HOOF
stalked inside and weakened around the far turn.

GLENGARRY stalked two wide, pressed the leader around the turn, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong
grounds and fended off an outer bidder late. NORMANDY HERO tracked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, sustained a grinding advance
in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, closed in to attempt a bid in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. VALENTINE CANDY pursued from
midpack in the three path, drifted four wide entering the lane and ran on to edge show at the sixteenth pole. PATRIOT SPIRIT raced off of the pace in the
two path while keen under snug restraint into the turn and stayed on mildly. COWES set the pace, felt pressure from the eventual winner around the turn,
got headed in upper stretch and weakened. MAYCOCKS BAY hopped at the start, raced at the rear in the three path and between horses, checked back at
the half mile pole, trailed around the turn and made little impact. SWEET SODDY J tracked from off of the pace in the four path and outside of rivals, but
faded.

RUNAWAY STORM broke slowly, settled towards the rear in the three path, crept closer approaching the far turn, progressed in the five path around that
bend to bid in the four path and outside of the top pair at the five sixteenths pole, chased an inner rival in upper stretch before vying into the final furlong,
wrestled a narrow margin in the final sixteenth as an outer rival joined the duel and prevailed in a tight photo. TALK OF THE NATION took contact from an
outer rival soon after the start, stalked two wide and between horses under snug restraint, pursued behind the leaders and from the three path around the
far turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to gradually close in on the top pair entering the final sixteenth, bid while subtly gaining
approaching the wire but just missed. SANTORINI prompted outside of the leader and from the four path, forged an advantage while shifting to the two path
at the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way from a pair of outer bidders turning for home, briefly shook free in upper stretch, but sparred with an outer
RUNAWAY STORM into the final furlong, gamely dueled as an outer foe challenged entering the final sixteenth and was narrowly bested late. SMOKEY
MANDATE set the pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one at the nine sixteenths pole, backed off and stalked from the pocket around the far
turn, but only managed to chase evenly through the final furlong. DUDE N COLORADO (GB) broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along
the inside, shifted two to four wide and between horses turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and ran on mildly between horses
while getting floated in by an outer rival. GIGANTE transferred contact from an outer rival into an inner foe while put to crowded quarters at the start, raced
at the rear along the inside, shifted three wide into the far turn, got floated five wide turning for home before fanning to the seven path in upper stretch, but
lacked a rally while shifting inwardly. WORTHINGTON laid off of the pace in the two path, trailed around the far turn, shifted outwardly in the final furlong
and offered belated interest. APPRAISE (IRE) tracked in the four path, moved to prompt three wide approaching the far turn, vied between horses turning

Footnotes
O'CONNOR (CHI) settled off of the pace in the three path, pursued between horses into and around the turn, shifted out to the five path to take aim nearing
the lane, brushed with an inner IL MIRACOLO straightening for home, sustained progress to bid with that one in midstretch, dueled three wide through the
final furlong and narrowly prevailed. IL MIRACOLO tracked in the two path, chased along with outer rivals while shifting to the three path around the far turn,
brushed with an outer O'CONNOR (CHI) while entering the lane in the four path, bid along with that one at the furlong grounds, sparred gamely between
horses through the late stages but missed. SPEED BIAS pressed two wide, bid along with an outer foe approaching the far turn, vied around that bend while
slightly headed, yet forged an advantage in upper stretch, dug in to embrace a pair of outer challenges at the furlong grounds, battled gamely through the
late stages but was grudgingly bested. TWILIGHT BLUE set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer bidding pair at the three furlong pole, yielded
entering the lane, tipped out in the final furlong and kept on to regain fourth. DASH ATTACK lacked speed in the five to six path around the first turn, tucked
behind foes approaching the far turn, saved ground around the far turn, fanned back to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace. LAW
PROFESSOR stalked three wide, bid into the far turn, vied and gained an advantage while in hand turning for home, but came up empty once set down
between horses entering the lane and weakened in upper stretch. TRADEMARK pursued from midpack in the four path, chased between horses into the far
turn but gave way shortly after. HAPPY AMERICAN trailed in the three path, moved forward in the five path entering the backstretch, but flattened out
around the far turn without reaching contention. PER ECM2023-220 FROM HIWU, SPEED BIAS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO
A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
DEADPAN stalked three wide, chased around the far turn as an outer MO CALIENTE pursued alongside, floated that one to the five path turning for home,
briefly leaned out in upper stretch before sustaining a grinding charge in the final furlong to bid at the sixteenth pole, led leaving that station and held from an
outer pair. ACT OF MUTINY pursued three wide, then between horses approaching the far turn, fanned to the seven to eight path in upper stretch, rallied
with a good kick in the final furlong to offer a late bid, but missed. MO CALIENTE tracked in midpack four wide, got floated out slightly turning for home, then
again in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong to bid along with an outer rival in the late stages, but was kept at bay. TIME SONG pressed two wide, failed
to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, rebid along with an outer rival in midstretch but was outkicked and yielded. VIVALDI broke inwardly and
bumped a rival, bore very wide around the first turn while towards the back of the pack, trailed entering the backstretch, regained stride to rejoin the field
approaching the far turn, shifted from the three path to the seven path entering the lane and rallied willingly. DOMINGO broke a step slow, tracked in the two
path, pursued between horses nearing the far turn, chased along the inside in upper stretch, altered around a faltering foe at the sixteenths pole and chased
evenly. SHERIFF JOE raced keenly two wide and between horses around the first turn and failed to menace. WAUHATCHIE set the pace along the inside,
drew clear entering the lane, but tired entering the final furlong and was overhauled at the sixteenth pole. TAPITORO broke a step slow at the start, saved
ground well back but to no avail. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start and made little impact from the
three path. VERACRUZIN broke a step slow before being bumped by an outer rival at the start and was outrun in the four path. TRIKARI pursued from
midpack along the inside and weakened turning for home.
