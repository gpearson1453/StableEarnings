Footnotes
IN YOUR FACE took hold when put in tight early, rated in the two path, drew closer two then three wide on the far turn, collared the leader inside the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. KATERINI vied between rivals into the first turn, cleared and crossed over to the rail around that bend, set all the pace to the
top of the lane, remained clear into the furlong grounds, challenged with a sixteenth remaining and yielded to the winner. DOLLY MAY (IRE) sat off the pace
on the inside, chased between into the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and got up for the show. BLONDE BOMBSHELL vied 3deep into the first
turn then stalked two wide into the backstretch, took aim still a bit off the rail into the lane, finished evenly and lost the show. MAGAZINE raced up close four
deep into the first turn then moved into the three path, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide, kept on through the
lane and gained between late. DE JORIA bumped with inner rival at the start, unhurried after and moved inside, coaxed along while tipping three wide on
the far turn and improved position in the stretch. MIMSY trailed on the inside through both turns, moved out then back inward in the stretch, improved
position but failed to threaten. SHEZMISBEHAVING traveled in the two path towards the rear, had to steady midway up the backstretch, eased out to the
four path on the far turn and lacked further response. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) pulled along the inside and had to steady off heels early, continued to
tug the rider along, steadied into the far turn, tipped out to the two path and weakened. DOWNBURST settled off the pace three then two wide, went three
deep into the second turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. MODERA brushed with outer rival at the start, vied for the lead from inside while
pulling into the first turn, steadied around the bend and dropped back to stalk, tracked along the inside into the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and
faded.

Footnotes
NOTHING LIKE YOU sped clear and crossed over into the first turn, coaxed along when threatened early on the far turn and kicked clear once more, cut the
corner into the stretch and was ridden out through the final furlong. GREAT FORTY EIGHT was a bit rank stalking between rivals on the first turn, chased
two wide into the second bend, closest in pursuit entering the stretch, was no match for the winner in the stretch run but was clearly second best. DON'T
BRING CRAZY broke out, stalked from inside, looked to challenge inside the leader early on the far turn but got put in tight and had to check approaching
the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide into the lane and churned on for the show. ARCTIC BREEZE stalked three deep, started to lose ground while
worked on through the far turn and weakened in the lane. TIANMA scrambled then bobbled and got bothered from inside at the start, trailed three to four
wide around the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
CALM SEA gained command quickly and controlled the pace from inside, challenged at the three-eighths pole, moved clear again around the bend, led
clear under a drive into the final sixteenth, tested again by HULA CANDY late and managed to hold on. HULA CANDY raced up close in the two path to the
outside of the leader early, drew alongside CALM SEA with three furlongs left to run, failed to sustain the bid at the quarter pole and chased two wide into
the lane, came again in the final sixteenth and got up at the wire. LEGISLATOR settled in the two path, gained three wide then four deep on the far turn but
flattened in the furlong grounds. ST IGNACIO pulled in the early going outside a rival then between foes, had to steady on the first turn, continued to pull
and had to steady twice on the backstretch, steadied a bit at the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the drive and lacked a rally. PINEHURST (IRE)
broke a step slow, pulled along the inside early, steadied briefly early on the far turn, swung out into the lane and failed to menace. MY PARTNER GLEN
also pulled early then rated along the inside, saved ground through the far turn and weakened. SMOOTH SALUTE stalked three deep through both turns
and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
SUPER CHIEF stalked from outside, challenged two then three wide late on the turn, dueled into the stretch, took over in the furlong grounds and
maintained a short advantage to the wire. SAULS CALL coaxed to the front, set the pace near the inside into the turn, met the challenge from SUPER
CHIEF with a quarter mile remaining, dueled two wide into the lane, lost command past the eight pole and stayed on to the wire. COLT FICTION stalked
from inside through the turn and into the lane, finished willingly but lacked the needed late punch. EL DIABLO ROJO tracked three wide into the turn, came
four wide into the lane and finished evenly through the stretch run. STAY IN THE GAME traveled in range up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide,
angled out in the drive and weakened. SEATTLE BREAKOUT came away well then started to climb and dropped back, trailed four wide to the stretch and
proved no menace.

Footnotes
ROSE MADDOX chased two wide into the turn, three deep past the quarter pole, reeled in the leader and took over at the eight pole, kicked clear shortly
after and was kept to task. MADIHA sat off the pace, rounded the bend three then four deep, drifted across the dirt, closed well but was outkicked by the
winner. CHISMOSA traveled between rivals at the back into the turn, raced two wide through the bend, bobbled crossing over the dirt, shifted to the inside
entering the lane, ran into mild traffic briefly in upper stretch, altered out into the clear and gained the show. ROSE DAWSON was closest in pursuit in the
early stages, raced along the inside around the bend, moved into striking distance in upper stretch but flattened out in the furlong grounds. ULTIMATE HY
chased on the inside into the turn, between foes leaving the bend and weakened in the drive. KLEEN KARMA was off a bit slow to begin, saved ground at
the back inside rivals, moved off the rail in the lane and was not a factor. ORGANIC cleared from inside and opened up a large lead early, held a diminishing
lead leaving the turn, overtaken at the eighth pole and gave way.

Footnotes
A NEW PEACE chased on the inside into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend, rallied steadily in the lane and overtook EQUILOVE (IRE)
nearing the wire. EQUILOVE (IRE) set the pace under pressure from outside rival, shook free around the turn, asked right handed midstretch when feeling A
NEW PEACE bearing down and could not hold that rival off in the closing moments. NEVER SWAY brushed inner rival leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack
up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the inside around the bend, moved to within striking distance in upper stretch but finished
evenly late. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, angled four wide around the bend and summoned a mild response to round
out the superfecta. JACRODRA'S DEVIL chased between rivals, dropped back and shifted to the inside briefly on the turn, altered a bit midstretch and kept
on to improve position. ROMAN EMPRESS broke a step slow and got brushed at the start, traveled along the inside towards the rear, got blocked behind
JACRODRA'S DEVIL and checked at the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the lane could not rally. AWESOME TAYLOR lacked early speed under
coaxing, chased four deep then five wide into the lane and failed to menace. MO CONNELLY chased between then got hit with kickback early tossing her
head at the five-eighths pole, worked on two then three wide around the bend, steadied in upper stretch when lacking room and had little left after.
DRIZELLA pressed the pace from outside, lost contact with the leader on the turn and faded. CODE RIBBON chased three deep into the turn, moved out to
the four path around the bend and weakened. THE RIDER ABOARD ROMAN EMPRESS LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST JACODRA'S DEVIL FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ROMAN EMPRESS WAS DRIFTING OUT WHEN
LOSING PATH ON THE TURN AND THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
ARROWTHEGREAT brushed with inner rival at the start, showed speed in the two path into the first turn, moved over and set the pace under pressure from
MISCHELOF (CHI), cleared that rival with a quarter mile remaining, inched away in upper stretch and held well under a drive. GHAZAALY chased along the
inside, inched closer in the middle stages, saved ground behind the leader through the far turn, moved off the fence in the drive, finished willingly but could
not reach the winner. MISCHELOF (CHI) stalked three then two wide before going up to apply pressure from outside, lost touch with ARROWTHEGREAT at
the quarter pole, flattened in the lane but managed to save the show honors. CLOUSEAU chased between well off the inside then angled into the three path
prior to the first turn, pulled three deep around the bend, ran up on heels at the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn three then four wide, showed a mild
response when called upon and missed the show. SMART MO chased five then four deep around the clubhouse turn, four then three deep on the second
bend, steered out in the lane and lacked a bid. FINNEUS brushed with the winner at the start, chased two wide between, raced along the rail into the far
turn, got shuffled back with three furlongs remaining, cut the corner into the lane and failed to threaten. BREAKFAST RIDE up close four wide into the first
turn then moved into the three path, ridden along three then two wide on the second bend and weakened in the stretch run. STAMP MY PASSPORT
chased six then five deep on the first turn, continued wide up the backstretch, spun five wide into the lane and failed to menace. EVER A REBEL stalked
from inside, moved off the fence in the middle stages, got put in tight between rivals near the three-eights pole and tired.

Footnotes
DEPARTURE took control early while racing keenly into the first turn and moved inside, pressured midway near the nine-sixteenths pole then cleared
leaving the backstretch, put to left handed urging in upper stretch and held TIZ PLUS at bay through the final sixteenth. TIZ PLUS forwardly place three
deep then tucked inside on the first turn, steadied slightly off the heels of the leader past the nine-sixteenths pole, continued to stalk from inside to the far
turn, tipped two wide with a quarter mile remaining, rallied outside the leader in deep stretch but could not get by. CALI BAY (IRE) reserved early and tucked
inside, gained leaving the backstretch and through the far turn, chased within range through the final furlong but could not find the needed late kick.
OVERDUE settled in the two path, went three wide into the second bend then moved into the two path, steered out approaching the stretch and chased
widest through the lane, kept on and improved position. JACKS OUTLAW stalked along the inside, tugged the rider along early on the backstretch, raced in
mid-pack two wide into the second bend, came out in the lane and lacked a bid. MAJESTIC EAGLE settled next to the rail, moved out in the middle stages
and exited the backstretch three deep, angled back to the inside around the far turn and could not rally. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR steadied briefly between
rivals, moved into the two path to stalk the pacesetter, roused three then four wide on the second bend and weakened. BIRTH OF COOL raced up close
from outside into the first turn, applied pressure at the nine-sixteenths pole but could not go on with the leader past the half-mile pole, chased two then three
wide around the second bend, bothered a bit past the eighth pole but had already started to weaken. BOASTER may have broke a step slow but was
content to trail early and steered to the inside, saved ground to the far turn and was never a factor.
