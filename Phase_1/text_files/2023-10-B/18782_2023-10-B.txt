Footnotes
IZERIGHT ran at the back of the pack for most of the race then coming into the last half of a furlong he flicked on his afterburners and bolted down the
middle of the track to win at the wire. DIABOLICAL RULER pressed the pace and wore down the leader assumed the lead for a brief moment just missed at
the wire. DIABOLICAL STORM set the early pace a furlong out of the gates then the pace was pressed by foes which wore them down with a hundred yards
left in the race. LONZO WHO was off slow from the gate but ran with a moderate pace to catch up to the main pack on the turn then having a gain in pace
down the main stretch passing a couple foes. JET N G ran with an even pace throughout the race in the middle of the pack. LEAVE THEM BEHIND ran in
the four path mid pack then ended up flattened out the pace mid stretch. NEW MEXICO JEREMY pressed the pace of the leader but the pacing was too
quick and they faded back late stretch. SECRET'S DOUBLE ran in the middle of the pack but the pace was too fast and they faded mid turn. THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.

LETHAL AVENGER faded late. WILDROSES101 late interest. HIGH FLYING HERO shuffled back. SUNDANZ no menace. WHIZKEY GLASSES no factor.
