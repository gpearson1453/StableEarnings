Footnotes
INDEPENDENT was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, remained clear by the furlong marker and then held sway late to prove best,
driving. CLUCK CLUCK stalked the pace between rivals, made a three wide bid off the turn and finished willingly to be gaining late. HARMONIZING was
reserved early on the inside, three wide midway on the turn and advancing, came six wide off the turn and closed well. G'S FIREBALL was between rivals
early, rated back two wide, then was ridden along and swung out four wide leaving the turn while making a bid but flattened out. VERY SURE was off a step
slow, then was outrun early and then had a belated rally. CONFLUENCE LASSIE stalked the pace four wide, then lugged in the stretch and weakened.
CLOUDY NIGHT stumbled at the start, then was close up on the inside but came up empty in the drive. SKIP THRU DA FIRE was settled early and was not
a threat. VALLEY STAR was on the inside and was through early. Shortly after passing the finish line, CLUCK CLUCK unseated her rider, G'S FIREBALL
jumped over the fallen rider then CLOUDY NIGHT tripped and fell over the fallen rider. CLOUDY NIGHT sustained a catastrophic injury due to the fall and
was euthanized. VALLEY STAR unseated her rider when swerving out to avoid the spill. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the post race spill but no
action was taken.

APPLE SHAKE SHAKE was bumped and bothered at the start, settled two to three wide, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly off the turn, hit
the front nearing the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best, driving. KRONE tracked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for
command off the turn, lugged in nearing the furlong marker despite under left handed crop, could not go with the winner in the final sixteenth while being
clearly second best. MAGIC IN THE PARK tracked the pace in between rivals, then dropped to the inside by the quarter pole, had to wait a bit near mid
stretch then was up for the show award late on the inside. KEEP IT SWEET broke outwardly and bumped a foe hard at the start, then settled on the inside,
swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally to just miss the show award. WAY TOO EARLY pressed the pace two to three wide, made a
two wide bid on the turn and weakened in the lane. STORM CREED broke in at the start, reserved on the inside, came five wide into the lane and had no
rally. DUCHESS OF DESTIN set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. ORIGAMI GIRL was bumped and sandwiched at the start, tracked the pace
on the inside and tired.

COCKTAIL DREAMING pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid to set the pace on the inside on the turn, then drew clear leaving the turn and
widened the margin to prove much the best while being ridden out. JOYA DEL SUR prompted the pace four wide in hand early, then pressed the winner two
wide on the t urn, proved to be no match for the winner in the lane while clearly second best. VOODOO MAMA JUJU was reserved early on the inside,
swung out three wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to best the rest. LADRO DI FICHI was rated early on the inside, two wide on the turn, came four
wide into the lane and was empty. MYSISTERNANCY was reserved early, three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. BLAME

NEAT pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid and took over leaving the turn and drew off while moving to the inside to prove much the
best, driving. ST JAMES THE GREAT was well rated early, made a four wide move by the quarter pole, no match for the winner while finishing willingly to
be second best. ROUNDTOP was allowed to settle early, saved ground and eased out on the turn, came four wide into the lane and then angled out to the
far outside and had a belatedly rally to best the rest. NEIL TO THE KING chased the pace two wide, then steadied twice from the five eighths marker to the
half mile marker, then lacked a rally. SASSE'S CLASS set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way in the lane. GOODBYE NOTE was four wide into
the first turn, tracked the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. ARIUS was well placed on the inside while rank on the first turn, then tired. D
MAJESTICAL lacked a rally. DATS MY PHARAOH failed to menace. MISTER AGENT was off slowly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HAPPY CAT set the early pace while making it to the inside, was well handled and shook clear off the turn, then held sway late to prove best, driving.
WICKED SECRET was reserved early two wide, came six wide into the lane and closed well on the far outside and gained the place award late.
CROSSLAND was rated along the inside, tipped out nearing the furlong marker and finished well, missed place award. VICTORS VALIANT stalked the
winner two wide, came three wide into the lane and kept on but needed more. OPPOSITES ATTRACT was reserved on the inside, angled out in the lane
and had some late kick. BASSANIO (GB) chased the pace in between rivals and had no kick. JOLLY BY GOLLY chased the pace four wide and tired.
WIRED IN was reluctant to load, tracked the pace three wide, then was between rivals on the turn and tired. SHERIFF RONNIE was off a step slow, then
was four wide on the backstretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NANCY MADE MY DAY dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead by the furlong marker, then edged clear and
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. ONE WAY FARRIOR tracked the early pace three wide, came four wide off the turn and closed
well, second best. BUCKIN' DREAMER dueled for the lead on the inside but faded the final furlong, bested rest. MINIMO bobbled at the start, then chased
the early pace on the inside, eased off the inside and was three wide into the lane and weakened. AVES MAKIN' WAVES was close up early on the inside
and dropped back. THENAME OF THEGAME was settled early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. R B TOOK THE ODDS showed little.
