Footnotes
SUMMER STORM STRIC rated in the three path, ranged up outside of foes in the five path approaching the quarter, bid from the six path into the lane, took
the lead while drifting in nearing the eighth pole, and held off an outer foe late. SANPIRODU bumped with an outer foe at the start, settled wellback in the
three path, floated out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and kept on while on his left lead for place. ATOMICO raced close up in the
four path, bid approaching the far turn, sustained that bid from the three path going into the lane, but evened out late for show. CHEER COACH stalked in
the four path, bid under a ride midway around the far turn, but flattened in the stretch. WE GOT THIS set the pace in the three path, was challenged by outer
rivals along the inside rounding the far turn, and faded entering the stretch. INSPIRING HONOR trailed in the two path down the backstretch, and made no
impact from the center down the lane. CROSS EXAM bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path and never threatened.

Footnotes
TROTTING GEAR stalked the pace three wide, took over leaving the quarter pole, drew clear leaving the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging
and held firm. MUDSHAFT was pinched back at the start, trailed down the backstretch, circled six wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane
and rallied outside. SHALL RETURN bumped MUDSHAFT at the start, tracked the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. RIGBY pressed the
pace two wide between foes and weakened in the final furlong. SHES A GIFT chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. COUNTLESS
DREAMS failed to menace while racing three wide. MISS MAC MAC bumped MUDSHAFT at the start, set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane.
DANCING DOLL was outrun inside. AWESOME APEAL played no factor while racing five wide.

Footnotes
KOZEM set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path early into the turn, opened up passing the quarter, and continued to extend her
advantage under a drive. MOCHI GIRL stalked in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, stayed on her left lead to the final sixteenth,
and chased on for place. BAHAMIAN BABY trailed in the four path, merged to the rail early into the turn, cut the corner under a drive entering the stretch,
and was along for show. DANNEEL chased in the three path, floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, and made no impact. HOLY
KINGDOM tracked along the inside into the turn, but never menaced. MY SARASOTA QUEEN bobbled at the start, pressed the winning pacesetter in the
four path, was coaxed in the three path around the turn, but faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
BEDTIME STORY dueled two wide between foes, drew clear near the quarter pole, widened in upper stretch and held firm late. SONICUS raced off the
early pace between foes, steadied and angled out near the three-eighths marker, advanced four wide around the turn and finished strongly to narrow most
of the gap. BIG BAND LUZZIANN raced in range three wide and finished evenly to gain the show. FLAG WOMAN chased the pace two wide and lacked the
needed rally. MAGIC MOONSTAR set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. A KISS FOR KHOZAN broke outwardly and slowly, pressed the
pace three wide and retreated through the stretch. PEACH COBBLER trailed inside, tipped out near the quarter pole and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SIR FLASH set the pace in the two path, was nudged along the inside around the turn, opened up from the two path in upper stretch, and held safe under a
drive. GREAT LILO chased in the four path, brushed with an outer foe going into the turn, floated out to the six path under a ride turning into the lane, and
ran on for place. JABRAN stalked inside, was roused from the rail midway around the turn, and kept on inside of foes down the stretch for show. WILD
CAUGHT pressed in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, tipped back out to the four path entering the stretch, but faded. WEMBY rated in the
five path, brushed with an inner foe going into the turn, and was tired entering the stretch. MOLINERO had a slow start, trailed from the six path into the turn
and did not threaten. SEEKING TO COLLECT raced off the pace in the three path but was empty entering the lane.

CLASSIC CAR WASH stalked in the five path, was coaxed to bid in the four path early around the turn, took the lead passing the quarter, opened up in
upper stretch, and held sway under a drive. SHAQ DIESEL tracked in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, tipped back out to the six
path entering the lane, and ran on while still on his left lead for place. BIRD WILDCAT brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the five
path, floated out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and kept on while on his left lead for show. DESERT RULER chased in the two
path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. BIG MARTINI set the pace in three path into the turn, was challenged on both sides
early around the turn, lost the lead, and faded in the stretch. AWESOME FLAY pressed in the two path, bid between foes going into the turn, but flattened
along the inside down the stretch. SLIM MAN rated in the four path but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. DOUBLE PLAY KING trailed in the
five path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and did not threaten. X Y POINT brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace
inside, bid from the rail into the turn, stuck a head in front passing the three eighths, but gaveway passing the quarter.

Footnotes
R HARPER ROSE was bumped soon after the start, pressed the early pace, drew clear near the seven-sixteenths marker, angled in entering the turn, set a
clear pace inside from there and widened under a drive in the lane. HONEY DIJON came in soon after the start and bumped the winner, raced in range
three wide, could not gain on the winner but kept trying through the stretch and gained the place late. FIELDS OF GREEN set the early pace inside, was
collared by the winner late on the backstretch, chased that foe two wide around the turn and held second until deep stretch. HAUNTED gave chase two
wide and lacked the needed rally. REINA MAR raced off the pace four wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. UNRELENTLESS failed to menace while
racing three wide. BUCCHERA played no factor while racing three wide. JAZZIN was throwing her head at the start then lunged to get away far behind the
field and was never involved. MIST had only brief speed two and three wide and was eased in the lane.

empty in the lane. SEMINOLE CHIEF was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. SQUINTS was bumped on both sides leaving the
chute, checked soon after, raced off the pace four wide and had no further bids. SECRET LOVER stumbled at the start, raced two and three wide and made
little impact. ECHO LANE bumped with LASSO at the start, had some speed inside but was through early. LASSO bumped with ECHO LANE at the start,

Footnotes
THE BEST DISTANCE opened up around the first turn to set the pace in the three path down the backstretch, was roused from the two path into the far
turn, stayed on while floating out to the six path into the lane, and held safe under a drive. TIZ ROMANTIC got bumped by an outer foe at the start, laid up
close in the five path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn, got floated out to the eight path turning into the lane, and ran on to hold place honors.
SPACE RUNNER trailed in the three path, advanced between foes in the two path rounding the far turn, and kept on from said position down the lane for
show. WHAT SAY THEE raced in midpack between rivals in the three path, was cued going into the far turn, swung out to the seven path entering the lane,
tipped into the five path, and finished evenly on his left lead. UNO TIGER rated in the two path, was driven inside of rivals around the far turn, but made no
impact from the three path in the stretch. SUNSHINE FROLIC raced off the pace in the five path, and did not factor from out in the seven path down the
stretch. SIGRUN FAST BOY tracked in the two path, shifted out to the five path turning into the lane, but faded in the final furlong. MONGOLIAN APPLE
stalked in the six path but backed up going into the stretch. SURROGATE broke in bumping an inner foe and had to steady, settled in midfield along the rail,
but gaveway in upper stretch. LORD EDDARD STARK raced wellback in the six path and never menaced.
