Footnotes
GOING MOBILE pressed from outside, lost touch briefly with the leader at the eighth pole, came back on in deep stretch and got up at the wire. POTITO
showed early speed and took control from MR. DREAMCYCLE early, set the pace under pressure from the outside, maintained a short lead through the
bend, cleared briefly at the eighth pole, then got tested again late and was a nailed in the closing moments. GENTLEMEN'S CLUB broke a bit slow, chased
off the rail then between rivals, rounded the turn two wide still between foes, finished willingly down the lane and edged HAVOC for third. HAVOC chased
outside a rival then three deep, remained three wide to the stretch and missed the show. MR. DREAMCYCLE away quickly from inside, ceded command to
POTITO and stalked from inside up the backstretch, saved ground inside a pair of rivals through the turn and flattened out in the late stages. MR. SUDS
was off slow to begin, was green crossing over the dirt early, trailed on the inside to the stretch, moved out in the lane and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR hustled clear from outside and angled into the two path, showed the way under coaxing into and around the far turn, led two wide into
the stretch, kicked clear when asked right handed and was geared down in the final sixteenth. TEMBO broke a step slow and was coaxed along after,
steadied along the inside into the first turn, moved out to the two path around the bend, angled back inside on the far turn, then finished willingly to earn the
place honors and whittle the gap on a geared down winner. MENDEZ MILE settled inside, saved ground through the far turn while worked on, continued up
the fence in the drive and gained the show. SIGNOFTHECROSS tracked two wide into the first turn then got moved out to the four path around the bend,
trailed up the backstretch, went between rivals on the second bend, came three wide into the lane and got edged for third. ECONOMICAL bobbled leaving
the gate, closest early in the three path, continued to give chase three then two wide on the far turn and weakened. WARRENS CANDY MAN broke a step
slow, chased two wide into the first turn then angled out and went four wide into the backstretch, rounded the far turn three to four wide and came up empty
in the lane.

Footnotes
CLASSYMADEMOISELLE dueled for the lead outside a rival into the first turn, took control three then two wide around the bend, set the pace under a hold
then was pressured by a pair of rivals to the inside, held a short lead over HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN through the far turn, responded through the lane and
held gamely to the wire. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN stalked along the rail then moved into the two path, went up to apply pressure on the backstretch, fought
inside the winner through the far turn and down the lane, failed to summon the needed late kick in deep stretch but stayed on gamely to the line. PENS
STREET broke a step slow, stalked three then four wide early, rounded the second bend three then two wide, kept trying in the final furlong and outfinished
WHISTLER'S STYLE for third. WHISTLER'S STYLE was off a bit slow in the beginning, traveled three then four wide off the pace early, moved out widest
and into contention in the middle stages, chased four then three wide on the far turn and flattened out. KUORA (PER) unhurried from inside then tipped off
the rail around the clubhouse turn, continued two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SPOILED ROTTEN dueled for the lead from inside then ceded
command leaving the first turn, moved up to press the pace from inside briefly on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
ZIMBA WARRIOR settled two to three wide on the first turn, raced outside a rival into the far turn, moved over to the rail around the bend, rallied inside the
top trio with a furlong remaining and outkicked BIG BUZZ in deep stretch. BIG BUZZ tucked inside at the back, steered out wide and moved into range on
the backstretch, rallied four deep on the far turn, led momentarily midstretch but was outkicked by ZIMBA WARRIOR in the late stages. GOOD JUJU broke
a step slow, sent from outside and vied three deep into the first turn, cleared and angled to the rail around the bend, pressured into the backstretch, cleared
again at the seven-sixteenths pole, challenged outside the quarter pole, fought with outer trio to the stretch, resisted to midstretch, then relinquished the lead
and yielded in the final sixteenth. SETTECENTO vied from inside into the clubhouse turn then chased GOOD JUJU briefly before having to check hard off
heels approaching the three-quarter pole, went up to press between rivals, chased leaving the backstretch, re-bid at the quarter pole, fought between rivals
in the stretch and weakened in the late stages. HEIR (FR) vied between into the first turn then chased briefly before going up to apply pressure from outside,
traveled three deep on the backstretch, continued three deep on the far turn and weakened in the late stages. MY INDY settled two wide then along the
inside, trailed on the far turn and eased out to the three path and lacked further response.

ON THE WHIM stalked off the rail while a bit green early then moved inside for the turn, saved ground while inching closer around the bend, moved out in
the lane, headed MAN O ROSE at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MAN O ROSE sped clear and moved inside, showed the way through the turn while
saving ground, continued clear into the final furlong, headed at the sixteenth pole and yielded to the winner. GLORIOUS LIFE broke slow on the outside,
traveled two wide off the pace leaving the backstretch, angled to the inside then back to the two path around the bend, summoned a mild rally and gained
the show. MORE TRY stalked the pacesetter from inside, saved ground through the turn chasing out of range, failed to summon a rally in the lane and got
edged for the show honors. HILL SIXTEEN was off slow to start, traveled in mid-pack early, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail into the lane,
drifted inward in upper stretch and could not rally. ANTIBES broke in and bumped, raced greenly near the back to the turn, moved off the rail around the
bend and came three wide into the lane and failed to menace. SMILING RULER got bumped leaving the gate, trailed on the inside into the turn, tipped two
wide to go around a rival and failed to make an impact. SEABOARD came away awkwardly, rushed up into range early, lost ground leaving the backstretch,
dropped back on the turn and tired.

BRIGHT LEAF stumbled and bumped outer rival at the start, brushed two wide into the first turn, chased between rivals then got put in tight entering the far
turn, tipped out to three path and started to rally under right handed encouragement, took over with a furlong remaining and kicked clear to win going away.
LOW EXPECTATIONS showed speed three then two wide around the first turn and dueled from outside, fought in the two path through the far turn and into
the lane, put a head in front in upper stretch but was soon overtaken by the winner and stayed on to secure second. AFJAN took a bump from inside at the
start, chased three deep around the first turn, moved into the two path on the far turn, churned on down the lane and held the show. PARK CITY stalked
from inside and brushed into the first turn, continued along the fence on the second bend, lacked room in upper stretch, could not find the needed response
once gaining a clear path and got edged for third. ELEVADO had good early speed from inside then dueled with LOW EXPECTATIONS, inched ahead on
the far turn, battled on even terms into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
JUST A GUESS rated along the inside behind the top pair early, chased out of range into the far turn, continued to save ground to the stretch, rallied along
the fence and overhauled NESTUCKA in the final sixteenth. NESTUCKA chased three wide around the first turn, bid four deep on the backstretch, dueled
two wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, led into deep stretch but could not fend off JUST A GUESS late. LIGHT DRAGOON chased three to two
wide then tugged forward and to attend the pace for a bit between rivals, chased again past the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn two then three wide,
raced within striking distance in the furlong grounds but could not summon the needed late kick. FLEET BROTATO settled two wide then had to steady off
heels on the first turn, rounded the far turn in the two path, finished willingly late and got up for a minor award. IMMELMANN dueled for command from
outside, inched ahead on the backstretch, dueled again on on the far turn this time along along the rail, lost command in upper stretch, fought on to the
sixteenth pole, weakened and was not persevered with late, getting nailed for a minor placing. GANTRY dueled from inside early, chased past the half-mile
pole, entered the lane two wide, put in a mild bid in upper stretch but flattened out. HELEN'S SUN tracked four deep into the clubhouse turn then angled
over to the two path, saved ground through the far turn and failed to menace. LONG JACKET tucked inside trailing early, saved ground through the far turn
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SANDY BOTTOM set the pace under pressure from TAMBO to the outside, shook free at the top of the stretch, roused outside the eighth pole, urged right
handed midstretch and held well under steady strong handling late. TAMBO bobbled leaving the gate, went up to press SANDY BOTTOM from outside,
chased that rival three wide into the lane, kept to task in the final furlong, came back on in deep stretch to gain late on the winner but needed to find more.
BECKY'S DREAM (FR) tracked three deep into the turn, rounded the bend three then four wide, failed to summon the needed response to threaten the
winner but stayed on for a clear third. DUA was off a bit slow in the beginning, chased outside a rival into the turn, pushed on two wide through the bend and
weakened down the lane. CHEEKY GAL came away slow, stalked in hand along the inside behind the pacesetter, hugged the rail through the turn, asked in
upper stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
NYSOS dueled for command outside URBAN LEGEND, inched ahead at the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and asked left handed, then widened
through the final furlong under strong handling and was ridden out to the wire. URBAN LEGEND dueled inside NYSOS up the backstretch and around the
turn, failed to kick on with that rival in upper stretch, churned on through the final furlong and held on for second. COLORADO CRUISER attended the pace
four deep early, chased the dueling pair four wide through the turn while losing ground, showed a mild response when kept to task through the lane but
could not get by URBAN LEGEND for second. DE' MEDICI forwardly placed early then started to lose ground and climbed a bit on the backstretch, dropped
back four wide on the turn, moved out and never quit trying in the lane and churned on for a minor award. E J WON THE CUP pressed the pace three deep
early, lost ground to the top pair three wide on the turn and weakened in the lane. BRITISH ISLES climbed badly in the early stages and dropped back, went
three deep into the turn, two wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TRACKER broke in and bumped, chased the top quartet to the turn, traveled along
the inside then two wide into the lane and failed to rally. BETTER THAN GOLD broke slow and got bumped by TRACKER, climbed and lacked early speed,
raced along the rail then angled out on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not make an impact. CITADINO threw his head and leaned back
to come away slow, steered down to the inside, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. MISCHIEF MOMENTS off slow to begin, settled near
the back, navigated the turn two wide and was not a factor.
