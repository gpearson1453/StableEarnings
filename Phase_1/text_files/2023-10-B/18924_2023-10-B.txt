Footnotes
MALPAIS vied with another through a fast first quarter, continued on near even terms with that one into the lane, inched away while straightening in the
lane, cleared outside the eighth pole and held. K J'S LEGACY vied for the lead along the inside with the winner through a fast pace, could not keep up after
straightening in the lane but stayed on well to hold the place spot. MAQAMAT raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the
three or four path and was gaining momentum late. HIGHEST PRAISE chased the pace along the inside into the lane and finished evenly. PERFECT
WAGER was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. SANTINO'S FANTASY raced in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and tired.

BARB'S VORTEX set the pace along the inside while under pressure, continued with a short lead into the far turn, shook clear in late turn then widened
through the lane. SHARON'S GREY HOPE chased the pace while along the inside, bid into the lane, could not gain on the winner while winning the duel for
the place spot. MOON DAZE pressed the winner two wide into the far turn, was asked for more entering the mid-turn, slowly lost ground to the top one into
the lane, hooked up with the runner-up and lost the place duel. MIZZTIFY DOLL trailed the field into the far turn, came into the lane from the three path and
never was a factor. BRODY MO was three wide through the turns, came into the lane from the four path and tired. GIO'S BABY GIRL raced two wide and
between rivals into the far turn, moved closer to the inside into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
AMAZING GAL stalked the pace in the three path, bid four wide at the quarter pole, was clear briefly and lasted under steady handling.
MILLIONDOLARMONKEY raced inside, angled five wide at the quarter pole, rallied and just missed. PRESSLY'S HOPE was jostled at the start, rallied five
wide at the top of the stretch and was steadied late in tight quarters. WICKED INTENT was off awkwardly and was bumped at the start, saved ground, then
rallied belatedly in the two path. LOTTA ROSES raced three wide and rallied late six wide. LUCKY SHORE saved ground, bid late in the three path and
faltered near the wire. PRESCIENCE saved ground, angled five wide in early stretch but couldn't close late. MIZ CALI pressed the pace in the two path, bid
at the quarter pole but faltered in the stretch. RIBALDRY (IRE) led inside before giving way in the stretch. NO MORE FAKE NEWS saved ground and then
faded. COLUMN was bumped at the start. AMERICA RULES was off awkwardly and was bumped at the start. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PRESSLY'S HOPE AGAINST MILLIONDOLARMONKEY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE LATE RUNNING.

Footnotes
FAST BOAT TO SKYE chased then stalked the pacesetter into the turn, bid in late turn, moved to the lead when straightening in the lane then maintained
the half-length advantage to the end. MINING CAMP set the pace while near the inside through mid-turn, was put under pressure by the winner in late turn,
lost the lead to that one into the lane then stayed on gamely to the wire. ICE AXE trailed early, raced off the inside through the turn when moving up, same
into the lane from the four path and was gaining through the final eighth to be well clear for the show spot. SAVAGE KISS chased the pace along the inside
through mid-turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole then weakened through the lane. BOBBY MERLOT saved ground into the lane and
tired. ICE VORTEX chased the pace from the three path into the far turn and was done soon after.

Footnotes
JEOPARDY THEORY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved closer after mid-turn, bid from the three path into the lane, caught the
leader nearing the eighth pole then edged clear late. AKAMAI vied for the lead two wide through the turns and into the lane, shook off dueling rival to be
joined soon after by the winner, dueled with that one through the lane then yielded while staying on to be clear for the place spot and second best.
COVENANT LADY chased the pace along the inside through the far turn, came into the four path for the drive and was up for the show spot. STOP
HAMMERTIME saved ground into the lane, came off the rail to pass tired ones and moved up from the two path. JACKSONS GOLD trailed into the
backstretch, continued near the rail down the backstretch, angled four wide into the far turn, continued in the four or five path through late turn, entered the
lane from the five path and moved up while not a threat. CIBOLO settled to near the back into the turn, raced three wide through mid-turn, came into the
lane from the eight path and offered a belated gain. MANSFIELD TIGER raced in the two path into mid-turn, came off the inside in late turn, entered the lane
four wide then weakened in the drive. INDOCUMENTADO was two wide through the turn and never factored. GRAND IN BAY was well back from off the
inside. ONE BIG DUDE vied for the lead along the inside from the outset, continued a contender into late turn then retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SECRET'S IMAGE chased the pace along the inside through the turn, bid into the lane while coming off the rail, advanced from the three or four path
through the final eighth and drove past the pacesetter as was going away at the end. LUCKIES JOY set the pace while on a clear lead into the lane,
continued in the two or three path for the drive when still clear then could not hold the winner safe while well clear for the place spot. SOLAR POWER was
near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and never was a serious threat. MARIACHI JUSTICE trailed into the lane
while saving ground and moved up while never a menace. FOREVER FRIENDS raced in the four path into the turn when not far back, lost ground into the
lane and tired while in the six path. FIERCE JUSTICE chased the pace from the three path into the turn then steadily faded. BINGE saved ground through
the turn when a contender then was empty after turning into the lane.
