Footnotes
JOE THE TAILOR broke inward, shared the early lead between rivals, moved ahead three wide on the bend, drew clear when asked leaving the turn and
gradually opened up under urging the final furlong. STROPE in contention between horses from the beginning, advanced four wide on the turn, floated out
some as he progressed in the stretch, found best stride too late but got up for second late. STANCE vied for the lead from inside, did not keep in tight
quarters along the rail on the bend, moved clear for second the last eighth, did not enough left to hold off STROPE but was clearly best of the rest. HAND
OVER MY HEART displayed early speed between JOE THE TAILOR and STANCE but flattened out for the drive. BEST MAN SPEECH hesitated at the
break, trailed from off the inside, lost ground moving widest for the stretch run and passed tired ones. PETE'S LEGACY raced in contention toward the
outside for a half mile, came six wide into the lane and gave way. C C RITHMS was a factor from inside, also for about a half mile, then had no stretch bid.
RAISERICHIESRANSOM chased from outside, angled in to be just off the rail on the bend, swung out behind STROPE entering the stretch and failed to
have a significant response. WATCHNTHETIDEROLL also broke inward, was prominent between rivals but quit after four furlongs.

Footnotes
CAHOKIA POSSE stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead on the bend, was crowded by TENSE as she vied for the lead outside that one
nearing the end of a half mile, drew clear and took the rail upper stretch then gradually drifted out as she lengthened command under urging the last furlong.
TENSE set a pressured pace from just off the rail, was challenged from outside on the turn, brushed with CAHOKIA POSSE several times approaching the
end of four furlongs, did not stay with that one into the lane, moved outside CAHOKIA POSSE upper stretch, began to wear down in the late going but kept
LOVEYOULIKECRAZY at bay. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY prominent between rivals, progressed four wide through the bend, took over third upper stretch then
could only pull away for the show inside the final eighth. WICKED SKY was a contender running widest for a half mile then lacked a significant stretch bid.
LUTION broke well but soon trailed, was just off the inside taking the turn, took the rail at the top of the lane, was steadied and altered out midstretch when
her path was compromised and passed between tired rivals inside the final furlong. FREEDOM ATTACK raced in the second flight from between horses,
came three wide into the stretch and gave way. PRIMITY was an early factor toward the outside then began to fade five wide on the bend. WILDWOOD
GHALY hesitated at the start, raced in contention from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
FERGIE ATTACK shared the early lead between rivals, had the rail on the bend, drew clear under urging in the lane and maintained full control under
steady handling. HER SPEAKER'S ON prominent from outside, angled in nearing the turn, progressed three wide, angled out for a clear path midstretch
and took over second inside the final sixteenth. BETTY'S SECRET hustled along to stay close early, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch,
advanced along the rail on the bend and caught MISS HIGH N MIGHTY for third in the waning yards. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY was sent to contest the pace
from outside, moved ahead and stay in path four through the turn, was no match for FERGIE ATTACK when set down for the drive and gradually lugged in
as she weakened deep stretch. THE LAST THRILL void of early speed, picked up her pace three wide on the bend, swung out widest for the stretch run and
showed a willingness to run late. SILVER EYES disputed the pace between horses on the backstretch, began to retreat two wide on the turn, fanned out
some into the lane and gave way. HOT N FRESH displayed early speed two wide but began to fade after a quarter mile. MOLLY'S TEMPLE vied for the
lead from inside but also gave way after two furlongs.

Footnotes
COMFORT ME NOW waited patiently along the rail, was roused after six furlongs, gained a clear path inside SET THE PACE entering the lane, rallied
outside SNOOZER and caught the latter in the final strides. SNOOZER shared the early lead outside CHEEKERS, edged ahead approaching the end of a
half mile, drew clear and took the rail into the second bend, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch, was corrected, challenged nearing the final
sixteenth, was all out, narrowly outfinished but proved easily best of the others. CHEEKERS vied for the lead briefly from inside, did not stay with SNOOZER
nearing the end of four furlongs, angled outside the latter into the second turn, drifted out to path four entering the lane, was no match for the top pair but
was unchallenged for third. IRISH DECLARATION chased from off the rail, commenced his bid after a half mile, lost ground four then five wide taking the
second bend, improved his position upper stretch then leveled off. MOVE ON OVER chased running widest, closed the gap some five wide on the second
turn, angled in some for the stretch run and faded. BLURT was snatched and threw his head up at the start, stayed prominent in the second flight between
rivals, was three wide taking the second bend then gave way for the drive. SEMINOLE BEACH raced in contention outside BLURT then faded soon after
travelling a half mile.

Footnotes
ORBITAL STARR void of speed, though urged along running widest, picked up his pace after two furlongs, advanced four wide on the bend, rallied through
the stretch and edged ahead in the waning yards. WINDIGO SPIRIT vied for the early lead from inside, did not keep up after a quarter mile, angled out
some on the turn, came into the lane from path three, started to drift out upper stretch, held a straight path the final furlong, closed well and caught MADE
TO FIT for second. MADE TO FIT shared the lead outside from the beginning, moved ahead and floated out some on the bend, angled in leaving the turn,
was just off the inside entering the stretch and gradually drifted out the last eighth. AVENGING WARRIOR displayed early speed between rivals, gained the
rail into the turn, did not stay with MADE TO FIT near the end of a half mile and flattened out inside the final furlong. WARNING LABEL chased from
between horses, came into the stretch from path three and had no late bid. JOEY B a step slow at the break, was without early speed, though also urged
along, saved ground and failed to menace. RULE FOLLOWER was away somewhat slowly, three wide on the bend, fanned out widest for the drive but had
little to offer. FAIRWAY LANE broke with the pack, quickly retreated, began to short his stride after a furlong, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL a step slow at the start, was bumped and forced into the rear of IMMORAL, progressed between horses on the bend, came five
wide into the lane, edged ahead inside the final furlong and held sway. GOLD SMOKE in contention early from outside, lost considerable ground widest
through the turn, began to slowly drift out as he took a narrow advantage upper stretch, continued to gradually float out as he battled to hold on and had to
settle for second best. BERNIE LOMAX came into contention along the rail on the bend, vied for the lead upper stretch, lacked the extra needed the final
eighth but was clear best of the others. WILDWOOD MINISTRY broke inward, bumping ETERNALLY GRATEFUL, contested the pace between horses, had
the rail on the turn then began to wear down just off the inside upper stretch. IMMORAL bumped from the rear at the start, was prominent just off the rail on
the backstretch, swung out to vie for the lead four wide on the bend, lost further ground fanning to path six for the stretch run and began to wear down.
PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN was forwardly placed between rivals on the backstretch, faded four wide on the turn and finished on even terms with BLUE
NORTHER. The latter vied for the lead from outside, was three then four wide through the bend and faded from between horses in the lane. LORD DYLAN
quickly recovered from a stumble at the start but gave way widest before finishing a half mile. GALLANT BUCK displayed early speed between horses,
came three wide into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LAND MARK DEAL settled early, gradually progressed from off the rail to vie for the lead three wide between rivals on the second bend, fanned out further
into the lane, edged ahead, was briefly clear of KING DOODLE inside the final furlong, challenged by the latter with a sixteenth left and narrowly held on.
KING DOODLE bumped at the start, was also settled early, drifted out widest entering the backstretch, advanced with LAND MARK DEAL to vie for the lead
widest on the second turn, did not stay with the latter upper stretch, came again with a sixteenth to go, was outnodded at the wire but proved clearly second
best. RIGHT ON RICHIE broke a bit inward, sped away from the rest to contest the pace outside MOMENT, came two wide into the lane, began to yield,
jostled briefly with the latter midstretch, battled for third the rest of the way and narrowly prevailed. KARAYEL was soon well back, picked up his pace into
the second bend, angled out widest upper stretch, rallied belatedly and just missed for third. GLOBAL EMPIRE caught five wide into the first turn, was
settled off the inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, saved ground taking the second bend, angled out four wide upper stretch and also found best
stride too late. MOMENT forced in at the break, bumped with KING DOODLE, vied for the lead along the rail, edged ahead leaving the second turn, began
yield upper stretch, jostled briefly with RIGHT ON RICHIE with a furlong to go, fought to keep third but did not have enough left in the waning yards.
NAMESAKE hesitated then made a slight lunge from the gate, chased from inside, came into contention behind MOMENT on the second turn, angled out
some for a clear path upper stretch then began to flatten.

Footnotes
GO MADI GO rated along the rail, progressed between rivals on the second bend, swiftly moved clear upper stretch and maintained full control under
steady handling. AROSE FOR LYLA settled just outside GO MADI GO, took the second turn three wide, gradually angled in as she made her bid in the lane
and caught SET THE PACE for second late. SET THE PACE soon had a clear lead, was challenged from both sides on the backstretch, moved clear when
allowed nearing the end of five furlongs, drifted out to path four into the stretch and slowly wore down inside the last eighth. RACETOTHEFINISH advanced
in tight quarters between horses to vie for the lead on the backstretch, did not keep up into the second turn, lost some ground staying outside SET THE
PACE entering the stretch and flattened out. SHEZ STUCK UP went for the lead running widest on the backstretch, was four wide on the second bend,
forced out further into the lane and also flatened. NOT TO BE DENIED progressed along the rail to also contest the pace on the backstretch but began to
fade before finishing six furlongs.

Footnotes
LINDALOUIMAGE broke awkwardly and lugged in to brush SUPERTRIX, was without early speed, though encouraged along, advanced three wide on the
bend, fanned outside NEXT TIME YOU WIN for the stretch run and swept past FOGGY KITTEN inside the last sixteenth. NEXT TIME YOU WIN raced in
the second flight between rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, lacked a significant rally in the lane but got up for second nearing the wire. FOGGY
KITTEN soon shared the lead outside COOKIN ROSES, moved ahead on the bend, shook the latter off again inside the final furlong but could not sustain
her bid late. SUPERTRIX crowded briefly at the break, chased from inside, was two then three wide through the turn, angled in some as she rallied inside
the last eighth, found herself blocked in the waning yards and was altered out. AH LEAH chased in midpack from outside, lost ground four then five wide
taking the bend and only made up minor ground deep stretch. COOKIN ROSES displayed early speed, gained the rail into the turn, did not stay with
FOGGY KITTEN and flattened out the final furlong. ABBMAR was an early contender but faded from inside on the bend. ARCH FLYER never far off the
inside, failed to menace.
