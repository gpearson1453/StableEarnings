BURN THE BREEZE set a clear pace along the rail and steadily widened while ridden out. SHARP PIPPA saved ground off the pace and ran on to gain the
place. TOODALOO Y'ALL chased the pace four wide, was no match for the winner and bested the rest. GHOST FORCE chased the winner three wide and
came up empty in the lane. FAMILY STASH shied and was checked soon after the start, saved ground and never threatened. MRS. CASH MAN prompted
the pace two wide and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ROD TWO ROD settled up close outside the early leader in the four path, took command while merging to the two path going into the turn, opened up
passing the quarter, floated out to the five path while continuing to extend his advantage into the stretch, and was driven out. DONTKISSDAMINISTER
tracked in the three path, ranged up under a nudge in the four path midway around the turn, tipped out to the six path under a ride entering the lane, and
continued to chase on his left lead for place. SOLOMONS GOLD stalked in the five path, was roused to bid from the three path early into the turn, but
flattened in upper stretch for show. STORMY VICTORY rated from the six path into the turn, was driven from said position turning into the lane, but did not
threaten. TIK TOKABLE led in the two path early, was put to a ride while losing the lead along the inside going into the turn, and faded turning into the
stretch. BAD HENRY raced off the pace just off the rail, but never menaced.

Footnotes
RASTANI was pinballed at the start, advanced at the rail around the turn, came through inside of the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole and drove clear.
AMERICAN OF COURSE was bumped hard at the start, set the pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole and held clear of the rest. MINXY broke out
and bumped RASTANI into AMERICAN OF COURSE then was bumped again by a rebounding RASTANI soon after, chased the pace five wide around the
turn and was one-paced through the lane. STARSHIP AURORA failed to menace while racing two wide. ANYBODY'S CHOICE prompted the pace four
wide and tired in the lane. SHE'S OUTTA HERE played no factor while racing two wide. RACE DAY SPEED was outrun while racing five wide and was
vanned off. GO LIL LADY pressed the pace three wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

BEIRA laid off the pace in the five path, was ridden into the far turn, remained in the five path entering the stretch, kept on outside the leader while still on
her left lead into the final furlong, and got up on the wire. SONADORA GIRL opened up around the first turn and was well clear to set the pace in the three
path down the backstretch, was roused from the two path early into the far turn, received a right handed cue in the three path at the top of the lane, but was
caught at the wire by a late charging outer foe to place. ASHIMA tracked in the four path, was driven into the far turn, tipped into the three path entering the
stretch, but drifted out, and flattened. SPANISH GIRL rated in the three path, floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, and did not
factor. SKINNY COSMO stalked in the three path, but faded turning into the lane. JESS'S MOMENT trailed throughout around the two path.

Footnotes
SERGEANT SINATRA set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. CAROLINA TRAFFIC tracked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch
and stayed on to just last for the place. COPANELLO BAY raced off the pace outside, raced six wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane,
closed outside, lugged in late and just missed second. CORPORATE AFFAIR steadied entering the turn, saved ground in midpack and lacked the needed
stretch rally. STRAIGHT TIME chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. REDISUR saved ground and failed to menace. NORFIE broke inwardly and
bumped SPUNKY BOY at the start, raced off the pace five wide and never threatened. AMARULA SUN had early speed two and three wide and retreated
through the lane. CALLIHOO raced in range outside, advanced three wide around the turn, had aim in upper stretch, was shut off nearing the eighth pole
and had no further bids. VINDICATED TIGER was a bit rank early, steadied entering the turn and dropped back four wide. SPUNKY BOY was bumped then
checked at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
FAST FIXER stalked in the three path, was roused early into the turn, bid from the four path turning into the lane, took a narrow lead passing the eighth
pole, drifted out late, but held sway. WARLORD CRUZAN set the pace in the two path, tipped inside and was nudged along early around the turn, faced an
outer challenge while back in the two path entering the stretch, lost the lead passing the eighth pole, and fought on for place. ACAMAR raced off the pace in
the three path, was coaxed in the four path midway around the turn, angled inside at the top of the stretch, and was up for show. ON JET HEIR had an
awkward start, trailed in the two path, was under right handed encouragement around the turn, tipped out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and
finished evenly between foes. JOYFUL SURPRISE chased in the two path, received right handed cues in the three path passing the quarter, floated out to
the five path going into the stretch, and flattened in the final furlong. PARTNER TOURS rated inside, tipped out to the three path going the stretch, but did
not threaten.

CLASSIFY pressed the pace in the three path, drew clear nearing the quarter pole and widened while ridden out. TOP MAVERICK tracked the pace four
wide, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the quarter pole but stayed on to gain the place. ALCAZABA (IRE) raced in range two wide, could not
gain on the winner, fought on for the minor awards and just missed second. AUSTONIAN set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner nearing
the three-eighths marker, could not match strides with that foe, angled out in upper stretch and lost second late. DON'T ANSWER was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace four wide and never threatened. FIFTY ONE FIFTY was bumped at the start, raced two wide and was involved. BUFFALO SPIRIT had
his head turned at the start, chased the pace inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
STARSHIP AGENDA got bumped between foes at the start, chased in the five path, ranged up under a drive in the four path around the far turn, swept to
the lead while merging into the two path entering the lane, and was driven clear into the final furlong. QUEEN MACHA bumped with an outer foe at the start,
rated between foes in the three path, was stymied midway around the far turn, shifted out to the seven path entering the stretch, and kept on for place.
DEMOGORGON stalked in the five path, was coaxed in the three path early around the far turn, but evened out down the lane for show. MARIA'S
REVENGE raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. TO
THYSELF B TRUE tracked in the two path, was ridden from the rail into the far turn, tipped out to the four path going into the lane, but was no factor.
LALOBA FEROZ raced wellback along the rail, angled out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. TAMARINDO laid up
close in the four path, bid in the two path midway around the far turn, but faded into the stretch. KOTYLE bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced
towards the back of the field between foes in the three path and never threatened. MARGEAUX ROMANCE set the pace in the three path but gaveway
along the inside turning into the stretch.
