Footnotes
SANDERSON set a pressured pace while on the inside, was well handled and kicked clear leaving the turn, then remained clear to the wire to prove best,
driving. RAPTURE BAY was rated two to three wide while in between rivals, then dropped to the inside leaving the three sixteenths and finished well up the
inside to get the bob for the place award. MORTAL SIN was reserved early three to four wide, made s ix wide move by the quarter pole, continued that
move to the furlong marker but hung late, lost bob for the place. CITY LEADER pressed the pace three to two wide, then was roused off the turn but was
lugging in through the lane and faded. STARLIFTER was allowed to settle on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane for racing room
and had a mild late kick. MONEY IN MOTION was reserved early, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. GRAND KINGDOM was
well placed on the inside and weakened in the lane. CHACHACHING was five wide into the first turn, then shifted in and chased the pace three wide, but
weakened. EL DIVINO NINO prompted the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but then was empty in the lane. SCENIC MOON steadied into
the first turn on the inside and then failed to respond.

Footnotes
GINGER GIRL tracked the early pace from the inside, eased off the inside to advance two wide while in hand nearing upper stretch, then was right behind
the dueling leaders off the turn, angled in by the furlong marker and made a bid to kick clear to prove best, driving. SISTREN was rated three wide, made a
three wide bid on the turn and dueled for command off the turn, won that duel but could not go with the winner late, second best. THENCOMEMORNING
pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn, then dueled for the lead off the turn and weakened the final furlong, bested rest.
GWYNEDD chased the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. SULLIVAN STREET was settled on the inside, shifted out two wide
leaving the turn and had no rally. LOTTACLASS LILSASS was void of early speed, swung out seven wide for the drive and passed the tiring rivals.
THUNDER BOSS stumbled at the start, went up to set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way after five furlongs. DONNA'S COURAGE chased the
pace four wide and tired. MARTHARITA was settled back early on the inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FLASH IS BACK was settled early, advanced in hand between rivals nearing the quarter pole, tacked out four wide when straightened and closed well to
draw away late to prove best, driving. CASINO TRICKS dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid to shake clear, but was caught in deep stretch,
held place award. STRONG FINISH tracked the pace along the inside, made a bid on the inside and was gaining but needed more, held show award. SIR
LANCE broke outwardly at the start, stalked the pace four to three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but hung in the lane, missed show award. WIN
NO JOKE was reserved early on the inside, swung out six wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally. BUBBA CHROME was settled back early, worked
way to the inside on the turn, cut the corner leaving the turn and then angled out in the lane and had a belated rally while in traffic late. CRAZY ODDS
chased the pace on the inside and had no kick while racing evenly. MALIBU COWBOY was reserved early, came eight wide into the lane and had no rally.
JUDY'S ARMY was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and weakened in the drive. IRISH WARLOCK was off a step slow, came widest into the
lane and was not a threat. HAMPDEN LANE chased the early pace two wide and then steadied by the seven sixteenths and fell back. UNCLE REMI dueled
for the early lead on the outside and gave way.

Footnotes
BACKATYA set the pace on the inside and shook clear on the turn, then was kept mild right handed crop pressure to remain clear to prove best. INSIDE
STUNT stalked the early pace three wide, then tracked the pace two wide on the turn, ran on willingly to be clearly second best, no match to the winner.
HERE AND NOFURTHER tracked the early pace four wide, then three wide on the turn but faded in the drive, bested rest. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO was
rated back on the inside, came four wide into the lane to pass the tiring rivals. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD chased the pace in between rivals, then was two
wide on the turn and weakened. BOWIE TWO STEP tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. HIS ROYAL G steadied shortly after the start and then
failed to respond.

Footnotes
SCORPIA showed good early speed to the inside, then rated off the duel, two wide on the turn in hand, then made a bid in the lane and drew clear the final
sixteenth to prove best, sharp. MAYFLY dueled for the early lead, made a bid to draw clear on the turn and drop to the inside, then was caught in the furlong
grounds and proved to be no match for the winner, second best. THIS COUNTRY was settled on the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn, then
drifted in through the lane while on the left lead despite left handed crop, green. SOMETHING WICKED was off slowly, then reserved and saved ground on
the turn, then made a mild bid on the inside but needed more. IRISH RAGE was reserved two to three wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn
and had no rally. DATAW ISLAND was settled early on the outside, three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. NORMAL was settled between rivals and
weakened. RISKY BEESNESS dueled for the lead on the outside, then got out on the turn, then was corrected nearing the five sixteenths and weakened.
GHOSTLY ANNA was off a step slow and had no response.

WAIT FOR TOMORROW set the early pace on the inside, drew off on the turn, then widened the margin in the drive while being ridden out after one pop
right handed with the crop by the furlong marker. FLINNY TIN TIN stalked the winner two wide early, then chased that rival on the turn and proved to be no
match while staying on to be second best. NO WALK INTHE PARK was off a step slow, then was reserved early on the inside, saved ground on the turn,
then finished well on the inside to up up for the show award. SIPPIN' TIME chased the pace between rivals and weakened. R B'S BIG MOMENT chased the
early pace on the inside and weakened. MARTHA'S HEART chased the pace four wide and tired. CUNDI raced in the two path and failed to menace.
BRASSIC was reserved early, three wide on the turn and failed to respond. PAMZ PALACE stumbled at the start and then was not a factor. LADY ON THE
GO was off slowly, then showed little.
