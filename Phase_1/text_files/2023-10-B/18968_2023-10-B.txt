Footnotes
THOMPSON stumbled a bit but still came away quickest, dueled from outside around the first turn, chased VERITAS AEQUITAS up the backstretch, bid
between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled inside UNCLE JUJU around that bend, shook free entering the stretch and widened under a drive.
RINGTONE stalked three wide then moved into the two path, angled to the inside and was coaxed along into the far turn, tipped three wide and was asked
around the bend, moved out further in the lane and bested the rest. VERITAS AEQUITAS broke cleanly but was asked to get going early and hustled up to
the front from inside, dueled around the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, challenged by a pair of rivals into the far turn, lost command with three
furlongs left to run, chased the leaders to the stretch, weakened in the lane but churned on to save the show honors. UNCLE JUJU got brushed from inside
and had the rider lose his iron briefly at the start before regaining footing, prominent early into the first turn then got put in tight between rivals and had to
take up, moved out to the three path, chased up the backstretch, bid three deep into the far turn, dueled outside THOMPSON around that bend, could not
kick on with the winner entering the stretch and weakened down the lane. SCREAMING VIRGINIA brushed lightly with UNCLE JUJU leaving the gate,
trailed two wide then along the rail early, angled four wide around the second bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISS MONARCH BAY broke well from outside but was quickly taken in hand and tucked inside at the back, eased off the fence to the three path while
trailing on the far turn, angled widest in the lane, unleashed a rally and reeled in THIRTY CARATS late under strong hand urging. THIRTY CARATS stepped
to the front and controlled the pace along the inside through the early going, met the bid from outer rival on the far turn, cleared when roused in upper
stretch, put to right handed urging shortly after, switch to the left hand midstretch but could not fend off the winner in the late stages. MAKE IT SNOW
reserved two wide then near the inside on the first turn, went two wide into the second bend, moved out and entered the lane four wide, finished willingly
through the stretch run and earned the show honors. MACHIAVELLIQUE stalked in the two path, bid outside THIRTY CARATS on the far turn, failed to kick
on with that rival in upper stretch but stayed on through the furlong grounds. BEAUTIFUL BOLT stalked three then two wide on the clubhouse turn,
remained off the rail and took aim three deep entering the stretch but finished evenly in the late stages. HAPPY HAPPY was off slow to begin, stalked on the
inside, pushed on through the second bend, remained on the fence through the drive racing within striking distance but needed to find more late.

Footnotes
VIOLENT RUNNER prompted the pace two wide, kept the pressure on down the lane, dug in past the sixteenth pole and proved best late. ICE DANCING
set the pace with VIOLENT RUNNER applying to the pressure, maintained a short lead through the turn and into the lane, carried the advantage still battling
with winner into the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly late. DOINITTHEHARDWAY stalked the top pair off the inside, rounded the bend in the three path,
finished willingly to gain from outside late but could not summon the needed final kick. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH trailed up the backstretch and moved inside,
saved ground to the lane, then angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. OUTSIDE THE LAW had to steady early and climbed for a bit when
DOINITTHEHARDWAY crossed in front, tracked four wide into the turn while out of range, remained wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CIRCLE OF TRUST reserved in the two path, advanced three deep in the middle stages, bumped with inner rival into the far turn, drew closer around the
bend and bid three deep entering the stretch, kicked clear midstretch and held safely under steady handling late. BLUE OASIS tracked in the two path
outside a rival, went between foes on the backstretch, bumped with rivals on both sides into the far turn, continued to give chase in the two path to the lane,
lacked room behind the leaders in upper stretch, altered out with a furlong remaining, finished gamely in deep stretch but could not get to the winner.
VISUALLY settled inside off the pace, moved outside a rival on the backstretch, took the second bend two then three wide and gained the show. AVOIR
broke out and brushed rival, forwardly placed three deep on the first turn, flanked the leader from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn
and took over leaving the bend, put away inner rival with a furlong left to run but overtaken by CIRCLE OF TRUST past the eighth pole and weakened late.
GLO GLO showed good early speed to take control from inside, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled with AVOIR around the far turn, lost command
leaving the bend and weakened in the furlong grounds. AMELIA BLEU bumped by AVOIR leaving the gate, tracked from inside early on, got blocked by
MOTET and had to check entering the far turn, tipped out to the two path and could not rally. NAKOTA (IRE) was off slow to begin, tucked inside while
lagging behind, trailed from the fence to the stretch, moved out in the lane and was not a factor. MOTET raced up close in the two path early, pressed briefly
between into the backstretch then dropped back to a stalking position and moved inside, got bumped, put in tight while brushing the rail and took up into the
far turn, saved ground to the lane had little left for the stretch. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE RUNNING INTO THE FAR TURN. AFTER A
REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CIRCLE OF TRUST FROM FIRST TO LAST FOR DRIFTING IN AND FORCING BLUE OASIS INTO MOTET,
CAUSING MOTET TO TAKE UP AND COSTING HER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
CANELO attended the pace three deep, roused on the far turn, took over past the quarter pole, cleared inner rivals entering the stretch, led under left
handed encouragement into deep stretch and held safely. STAR PROSPECT steadied a bit between rivals while three wide on the first turn, went to wide
into the second bend, spun four wide into the lane, finished willingly and edged TAKE CHARGE CURLY for the place honors. TAKE CHARGE CURLY got
brushed by inner rival while two wide early on the clubhouse turn, chased near the inside then two wide into the lane and got outkicked for second. TOP
GUN CLASSIC came away well but dropped back quickly on the inside, moved out and rounded the far turn four wide, summoned a mild rally and rounded
out the superfecta. ALL THE KING'S MEN dueled for command from outside, vied between rivals at the quarter pole, failed to kick on with the winner
entering the lane and weakened in the furlong grounds. CATHEDRAL LIGHT bumped with inner rival at the start, chased four wide early, remained well off
the rail into the far turn, driven three wide into the lane, found the rail in the stretch and lacked a rally. WARRENS WORLD bumped with CATHERDRAL
LIGHT at the start, went up to duel from inside, ridden along into the far turn, asked left handed around the bend, chased the top pair into the lane and faded
out of contention. TIZ TOK stumbled leaving the gate, caught five wide chasing around the first turn then dropped back off the pace, had a couple rivals beat
on the second bend, cut the corner into the lane and failed to menace. ROAD OF LOVE brushed with outer rival early on the first turn, dropped back into the
far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and tired.

FAVORITISM set the pace under from outer rivals, asked leaving the turn in the two path, cleared outside the eighth pole and drew away while flagged with
the crop in deep stretch. TAPALO bobbled leaving the gate, pressed the pace four deep up the backstretch, stayed alongside the leader around the turn,
lost contact with a furlong left to run and held the place. SCHWARZMEIER broke a step slow and got bothered by outer rival leaving the gate, chased three
deep off the pace into the turn, asked around the bend and came four wide into the lane and finished evenly late. SHARPAZANO pressed between up the
backstretch, chased three then two wide into the drive and weakened. GAVEA raced up close from inside, roused at the quarter pole, cut the corner into the
stretch and weakened. ELIGIO chased between rivals off the pace, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane and failed to
menace. RIGHT IN FRONT broke a step slow, trailed wide up the backstretch, took the turn five wide and was not a factor. MIDNIGHT LOVE chased from
inside out of range early, dropped back around the bend, entered the lane two wide and came up empty.
