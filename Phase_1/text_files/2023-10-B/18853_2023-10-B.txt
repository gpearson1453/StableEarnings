Footnotes
UTAMARO drifted out while going to the front early then angled in near the seven-eighths, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe while off the rail, vied in
the two path while asked on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a right-handed crop, drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop approaching the
furlong marker, went back to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and extended the advantage while kept to the task. MUNNY FOR NUTHIN was
taken under restraint early then rated just off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner while remaining on his inside
lead in the stretch and safely secured the place. KENTUCKY JOKER bumped with a rival at the start then jostled with that foe, was forwardly placed on the
outside, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging, chased in the six path on the turn, lugged inward under extra right-rein pressure in the stretch and
weakened but was clear for the show. WAFLR broke out and bumped with a foe, was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back near the half-mile
pole, was urged three to four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. PERFECT OUTCOME bumped with a foe just after the start, prompted the
pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased in the five path through the turn, brushed with a foe while between horses in upper
stretch and tired. ACADEMY CHOICE showed speed on the outside of a foe, vied in the four path while asked on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch
then brushed with a foe and capitulated. SINALOA bobbled after the start then bumped with rivals on both sides, jostled with a foe shortly thereafter, settled
at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GUN SONG coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied between foes to
take narrow command just inside the eighth pole, dug in gamely to hold sway and prevail at the end. VALUE AREA struck the off side stall at the start
getting away last and conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five wide advancing on the front midway on the turn, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command heads apart from a pair a furlong out, got headed just
inside that station and fought on to the finish to secure the place honors. DON'T SAY IT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under threat from a pair and was collared a furlong out, battled on latched on inside the top two through to the wire. STREET VIEW coaxed from the start,
chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened. PROGENY chased along the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. MATAGORA BAY struck the near side stall at the start and was away
a half a beat slow when placed to coaxing, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
MORNING CUP pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch, responded well in the
final fulrong and proved best under steady handling. GUN MAESTRO went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside while off the rail, vied
in the three path on the turn, dropped to the two path near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and was outfinished while just able to hold
the place. M B'S MUNNING broke a half-step slow, was coaxed along just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, made a rail near the rail
outside the quarter-pole, pursued the top two into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place. MAKAR
charged the front of the gate just prior to the start, hit the front of the stall doors and was off slow, moved out then advanced while urged along on the
outside, went five then four wide on the turn and came up empty. WITH KNOW NAME was off a half-step slow, dropped to the rear under urging, went three
wide on the turn and was no factor. ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while inside to
the two path on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
COOL QUARTET was well spotted just off the pace, came under encouragement while stalking in the four path on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch,
made an outside bid while remaining on his left lead, swapped to the proper lead while taking the advantage into the final furlong and drew clear under
steady handling. DURKIN'S CALL was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace while in hand, made a bid in the five path on the turn, took the lead at the
quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. GOLDINI
was forwardly placed on the outside, went six wide on the turn, was roused late on that bend then driven seven wide into the stretch and weakened but was
clear for the show. FORTY TWO ACE was coaxed to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost the
lead at the quarter-pole and tired. HANG TIGHT settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to
threaten. DONTBELATE bumped with a foe at the start, disputed the pace, vied in the three path on the turn and capitulated. LORD GATLING settled
towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. DATESFREEDOM bumped with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, was urged
two then three wide on the turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
THUNDERIAN tracked the pace, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the four path on the turn, led into upper stretch, dueled inside of the runner-up
to the finish and gamely prevailed. BROOKLYN DIAMONDS was forwardly placed on the outside, chased five then four wide on the turn, gained to make a
bid into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner to the finish and was denied while clear for the place. MEMPHIS climbed some early then dropped well
back, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was along for the show. MAGICAL WAYS was well placed just off the pace,
chased inside on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. ICE ROAD raced
just off the pace, chased three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. WHAT'S UP DOC settled off the
pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, came six wide into upper stretch and failed
to rally. CLUBHOUSE disputed the pace on the backstretch, vied three then two wide on the turn and tired. BERLONE prompted the pace on the inside,
vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. RALLY SQUIRREL disputed the pace between horses, dropped back in the
two path on the turn and retreated. BARON'S LEGACY angled in at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
ASHBURN ALLEY disputed the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, remained on her left lead in the drive and
proved much the best under steady urging. PHOTO FINISH was urged along off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn,
came five wide into upper stretch, moved in inside the furlong marker and got up for the place. BOOK OF WISDOM was urged along off the pace, went
three wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and just lost the place. TAVIN was hustled from the gate, contested the pace between horses, vied
in the three path on the turn and weakened. BEACH CRUISER bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand briefly near the five-eighths then chased
the pace, angled from the two path to the five path on the turn and came up empty. MISS BOURBON brushed the outside of the gate at the start, was urged
along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and also came up empty. LA INDECENTE was coaxed along off the pace,
saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. GOING FOR GLORY broke a bit slow then dropped back, angled in under urging at the rear, went three
wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MY KINDA MISCHIEF bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two
path, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. MYSARIA was urged along off the pace, fell back fast late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the
two path and was no factor.
