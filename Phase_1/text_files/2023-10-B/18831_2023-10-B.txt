Footnotes
TALES OF HOME chased the pace along the inside through the turn, bid into the lane while still along the rail, caught the leader just inside the eighth pole
then held off the runner-up while drifting from the inside to the four path late. CHANISA chased the pacesetter while in the three path through the turn, bid
into the lane, was closing in on the pace while still in the three or four path, continued with good energy while being outfinished by the winner. STELLAR
LILY was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and was gaining to the end. METHODOLOGY raced in the two path through
the turn and into the lane then gained belatedly while well off the inside. SEACHROME set a fast pace to be clear at once and remain clear into the lane,
was headed inside the eighth pole and folded up. LADY MERCEDES never a factor while racing near the back through the turn from the two path, angled
into the five path for the drive and never was a factor. LONG BLACK VEIL never a menace while in the four path through the turn and into the lane.

Footnotes
DEE DEE B was unhurried while in the two path, gained momentum through the far turn, moved to near the rail into the lane, guided back to the three path
when gaining on the leader, caught that one inside the eighth pole then drove past and cleared. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE saved ground into the far turn, bid
from near the rail into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clearly second best. TOUR
DE' PORT bumped at the start, raced in the four path into the far turn, bid after mid-turn, continued in the five path into the lane and moved up a spot while
not a threat. LUCKY ANA was in the three path into the turn when never far back, was close up through mid-turn, continued in the three or four path then
faded. ENGLISH CHARM chased the clear pacesetter down the backstretch, inherited the lead near the five-eighths pole from a tiring leader, continued on
top through the turn and into the lane then gave way while near the inside. SOUTHERN MESA was far back from the outset and passed tired ones late.
LASS QUISTMAS steadily faded while off the inside. CANGUA hustled to the pace at once, set a clear lead down the backstretch and was done nearing the
five-eighths pole. The one-mile time was omitted due to a timer malfunction.

FALABELLA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, bid from between rivals in late turn, dropped to the inside while looking as if she were beaten while
straightening in the lane ,stayed on gamely through the final eighth and inched up while drifting off the inside late. MIDNIGHT ANGEL stalked the
pacesetters while in the three or four path into the turn, bid three wide in late turn, gained the lead while dropping into the two path into the lane, looked in
control approaching the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe. MITOLE'S BAYTOWN set the pace while under pressure into the turn, dueled with
the two top ones into the lane then could not keep up. OUR GIRL FLINT was in the three path into the turn, bid in late turn, was still a contender into the
lane then weakened late. FROSTY TALE chased the pace from the four path down the backstretch and was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
STARLET EXPRESS settled off the early pace into the turn, bid from the two path in late turn, continued to inch up into the lane, gained the lead just inside
the eighth pole then was under a hand drive to the wire while widening. BEREA set the early pace to be clear in mid-turn, was challenged into the lane by
the winner, could not stay with that one inside the eighth pole then stayed on while well clear of the next rival. SKYS IMAGE was unhurried while off the
inside, came into the lane from the four or five path, was looking to split rivals nearing the eighth pole when put in tight and jostled, continued to split the
rivals and moved up for the minor share. ANJAWAY was near the rail through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from near the inside, came
off the rail after entering the lane then moved up while not a serious menace. Z'S LUCKY GIRL raced five wide through the turn when not far back, came in
the lane from the six path and never was a menace. BREAKUP WITH TITOS was close up early while in the two path then tired. DULCE VICTORIA
pressed the pace two wide into the turn, continued close up through the turn then was empty turning into the lane. LEXI SUN was three wide through the
turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from the seven path and tired. AJIC JAY was outrun while off the inside. LILMISS SASSYPANTS chased the
pace three or four wide through the turn when a contender then was empty straightening in the lane.
