Footnotes
AN ARMY OF LIGHT away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the clear leader in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid from
just off the rail entering the final turn, and drove up inside of EARS TO US when that rival drifted out entering the lane, quickly took control and drew clear
late. EARS TO US away well and rushed to a clear lead while racing three wide into the first turn, widened his advantage in the run down the backside and
into the final turn, drifted five wide entering the lane and was quickly overtaken by AN ARMY OF LIGHT, and finished four out from the rail in the drive to
hold the place. TUXEDO broke sharply, but was allowed to settle well off the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the
final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive. DIVAANY settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EH TEE EM unhurried early, while
dropping well behind the rest of the field in the run to the first turn, remained well back throughout, and was never seriously persevered with.

SPACE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail through the stretch
the first time and in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle from the inside of STORMY BLUE into the final turn, began to get the better of his pace
rival leaving the turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. STORMY BLUE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of SPACE
entering the stretch the first time, continued to battle with that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, struggled to keep pace with that
rival leaving the turn, but closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove second best. STAR ENTRY away well and stalked the dueling leaders through the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and closed willingly from
along the rail in the drive to garner a share. BOITANO stalked the battling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two wide from between
rivals, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to just miss the
show spot. ITSMYDAY stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a three wide trip from a stalking
trip in the run down the backstretch, was asked to keep up from midway down the backstretch, but faded over the final furlong.

GOOD BYE PUTIN settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, shifted five wide for the drive, and closed steadily to be up in time. FAMILY BIZ away
well and stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, pulled his way into a tracking trip in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside while awaiting room through the final turn, slipped through along the inside of QUAGMIRE entering the lane, and closed with a rush
to just miss. PARKER POINT away alertly and tracked the pacesetter one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while holding on for a share. QUAGMIRE broke sharply and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of PARKER POINT in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late. FORT LANGLEY stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied
smartly three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon in the lane. SLEW'S DA BOSS unhurried early while
trailing the field through the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final

ARTISTIC JEWLER tracked the leader into the backstretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position through the stretch the
second time, slipped through at the rail to challenge from the lead leaving the third turn, opened aa clear advantage through the final turn, and was never
threatened late while under confident handling. JOCK TALK unhurried early while racing well behind the field in the run down the backstretch the first time,
continued to bide his time at the back of the pack through the stretch the second time, began to take up the chase in the run down the backstretch the final
time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide from between rivals in the drive to get up for the place. YOU DON'T OWN ME

through the second turn and through the stretch the second time, was collared by ARTISTIC JEWLER from along the rail leaving the third turn, chased that
rival three wide into the final turn, was no match for her over the final furlong, but closed willingly five wide in the drive to garner a share. LAUGH WITH ME
tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position through the stretch and into the
third turn, dropped to the rail in the run down the backside the final time, commenced his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished
late while finishing at the rail in the drive. BARNEY GOOGLE settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch the first
time, maintained his position through the stretch the second time, dropped back to trail in the run down the backside the final time, and failed to menace.

rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed three
wide while drifting out in deep stretch to hold on for a share. MAKEITORBREAKIT pressed the pace from the outside of AVE'S IN COMMAND entering the
stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and closed five wide in the drive while

position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. FRANKIE MACHINE settled well off the contested

no match when tackled by KNOPFLER in the lane, but finished gamely to hold the place. EYE BE SEEING YOU tracked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to garner a share. DRILLER

rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. SOMTHING ELUSIVE
settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with
interest four wide in the drive. DEPUTY'S DANCER away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. SELF SERVING unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. ANOTHER GUINNESS broke
outwards at the start, and raced into a tracking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground into the final turn, but weakened
