Footnotes
CASTLE LEOCH reserved in the beginning and moved into the two path, saved ground around the far turn before swing out into approaching the stretch,
rallied four deep in the furlong grounds and proved best late. EASTERN OCEAN stalked along the inside, tipped out on the far turn and took aim three wide
into the stretch, launched a bid with a furlong left to run, fought between rivals in deep stretch, had the rider lose his crop late and was outkicked by the
winner. MARGOT'S BOY set the pace from inside under pressure, headed around the far turn, dueled in stretch and yielded late. FLAVIUS bobbled leaving
the gate, went up to press the pace in hand two wide, headed the leader on the far turn, fought through the lead and weakened late. TAISHAN tracked in
the three path, went two then three wide around the far turn, got floated out exiting the bend and weakened. LIBERAL (IRE) broke well then settled at the
back on the inside, tipped two wide for the far turn, eased further out around the bend then angled five wide into the stretch, offered no response in the lane
and walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
RUFF RIDE brushed outer rival at the start, tucked inside at the back into the first turn, moved into range in the middle stages, split foes then tipped out and
chased three deep at the quarter pole, took aim three wide into the lane, drew alongside the leader in upper stretch, dueled into the final furlong and edged
away in deep stretch. BIG NOVEL prominent early three wide on the first turn then pressed from outside, challenged on the far turn and cleared past the
five-sixteenths pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch, met the challenge from RUFF RIDE in upper stretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. TIZZY
TWISTER stalked two wide then moved inside on the first turn, shifted back to the two path on the far turn, chased within striking distance through the lane
but could not find the needed late kick. RENEGADE PRINCESS tracked four then three wide early, remained wide and came four wide into the stretch and
weakened. SWEET HELLO took control from inside then moved into the two path around the clubhouse turn, showed the way with BIG NOVEL alongside
up the backstretch, offered no resistance when tested by that rival on the far turn and gave way. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY brushed leaving the gate,
chased three then two wide around the first turn, trailed up the backstretch and through the far turn, eased off the rail leaving that bend to enter the lane
three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BRAZENLY coaxed from the gate then paused when EL ORO (FR) started to move inward, began to climb and steered out wide, rallied four then five wide
around the bend, closed in on the leader while drifting inward, brushed with that rival late and drove past. K P KWEST dueled for command from outside,
put inner rival away at the top of the stretch, challenged by BRAZENLY with a sixteenth to go, drifted out and brushed that rival late and was overtaken.
RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) was off a bit slow to begin, trailed on the inside into the turn, steered out and came four wide into the lane, moved out further and
was along for a clear third. PLAY CHICKEN chased off the rail then between rivals into and around the bend, called upon in the lane and failed to produce a
bid. DIVINE RASCAL broke alertly and went up to duel with K P KWEST early, fought with that rival around the turn, lost touch entering the stretch and
weakened in the lane. TRUSTY RUSTY chased under coaxing outside a rival then three deep into the turn, remained outside rivals around the bend and
weakened in the sretch. EL ORO (FR) stalked the top pair from inside, saved ground to the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
CRIBBAGE BOARD dueled for the lead outside RED FALCON, inched ahead around the bend, cleared with a furlong remaining and held gamely in the
end. JOHN DUNBAR broke a hair slow and was coaxed to a forward position from inside, tried to sneak up the rail leaving the turn but lacked room entering
the stretch, tipped out at the eighth pole, finished gamely between and got up for second. GRAND TIGER chased two wide into the turn, ridden along while
tipping out around the bend, took aim three wide into the stretch, finished willingly down the lane but could not summon the needed final kick. RED FALCON
dueled for command from inside, could not keep pace with the leader entering the final furlong, stayed on well from inside but was outkicked for the place
and show. BARTON STRONG allowed to settle at the back, advanced four to five wide around the bend but could not find more in the furlong grounds.
LOGON TO WIN tracked three wide into the turn, had to alter in from behind BEYOND COMPARE at the five-sixteenths pole, brushed with outer rival at the
top of the stretch and failed to rally. KING ZOG settled outside a rival, went four wide into the turn, bumped with BEYOND COMPARE at the quarter pole,
steered down to the two path, brushed with LOGON TO WIN at the three-sixteenths pole and could not rally. BEYOND COMPARE forwardly placed early,
chased three deep into the turn, shifted in at the five-sixteenths pole, bumped with KING ZOG and checked at the quarter pole and was not persevered with
in the lane.

Footnotes
TIERGARTEN rated along the inside behind the pacesetter, tipped two wide on the far turn, dove back inside in upper stretch, challenged outer rivals from
the fence and proved best under a drive. OLE SILVER dueled into the first turn while moving inside, took control around the bend, controlled the pace under
some pressure on the backstretch, headed on the far turn and lost command to CORNEILIA FORT, battled back to regain the advantage with a furlong
remaining, finished gamely through deep stretch but was outkicked by the winner. CORNELIA FORT dueled outside OLE SILVER into the first turn then
chased from outside around the bend, moved up to apply pressure again in the middle stages, headed the leader on the far turn and put a nose in front, lost
command at the eighth pole, battled through the final furlong and got outkicked. FREEDOM LASS stalked three deep in the early going, challenged the top
pair from outside midway around the far turn, fought four deep into deep stretch and faltered late. SHARED FUTURE up close three deep then shifted into
the two path to stalk the pace, traveled between rivals up the backstretch, angled in on the far turn after losing positions and weakened in the lane. NEVER
SWAY sat off the pace on the inside, moved out and moved into range two then three wide but flattened out in the drive.

Footnotes
SIGNORA MINISTER pressed between rivals to the turn, raced on even terms with UNWRITTEN CODE around the bend and took over at the quarter pole,
held a short lead over CRIMSON ROSE through the lane, brushed with that rival outside the sixteenth pole and held gamely to the wire. CRIMSON ROSE
pressed the pace three deep, kept the pressure on SIGNORA MINISTER down the lane, brushed that rival at the sixteenth pole and could not get by.
PROFESSORS' PRIDE stalked the leaders two wide into the turn, eased out and came four wide into the stretch, kept on through the lane and earned the
show honors. UNWRITTEN CODE set the pace inside a pair of rivals, fought with outer pair around the bend, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole, could
not kick on with leaders in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. BELLA RENELLA raced in range early, traveled three wide into the turn,
spun five wide off the bend and weakened. INDY'S STAR traveled at the back on the inside, steered out and came four wide into the lane and failed to
menace. TAPIT DOUX traveled outside a rival at the back early on, exited the bend four wide, angled in at the top of the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DANIEL'S MAGIC reserved in the early stages, went two wide around the bend, chased between rivals then angled in, rallied along the fence and nailed
NOBLE REFLECTION at the wire. NOBLE REFLECTION bumped inner rival at the start then sprinted clear under a hold early, took pressure from outside
on the turn, maintained a short lead over I'm A GAMBLER (IRE) through the lane but got nailed by DANIEL'S MAGIC on the line. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) got
bumped back at the start, trailed on the inside, tipped out with a quarter mile left to run, came three wide into the lane and surged between rivals to gain
third. VANTASTIC traveled two wide outside a rival into the turn, angled out approaching the dirt crossing, rallied widest in the lane but got outclosed. I'M A
GAMBLER (IRE) stalked three wide into the turn, challenged from outside around the bend, drifted out into the stretch, kept the pressure into the final
furlong and failed to summon the needed late kick. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) stalked the pace from inside, moved out for the stretch, finished willingly but
got bothered by I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out to the wire. RADICAL RIGHT sat off the pace and moved inside, saved
ground through the turn, angled out at the eighth pole and was not a factor. PERFECT FLIGHT chased three deep into the turn, four wide into the drive and
weakened.

Footnotes
MIRACLE MARK took control early and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch and stayed clear under a drive. NESSO'S LASTHARRAH antsy in the
gate, stalked in the two path, took aim two wide through the far turn, lacked the needed late kick in the furlong grounds and held the place. GUY NAMED
JOE brushed outer rival at the start, steadied out of a tight spot between rivals entering the first turn, traveled two wide outside a rival off the pace, tipped
three wide with a quarter mile remaining, closed fast through the lane and missed second. TRIBAL pulled along the inside early then settled off the pace,
saved ground through the second bend, angled out in the lane and finished willingly before steadying near the wire. MAXIMUM CAPACITY stalked from
inside, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, moved out in the drive and lacked a bid. AMBIGUOUS chased two wide into the first turn then shifted out to the
three path, raced near the back up the backstretch, angled to the inside leaving the far turn and failed to threaten. DEALERS SPECIAL became fractious in
the gate, came away slow, pulled early and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. SINE QUA NON was off slow and brushed to
begin, trailed to the stretch and failed to make an impact. TRACK AND FIELD broke a step slow from outside, tracked in the two path, pushed on through
the far turn and weakened in the stretch run.
