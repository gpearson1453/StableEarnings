Footnotes
LUCKY JEREMY set the pace in the two path as an outer rival prompted, led turning for home as an outer rival attempted a bid, then shook clear in upper
stretch and held sway. WISTUCKY stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, responded to rousing around the bend to range up nearing the
lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, yet kept on well to prove second best. RUN JALEN RUN took contact from rivals on both sides at the start,
pursued from the three path into the turn, picked up stride between horses turning for home, fanned to the five path entering the lane, gained show in upper
stretch and fended off an inner bidder late. CLOTH OF GOLD bumped an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, moved up between
horses in the four path in midstretch but was denied reaching show by an outer rival. MOHAWK RIVER bobbled a bit at the start, chased along the inside
and faded in the final furlong. WISH CAREFULLY chased in the five path and faded. BOURBON BOSS prompted the leader from the three path, but was
outmoved by an outer bidder turning for home and weakened between horses in upper stretch. DANCING NOAH brushed an inner rival at the start and
made little impact from the two path. BIBI BOSS broke slowly, trailed, attempted to gain in the three to four path around the turn but was outrun.
COALPOWER showed little.

Footnotes
BYE BYE LIAM pursued from midpack along the inside, stayed on to close in on the tiring embattled leading pair in the final furlong as an outer rival did the
same, outside of them at the sixteenth pole, flopped leads and sustained a bid between horses coming to the wire and was up in time. BOWSTREET set the
pace in the two path, met an outer challenge at the three furlong pole, dueled turning for home, clung to an advantage through midstretch, began to inch
away from his counterpart leaving the sixteenth pole but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. ORANGE DIABLO took light contact between rivals at the
start, pursued the main group into the turn, gained four wide around the bend, stayed on along with an inner rival through the final furlong, closed in on the
tiring leader's while chasing that foe's bid in the final sixteenth and missed reaching place. LINZER stalked two wide, bid in the three path at the three
furlong pole, dueled turning for home and through midstretch, but yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. COOKN WIT CATMAN broke awkwardly
and slow, lacked speed in the two path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and moved up. GOOD LORD tracked in the three path, chased between
horses turning for home and weakened. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC made little impact from the three path. PUCKSTER broke a step slow and steadied hard after
being squeezed between horses at the start, lagged behind in the four path and was outrun. OZONE chased in the two path and weakened between horses
entering the lane.

Footnotes
COASTAL INVASION bumped an inner rival at the start, showed the way before shifting down to the two path approaching the turn, met an outer challenge
from BLUE SQUALL turning for home, gamely clung to an advantage while exchanging brushes in midstretch, then inched away in the final fifty yards.
BLUE SQUALL leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide, sparked a duel with the pace setter while bidding in the three path turning for
home, exchanged contact while sparring through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth and narrowly saved place. TANYA SHOWERS broke a step
slow, pursued from midpack three wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, then offered a good late kick in the final furlong to miss reaching place.
CLEAR VOICE bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, chased the dueling leaders while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, yet kept on
along with an outer rival to re-close the gap in the final sixteenth. CHILLED was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace in the four

Footnotes
TOASTED ROLL tugged clear in the three to two path around the first turn, settled into stride with a loose margin entering the backstretch, maintained a
clear advantage into the far turn, padded the margin entering the lane, but began to tire in the final furlong, weakened in the final sixteenth, was collared by
an outer bidder at the wire but narrowly lasted. ROSELEE MAY tracked in the three path, chased the clear leader around the far turn, pulled away from the
rest while pursuing in the final furlong, closed in quickly as the leader weakened in the final sixteenth, bid at the wire but just came up short. SPEAK UP
settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and ran on while hanging on her
left lead. YAMMY YAMMY BELLA trailed around both turns, cut the gap nearing the lane before tipping to the three path and moved up between horses.
WITHOUT CAUSE laid off of the pace in the three to two path, moved forward between horses down the backstretch, chased behind mild traffic around the
far turn, then flattened out between horses. TURINO pursued from midpack in the four path, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. WILLOWY
stalked inside of a rival while a bit off of the rail, chased along the fence around the far turn and weakened. BIG DREAMER pursued from midpack in the
three to two path, then inside down the backstretch, but faded turning for home and was eased through the final furlong. TAZAWAKO (JPN) lacked speed in
the two to four path, but was through entering the lane and eased thereafter.

Footnotes
REAL MEN VIOLIN laid off of the pace along the inside, slipped through a narrow rail seam in upper stretch to gain place from outer rivals at the three
sixteenths pole, shifted outside of the clear leader entering midstretch, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. TRACK PHANTOM set the pace in
the two path, drew off in upper stretch, but met an outer challenge entering the final sixteenth and was bested late. TOP GUN ROCKET stalked in the four
path, brushed with an inner rival while chasing the clear leader in upper stretch and edged show. BOURBON'S FAULT prompted the leader from the three
path, failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, brushed with an outer foe in upper stretch and yielded between horses. BEYOND STOKED stalked
along the inside and from the pocket into the turn, but yielded between horses in upper stretch. MO' SPRESSO tracked two wide and between horses,
shifted out to the five path in upper stretch but lacked a rally. TENNESSEE leaned inwardly at the start, saved ground well back to no avail.
UNREASONABLE pursued from midpack in the five path and faded. HIGH ENOUGH broke awkwardly, raced towards the rear in the three path, trailed into
the turn and was outrun. MO RHODES was outrun in the six to five path.

Footnotes
SHARP TUNE broke slowly, tracked two wide and between horses into the turn, loomed a danger with run while blocked behind the leading trio turning for
home, tipped outside of them and to the five path in upper stretch, drove past under moderate urging at the furlong grounds, kicked clear and held safely
from an outer bidder late. BARBRATINA broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride fanning to the six path entering the lane,
bumped with an outer rival in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of the clearing leader in the final furlong, closed in on that one in the late stages but ran out of
ground. ZADORSKY pursued from midpack in the three path, got floated to the seven path by an inner rival entering the lane before bumping with that one
in upper stretch, yet ran on in the final furlong to edge show late. DONE ENOUGH prompted the top pair form the four path, bid entering the lane, vied
through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and gradually yielded. MYA'S HALO sparred for the lead two wide,
dueled between horses through upper stretch, but gave way in the final furlong. KRICKLE dueled for the lead inside of a vying rival while a path off of the rail
around the turn, sparred with a pair of rivals entering the lane, but yielded to an outer trio passing the furlong grounds. OUR KEEPSAKE leaned out at the
start, raced off of the pace in the four path and faded. TAKE CHARGE BABE trailed along the inside and never got involved. HIDDEN CLASS leaned out at
the start, stalked along the inside and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SNEAD was away awkwardly, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, came under urging shifting to the four path into the turn, tipped outside
of the leading quartet with multiple lengths to find in upper stretch, yet sustained a grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth pole and edged past. SPEEDTAIL
stalked close up in the two path, split foes to bid three wide and between horses entering the lane, gained an advantage in midstretch, but was bested by an
outer bidder in the final sixteenth. HONKY TONK HIGHWAY broke out and bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted three wide, bid while floated four
wide entering the lane, vied through midstretch, but yielded to the leader and an outer bidder leaving the sixteenth pole. FARM TEAM was bumped and
forced outwardly by an inner rival at the start, vied two wide, led with three furlongs to go, sparred between horses entering the lane as an outer pair offered
bids, but yielded at the furlong grounds. MIDNIGHT MAESTRO chased in the four to five path into the turn and gave way. LUKE bumped with an inner rival
at the start, lacked speed in the five to four path around the turn and made little impact. PHENOMENAL DREAM bumped with an outer rival before being
steadying back when put to crowded quarters by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses and failed to factor. CURLIN
GUNNER lagged behind into the turn and was outrun. NUMERO SIETE vied along the inside, shifted in slightly leaving the chute, sustained position while
headed around the turn, vied with an outer trio entering the lane, but faltered in hand at the furlong grounds and was eased thereafter. DIRBAS lacked
speed along the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
WEST SUNSET quickly established a clear margin early on, showed the way well in hand via a loose advantage around both turns, responded readily once
set down entering the lane, kicked away and was ridden out through the final furlong. GIN GIN broke step slow, pursued from midpack in the three path,
chased the clear leader from between horses while vying for place turning for home, then edged that position in upper stretch and safely fended off an outer
foe thereafter. V V'S DREAM broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer to vie for place outside of pair of rivals while chasing the
clear leader turning for home, but flattened out through the lane. CANDY LANDY tracked the clear leader from the two path, chased inside of place-bidding
foes around the far turn and weakened entering the lane. FLOORED trailed in the two to three path, fanned five wide entering the lane but lacked a rally.

OTTO THE CONQUEROR set the pace along the inside, then drew off entering the lane and was driven home to seal the deal. HONOR MARIE laid off of
the pace in the three to four path into the turn, gained in the five path turning for home, sustained progress to bid for place in midstretch and edged that
position in the final furlong. JUST STEEL shifted outside of rivals while pulling in the bit down the backstretch, pursued from midpack five wide into the turn,
ranged up four wide turning for home to take aim on the clearing leader entering the lane, but leveled off and lost place with a sixteenth to go. IRIDESCENT
vied outside of the eventual winner, but yielded between horses entering the lane. EPIC BATTLE laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three
path in upper stretch and moved up between horses. CALL ME ANDY stalked along the inside and weakened. BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX stalked four to
three wide, chased between horses while getting outmoved by an outer rival turning for home and gave way. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON took back from
crowded quarters between horses soon after the start, trailed in the two to three path and was outrun. GROUP TICKET prompted three wide and between
horses, but weakened entering the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
LIBERAL ARTS trailed in the three two to path, picked up stride surpassing outer rivals entering the lane, took aim outside of the top pair in upper stretch,
bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear while shifting outwardly. MOONLIGHT laid off of the pace in the two to three path, came under strong urging four
wide around the far turn, got outmoved by an inner rival in upper stretch, yet ran on into the final furlong and rallied to gain place late. INFORMED PATRIOT
tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped off the rail to take aim outside of the leader turning for home, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper
stretch, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, gave way and lost place in the closing stages. GETTYSBURG ADDRESS set a clear
pace, but met an outer challenge entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. NORTHERN FLAME stalked two
wide, chased in the three path and between horses around the far turn but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
LOOKSTER prompted along the inside before stalking an outer rival down the backstretch, bid along with outer rivals turning for home and kicked away in
upper stretch. PERFECT SHOT stalked three wide, bid between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with an inner rival in upper
stretch, chased and held place. FORESEEN hopped at the start, trailed, gained five wide turning for home, sustained progress in the seven path in upper
stretch and rallied to gain show at the sixteenth pole. PLAYBACK laid off of the pace three wide, chased between horses in upper stretch to vie for show into
the final furlong but was outkicked entering the final sixteenth. MY FAVORITE GIRL lacked speed, gained in the four path around the turn, but leveled off in
the six path between horses in upper stretch. PIN UP BETTY sped clear leaving the chute, but was headed inside of a trio of foes at the five sixteenths pole
and weakened. LADY MOSCATO tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the top trio turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch and faded between
horses while hanging on her left lead. C'EST CHEESE pursued two wide and between horses, then along the inside around the turn and faded. SASSY
PRINCESS lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. WINSOME BEAUTY never got involved two wide and between horses. ALDORA laid off
of the pace along the inside but weakened with three furlongs to go.
