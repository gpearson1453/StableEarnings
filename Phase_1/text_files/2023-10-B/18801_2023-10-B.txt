Footnotes
ROAD CALL far behind early, advanced inside to the stretch, split foes in the final eighth and was up in time. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE was urged just
off the pacesetter, led at the five sixteenths pole but was caught late. IT'S A PITY moved closer outside on the turn then, loomed a threat but was
outfinished. IM STILL BRAVE hustled to clear advantage to midway on the turn and tired. UPFOR PAROLE broke slowly, rushed up inside then finished
after half a mile. OUT ON THE TOWN lacked speed outside then passed rivals without menacing. UNION PARK raced wide off the leaders then faded
through the stretch. E T'S DEMON FIRE dropped back early and was never in contention. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN lagged far behind throughout.
CAUTELOSO prompted the pace outside down the backstretch and stopped. SHEA D CAPTURE raced wide throughout and was never a factor. RUN FOR
KARL lacked speed and weakened steadily. PER RULING 23281PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, ROAD CALL WAS DQ'D DUE
TO A VIOLATION OF THE HISA RULE OF SIX STRIKES.

HEXAGON vied outside, took over at the quarter pole and pulled away driving. COWBOY JIM lacked speed outside, moved very wide and rallied for the
place. UNION REWARD far behind early, split rivals in the stretch and closed well. STEERAGE earned a narrow lead along the inside and proved empty in
the stretch. SHARP SENSATION lacked speed and failed a solid rally. TIEMPO PERFECTO saved ground off the pace and faltered. DR. ROGER well
placed behind dueling leaders then gave way readily.

CHELSEA WALL settled close up near the inside, angled out on the final turn then pulled away under moderate pressure. SCOTT ALAIA raced off the
leaders, advanced wide into the stretch to gain the place. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED prompted the pace, moved briefly clear at the quarter pole then
weakened. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD led narrowly outside, was challenged from both sides and faded. LULI'S DANCER trailed saving ground then passed
fading rivals. PURE ELEGANCE chased three wide, bid closer before half a mile and gave way. CLASSY MISS lacked speed outside, continued wide and
lacked a rally. CONNELMAURA alternated for the advantage inside for three quarters and faltered.
