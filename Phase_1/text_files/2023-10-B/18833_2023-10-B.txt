Footnotes
LAKESIDE GETAWAY assumed the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and was under steady urging in the drive. DETERMINED LILLY , three wide
the first turn, moved up in the two path the far turn and chased the winner in an even effort. VANILLA BEAN raced along the inner rail down the backstretch,
swung four wide leaving the far turn and offered a slight rally. AMUNET had a three wide move mid way on the far turn, remained prominent to upper stretch
then weakened. CUSH EFFECT lacked speed, was in the two path the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. PASTA SALAD
RHONDA , never a factor, swung to the four path entering the stretch and passed tired foes. LITTLE NUTTER , snugly rated the opening three furlongs, was
within striking distance entering the far turn then weakened. HOPEFUL CURE , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four wide and was not a factor.
BESSIE BLUE , a forward factor along the inner rail for six furlongs, faltered.

Footnotes
DISPUTED NOTION rated off the pace while saving ground, gained along the rail nearing mid stretch, came out then edged up behind foes, altered back in
for room, surged between rivals while under strong handling and got up in the final yards. BY ITS ABSENCE edged up between runners nearing the turn
and took up closest pursuit, gave hard chase three wide into the lane, closed in under left handed asks, gained a slim lead inside the sixteenth marker,
battled gamely between foes but wasn't quite good enough. PRINS FIRE drifted in at the break forcing in KBCYA LATER, corrected and showed speed,
was shuffled back after a furlong, steadied leaving the half, regrouped to stalk inside, advanced along the rail past mid stretch, challenged for command in
deep stretch and finished gamely. TUNA N STAMPS , urged along off the rail chasing the pace, circled four to five wide into the lane, ranged up past mid
stretch the hung outside rivals nearing the wire. STEELE MONEY , in the clear while off the pace into the turn, advanced four wide leaving mid stretch,
angled out late and kept on with good energy to bridge the gap. LANDON JACK had speed outside rivals then cleared after a furlong, dropped in to set the
pace, was under pressure two wide past mid stretch, was surrounded near the sixteenth pole and weakened. BOLD HONOR broke sluggishly, raced well
back leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the lane and passed tired foes. KBCYA LATER , forced in at the break, recovered and moved up between
runners heading to the turn, chased three wide nearing the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths then faded under a steady hand ride. DR RAGS ,
four to five wide, made a mild run nearing the stretch, lacked a further response past the three sixteenths and weakened. FLIGHT OF BOURBON popped
the gate open pre race, was sent up early to give chase, faltered between rivals leaving the far turn then was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
MARIA'S HONOR , angled in early, hugged the inner rail around the first turn, remained inside horses down the backstretch, eased out mid way on the far
turn, was fanned six deep in upper stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. MARY JANE CHROME , unhurried down the backstretch,
advanced four deep entering the stretch, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and was out kicked. WATER WITCH lacked speed, was five deep turning
for home and rallied. DAILY PLANET hugged the inner rail around the first turn, worked his way to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. HOT CHOICE
worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. QIA , three wide the first turn, raced between horses in the stretch and lacked the needed late
response. EARLEY ROSE , along the inner rail to the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and was no factor. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK , four deep the
first turn, sprinted clear entering the backstretch, set the pace near the inner rail and tired late. BODE'S HERITAGE , three wide both turns, chased the pace
and gave way. THE HAUNTED ROOM , a forward factor along the inner rail to upper stretch, gave way. GLOSSAMER , two wide down the backstretch and
on the far turn, chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
IRISH EXIT was sent up to the inside of rivals leaving the chute to gain a stalking spot, was under a hearty ride chasing the embattled leaders mid turn, was
able to maintain a forward position then worked outward into the lane, closed in steadily and to the inside of IT'S VIPER in mid stretch, brushed with that one
when making the lead a sixteenth out, switched over to his left lead soon after, dueled and was fully extended to hold sway. IT'S VIPER broke outward and
bumped with a rival at the break then checked when in tight, regrouped and settled in last, was under a ride leaving the far turn, moved up two wide into the
stretch, rallied to the inside of the winner then was brushed when bidding between rivals a sixteenth out, battled gamely through the final seventy yards but
wasn't quite good enough. FEELING WOOZY was sent up between runners nearing the three quarter pole and prompted outside UNCLE IRISH, applied
more pressure leaving the half then dueled under some rating past the three eighths, took over into lane, shook clear under a drive past the three
sixteenths, could not contain the top pair leaving the sixteenth pole and weakened. UNCLE IRISH , bumped at the break, took over early and secured the
inside, took pressure into the turn, dueled from the three eighths to upper stretch, could not kick on with FEELING WOOZY nearing mid stretch then faded.
JOHN THE BEAR , bumped and steadied at the break, stalked four wide outside foes heading to the turn, circled five wide into the lane and faded. MOSE
PERFECT , between rivals while in range early, lacked a punch past mid turn and weakened. SHACKLED LOVE stalked three deep, was under a ride
leaving the far turn, could not keep pace mid turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BONDIVA cruised clear outside runners after a furlong then dropped in to set a rated pace, wandered outward a bit under left handed asks near mid stretch,
was corrected with right handed encouragement nearing the sixteenth marker, kept on under a solid hand ride from there and turned away GOLDEN
CHARM. GOLDEN CHARM edged up early while saving ground and moved to within range, advanced to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths, angled
out to be four wide in upper stretch, closed steadily past the sixteenth pole but was kept at bay in the final yards. CONCEPTUALIZE had inside speed then
rated back a bit as the winner cleared after a furlong, moved up inside past the five sixteenths, eased out three wide into the lane, gave chase past mid
stretch but came up empty late. TEA ROSE , off the early pace while removed from the inside, dropped to the rail around the turn, stayed inside for the drive
and churned on to gain through the final seventy yards. QUIT QUAY , away alertly, dropped off the early pace, circled five wide into the lane and offered a
belated response. GRACEFUL UNION broke a step slow, was taken wide early on, chased three to four wide past the five sixteenths and weakened.
FLITTER drifted in a bit at the break, corrected and edged up to stalk outside a rival, failed to kick on under pressure entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
THERE ARE NO WORDS , two wide chasing the pace for six furlongs, took the lead leaving the far turn, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch, dug in
late and narrowly prevailed. ELDEST SON , patiently handled along the inner rail to the stretch, moved out to the three path and rallied between horses.
THE ADDISON POUR trailed to the far turn, was in hand behind horses waiting for home in upper stretch, worked between horses in mid stretch, moved to
the five path near the sixteenth pole and rallied outside rivals. Q F SEVENTY FIVE , never far back racing near the inner rail, challenged for the lead inside
the eighth pole and finished willingly. WISH ME HOME stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, took aim on the
lead entering the stretch and flattened out. TOM HAGEN broke slowly, circled both turns three wide, remained on his left lead for much of the stretch run
and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. WOW WHATA SUMMER , three wide the first turn, raced four wide the far turn and was not a factor. LADY
OUTOFTHE BLUE was outrun. SWAN LAKE gave way. SPYCRAFT , taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear into the first turn faltered in mid stretch.

Footnotes
TRANSFER THE FUNDS vied between rivals into the first turn, moved clear past the seven eighths then dropped in to set a rated pace, met an outside
challenge from HELLMAN then was briefly headed with a half mile remaining, reclaimed the lead leaving the far turn while nicely handled, spurted away
after being set down approaching the stretch, responded to right handed asks and widened past mid stretch then kept on eagerly to the wire while steadily
hand ridden the final seventy yards. FOOD FOODIE , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, edged up nearing the far turn, came under a ride when
angled out past the three eighths, raced four wide with aim into the stretch, kept on with some interest but failed to make inroads through the final eighth.
GAMBLING TZAR settled off the pace and just off the inside, saved ground while put to asking past the three eighths, made a mild advance near mid
stretch then flattened out. ESPRESSO LUNGO , between runners early, stalked three wide through the backstretch run, lacked a response mid way on the
final turn and weakened. HELLMAN vied inside foes into the first turn, eased back and angled out into the backstretch, went up outside the winner and
threatened with a half to go, poked a head in front then battled past the three eighths, failed to kick on nearing the lane and tired. DAREDAVITE lost ground
four wide outside rivals, stayed in touch to the far turn, lacked a response past the five sixteenths and dropped back.
