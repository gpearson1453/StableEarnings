Footnotes
ANTE ANGEL was close up early while in the two path, settled off the pace while in the two or three path through the turn, shifted a path closer to the inside
into the lane then rallied through the final eighth to be clear at the wire. SALTY SUE set the pace from the two or three path through the turn, shook off two
challengers into the lane to clear, had her largest advantage with an eighth to travel, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clearly second
best. ABRA ABRA raced off the pace while in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane and was gaining to the end. SEQUEEKER raced in the four
path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the five or six path, continued in mid-track inside the sixteenth pole then shifted in late to
avoid tiring rivals while gaining. JANE'S A DIVA chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and weakened.
SANTIVA DIVA pressed then chased the pace through the turn, was still a factor into the lane then faded. SONDRAS LAST HOPE saved ground through
the turn and never was a factor. TAPRIZE ME was along the inside throughout and was empty through the final eighth.

place late while no threat. ANAITA stalked the pace in the three path but was outdueled for the place. BETCHA stalked the pace inside, angled five wide at
the quarter pole but couldn't close. HAPPYKIYAY saved ground to no avail. LOVE DRUNK and INCREDIBLE JUSTICE were not factors. CORSIDAT raced
in the four path before fading.

Footnotes
JURADICIAL pressed the pace two wide into mid-turn, was asked for more soon after, cleared in late turn then widened to the eighth pole and was under a
hand drive to the end. SHANGHAI EXPRESS was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and showed good energy the final
sixteenth while never a serious threat to the winner. HERE KITTY KITTY was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
offered a mild bid to gain the show spot. BEREA set the pace into the turn while near the inside, could not stay with the winner into the lane and faded. E Z
AVENUE hesitated at the start spotting the field three lengths, rushed up to contend into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
THE KID PATAKY cleared off to a long lead soon after the start, remained well clear through the turn and into the lane, began losing her advantage inside
the eighth pole and gamely held under strong handling. RAFAELLA chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five
path, methodically gained on the winner through the final eighth and just missed. MARTZ ROSEY raced near the inside through the turn, cut the corner into
the lane, was a serious menace inside the sixteenth pole and just missed along the inside. PRIMROSE GIRL raced near the rail through the turn and into
the lane and gained energy late. CLASSIC KITTEN saved ground through the turn, came off the inside for the drive and was gaining late. BELLA
FRANCESCA trailed into the turn, moved through the three or four path on the turn, swung into the lane from the six path and showed good energy too late.
FRONT COVER was two wide through the turn and into the lane and never was a menace. I MADE IT chased the pace from the four path through the turn,
was in the five path once straightened and faded. TURBO GAL never a factor while in the four path through the turn. HARD TRUTH WINS chased along the
inside through the turn and was empty into the lane. POISED raced three wide through the turn and tired. JUICY JUSTICE was outrun while in the three
path.

Footnotes
ITZFOREVER in the two or three path into the first turn, continued near the inside down the backstretch, waited for tiring rivals dropping back into the far
turn, came off the inside in mid-turn, guided to the four path nearing the five-sixteenths pole, bid four wide into the lane, cleared while drifting in and widened
while finishing near the inside. EVIL INTENTIONS tracked inside through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and finished with good energy to wrap up
second best. FOREVER PINK vied for the lead from the outset while along the inside, gained a short advantage in mid-turn, continued with good energy into
the lane, was no match for the top two but stayed on well to be best of the rest. WILDCATJUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the
five path into the turn, continued in the six path into the lane and moved up. IMAGINE THE MOON raced in the four path through both turns when never far
back, came into the lane from the five path and was empty nearing the eighth pole. TIZZY JOJO in mid-field into the far turn when in the two or three path,
moved into the four path after mid-turn when being asked, came into the lane from the six path and tired. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE was well back from off the
inside, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. CIERRA EMPIRE never was a menace while saving ground. GIRLS ARE TUFFER vie
for the lead two wide throughout and was done near the quarter pole. SHEZA NUT raced three wide and in the four path through the far turn and was empty
into the lane. FOREVER NOTED raced four wide through the first turn, continued off the inside and was done entering the far turn. PASSIONFORJUSTICE
chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch and was empty nearing the three-eighths pole.
