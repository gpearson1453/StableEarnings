Footnotes
MAYBETHEONE broke in full stride to set all the pace, widened into the stretch under mild right handed urging and won as much the best.
DANZANITEAWAY unhurried early, closed willingly in the five path through deep stretch and finished clear for second. B SASSI was forced out bumping
OH GLORIOUS DAY at the start, chased the winner along the inside and went evenly. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK failed to menace. OH GLORIOUS DAY
was bumped at the start then lacked the needed response. MOBIL DREAM STAR found her best stride late. PITY PURCHASE was a sharp threat outside
through the turn and weakened late. VICTORIA COMMAND was outrun. LUCKY STUFF bore out at the start, had speed through the turn then wilted.
RIVERS RUN RED was no threat. COWGIRLS HUMOR was no factor.

Footnotes
SOCIAL HISTORY set a pressured pace from two wide to the top of the lane, responded when called upon to open a clear advantage and drew off as much
best. C V DYNAMIC reserved off the early pace, split rivals in the turn under a drive, angled four wide coming home and closed well to be second best.
LIVING THE DREAM stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, angled in to the rail down the lane and finished willingly for the show. VECCHI
pressed the pace from the rail to the quarter pole, drifted out in the stretch while tiring. RIVERS OF DENIRO rushed up the rail to be with the early lead and
flattened out in the turn. PLAYFULASITGETS went one-paced failing to menace. KELLEHER dropped back through the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
RECKLESS L J never far back, advanced steadily three then two wide under mild right handed urging and was along in time. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS
sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages. HENRY THE CAT allowed to settle, finished with
good courage inside. TIGER TRAIL stalked the pace along the inside through the turn, shifted out to the seven path at the top of the stretch then faded.
SERENDIPITOUS passed tiring rivals. POWERFUL PHIL failed to menace. PRIVATE DRIVE was outrun. ROSCO P. COLTRANE bobbled outward at the
start, was a sharp threat outside through the turn then gave way on the stretch. WORTHY OPPONENT pressed the early pace four then three wide into the
turn, stopped abruptly in the stretch, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SADIE'S SILVER KID prompted the pace to midway on the turn, assumed command turning for home, pulled clear inside the sixteenth pole in a determined
drive. COUNTEVERYBLESSING stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, loomed at he head of the lane and finished willingly while unable to go
with the winner. JUSTA LITTLE MOORE tracked the leaders from four wide and rallied down the lane to just miss the place. SEEKING FREEDOM broke
outward leaving the gate, rated in mid-pack to the quarter pole, rallied in upper stretch and finished evenly. TAHLEQUAH JOE set the early pace from the
rail and weakened through the stretch. STRIKING LAD tracked the pace from the outside and failed to gain ground in the lane. REIGNING DREAM showed
brief speed to be prominent early, dropped back in the turn and never posed a threat. DREAMINGABOUTTIME trailed throughout. ONE STEP ASIDE
squeezed at the start, clipped heels several strides from the gate and unseated his rider, galloped around the track crossing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
DIVA POWER stalked the pace three wide, made the lead two wide early on the turn, quickly opened a daylight advantage, set the balance of the pace and
prevailed under strong handling. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, improved position two wide before a half and
finished clear for second. STATUS SYMBOL allowed to settle, had a mild late rally along the inside. LADY ABRIL allowed to settle, closed some ground
outside rivals into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. TALE OF THE LYON set a pressured pace two wide into the turn and was through after a half.
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE well placed, failed to respond. SARAH JANE was no threat. APPEALING SENORITA was no factor. BEEBLEGEE was outrun.
PISTOL PACKIN BOS pressed the early pace along the inside and stopped on the turn.

CANDLELIGHT HOURS stalked the pace from the fence to the far turn, was called upon midway on the bend to maintain position and not be boxed in, took
command turning for home, cleared the pacesetter in upper stretch, shied from the gate tire tracks in the lane and was kept to task late in the drive while
much best. R THREE ANGELS hustled away from the gates to open a clear lead into the first turn, maintained the advantage to the head of the lane and
kept on well to be second best while no match for the winner. MARKET SUCCESS tracked the leaders from four wide into the far turn to be within striking
distance and lacked a closing response when called upon. SPARKLING JEWEL well placed just off the pacesetter into the turn racing in the three path, tried
to go with the winner in the turn matching strides to the quarter pole and flattened out for the drive. SONNET trailed throughout and was outrun.

HERE'S THE SPIDER slow early to trail into the first turn, steadily made up ground down the backside to be in striking distance, circled four wide at the
quarter pole consistently closing ground and prevailed late in the drive to be clear at the wire. CITY SCENE prompted the pace down the backside,
assumed command into the far turn, dueled with PRACTICALLLYELUSIVE from the five-sixteenths pole to the wire, coming out late in the drive to bump
that one and held on gamely for the place. PRACTICALLYELUSIVE tracked the pace from three wide down the backside while resisting rider's restraint,
moved to engage the leader in the turn, battled with the frontrunner down the lane, was bumped late in the drive when that one drifted out and finished
willingly while unable to get passed. WOMAN'S DREAM raced up between horse down the backside to be prominent, lost position nearing the half mile
pole, ranged up in the far turn to threaten and could not sustain the rally. FANCIFUL saved ground for the run to the far turn, angled out to challenge in
upper stretch and flattened out down the lane. BIG FACTS dropped back into the first turn to trail down the backside and passed tiring rivals coming home
never having menaced. GOLD HONEY showed brief speed through the first turn and came up empty. HISTORYINTHEMAKING flashed speed for the first
half mile and stopped entering the far turn.

WHO DEY never far back, moved up steadily five wide down the backstretch to engage the runner up after a half, matched strides the balance of the trip,
drifted out to the seven path through deep stretch and proved best under left handed urging. SHADOWY away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside
into the stretch, dug in determinedly but couldn't handle the winner. DIAL DIRECT stalked the pace near the inside and went evenly. EKATI'S WAY stalked
the early pace three then two wide, was bumped past the half mile marker then faded. VILLIAN failed to menace. SCRIMPER checked repeatedly between
rivals on the clubhouse turn then was no factor. IRONCLAD ALIBI was fractious in the gate, bumped repeatedly at the start then no threat. GAPPER was
always outrun. RADIO SILENT was through after a half. LUCKY VICTOR had brief speed. TOUGH CAT was never involved. KINDERHOOK'S rider lost his
left iron at the start, bumped repeatedly with IRONCLAD ALIBI, rushed to contention in the five path on the first turn, drifted in bumping EKATI'S WAY past
the half mile pole then stopped.

Footnotes
FAIR AND SQUARE stalked the pace three wide for six furlongs, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under strong
handling to win as much the best. TANTRUM was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, rallied determinedly three wide through the stretch and got up for
second. RAVEN MOON unhurried early, offered a strong bid along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished for second. I WANNA WIN pressed the
pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the pace into the far turn then weakened in the stretch. SILENCE allowed to settle along the rail, was in tight
nearing the far turn then passed tiring rivals late along the inside. FOREWARNED failed to menace. WICKED WARRIOR bore out at the start bumping
TANTRUM, was well placed, angled inward nearing the far turn causing a chain reaction of rivals to his inside being in tight then weakened. DARK VADER
settled two wide, was in tight nearing the far turn causing his rider to check and lost momentum. GONE IN A FLASH was no factor. SERVE REVENGE
COLD set the pace for a little over a half, was forced in past the seven sixteenths pole then flattened out. DERBY INCLUDED was never involved. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
