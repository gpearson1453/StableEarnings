three path, led between foes midway around the turn, vied past the eighth pole and weakened. PARTY SHAKER tracked the pace four wide, bid midway
around the turn, reached even terms near the five-sixteenths marker, vied past the eighth pole and tired. FONTINA broke inwardly, chased the pace in the

Footnotes
SOLAIR rated in the three path, was put to ride between foes early into the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the lane, swept past an inner trio
passing the eighth pole, and tipped inward while drawing clear. LEXINATOR laid off the pace along the rail, brushed with the rail midway around the turn,
was in the five path at the top of the stretch, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. BARBARA stalked in the two path,
was nudged along the inside early around the turn, and kept on inside of foes while on her left lead for show. TALK MUCH prompted the pace in the five
path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, swung from back in the five path into the lane, but was one paced. RUNAWAY BREEZE chased
in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and made no impact. FLIP MY ID set the
pace in the three path, was coaxed in the four path turning into the lane, but yielded in the final furlong. ISLAND MAGIC broke slowly and always trailed
from the five to eight paths.

STORM BRAVE tracked the pace four wide, bid three deep rounding the far turn, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SUPER SPREADER
pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the seven-sixteenths marker, set the pace in the two path around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole
and held well for the place. BLUTO'S CANDY settled off the pace while racing two wide, moved up four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead
in the lane and was one-paced to hold third. AMBUSHED raced in range inside and lacked the needed rally. ENSIGN SKIP broke in a tangle, raced three
and four wide and never threatened. LEGEND set the pace inside and faltered around the far turn. DUKE SKYWALKER had his head turned at the start,
raced three wide and made little impact. RUNNIN' BLOCK broke awkwardly, raced two and three wide and played no factor. DANLEY failed to menace
while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
ATALANTA ALEXANDRA chased in the six path, ranged up in the five path around the turn, bid passing the quarter, took a narrow lead from the five path at
the top of the lane, and drifted out while inching clear under a drive. STREET CHARITY bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path, bid in
the three path early around the turn, took a short lead passing the three-eighths, was challenged by an outer foe nearing the quarter, lost the lead along the
inside entering the stretch, but kept on for place. UNIFIEDS PRINCESS bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path, fanned out to the
eight path under a drive turning into the lane, and was up for show. SUPER SPIN set the pace from the two path into the turn, but lost the lead along the rail
early around the turn, and faded in the stretch. BRITISH EMPRESS prompted the pace in the three path, bid between foes early into the turn, but flattened
from the five path in upper stretch. SHILOH raced off the pace in the four path but never menaced.

menace while racing two wide. NICO'S HAVING FUN played no factor while racing five. SIR AUSTIN was outrun while racing three wide. MUNTALIQ

Footnotes
CANTARO trailed in the two path, bumped with an inner foe and steadied nearing the half, was roused into the turn, drifted far outside turning into the
stretch, and rallied to be up in the final strides. VAMOS VIEJO laid off the pace along the rail, was bumped by an outer foe and had to check nearing the
half, waited in the two path around the turn, shifted out to the four path turning into the lane, and ran on between foes for place. JAM SESSION prompted
the pace in the four path, bid under coaxing in the five path turning into the lane, stuck a head in front passing the eighth pole, but was outfinished on both
sides to show. BEGANINGREENPOINT chased in the two path, was driven in the three path around the turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch,
finished evenly, and just missed minor placings. DROPKICK MURPHY stalked inside of foes from the two path, was coaxed along around the turn, but
flattened passing the eighth pole. UNCAPTURED STAR set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path passing the quarter, but faded between
foes in the final furlong. GRAND BEY rated in the four path but was tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
GREAT VENEZUELA prompted the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. DEMAR'S LEGACY set the pace inside, was no
match for the winner but stayed on well to be a clear second. MIAH MIAH was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the
quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. GENUINE PERIL was off a step slow, chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a closing bid. SPECIAL
AFFAIR broke outwardly and bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. HEAVEN IN MIND stumbled at the start and was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MY LADY JAMES bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside, waited from the rail around the turn, was roused from the two path into the
stretch, drew past an inner foe passing the sixteenth, and was wrapped up late. MOANAS POWER pressed inside, took a short lead while under a ride from
the rail early into the turn, stayed on from inside into the stretch, but was caught around the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. OMO TEN GIRL vied for the
lead in the three path, was under rousing in the four path midway around the turn, and kept on in the five path in the stretch to secure show. BOTH SIDES
broke out and bumped with an outer foe, rated inside, was coaxed midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the lane, and finished
evenly on her left lead. LADY JAE raced off the pace in the three path, was cued in the five path midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path
entering the stretch, but made no impact. SHEZA SPITFIRE trailed from the two path into the turn, and was no factor from the four path down the lane.
PRINCESS BLAKELY stalked in the four path, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, but faded on her left lead. FORTUNA BELLE dueled for the
lead in the two path, but gaveway between foes at the top of the lane. GLAZED GINGER chased in the three path, drifted out to the seven path passing the
quarter, and was tired.

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER stalked in the four path, bid going into the turn, took the lead and was in the two path passing the three-eighths, floated out to the five
path entering the lane, was headed by an outer foe passing the eighth pole, but dug in to inch away late. SOPHIA'S STORM tracked in the five path, ranged
up nearing the quarter, bid from the seven path into the stretch, headed the inner leader passing the eighth pole, but was repelled to place. GITANA raced
up close in the three path, was roused into the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. LE BOIANA chased
inside, angled out under a drive around the turn, was in the eight path entering the stretch, but made no impact. SIMPLIFY (ARG) rated in the four path, was
ridden from the two path into the turn, but was one paced down the lane. ROSE E HOLIDAY raced off the pace in the two path, was driven in the four path
around the turn, but did not threaten from the nine path in the stretch. WHEELINGNDEALING set the pace in the two path, lost the lead along the inside
early around the turn, and faded in the stretch. BLACK ICE had a slow start and always trailed around the six path.

under a drive. ISAYSO stalked the pace four wide, took the lead nearing the five-sixteenths marker, continued on the left lead in the lane, was no match for
the winner but held for the place. PLEASANT EMBRACE prompted the pace three wide between foes, could not match strides with the winner in the lane
but kept on to gain the show. A FANCY SOLUTION failed to menace while racing five wide. QUEEN AIKO was bumped at the start, saved ground off the
pace, swung five wide turning for home, lugged in soon after and flattened out inside. DREAM DIAMOND pressed the pace two wide between foes and tired
in the drive. NOUVEAU RICHE played no factor while racing three wide. POPPA CHIPPY bumped at the start, dueled inside and retreated nearing the
