on the stretch with a strong drive they got the nod at the wire. NORTHCUT set the from right out of the gate and into the first turn, maintained a strong pace
and as they came out of the turn he started to draw off from the foes but unfortunately got caught at the wire and missed the nod for the win. MAD LUTHER
ran off pace but pressed the pace of the leader throughout the race was never far back until late into the stretch. GOPHER GOLD ran with an even pace
