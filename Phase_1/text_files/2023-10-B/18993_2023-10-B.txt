Footnotes
ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE without early speed, though hustled along, came into contention along the rail on the bend, gained a clear path into the lane, took
over inside the furlong marker, drew clear and held sway under steady handling. LINDALOUIMAGE also without early speed, gained a striking position just
outside ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE on the turn, was blocked behind a wall of horses upper stretch, altered in after entering the last eighth, squeezed through
inside FREE LOVE shortly after that and took over second inside the final sixteenth. FREE LOVE advanced inside SMILE AT THE STORM to soon vie for
the lead, had the rail on the bend, floated out some entering the lane and gradually wore down inside the final eighth. LIFE OF SATURDAYS prominent
between rivals, went for the lead three wide on the turn, began to yield in the stretch and gradually drifted out the last furlong. PALACE MAGIC contested
the pace from outside for nearly and half mile then gave way. SMILE AT THE STORM displayed early speed between horses then faded for the drive.

Footnotes
DRIFTING WEST rated between then from outside the first half mile, went for the lead three wide on the second turn, took the lead in the lane, drew off
inside the final furlong, drifted out under left-handed pressure in the waning yards but was clearly the best. GEORGE'S VISION never far back from outside,
picked up his pace after a half mile, rallied four wide in the lane and caught SPEEDY G for second near the wire. SPEEDY G raced in contention from
inside, altered out with a furlong to go, had second deep stretch between horses in the late going but was outfinished. WILLOW RIDGE was sent to set the
pace from inside, roused on the second bend, no match for DRIFTING WEST when set down for the drive and wore down late. FLASHY RICHIE advanced
four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace from outside but began to flatten two wide before finishing six furlongs. KRAMDEN was prominent between
rivals for a half mile then began to fade.

Footnotes
I'M YOUR VALENTINE forwardly placed toward the outside, advanced four wide through the bend, engaged SENOR MIKE from outside inside the furlong
pole, gradually lugged in as he battled for the lead and edged ahead in time. SENOR MIKE pressed from between horses, took the advantage three wide on
the turn, fought gamely in the lane, gradually lugged in the last sixteenth and had to settle for second best. HE'S A FINE MAN prominent from just off the
inside, did not keep up after a quarter mile, gradually angled out through the bend and rallied belatedly five wide in the stretch. PLAIN OR PEANUT broke
slowly, moved to the outside early on, lost ground four to six wide taking the turn, surged through the stretch and narrowly missed third. LORD
SHAFTESBURY vied for the early lead between horses, gained the rail into the bend and slowly wore down the final furlong. RA'DOM jostled briefly at the
break, raced in contention from inside, progressed on the turn, swung out behind SENOR MIKE entering the lane and gradually weakened the last eighth.
THACKER FROMM raced in contention just off the inside for a half mile then failed to have a stretch bid. BLEEDING BLUE displayed early speed outside
LORD SHAFTESBURY for four furlongs and began to fade as he floated out entering the stretch. LAGRUE broke outward, jostling briefly with RA'DOM then
showed little running widest of all.

NULLARBOR bumped LONESOME DREAM shortly after the break, edged ahead of that one on the first turn, moved clear and took the rail on the
backstretch, gradually drifted out under urging in the lane and proved clearly best. LASTFORTINOFAMILY was kept close, went for the lead two wide on the
second bend, moved clear for the place then, was no match for NULLARBOR the last furlong but was unchallenged for second. BUREAU veered out at the
break, bumped SONO GRATO, was solidly checked and allowed to settle, progressed from outside on the backstretch, three then four wide taking the
second turn and drew off for third inside the last eighth. LONESOME DREAM bumped shortly after the start, was sent to vie for the lead inside
NULLARBOR, checked while in tight quarters nearing the end of two furlongs, moved outside the latter on the backstretch, gradually began to yield, had the
rail on the second turn and continued to fade for the drive. MAC PANDOWDY chased from inside, angled out entering the lane and had no late bid. SONO
GRATO bumped and forced outward at the start, chased from just off the inside, fanned out some for the stretch run and had little to offer.

LITTLE ACCOUNT prominent just off the inside, altered out four wide for a clear path upper stretch, moved clear of the rest approaching the final sixteenth
and kept ZENCHUA SKY at bay. ZENCHUA SKY bumped with MUD HUT at the start then was bumped by CAT TALE BREEZE, taken to the inside early
on, progressed along the rail on the bend, altered inside HALLIE'S RAINBOW midstretch, took over second inside the final sixteenth and was closing in on
LITTLE ACCOUNT in the waning yards. SENORITA AURORA settled back and just off the inside, advanced two wide on the turn, angled out for racing
room with two furlongs left, rallied in the lane and caught HALLIE'S RAINBOW for third nearing the wire. HALLIE'S RAINBOW vied for the lead just off or
along the rail, floated out some entering the stretch and also wore down in the late going. MUD HUT bumped at the start, contested the pace outside
HALLIE'S RAINBOW to midstretch then leveled off. CAT TALE BREEZE was bumped and forced into ZENCHUA SKY at the break, raced in contention
toward the outside on the backstretch but began to fade between rivals nearing the end of three furlongs. AMARI S. responded to urging to press the early
pace but gave way four wide on the bend. LUNARCHY broke inward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, was a factor from outside, improved position
widest through the turn but gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
TWO COOKIE RULE was settled inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, angled out some on the second bend, came into the lane behind SEMINOLE
BEACH, altered outside that one nearing the eighth pole, rallied and caught the latter at the wire. SEMINOLE BEACH was kept close from inside, angled out
some while boxed in on the second turn, gained a clear path three wide entering the stretch, moved to the lead, was clear of the rest with a sixteenth left but
was narrowly outfinished in a game effort. CHICKS FOR FREE a bit awkward at the start, advanced widest on the backstretch, angled in beside AWESOME
WILLY into the second bend, had a slight advantage into the lane but gradually wore down two wide. AWESOME WILLY broke on top and was hustled
ahead, allowed to relax on the backstretch, was roused again along on the rail on the second turn but flattened out for the drive. BOURBON DELIGHT was
checked while boxed in behind rivals after two furlongs, altered out some, failed to keep up, angled back in midway on the backstretch, saved ground taking
the second bend and had little to offer for the stretch run. BLURT displayed early speed outside AWESOME WILLY but began to fade before finishing six
furlongs. FULL MAGAZINE raced in contention four or five wide for three-quarters of a mile then gave way.

also fought for second deep stretch but had to settle for the show. JACK VAN BERG broke inward, bumping CREEKMORE, raced closest to the early
speed, took the lead two wide on the turn, soon moved clear, floated out some at the top of the stretch, was no match for TALIS PARK GRAD inside the last
eighth and slowly wore down between rivals in the late going. CREEKMORE bumped at the break, chased from inside, lost position two wide on the bend,
swung out five wide for the drive and made up minor ground inside the final furlong. TROY OUNCE bobbled at the start, soon faded, was widest taking the
turn and improved position in the stretch without threatening. MEDAL OF FACT raced in the third flight between horses, was steadied back from close
quarters on the bend, fanned out to path six into the lane and had no late bid. BULLDOG OF BERGEN trailed from inside, swung out entering the stretch
and had little to offer. FASTNFURIOUS soon sprinted away from the rest, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, was overtaken on the turn and
quickly gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
SCAPITURE rated well off the early speed, commenced her bid from outside after a quarter mile, rallied widest in the stretch and got up in time under a
well-judged ride. CARICIA hesitated at the break, moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, went for the lead outside BLAZE BEAUTY on the bend,
edged ahead in the lane, fought to hold on but did not have the needed late kick. BLAZE BEAUTY broke on top, set a pressured pace from outside, drew
clear after two furlongs, moved to the rail, was challenged on the turn, fought through the stretch but also did not have enough left late. HEAVENLY SCENT
pressed BLAZE BEAUTY from just inside on the backstretch, did not keep up while saving ground through the turn and steady gave way just off the rail
through the lane. SEQUAYA was a factor from inside for two furlongs then began to fade.

Footnotes
SUPERTRIX settled just off the inside, stayed off the rail taking the bend, was looking for a clear path midstretch, gained it with a sixteenth left, split rivals
with seventy yards to go and got up at the wire to finish on even terms with TEMPLUNA. The latter was rated from outside, began to advance three wide on
the turn, fanned widest into the lane, took the lead inside the last sixteenth and held on. AUNT STELLA raced in the second flight from outside, came into
the stretch from path three, dueled outside FOGGY KITTEN, edged ahead inside the last furlong, drifted out with a sixteenth to go and gradually yielded.
GHAALEB'S APPEAL reluctant to load, advanced from outside, to moved clear for third on the turn, loomed a threat outside AUNT STELLA deep stretch,
was forced out by that one with a sixteenth left and leveled off. FOGGY KITTEN quickly recovered from being bumped at the start to gain a clear lead,
showed the way from inside, floated out some leaving the bend, was challenged in the stretch and gradually wore down inside the final eighth. ARCH
FLYER in the second flight early between rivals, was caught in tight quarters after travelling the first furlong, steadied midway on the backstretch, altered in
at the half mile marker, failed to keep up just off the rail on the turn and had no late bid. ABBMAR unruly in the gate, broke outward, bumping FOGGY
KITTEN, was hustled up just off the inside but gave way along the rail after three furlongs.
