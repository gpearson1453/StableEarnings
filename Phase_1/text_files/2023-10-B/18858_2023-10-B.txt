Footnotes
MEAN AMERICAN pressed the pace, moved up around the final turn, dueled down the stretch with BETISON and prevailed for the win. BETISON went to
the front, drove clear, saved ground, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. ANN'S STORM lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, racing outside around the second turn, but proved no match for the top two. BEYOND D'ORO pressed the pace, weakened and
was no threat late. BRI raced in the rear and was never a threat. EMMAS RULER lacked early speed and showed little. CAJUN ACES raced near the
middle of the field, saved ground, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
TENNESSEE MOON pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the stretch with LIL MISS SUNSHINE and prevailed for the win. LIL
MISS SUNSHINE went to the front, drove clear, drifted out entering the stretch, dueled down the lane and was outfinished for the win. SUMMER IS HOT
void of early speed, saved ground around the turn, angled out, made a bid, proved no match for the top, but got up for third. FINISHWHATUSTARTED
raced within contention, lacked a late kick and was caught for third. CHEER UP raced near the middle of the of the field and put forth an even effort.
PIPPA'S PROSPECT raced evenly near the middle of the pack and was never a factor. PREACH IT GIRL lacked early speed, moved up, weakened and
was no threat late. I'M ALL MIXED UP always raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was outrun. IVY ABAD GIRL raced within striking
distance and dropped back.

end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SHAMEFUL ALLIANCE raced within contention, saved ground,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. CHENTI raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, showed late interest, but was outfinished for
third. NEPHI raced evenly near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was never a threat. SHAWN'S SOLVING dueled for the early lead,
saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. ROCKY BOY void of early speed, lost contact with the field and was distanced.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THE SAINT pressed the early pace, took the advantage around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. ALLIACEOUS lacked
early speed, made a steady gain, had an outside trip and finished willingly. LUTIE MO hopped at the break, racing in the back, moved up, within contention,
came around the second turn three wide, proved no match for the top two, but held on for show. I BEAR ARMS raced near the middle of the field, came
around the final turn wide, made a mild bid and was outfinished for show. GIRL THIRSTY raced near the back and was never a factor. OUR LITTLE GIRL
void of early speed and passed tired ones late. MI LIA pressed the early pace and dropped back. SHES A LUCKY REBEL sprinted to the front, drove clear
and stopped.
