Footnotes
AGNELLO CITY tracked the pacesetters from three wide in the turn, was set to a drive midway on the bend, engaged the leaders in upper stretch and
pulled away through the lane. SOMETHING ON TAP stalked the leaders from a clear pocket along the rail in the turn, angled out three wide to challenge
turning for home, attempted to lug-in through the lane and finished well to be second best. MY HOMBRE set a pressured pace from the fence to the head of
the lane and tired through the stretch. R CLIFFHANGER pressed the pace from two wide to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. WHY KENNY WHY
broke alertly, was allowed to settle off the pace down the backside, was called upon in the turn and lacked a response. MY TICKET was the distant trailer in
the turn and closed mildly in the stretch never having posed a threat. BALU reserved off the leaders along the rail and finished one-paced with no impact.

Footnotes
SAVVY LAYLA tracked the pace from four wide into the turn, engaged the leaders at the quarter pole and cleared off in the stretch. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE
broke outward, raced up the fence to take the lead under constant pressure, was headed turning for home in a four way duel, responded to the challenge
digging back in and kept on through the lane gamely for the place. UNIDENTIFIED MAN stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, made a bid
from between horses nearing the quarter pole and could not sustain the rally. JACK'S ADVANTAGE was unhurried early to be near the back of the pack
through the turn and showed good late interest to be gaining late. ZELIG pinched at the start when the inside and outside rivals bumped and squeezed him
leaving the gate, settled in a tracking position off the front four through the turn, angled out five wide under a drive turning for home and lacked a closing
response. UPTOWN GUY broke inward bumping rival from the gate, moved up to press the pace from two wide between horses to the head of the stretch
and faded in the lane. KEEN ON YOU raced wide throughout and never posed a threat.

Footnotes
LITTLE TOY GUNS prompted the early pace down the backside, split rivals to challenge for the lead nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear lead in upper
stretch and drew off as much best to the wire. ORLEANS STORM tracked the leaders into the turn, was taken in hand off heels on the bend, was called
upon turning for home and closed well to gain the place. CHECK THE FACTS raced four wide in striking distance through the turn and steadily advanced
down the stretch. THE GOSPEL OF MARK reserved off the pace to midway on the bend, commenced a long rally turning for home, encountered traffic
down the stretch to be in tight and having to steady and alter paths and finished with good late interest. ORVILLE B showed early speed to be on the lead
from three wide through the turn and tired through the lane lugging in midway down the lane impeding closing rival. CHILTEPIN pressed the pace from the
rail to upper stretch and weakened down the lane. MUSIC GEM was never a threat. JOHN PHILIP bumped outside rival leaving the gate, raced wide down
the backside and finished as no factor having bled.

Footnotes
MITESSE pressed the pace from two wide to the turn, engaged the leader midway on the bend, battled with that one through the lane and prevailed late in
the drive in a determined effort. EGG NOG set a pressured pace to the turn, dueled with the winner from the five-sixteenths pole to deep stretch from the
rail, kept on gamely and was out-finished in the final strides in a good effort. MORE MUCHO stalked the pacesetters from three wide the entire trip, looming
up in mid-stretch and could not gain late in the drive. TESTED POSITIVE reserved off the pace to the top of the lane and made a mild rally down the lane.
PINKY TUSCADERO prominently placed along the fence down the backside to be in striking distance through the turn and failed to mount a closing rally.
LA REINA DEL NORTE unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field turning for home and made a late gain down the stretch. RIVERVIEW
STEVIE tracked the leaders from mid-pack while racing three wide, was called upon into the turn to close ground and flattened out turning for home.
YEGUITA QUEEN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RUMBLE STRIP RON unhurried for three quarters of a mile under patient handling, dropped to rail turning for home and rallied up the fence in a drive to be
up in the final strides. GOING IN STYLE reserved off the pace down the backside, rallied three wide in the turn to engage the leaders in upper stretch,
battled through the lane to take a brief lead yards from the wire only to be out-finished late. EXONERATED PREZ dueled on the early lead through the first
turn, settled just off the pacesetter down the backside, angled to the clear turning for home and kept on willingly down the lane. FIRST SONG dueled for the
lead entering the backstretch, took command down the backside, prevailed to midway down the lane and was outkicked in deep stretch. MASTER OF WAR
trailed to the quarter pole, swung seven wide at the top of the stretch and closed well finding his best stride late. SUSIE'S KID rated in mid-pack through the
far turn and failed to gain ground when called upon for the drive. ROMANTIC COWBOY prompted the early pace in the first turn, settled just off the leaders
down the backside and faded coming home. BLUNDER went evenly never posing a threat. PATIO PARTY well placed to be prominent for three-quarters
and gave way in the lane. KING OF TRUTH showed brief foot and was through early.

Footnotes
OVER THE HILLS reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied two wide through the turn splitting rivals turning for home to engage the leader in mid-stretch and
drew off convincingly. ENERGIZER broke sharply to be in front, settled just off the pacesetter through the turn, briefly assumed command turning for home,
could not go with the winner but finished willingly as second best. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN stalked the leaders from four wide through the turn and failed to
gain ground in the stretch. CUGINE unhurried in the early going and rallied well belatedly down the lane. HAPPILEA was prominently placed for the first
quarter mile, dropped back in the turn, angled well wide in upper stretch and rallied late. MASTER flashed speed to take the lead for a half mile and tired
coming home. SMOKEY LEE trailed to the top of the lane and passed weakened rivals in the stretch. GINS AND TINS was well placed along the fence to
be close up in the turn and went evenly. RACARINO chased the leaders from four wide mounting a brief bid in the turn and flattened out. MUNI MUNI SLEW
was never a factor.

COLOR BEARER set the pace from the fence up the backside, opened a clear advantage in the turn and drew clear through the lane unchallenged. WAR
ON THE RIVER stalked the pacesetter from three wide through the turn, made a bid in upper stretch but could not match the winner and finished willingly to
hold the place. JIM'S RIVER RUNNER unhurried for the first half mile, angled wide for the run down the stretch and rallied well coming home. INDY CARR
well placed tracking the leaders through the turn and failed to gain ground in the lane. LITTLE RONS ROCKET tracked from the fence into the turn,
mounted a rally through the bend along the rail and weakened in the stretch. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER trailed in the early going while three wide and
failed to respond when called upon. NOSEY POWER was never a threat. FACTUM'S PRIDE pressed the pace in the early going, steadily dropped back
coming home, suffered an injury yards from the wire and was vanned off.

Footnotes
EAGLE NEST rushed up the fence shortly away from the gate to take command, opened a clear advantage into the turn, responded when challenged
turning for home and drew away down the lane. HARTSTEIN prompted the pace down the backside, made a bold bid nearing the quarter pole to challenge
the leader, could not go with that one but finished willingly in a good effort. MARQUITOS M bumped at the start, was taken in hand to be unhurried early
well off the pace and closed with a good late rally making up significant ground in the stretch. PRESSLEY RIDGE broke inward bumping rival at the start,
was ridden the entire way to keep pace and made a mild gain down the lane. NIKAO tracked the leaders from the rail and lacked a closing response. MY
BUDDY MICAH posed no threat. FORMYBOYS prominently placed for the first half mile and faded.
