PUTTHEBLAMEONME well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a
steady gain and edged up in the final strides. FIERCE AND STRONG unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. REELED IN stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the
turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook clear late, then was no match in the final yards and held the show. MR.
REDOLFO tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled around a tiring rival and flattened the
final furlong. KOTYLOS veered out at the start, angled widest into the stretch and passed a tiring rival. WARRIOR'S CAUSE set the pace inside and faded
late.

Footnotes
JARETH set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. EXTRA MEDIUM mid pack
and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled in and closed well for the place. CAPTAIN MAD JACK mid
pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show.
OLDZFOURFORTYTWO broke awkwardly from the gate and was well placed off the rail, tracked the leader through the turn, angled out two and three wide
into the stretch, then flattened and held a share. LEBASI unhurried, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved
position. VALDOLOBO (IRE) stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch and faded the final furlong. WORBOTHOR well placed, held position on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had no
rally. CROWLEY'S WAR veered out at the start, and was never involved.

Footnotes
SHAKEN AND SHIMMY well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up in the final strides. DISASTER RECOVERY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then
was outfinished. HUMBLE JOE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, drifted in and edged up
for the show. MR. YASUDA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through on the two path into the stretch, angled in, made a steady gain
and edged up for a share. TWIST OF FAITH well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch and flattened out. DON'T FLINCH allowed to settle, saved ground two path second turn, came through on that path into the stretch,
angled out and improved position. BRIT'S UNION mid pack and inside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path
into the stretch and was steadied along. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT never far back, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into
the lane and had no rally. NORTHERN RUNNER had a wide trip. SNIP THE ROSES passed tiring rivals. COMMANDING ran evenly for three quarters then
had no rally. OUT OF STOCK stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn.
