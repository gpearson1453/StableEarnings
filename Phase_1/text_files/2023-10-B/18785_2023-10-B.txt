CUVEE TEE jostled leaving, trailed the field, moved up four wide leaving the backstretch then swept the lead, and remained clear. SWIFT SWALLOW
brushed leaving, allowed to settle inside, shifted out then went in pursuit of the leader, improved position, and finished evenly. REBATE pressed the early
pace, and faded. PERPETUAL BLISS broke outward, reserved off the early pacesetters, lodged a bid in the final turn but failed to threaten. ARANY jostled
away from the gate, set a pressured pace in the two path, dropped back then fell, did not finish, and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards
conducted an inquiry into the final turn of the race but made no change after review.

Footnotes
SLAATS was under a snug hold while three wide leaving the opening turn, gained closer order outside then took over, and opened up to an easy victory.
KYSTONE saved ground from the rail, chased in the final turn, was kept under heavy urging, and got by late for second. QUINTO SOL pressed the early
pace, gained an advantage entering the backstretch, was overtaken by SLAATS nearing the final turn, and faded gradually. I'M DASHING trailed the field,
and offered a late mild bid. SMART PLAY set a pressured pace, was overtaken, and was done early.

two path, rallied inside then weakened late stretch. DARKCLOUDOFSMOKE lagged early, and offered little. SHES A COOL CAT chased and tired.

Footnotes
ANOTHERFORBROOKS sandwiched leaving then settled near the back of the field, quickly gained closer order through the backstretch, drove three wide
at the head of the lane, closed steadily, and was along in time. LAHUN raced in closest pursuit, set sights on LOLLIPOP KID then overtook the lead, was
showing signs of tiring, and was caught late. LAST OF WAR broke outward bumping ANOTHERFORBROOKS, raced wide through the backstretch, and
rallied belatedly for show. AMEER saved ground inside, lodged a bid into the stretch, and was bested late. LOLLIPOP KID broke inward bumping inside
foes, drew away to good margins entering the backstretch, saw the margins diminish into the far turn, was overtaken then gave way. SUPER D'ORO
squeezed out away from the gate and was unable to recover from the poor start. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of
the race but made no change after a review of the film.

SOCIAL CUES quickly went to the front, took pressure through the backstretch, lost a slim advantage in the far turn, asked to quicken then regained the
lead, and held firm. GOLDIE SOCKS sat just off the pace early, prompted action while three to four wide, rallied between rivals in the final turn, and held for
place. QUEEN RHONDA went four wide through the first turn, moved up while four to five wide to contest the front, rallied three wide off the final turn, and
finished evenly. KEEPMEINPOWER broke awkwardly, tracked wide into the backstretch, and lacked a closing response. ANNA'S IMAGE saved inside and
tired early.

ECHO CREEK rated well off the pace inside, advanced quickly in the far turn, found clear running room inside then overtook the lead, and held under a late
threat from MONOPOLIZE. MONOPOLIZE broke slow, took closer order in the far turn, shifted out to the two path at the head of the lane, surged late and
missed. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN broke alertly then contested the early pace inside of WHERE'S THE PUMPS, inherited the lead briefly, and flattened in the
stretch. MISS MCBRIDE allowed to settle early, and bid belatedly. OLIVE'S CANDY was outsprinted through the turn, chased three wide, and weakened
late.

Footnotes
MUCHO MAGIC raced five to six wide into the backstretch, angled in sharply to the three path at the head of the lane, grabbed the lead and won driving.
ESTIFRAAD stalked four wide into the opening turn, took closer order while in the three path, inherited the front turning for home, and was outfinished. BON
PRIX pressed the early pace while three wide, tracked the pace from the four path, cut the corner into the last turn, was outkicked and held on for show.
BRODY'S STREAK vied inside for the early lead, showed the way through the backstretch, drifted out badly handing over the advantage, then came back
on but was unable to secure a top-three finish. BARE BACK JACK trailed the field while wide, lodged a mild bid and gave way. LIGHT FAST FEET vied
between early, and was outrun. TRUMP UM offered little.
