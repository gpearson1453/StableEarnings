Footnotes
NOVELLIE set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the turn, and stayed on along the inside down the lane to hold off an outer foe. A
J'S MEMORY rated in the six path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, was roused nearing the quarter, and kept on in the four path down the stretch
while still on her left lead for place. MY FIRST DATE chased in the five path, was driven in the three path early around the turn, and was one paced around
the five path down the lane for show. FOR THE THRILL tracked in the four path, was under right handed urging in the two path midway around the turn, but
was no factor around the six path down the lane. SHOW ME LOVE stalked in the three path, was ridden along the inside around the turn, but flattened in the
stretch. STARSHIP SIGRUN slowly broke out at the start, trailed from the four path into the turn and did not threaten. BLACK AND SILVER had her head
turned at the start, raced off the pace inside but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
FOREVER UNCAPTURED pressed the pace two wide, took over midway around the turn, drew clear leaving the quarter pole and widened while drifting out
a touch under left-handed urging. TAYYARA stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on to be
clearly second best. VACATION SUITE saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. DOVE IN CHARGE
failed to menace while racing four wide. TOVIA set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the quarter pole. HOLLYWOOD HONEY was outrun while
racing two wide. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE had only brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
HAY HAY PAULA broke slowly, chased in the three path, was roused from the two path into the far turn, cut the corner to take the lead at the top of the
lane, and was driven clear. KATIESDREAMGIRL rated in the four path, was stymied in the two path passing the quarter, swung out to the six path entering
the stretch, and ran on between for place. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS stalked in the five path, was cued early into the far turn, floated out to the seven path
turning into the lane, and finished evenly for show. RADIANT GEM had a slow start, raced off the pace in the four path, ranged up in the six path nearing the
quarter, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. WINNING AT EASE led around the first turn, dueled with an inner foe for
the lead in the four path down the backside, tipped to the three path around the far turn, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but flattened. SCENIC
VIEW vied for the lead inside of a foe from the two path turning into the backstretch, under confident handling on the inside around the far turn, was roused
from the four path into the lane, but faded. GRATIA raced wellback along the inside and never menaced.

CANT STOP DREAMING saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole, kicked in and readily drew off under a moderate urging.
FLUFFY saved ground well back, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and rallied for the place. PARALLEL pressed the pace two wide,
took a narrow lead between foes midway around the turn, drew clear in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. NEXT ON STAGE set the
pace along the rail and faded after three furlongs. SAND WEDGE stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths marker but
came up empty in the stretch. SHE CAN SCAT chased the pace four wide and retreated through the lane. NEW BABY broke inwardly into the gap, checked
soon after and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GRANTED SUCCESS settled off the pace, advanced four and five wide around the turn, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and powered clear
under a drive. SPY HUNTER had his head turned and was off very slowly, advanced outside down the backstretch, prompted the pace three wide around
the turn, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole but could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth. BORIS set the pace in the two path,
drifted out steadily through the stretch and weakened. JOE DI BAGGIO raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. DANZIG CHIPS chased
the pace inside and faded in the lane. APOCALYPSO dwelt and trailed throughout in the three path. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE START AND RULED THAT EVERY HORSE WAS ACCORDED A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO START.

Footnotes
ALI'I NUI prompted the pace in the five path, took command while tipping inside early around the far turn, opened up from the two path into the stretch, and
held sway under a drive. HALON trailed along the rail, shifted out to the four path under a ride early into the far turn, floated out to the seven path turning
into the stretch, and ran on for place. CLASSIC BALLAD rated in the four path, was cued early around the far turn, and kept on between foes in the four
path down the lane for show. NEVER SAY NEVER tracked in the four path, was driven between foes in the two path around the far turn, and finished evenly
from the three path in the stretch. SHEER DELIGHT was reluctant to load, bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path, was
under right handed urging in the five path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. PEYTON'S DAY
raced wellback in the four path and never threatened. PAPALOTE bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the three path but backed up along
the rail around the far turn. STRATEGY JAK stalked in the six path, ranged up to bid in the three path around the far turn, pulled up entering the stretch, and
was vanned off.
