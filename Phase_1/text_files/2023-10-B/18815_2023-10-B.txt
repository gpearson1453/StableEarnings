Footnotes
BELLA'S GATSBY was unruly in the gates, broke out, pressed the pace, moved up around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and won under steady
urging. LOST GOLD lacked early speed, racing on the rail down the backside, moved up around the final turn, angled out, split rivals, proved no match for
the winner, but got up for second. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT was fractious in the gates before the start, raced near the back, came around the final turn four
wide, rallied and was outfinished for second. GHOST COWBOY raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, made a late gain and missed the show
position. WINGS OF GOLD vied for the early lead and weakened late. PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded.
WILDCARD GOLD was fractious in the gates, raced in the middle of the field, dropped back and was no threat late. PRINCE SIMBA raced within contention
in the beginning, came around the first turn four wide, retreated and was outrun.

SHE'S EXTRA went to the front, drove clear, drifted out down the stretch, was all out at the wire and just held on. GOOD BY FAITH raced within striking
distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the stretch, altered course and missed. READY FOR THUNDER broke a step slow, saved
ground around the turn and gained ground. PARIS GARTERS void of early speed and passed tired ones. SHEZA HOT STORM raced within striking
distance and faded. LONG LEGGED LADY pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. WHY TEXAS WHY lacked early
speed, always raced near the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #4 GOOD BY FAITH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #5 SHE'S EXTRA
FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

weakened and was no real factor. WINGS FOR ENO raced in the middle of the pack and faded. PAYOFF CYCLE pressed the early pace and was finished
early. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY void of early speed and showed little.
