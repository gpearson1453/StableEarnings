Footnotes
CRAFTY OAKS took control from the onset, was patiently handled maintaining a slim advantage on the rail throughout the turn, was coaxed for more on the
fence in upper stretch, finally was urged to go nearing the sixteenth pole and comfortably kept the chasing rival at bay in deep stretch. MEKO MAKEE
tracked the duo down the backstretch, rated kindly sitting on the fence waiting behind the front pair on the turn, burst between runners finding clear running
room in the two path at the top of the stretch and chased the winner home but could not close the gap at the wire. NATURAL STAR broke in to begin, trailed
after the start, made an early move four deep at the half getting better position outside, loomed a threat three wide shadowing the front pair around the turn
and ran on mildly down the lane to be a distant but clear third at the finish line. ALWAYS A WAY stalked on the rail in the early going, saved ground seeing
the field throughout the turn and finished up willingly on the fence to be a fringe player in the end. CLASSY IMAGE was squeezed at the break, forced the
pace outside down the back straight, hounded the winner outside around the bend, was asked to keep up between runners fighting up front at the quarter
pole and gave way in the three path in upper stretch. CHASING BOURBON broke inwards to begin, was unhurried trailing in the four path at the half, put in
a brief run three wide outside foes from the five sixteenths pole until upper stretch and stalled through the lane. CANTUCCI broke out on the start, stalked
near the rear with horses on each side, was roused midturn, offered little response and had nothing to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MISS VYVYANNE was quickly clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, drew away in the stretch while kept busy. ADMISSIBLE was close up stalking the
winner two to three wide, proved no match but held the place. KANTBACKOFF settled off the pace, saved ground inside, was best of the rest. JUST ON
TIME settled mid-pack inside, came off the rail a bit leaving the turn, lacked the needed late kick. SOUPER COP lacked early speed bringing up the rear,
swung four wide, improved position. WELL ACTUALLY bobbled ever so slightly at the start but recovered quickly and moved forward, pursued the eventual
winner from outside four wide through the turn, weakened in the stretch. SILENT TRIBUTE broke in just a bit, raced off the pace outside rivals four wide
through the turn, was never a threat. MUSKOKA SUMMER was encouraged along two to three wide between runners, tired.

Footnotes
RELOAD'S RASCAL hesitated then was steadied soon after the start, was allowed to gather himself after the beginning to trail down the backside, began to
pick up runners three wide at the quarter pole, was full of run outside in the four path and held on in a well timed rally down the stretch. HILARIOUS AFFAIR
tracked in the second flight three deep on the outside down the back straight, rallied around rivals three wide three eighths out, was in range in the two path
at the top of the stretch, burst between horses at the furlong marker and just missed with the late surge at the finish line. ARTIE was urged along the
backstretch getting better inside position entering the turn, improved up the fence around the bend, had his sights set on the speedy frontrunner
straightening out for the drive but was outfinished late to settle for the show prize at the wire. KINETIC STONE took command on the inside from the start,
put away the two early speed rivals midway on the turn, opened up some at the top of the lane, was getting leg weary at the furlong pole and tired in deep
stretch saving for a minor share in the end. HIGHLAND LIFE watched the front trio tracking between horses down the backside, could not match strides with
others running around the bend, showed some interest to close in late and almost captured the minor share at the finish. RELOAD'S REBEL chased the
pace outside three wide down the backstretch and through the running around the turn, could not find more for the drive and yielded between foes in the
three path turning for home. HE'S FULLY LOADED prompted the pace with runners on each side down the backstretch, gave way vying up front in midturn
and emptied out at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY MAEVE (IRE) settled between runners in the second flight early, advanced three wide on the far turn, took command at the top of the stretch, kicked
clear, held safe. ERASMO'S GIRL raced far back early shifting in, was encouraged along past the half, swung four wide turning for home then angled out
another two paths once in upper stretch, continued to gain while rallying strongly outside for place but was too late to reach to the winner. BLAZING SKY
was caught three to four wide in the early going racing off the leaders but well clear of the trailers, continued three to four deep on the far turn, improved in
upper- to mid-stretch and kept on to secure show honors. AWILDAS TREASURE settled off the leaders racing off the rail, rallied between foes in mid-stretch
to improve position but evened out late. KATCHY NAME sped clear and angled in, set the pace inside, gave way. BAYOU BELLE raced off the inside far
back early, swung six wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. WICKED MIAH was encouraged forward down the stretch the first turn, raced just off the
leader two wide, dropped back and faded. LITTLE FIRE was in just a hair tight at the break, raced far back off the inside and was never a threat. COLOR
FORCE settled just off the leaders tracking inside, faltered.

Footnotes
TAWARET moved forward inside late on the turn, was blocked the whole of upper stretch seeking room in behind several, found it inside in mid-stretch,
moved to the lead soon after and prevailed. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB raced off the inside toward the back three to four wide on the turn, came out five to six
wide for the drive, kicked on late to get up for place. SASSINESS advanced inside on the turn shifting four wide late on that bend, struck the lead in upper
stretch, was outkicked by inside and outside foes. PLAYMATE quickly moved to the lead and shifted in, was briefly pressed by outside rivals, moved clear
soon after, was challenged again leaving the turn, fought on till mid-stretch then weakened. PAINTED GLORY switched out stalking the pacesetter two to
three wide and in range, continued to be within striking distance coming to mid-stretch, was outkicked. STORMS OF LIFE broke awkwardly and slowly, was
devoid of early speed, swung five wide and improved. GOOD NEWS MONEY stalked mid-pack three to four wide, came out further at the quarter pole,
made no late bid but kept on. HELIOCENTRIC was well-placed stalking two to three wide, had no late bid. ALL FOR HONOR was forwardly-placed stalking
from outside into the turn three to four wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
HITS DIFFERENT broke a bit slow at the start, was coaxed to get interested down the backside, three furlongs out was scrubbed on three wide starting to
make a run, swung out widest in the six path posing a threat driving to the wire and determinedly wore down the leader under a vigorous ride in deep
stretch. TIME TO RELOAD was alone in midfield down the backside, nudged to go after the leaders midpoint on the turn, pounced five wide taking the lead
straightening out for home, did not switch leads to the finish and was just outkicked by the winner in the final seventy yards. MO TOUGH was off slow on the
break, co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, rallied splitting runners in the two path midturn, was in the hunt finding a seam in the three path at the
top of the lane, could not threaten the top two but gamely finished up to prevail for the show money. TRILLING SONG hesitated on the break, co-trailed on
the outside in the early going, could still see the field at the quarter pole, shifted outside switching leads at the furlong marker, found her best stride late and
was closing in trying to get third at the wire. TAPPING A RHYTHM battled on the rail up front down the backstretch, had a slight advantage while pressed
outside around the bend, was collared outside at the quarter pole and faltered inside with an eighth remaining. HASLEMERE settled close to the middle of
the pack on the rail down the backside, saved ground on the fence closing the gap around the turn, was in with a chance for a share of the prize on the rail
at the top of the stretch but offered little finish and could not threaten in the final furlong. TALKING WONDERS had a good trip watching the engaged pair
battle down the back straight, moved three wide outside to bid at the quarter pole, momentarily poked her head in front, was headed outside turning for
home and flattened out at the furlong marker between runners. LOVE TO DREAM dueled outside up front down the backstretch, continued contesting the
pace outside through the turn, could not quicken with others at the quarter pole and backed away turning for home.

Footnotes
MORE MONEY HUNNY quickly moved to the lead, set the pace inside of pressuring outside rivals, was headed by several foes in upper stretch, fought on
gamely inside numerous rivals to retake a narrow lead late and just held from the closing rush of another. VAZHI settled racing mid-pack into the turn, was
unencumbered and all alone racing off the rail on that bend, shifted seven wide turning into upper stretch, took aim, rallied strongly but missed. LOIS'
COURAGE stalked from outside the second flight, went four to five wide on the turn, moved to challenge in upper stretch taking a narrow brief lead at the
three-sixteenths, was outkicked. PRINCESS JADE settled in behind the leading trio tracking inside into the turn, came out five wide in mid-stretch, kept on
but needed more. CHARLOTTES ROAD attended the pace from outside three to four wide, exchanged light brushing leaving the backstretch, bid at the top
of the stretch looming a threat and with a narrow brief advantage, lacked the needed late kick. BEAUTIFUL SKY was in behind the leaders and inside a rival
leaving the backstretch, steadied sharply at that point dropping back several lengths, continued four then five wide on the turn regaining momentum on the
leaders, floated eight wide into the stretch and ran on. MCKENZIE ROAD pressed the eventual winner from between foes two to three deep, exchanged a
light brush leaving the backstretch, dropped back in upper stretch and altered out six wide, came up empty in the drive. AHBEE raced between foes at the
back going two to three wide on the turn, shifted out five to six deep in upper stretch, was never a threat. SAVE THE BEES broke a step slowly, switched
out, raced between foes into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, swung seven deep, made no bid. LOOKIN TO CONQUER was at the back
saving ground on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, failed to menace. LEMON SWEETS was caught outside foes at the back four to five deep into the
turn, shifted in late on that bend, was not a factor. TIPSY'S EMPIRE was urged at the start and switched off the inside chasing in behind the leaders racing
off the rail, came out for the stretch run then veered in to the rail near the three-sixteenths, faded.

NO MORE OPTIONS had a good position nestled on the rail behind the contesting pair at the half, patiently waited for his que inside on the turn, was urged
to go after the leaders at the quarter pole, swung out to the four path gaining momentum posing the main threat, found another gear to past rivals taking
control outside at the sixteenth pole and was smartly drawing clear for the victory crossing the wire. SIESTA BEACH could see this compact field outside
down the backside, was coaxed at the rear keeping pace with the pack around the bend, shifted inside to the rail closing in with a furlong from home and
surged in deep stretch to get up for the place share. JUNIOR HOT SHOT prompted between rivals at the start, forced the pace outside four furlongs from
home, was content shadowing the frontrunner outside around the bend, stubbornly battled between horses at the eighth pole, was no match for the winner
late, faded and lost the pace share nearing the wire. GAROFOLI emerged with a slight lead on the rail at the half, maintained a narrow lead throughout the
turn on the fence, fought on clinging to the lead in mid-stretch, needed more late and weakened in the two path between runners at the sixteenth pole for a
minor share. YACHT BOY broke alertly to lead at the start, tracked the engaged duo in the three path outside down the back straight, came under a ride
three wide trying to go after the front pair at the quarter pole, could not close in turning for home, had nothing more to give in upper stretch and tired on the
outside in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LADY MOONSHINE rated kindly on the rail down the back straight keeping tabs on the front two, crept closer when coaxed starting a run on the fence three
furlongs out, burst between horses in the three path looking strong at the top of the lane, took the lead at the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task late to
hold off the re-rallying runner up at the finish line. BLUEBERRY FIELDS was content to sit behind the pacesetter, tracking outside in the early stages, was
asked to reel in the frontrunner three furlongs from home, came under a hard ride between horses making little gain on the leader at the quarter pole and
battled back to resurge at the finish to capture second money. ROYAL BLUSH took this field into the first turn, set a soft pace down the backstretch
comfortably up front, was under only mild pressure still dictating the pace on the final turn, fought on inside through the stretch but gave way grudgingly in
the final seventy yards holding for show in the end. JAB was at the back of the pack outside four deep into the turn, tracked the front two outside down the
backside, was roused three wide making good progress midway on the final turn, loomed a threat in the five path turning for home but stalled late to settle
for a small piece of the prize in the end. FISH MOONEY settled near the back under a hold in the two path on the first turn, stalked between foes in the two
wide down the backside, made a mild run when nudged to go on between foes at the three eighths pole but could not get interested down the stretch to be
involved at the finish. JUMPIN JUNIE travelled in hand near the rear on the first turn, stalked on the rail in the third flight down the back straight, could not
quicken with others running on the far turn and could not be a factor driving to the finish line. MAKES SENSE TO ME stalked three wide in the first turn,
settled in the third flight three deep down the backstretch, offered little run four wide three furlongs out, stopped in upper stretch, was eased crossing the
finish and walked off.

Footnotes
OLIVIA ROSE took control from the onset setting a soft opening first quarter unopposed, continued strongly up front unchallenged running throughout the
turn, was set down in upper stretch, easily cleared off and won going away in a very convincing front end display. HURRICANE CLAIR was content to sit off
the winner outside down the backstretch, midturn was roused to go after the loose frontrunner but could not close the gap, chased in upper stretch but to no
avail and finished up comfortably besting the rest for the runners up share. FOURFIFTYFOUR tracked the front two on the outside at the half, was scrubbed
on with five sixteenths to go but could not gain top the top three runners around the bend, gamely never gave up and fought on late to close in capturing
third money in the final sixteenth. LADY WELLINGTON tracked in the second flight on the rail down the backside, was asked midturn making little gain on
the leaders but opened on fellow rival for third position through the turn, faded in mid-stretch and held for a minor share at wire. GRADEVOLE broke out at
the start, co-trailed in the third flight on the outside down the backstretch, made little impression running around the bend and could not get into contention
driving to the finish line. RED ELEANOR co-trailed on the inside down the back straight, made no impact throughout the turn running inside on the rail and
showed little in the stretch drive.

HELLUVA HOLIDAY patiently tracked the frontrunner in the early stages, started to reel in the leader at the quarter pole, bid three wide outside at the top of
the lane, poked her head in front dueling with two other rivals inside in deep stretch and held on stubbornly at the finish line. CRUMLIN BEAST tracked the
pace on the rail in the backstretch, continued on the fence watching the front two around the bend waiting to move, pounced in the two path in tight quarters
in mid-stretch, fought on gamely to the wire but could not get by the winner down the lane. HUMOR ME JIM comfortably took this field down the backstretch
setting the pace, continued through the turn with little pressure up front setting the pace, was asking for the wire just holding onto the lead on the fence at
the furlong marker, could not ward off the two that were tracking her throughout the entire race and faded in deep stretch to be a clear third. O WOW settled
in the third flight in the three path with runners on each side with a half left to run, was shuffled back some three eighths from the finish, recovered to start
picking up horses four wide at the quarter pole and closed in willingly through the stretch to capture a minor share in the end. ASHLEE'S RING stalked four
deep in the third flight at the half, commenced a rally four wide three furlongs from the line, was in the mix for a share in the four path turning for home and
battled for the minors to the finish but was outgamed at the wire. SPEEDY JOHNY was off slow, trailing by many down the backside, was hard ridden three
furlongs out still seeing the field, began to get into stride reaching for ground catching up to runners by the quarter pole and closed strongly in the six path
outside horses down the lane but had too much do to pose a threat at the finish. LILLZ HOPE broke slow on the start, had one beat while unhurried down
the backside, was urged three wide at the quarter pole for more run and offered a mild finish in the stretch but could not be a factor at the wire. GAV'S
DREAM GIRL travelled in midfield between foes down the back straight, was nudged for more five sixteenths out, made little headway through the turn,
showed some interest to be involved for the minor share in upper stretch with a rally but could not continue on to the wire and faded in the final seventy
yards losing a couple of placings just before the finish line. KRYPTO GAINS stalked near the rear on the fence down the backside, progressed inside
making a brief rally at the three furlong pole to be in range on the rail at the top of the stretch, could not sustain the run and retreated in the final sixteenth.
TELLTALE tracked three wide outside down the backstretch, could not keep pace with others when asked for more three furlongs from home and faltered
with rivals on either side in upper stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 CRUMLIN BEAST AGAINST #5 HELLUVA HOLIDAY RUNNING THROUGH THE
STRETCH IN THE FINAL FURLONG WAS DISALLOWED
