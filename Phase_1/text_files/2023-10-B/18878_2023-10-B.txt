Footnotes
FRESNO CHILE took back in the early running and saved ground into the first turn, moved up along the backstretch run while saving ground and chased
RHONDA'S COOKIN to the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the stretch and made a steady gain on that rival heading to the furlong marker, came within
range at the sixteenth-marker, drew to even terms with RHONDA'S COOKIN in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. RHONDA'S COOKIN
was sent leaving the start and assumed command into the first turn, drew to a clear lead along the first turn and set solid fractions into the backstretch run,
drew off heading to the half-mile pole and widened the lead along the far turn, had the lead cut into while still clear approaching mid-stretch, felt pressure
from FRESNO CHILE inside of the sixteenth-marker, was all out in the final strides and was tagged for the win on the wire, while holding clearly for second
at the finish. PRESTIGIOUS settled off of the early pace and raced outside of rivals into the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch run and was
content to trail to the half-mile marker, improved position four wide on the far turn, maintained that four wide path into the stretch and chased the top pair to
the furlong pole, could not impact the top two in the final sixteenth but closed well late and was well clear in the end for third. BILLY GALLIVAN bobbled
leaving the start and was off a step slowly, tracked between runners into the first turn, continued to track from the second flight while between rivals through
the backstretch run, chased two wide to the quarter pole, gained ground into the stretch but could not muster the needed response in the final stages.
GLORIOUS DIVINITY broke alertly, was prominent into the first turn and stalked the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run and tracked the loose
pacesetter to the half-mile marker, lost position approaching the quarter marker, saved all of the ground into the stretch, lacked a response in the final
furlong and weakened. SILVER FLIRT was forwardly placed while saving ground into the first turn, tracked the solid pace from a two wide path into the
backstretch run, was asked for run two wide into the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch and tired. LIGHTS ASTERN settled off of the solid early
pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn and came four wide into the backstretch run, tracked the quick pace to the half-mile marker, dropped back
into the far turn, maintained a wide path into the stretch and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SHOUT IT OUT took back off of the solid early pace, tracked three wide into the turn and improved position approaching the quarter marker, swung to the
four path into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, rallied five wide in deep stretch, surged in the
final strides and was up at the wire to prevail in a blanket finish. JAYS ANGEL was hustled away from the start and assumed command in the early stages,
set a pressured pace into the turn and dueled with BOLD MISTRESS through solid fractions heading to the quarter marker, maintained a narrow lead into
the stretch and battled with BOLD MISTRESS to the furlong marker, held a slim lead into the final sixteenth, was headed by BOLD MISTRESS in the final
yards, came again and was nailed on the wire by SHOUT IT OUT for the win, while just holding for second in a game runner-up effort. BOLD MISTRESS
disputed the solid early pace while three wide and between runners, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace two wide to the quarter marker, battled for
the lead into the stretch, dueled with JAYS ANGEL into the final sixteenth, drew to even terms with that rival in deep stretch, was outfinished in the final
strides and just missed for the win and place, while dead-heating for the show. MAYCEE JO was a bit antsy in the post parade and unseated the rider, was
away from the gate in good order and raced close to the solid early pace while four wide, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace three wide
approaching the quarter marker, battled for the lead into the stretch, responded to firm urging into the final sixteenth, closed in the final strides while
between runners and just missed for the win and place, while dead-heating for the show. LUCY L took back off of the solid early pace and saved ground into
the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, found her best stride late, vied between runners in the final strides and just missed in a blanket finish. MISS
SKI forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the solid early pace while between runners, lost position into the turn and chased two wide to the
quarter pole, ran evenly into the stretch and did not offer a late response.

SPINNIN PISTOLS tracked the solid early pace outside of a rival, improved position into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, slipped to the
rail into upper stretch and loomed nearing the furlong marker, responded to urging into deep stretch, wore down MELANIE'S TIGER in the final sixteenth
and held in a drive at the finish to prevail in a good debut. MELANIE'S TIGER bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up in the early running
and disputed the solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, assumed command into the turn and set a fast pace approaching the quarter marker, drifted to
the two path into upper stretch and maintained the lead to the furlong marker, held foes at bay to the sixteenth-pole, was overtaken in deep stretch and was
outfinished in the final strides for the win, while just holding for second. TAMARANDO STAR broke alertly and established the early lead, was engaged by
MELANIE'S TIGER and disputed the solid pace with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, pressed outside of MELANIE'S TIGER along the turn, lost
ground into the drive and shifted to the three path in upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker, re-rallied three wide in deep stretch and just missed for
second, while holding clearly for third. STEVE'S BIG TICKET raced close up while outside of runners in the early stages, lost ground three wide on the turn
and swung four wide into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker, mildly re-rallied in deep stretch but needed more in the late stages. NOVINOPHOBIA
tracked the solid early pace from the inside, lost position on the turn, saved ground into the top of the stretch, could not keep pace approaching the furlong
marker and lacked a response in deep stretch.

Footnotes
LOADED MUSKET was away in good order, vied for the early lead then took back to track from the inside heading into the turn, was guided to the two path
and waited for racing room at the quarter marker, found a narrow seam into upper stretch, split rivals at the furlong marker, battled with WICKLOW HILLS
and took command approaching the sixteenth-marker, drew to a clear lead into deep stretch and powered home under firm hand urging to prevail.
DRUMADOON rated off of the fast early pace and tracked from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter
marker, saved ground into upper stretch, was blocked along the rail from the three sixteenth-marker to mid-stretch, found an opening nearing the furlong
marker, could not match strides with LOADED MUSKET in the late stages but ran on and was up in the final strides to claim second. WICKLOW HILLS
broke alertly and vied for the early lead away from the start, pressed the solid early pace inside of JERSEY BABE, dueled with that rival into the turn and
carved out fast fractions heading to the quarter marker, maintained a rail path into upper stretch and took a narrow lead to the furlong grounds, was
overtaken by LOADED MUSKET approaching the sixteenth-marker, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for second in the final strides, while
holding safely for third. DRAW SOME bobbled then was bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was away a step slowly, lacked early speed and
saved ground into the turn, made a mild gain from the inside into upper stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong and finished
evenly. MEDAL ICE tracked the solid early pace from the outside, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, raced widest into the stretch, lost
ground at the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. JERSEY BABE was prominent away from the start, vied for the early lead then was sent to
the front in the opening half-mile, set pressured fractions into the turn outside of WICKLOW HILLS, dueled with that runner to the quarter marker while
setting a quick pace, made room for the oncoming LOADED MUSKET at mid-stretch, lacked a response into the final furlong and faded.

Footnotes
AZURE STAR (IRE) broke well from the inside and secured the lead and the rail heading into the clubhouse turn then opened up on the field while under
some restraint, remained unpressured down the backstretch, leading the field through solid fractions for the level, responded when challenged by
CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN and was set down passing the five-sixteenths marker, battled that foe the length of the stretch, gained a narrow advantage inside
the sixteneth pole and held on. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN secured good position into the first turn, then settled behind AZURE STAR (IRE) as that one set all
the early fractions, moved to challenge for the lead passing the five-sixteenths pole then tried unsuccessfully to get in front of that foe for the length of the
stretch. LYING GHOST raced two deep through the first turn, then settled mid-pack in a tracking position, got a clean inside trip through the far turn and
loomed a threat at the top of the stretch, could not find another gear when needed but finished well enough to hold third. VANISKY was not asked for speed
out of the gate then was floated six wide on the first turn, had to check slightly when DANCE COMPANY crossed in front near the thirteen-sixteenths pole,
started a sustained run near the nine-sixteenths pole and ran on well down the stretch but too late to be a threat. DANCE COMPANY broke well but was
content to settle near the rear of the field, moved out into the clear down the backstretch and improved position, attempted to rally with three furlongs to go
but could do no better than finish one-paced while still wide down the stretch. BROOKYS TAPIT got squeezed and shuffled back a few strides out of the
gate, giving the rest of the field a head start, raced far behind the others through the first half then made a mild sustained rally to improve position a little but
had far too much ground to make up. JOHNNY DAR broke a step slow then was hustled to vie for the lead three deep through the first turn, then back off
the pace and was content to track behind the pacesetter, started to weaken passing the seven-sixteenths marker and despite the best efforts of the rider
dropped back through the field and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
RAFANELLI was asked for early speed away from the start and took command leaving the break, sped to a clear early lead and set quick fractions into the
turn, carved out a fast pace while unchallenged through the turn, widened the lead into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and was geared
down in the final strides to be much the best. LAURA BRANIGAN was forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the fast early pace from the inside,
ran in pursuit of RAFANELLI to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the stretch and lost ground to that rival heading to the furlong marker, was able to
cut into the margin in the final stages but could not impact the winner and was second best. TURIAF broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace,
shifted to the rail into the turn and chased the fast pace to the quarter marker, angled three wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the top two in the
final furlong but closed well and was clear in the end for third. LITTLE LILIANA chased the fast early pace outside of rivals, maintained a three wide path to
the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked a late rally. SWEET LAYLA RAE broke in at the start and was off slowly, chased from the
rear while saving ground heading into the turn, trailed into the stretch and did not factor. GENTLE JULIA close up away from the start, chased the
pacesetter between runners in the opening furlong, ran in pursuit while two wide and between rivals heading to the quarter marker, swung to the three path
into upper stretch, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DRIVER'S ED broke alertly and established the early lead leaving the break, cleared to the two path and set fast fractions while pressed into the turn,
slipped to the rail and carved out a quick pace while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong
marker, was kept to steady urging into the final sixteenth, switched to the left lead into deep stretch, maintained a clear lead over the runner-up and held
safely in a drive. YOU ENJOY MYSELF chased the fast early pace from a three wide position, ran in pursuit from that three wide path approaching the
quarter marker, gained ground into the stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the late stages and ran on to be second best. OUR NORTH STAR
took back in the early stages and settled toward the rear to begin, raced two wide into the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, was roused four wide
into the stretch, moved up at the furlong grounds, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but finished well and was clear in the end for third. ZEE
CARROT EAGLE chased the fast early pace from the outside, slipped to the two path into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker,
continued that bid while three wide into the stretch, could not sustain his rally into the late stages and flattened out. FORDY G was hustled to be prominent
away from the start, pressed inside of DRIVER'S ED in the early stages, took back and was guided outside of the pacesetter entering the turn, kept close
attendance to the fast pace heading to the quarter marker, could not match strides with DRIVER'S ED into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.
ONE BIG SMILE chased the fast early pace from a four wide path, drifted out a bit entering the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker while racing
wide, came five wide into the stretch and gave way. UPDRAFT chased from the inside and did not have an impact. PLENTY COUPS was crowded at the
start and was away a step slowly, chased the fast early pace from the inside, improved position on the turn, ran evenly into the stretch and tired in the final
stages. RACER REX was slow into stride away from the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STRANGE ADDICTION came out of the gate awkwardly then recovered quickly and was up on the pace through the first turn, was taken in hand and took
up a stalking position behind SAREEHA (IRE) down the backstretch, rating nicely, allowed that rival to slip away heading into the far turn, then when that
pacesetter started to weaken was set down, quickly took command in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, dug in under firm handling
into deep stretch and lasted over the oncoming runner-u. TIZ MY PRINCESS unhurried early, was held up in the back of the compact field while saving
ground to the far turn, angled to the four path at the top of the stretch, closed willingly in the late stages, pressured STRANGE ADDICTION but could not get
by the determined winner and missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. SAREEHA (IRE) was sent hard for the lead from the break, took a
short lead through the clubhouse turn with the rider doing his best to slow down the pace, then extended the lead passing the half-mile marker but started to
weaken approaching the stretch, was overtaken by STRANGE ADDICTION approaching the quarter pole, weakened in the final sixteenth and just held for
third. BEA MISCHIEF taken in hand settled two deep at the rear of the field, attempted a wide rally through the far turn and advanced at the quarter marker,
came under pressure turning for home, had trouble changing leads, could not muster the needed late response and just missed for third. FINNLEY'S
KITTEN settled mid-pack while saving ground along the rail, came under a ride past the three furlong marker, raced on the wrong lead through the stretch
and was gave way. J AND M EXPRESS floated three wide through the first turn, moved up to a stalking position a few lengths behind the pacesetter while
still racing in the three path, rallied through the far turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ALEXANDER'S DREAM broke sharply then angled over when clear, pressured HARBOR OUTLAW through the early running, moved to challenge that one
passing the three furlong pole, took command turning for home, responded when set down for the stretch run and held off a fast closing challenger at the
wire. THE LITTLE H MAN raced in the middle of the compact field, patiently waited for racing room through the stretch, took advantage of a seam near the
three-sixteenths marker then produced a strong rally and was slowly gaining on the eventual winner but ran out of racetrack. TALBOT BAY steadied slightly
just after the start when MOTHER'S PRAYER came over, steadied repeatedly while racing on the rail behind a wall of horses down the backstretch,
checked hard just past the half-mile pole, then checked again past the seven-sixteenths marker, awaited room through the turn, deftly eased out to the five
path for the stretch run then closed strongly under steady handling but came up short in a courageous effort. HARBOR OUTLAW broke best and was able
to gain the early lead, set a solid pace while being dogged by ALEXANDER'S DREAM through the early fractions, dug in when that foe moved to challenge
on the far turn, hung in to mid-stretch then was outfinished in the final furlong. BEAUDACIOUS broke well but was put into a hard hold at the rear of the field
through the early stages, angled to the outside for clear running through the turn, took the five path while making a sweeping move through the turn, came
into the stretch with designs on the lead then stalled out and finished one-paced to the wire. WINDRIBBON raced close up but near the rear and between
horses in the compact field, had to check hard near the seven-sixteenths marker, lost some momentum, tried to re-rally by going seven wide into the stretch
and was going well until the final furlong. BLAZING JAMIE raced near the rear of the compact field, was stuck behind horses through the turn, swung out six
wide into the stretch, but did not have the needed response. MOTHER'S PRAYER broke in and bothered TALBOT BAY after the break, then was pushed to
challenge for the early lead, got inside position and tracked just behind ALEXANDER'S DREAM and TALBOT BAY, had to wait for running room passing the
quarter pole then dropped over to the rail for the stretch run but tired in the final furlong. SLEW'S JOY was close up between horses in the early going,
launched a bid passing the three furlong pole then gave way in the stretch.
