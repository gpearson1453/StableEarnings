Footnotes
GHOSTLY NIGHT prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, took charge with five sixteenths to go, drew clear entering the lane and held
sway from pursuers on either side while subtly tiring in the final furlong. CALTHA was washed out with a visible layer of sweat in the post parade, tracked
the top pair along the inside, ran on in the two path to gain place in the final sixteenth and held that position late. DONYA KNOW IT veered inwardly at the
start, raced off of the pace two to three wide into the turn, steadily gained ground around the bend, stayed on in the five path and reached show at the wire
while missing place. VITAEMI set the pace inside of the eventual winner, proved no match for that one with five sixteenths to go, yet sustained a chase to
maintain place through midstretch, but was bested by an outer pair in the final sixteenth. SACRED BEAUTY raced off of the pace in the two path, fanned out
to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace. L. A. STAR trailed in the three path and improved along the inside in the final furlong. PRIDDIS
hopped slightly at the start, chased two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BALL GOWN stalked outside of the clear leader, bid at the three furlong pole, drew off nearing the lane and was driven home to seal the deal. MENDED WE
STAND tracked in the three path, was coaxed along in pursuit of the top pair from the four path around the turn, spun into the lane in the five path, gained
place approaching the furlong grounds and lasted for that position between rivals while tiring late. HOT SUMMER DREAM lacked speed along the inside,
shifted to the four path entering the turn before tipping to the six path leaving it, then stayed on wider in the final furlong and missed reaching place.
MAHOMEBRED popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, sped clear early on, but was headed by an outer bidder at the three furlong pole and
weakened approaching the lane. SHES A SECRET chased along the inside then faded in the two path around the turn. LITURGIA lacked speed in the three
path, dropped back to the rear despite heavy urging and was outrun. FLATTER ME ZEN trailed along the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
YULETIDE GALLOP took contact from an outer rival at the start, stalked in the three path, pressed between horses around the turn, chased the leader while
drifting inwardly in upper stretch, took aim before lugging in behind his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, straightened and offered a bid while lugging
again at the sixteenth pole, flopped back to his left lead while dueling through the late stages and prevailed. ONE RED CENT set the pace in the two path,
showed the way from outer pressers around the turn, held sway as YULETIDE GALLOP pursued through midstretch, dug in to resist that foe's bid in the
final sixteenth, dueled but was bested late. WHO'S SNOW TROUBLE bumped an inner rival while off awkwardly, stalked in the four path, applied moderate
pressure to the top pair around the turn, but chased those foes while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, changed over while vying for show with
an inner foe in the final furlong and saved that position. NOTORIOUS SIXOHTWO broke a step slow, rushed forward to be close up inside of the leader by
the nine sixteenths pole, stalked around the turn, vied with an outer rival for show in the final furlong while chasing, but missed. MY BROTHER CHARLIE
brushed with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path, crept closer in the five path entering the lane and moved up. STING MUSIC saved
ground in midpack, but to no avail. COAL MINER dropped his rider behind the gate and sprinted loose for a furlong, then was fractious trying to load once
again, chased in the two path into the turn but weakened around the bend. VINO FA DANZA made little impact from the two path. IN THE NUMBERS
lacked speed in the three path and failed to factor. CHASENTHEONE pursued rom midpack in the four path and weakened. BROADWAY RED broke a step
slow, exchanged light contact with an inner rival and was steadied back at the start, then got outrun in the three path.

Footnotes
CAMP DADDY broke a touch outwardly, vied two wide, wrestled an advantage coming to midstretch, inched clear entering the final sixteenth and held sway
from an outer pursuer late. MAGNIFICENT MILE tracked behind the leaders and from the two path around the turn, tipped to the three path while chasing to
the top pair entering the final furlong, ran on to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. HOCUS sparred for the lead inside of
the eventual winner, got headed in upper stretch, gave way with a sixteenth to go and narrowly saved show. GOODASIWONSWAS trailed the short field
early on, pursued in the three to four path while attempting to range closer outside of rivals around the turn, but lugged inwardly in upper stretch, shifted
back out in midstretch, ran on late but missed reaching a tiring rival for show. HUSKER BUTCH stalked outside of the top pair, failed to keep pace with them
while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, yielded while getting floated to the four path at the furlong grounds, gave way yet missed between horses in
the photo for show.

Footnotes
SPIRIT'S MISCHIEF vied two wide, led narrowly around the turn, then kicked away approaching midstretch. MUAZARAH broke sharply, vied inside of a pair
of rivals into the turn, prompted while headed around the bend, quickly failed to keep pace with the leader at the three sixteenths pole and remained well
clear of show. REDEPOSIT broke a step slow, rushed forward to stalk four wide, yielded and lost ground turning for home, yet sustained stride while tucking
three wide in upper stretch, ran on between horses entering the final furlong and prevailed over an inner rival for show. IN A JAM broke outwardly, tracked
two wide and between horses, vied for show with an outer rival in the final furlong but missed. BRENNAN'S HONOR broke a step slow, bumped with an
outer rival while securing inside tracking position at the nine sixteenths pole, subtly steadied back inside the three furlong pole, then saved ground around
the bend and lacked a bid. GOTTA KEEP HIM bumped with an inner rival at the nine sixteenths pole, retreated to midpack into the turn, shifted to the three
path turning for home, then to the five path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. OY VEY prompted three wide, but gave way entering the lane and weakened.
CHESTNUT CREED bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three to four path, gave way and drifted inwardly in upper stretch.
SMOKEY SMOKEY bumped with an outer rival while put to crowded quarters by an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear along the inside and failed to
factor. NON FUNGIBLE shied subtly from bumping foes at the nine sixteenths pole, then never got involved from the two path. GOOD POINT showed little
in the three path. CAMILAS WARRIOR shied between horses and steadied soon after the start, lacked speed in the four path and was outrun.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK settled off of the pace in the two path, gained in the four path and outside of rivals to take aim on the clear leader nearing the lane, sustained
progress to bid in midstretch, dueled with that aforementioned rival through the final furlong and edged an advantage in the closing stages. TIGER MOON
tracked in the three path, bid boldly well in hand with three furlongs to go, drew clear shortly after, but required a strong right rein and a left handed crop to
keep from lugging inwardly in upper stretch dueled with an outer bidder entering the final furlong but was bested late. NEPAL UP lacked speed along the
inside, crept closer down the backstretch, improved between faltering foes inside the three furlong pole, then ran on mildly in the four path to secure show.
NORDIC LIGHT pressed two wide, led into the far turn, but proved no match for an outer bidder at the three furlong pole and weakened. CALL ME GUSTO
got briefly antsy just before the off, stalked outside of the top pair around the first turn, but faded between horses with three furlongs to go. MONKEY ZONE
hopped and broke slowly, trailed in the four path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and was outrun. COMMANDER CARL set the pace
along the inside, but was headed into the far turn, stopped shortly after and was eased through the lane.

SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS set the pace in the three to two path while feeling pressure from an outer rival into the turn, shook clear of that one while well in
hand in the three path in upper stretch, responded once set down inside the final furlong and held sway safely. FROZEN SOLID pressed the leader from the
four to three path into the turn, but failed to keep pace with her while drifting to the five path in upper stretch, yet sustained his pursuit of that one through the
final furlong and held place from an outer bidder late. LAURA'S CHARM bumped with an inner rival just after the start, raced off of the apace two wide,
shifted to the five path entering the lane, moved out to the nine path approaching midstretch, then rallied to bid for place late but came up short. ROYAL
COUNTY bumped with rivals on both sides while put to crowded quarters among them at the start, saved ground off of the pace, improved by splitting foes
two wide at the furlong grounds and ran on evenly. FRANGO ELECTRICO bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased two wide and between horses,
entered the lane in the three path and lacked a bid. TWIRLING SAVI raced at the rear along the inside, shifted out entering the lane and moved up. TAKE
CHARGE CHLOE was off a step slow while breaking a bit outwardly, then made little impact from the three path. FOUR DAWN was antsy in the starting
gate, tracked three wide, floated to the four path entering the lane and faded between horses in the final furlong. SOL HOPE stalked along the inside and
weakened.

Footnotes
RAGING SEA tracked two wide and between horses, strolled up to the top pair to bid three wide at the three furlong pole, sparred with an inner POBLANO
turning for home, wrestled a narrow advantage in upper stretch, tenaciously clung to that margin through midstretch and edged ahead entering the final
sixteenth. POBLANO prompted two wide, led into the far turn as an outer RAGING SEA joined the fray, dueled with that one turning for home, lost an
advantage in upper stretch yet fought on gamely into the final furlong, but yielded with a sixteenth to go. SURELY SHIRLEY raced at the rear two wide,
saved ground around the far turn, then stayed on inside of rivals to gain show at the wire. LEXA tracked along the inside, chased the leaders from the two
path around the far turn, floated to the four path entering the lane before surpassing a tiring rival for show in upper stretch, but lost that position to an inner
rival at the wire. LET'S DUET lacked speed along the inside, improved position in the three path around the far turn before fanning to the five path entering
the lane, but flattened out without reaching contention. FOREVER AFTER ALL set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one and another
bidder into the far turn and weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. EIVISSA stalked three wide, yielded between horses nearing the backstretch,
chased in the four path around the far turn and tired. OVERINDULGENCE stalked in the four path, but steadily faded after a half mile. LAVISH HABITS laid
off of the pace three to four wide around the first turn, but was through approaching the far turn and eased through the lane.

BRIGADIER GENERAL set the pace in the two path, built a clear margin into the far turn, maintained an open advantage in upper stretch, shifted down
entering the final sixteenth as an inner rival threatened to offer a bid, and held firm while keeping that one in a bit tight to the wire. WAR CAMPAIGN settled
far back two wide, gained along the inside turning for home, sustained a rail rally to take aim inside of the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, inched
closer while kept in tight quarters by that one in the late stages and was fended off. MINNESOTA READY tracked two wide and between horses, gained
place from outer rivals with five sixteenths to go, chased in pursuit outside of the clear leader turning for home and flattened out. BRITAIN'S KITTEN trailed
along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, cut the corner and rallied inside of rivals entering the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on.
SEARCH ENGINE stalked the top pair from the four path, chased between horses around the far turn and gave way. FOREVER SOUPER laid off of the
pace in the three to five path and tired. WARRIOR JOHNY pressed the leader from the three path while between horses, but yielded into the far turn and
weakened between horses turning for home. XAVEY DAVE stalked along the inside, but came under heavy urging with a half mile to go and weakened.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATED DRAMA broke outwardly, prompted two wide from the three path, led turning for home and drew off under a drive. CRAVENSWORTH broke
a step slow, trailed in the two path, rallied between horses in upper stretch and sustained progress to gain place from an outer rival late. HI YAH bumped
with an outer rival at the start, tracked the top pair from the four path, inched closer as the eventual winner took charge turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with that one in upper stretch, yielded late and lost place in the closing stages. INSIGNIS lacked speed in the five path, entered the lane in the six path
while among foes and moved up. DUAL MONARCHY chased from midpack along the inside, tipped off the rail nearing the lane, drifted further out in upper
stretch and yielded between rivals. DAVID'S TUITION steadied hard after being put to tight rail quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, raced far back along the
inside around the turn, encountered traffic in upper stretch and failed to factor. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN pursued from midpack two wide and between
horses, entered the lane in the four path and failed to threaten among foes. MAHONEY ROAD bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack
in the five path and gave way. ENJOYMENT broke a step slow before being put to a bit of crowded quarters between horses at the start, lacked speed in
the three path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and lacked a rally. THANKGODNGREYHOUND set the pace inside of a vying rival while a path
off of the inside, got headed turning for home and caved.
