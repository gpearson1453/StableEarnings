Footnotes
BEYOND BEST settled inside, bid to the front after half a mile and extended his lead under moderate urging. ROAN BURGUNDY set a pressured pace for
half mile then pursued the winner rest of way. IN SPADES moved close up four wide then flattened out in the stretch. THISTLE saved ground just behind
the leaders and faltered. PREDOMINATE trailed far behind and managed only a mild rally while no threat. BIG BEEMSTER lagged far behind outside and
was never in contention. DESANTIS prompted the pace for half a mile and gave way readily. NOTABLE EXCEPTION flashed speed then stopped abruptly
losing contact.

LADY ZETA took control at once, repelled challenge at the top of the stretch and pulled away. TARA'S TALENT lacked speed, split rivals advancing and just
up for the place. MIDTOWN ROSE flashed speed, angled out in the stretch and closed well. ALWAYS MIA raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and
weakened. CONFIRMED GENIUS moved just off the leaders inside and faded. KILIMANJARA dropped back early and was never in contention. PEACH
PERFECT trailed to the stretch then passed fading rivals. CARTOUCHE raced close up wide down the backstretch and gave way. GET GROOVY raced far
behind throughout losing contact with his field.

AVA K'S BOY set a pressured pace outside, remained ahead under constant pressure and gamely lasted holding off late challenges. LARGE made a
menacing wide bid on the turn then made a gradual late gain. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS forced the pace along the inside throughout and finished willingly.
MISCHIEVOUS JONES saved ground in second flight and continued well to the finish. SPLITZVILLE dropped far behind and was never involved. ABOUT
THE MULTIPLE raced within striking range for half a mile and gave way. DANGNABBIT stumbled at the start causing his right iron to break losing all
chance and could not be properly ridden.

CAUSES TROUBLE sprinted clear early, widened in the stretch and was kept to his task. BAAFEED lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and closed
well. LEGAL DEAL dropped back early, was in bit tight at the top of the stretch and no threat. THE KHOZAN ONE raced near the inside then flattened out in
the stretch. A DANGEROUS GUY prompted the winner along the inside and faltered. MANOLITO dropped far back then caught fading rival. HAPPY FARM
hustled just off the leaders outside and gave way.

COLD FEET hustled to a clear advantage, began widening on the turn and maintained a big advantage in a dominating score. DANCE CODE broke
sluggishly, moved to contention inside and continued well. UNCLE DAR pursued the pacesetter to the stretch and faltered. PROFESSOR KOOL chased
very wide throughout and lacked a rally. YO NESSROUNDONKERN lacked speed then caught a pair of fading rivals. KINGDOM showed brief speed wide
then began fading on the turn. BUFF HELLO was hard used chasing the pacesetter and stopped abruptly. O'BRIEN saved ground off the leaders and gave
way readily.

Footnotes
SHERO led under pressure outside, shook loose on the turn then edged away through the stretch. EMIRATES AFFAIR dueled the winner then pursued on
the turn and just lasted for the place. BEACH DAZE lacked speed then finished with good energy in the stretch. BUCKS SOME saved ground off the leaders
and closed well. EUPHIMA (ARG) settled just behind the pacesetters, made a brief bid turn then faded. ET'S MOON MAIDEN raced wide off the leaders
and flattened out in the stretch. PEACHY WEACHY trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. GOLD MEDAL ANNA lacked speed outside and was never
in contention. SEA MAIDEN prompted the pace along the inside to the far turn and stopped. MADELINE'S GROGU was taken up in the opening quarter
then retreated.

Footnotes
VEESON far behind early, swung extremely wide in the stretch, surged through the lane and was up in time. PRINCE OF RAIN trailed in the opening
quarter, rallied very wide, led in the late stages but was nailed. ONE MORE SCOOP dropped back outside, bid very wide and closed strongly too late.
DOLLARIZATION moved close up along the inside, loomed a stretch threat but tired. STRAWBERRY TREAT jagged far behind then narrowed the gap
without menacing. BOURBON MUSIC set rapid fractions inside to midstretch and weakened. BEREN was urged just behind dueling pacesetters and
faltered. JEAN VALJEAN prompted the leader outside to the final furlong and faded. JOHN DUTTON underwent shoe repair in the paddock, dropped far
back and was never a factor. SMOOTH B raced off the leaders and weakened steadily. WORD ON A WING stalked the pace four wide, made a brief bid
into the far turn then gave way. FORE HARP forced the pace down the backstretch and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
SMARTEN UP lacked speed, advanced inside on the final turn then wore down the leader in the final yards. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE went after the
pacesetter on the final turn, bid clear then was nailed at the wire. DEPLANE broke slowest, advanced wide then flattened out late. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA
trailed briefly, moved very wide on the final turn with a mild bid. SCAMP WALKER saved ground, moved briefly closer on the final turn then yielded. NORTH
POLE urged within range outside then faded on the final turn. THREEPETE sprinted away to a long lead for half a mile, was collared at the quarter pole and
faltered. FINANCIAL STRENGTH saved ground in midpack and was never involved. BOOK MARKER was outrun throughout and faded steadily. IMPETUD
flashed speed for half a mile and stopped abruptly.
