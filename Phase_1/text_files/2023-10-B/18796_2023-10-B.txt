Footnotes
MENTORING while in hand took control on the inside at the half, opened up at will unchallenged through the turn, cruised home for the win drifting out when
throttled down in deep stretch, was pulled up galloping out and was vanned off. FOREST STAR travelled in mid-pack in the early stages, was roused
gaining momentum into the turn, was urged for more left handed nearing the quarter pole and gamely bested the rest to be a non threatening runner up in
the end. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS settled to be second last down the backside, put a mild run around horses three wide at the quarter marker, swung out
widest in the six path at the top of the lane and finished with intent in deep stretch to capture third in a three way photo. CANDY STREET trailed down the
back straight, began to get involved picking up runners on the rail at the quarter pole, angled out to the three path turning for home, showed good late
interest and just missed getting up for third at the wire. YORKVILLE stalked near the rear inside down the backstretch, advanced two wide at the three
furlong marker, shifted outside for the drive in the five path battling for a piece of the prize and had to settle on the fringes when outfinished in deep stretch
for the show money. SNOOKERED broke sharp on the break, settled outside runners stalking in midfield down the backside, could not quicken with others
around the bend, was shuffled back seeing the field turning for home and finished up mildly to be involved for the minor share in the end. TRIGGER'S BAY
had a brief lead in the early going, gave way to the winner inside to chase at the half, was urged for more to keep up with the winner through the turn and
retreated on the fence at the furlong marker. READY ON THE LINE had a good position down the backside all alone tracing the front duo, was asked for
more run midturn, offered little response inside and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FRAC DANCER took command from the onset, dictated the pace comfortably with mild pressure through the turn, opened up on challengers when coaxed
in upper stretch, was reminded of business with a couple of taps from the rider at the furlong pole and easily coasted home late for the victory. LAKEFIELD
was unhurried near the rear in the early going, saved ground running through the turn closing the gap on fellow rivals, shifted outside to the four path with
run and closed belatedly to be second best at the finish. VALYRIAN SKY tracked the frontrunning winner outside down the back straight, was roused three
furlongs out, took closer order to the leader at the quarter pole, chased, but to no avail in upper stretch and faded late losing the place share in the last
sixteenth. GUN COURT settled on the outside three deep down the backside in midfield, rallied two wide outside horses with five sixteenths remaining,
angled out to the five path for the drive and showed some good late energy to settle on the fringes at the wire. BUCK'S FIZZ travelled three from the back
with a half left to run, was scrubbed on three furlongs out, could not gain on others through the turn and had little to give running down the stretch. AZIEL
tracked the leader on the inside down the back straight, keep pace running on the fence around the turn , was in the mix of things on the rail turning for
home and weakened inside at the furlong pole. FOREST FLASH settled in mid-pack on the rail down the backside, was asked for more run midway on the
turn, offered little gain and yielded in upper stretch. GLORIOUS REVENGE trailed the field down the backstretch, lost contact with the pack running on the
turn and could not reach contention driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
UNCLE TRULY advanced on the rail getting a better forward position with five eighths remaining, was nudged three furlongs out keeping pace with rivals,
began to reel in runners in upper stretch, burst on by the leader on the fence at the furlong pole and was extending the advantage at the finish. SOUPER
ATTENTIVE was content to track the speed outside throughout the turn, bid for the lead outside at the top of the stretch, assumed command with three
sixteenths to go, could not match strides with the winner on the rail with an eighth to run and and finished up besting the rest easily for a clear second in the
end. NANTUCKETS DAY travelled the wide outside runners in mid-pack five furlongs from the line, was shuffled back some to be near the rear inside
running on the turn, began to pick up runners driving on the fence in upper stretch, shifted outside off the tiring early leader at the eighth pole and closed
belatedly to be an easy but non threatening third at the wire. SILENT AND VIOLENT settled in midfield three wide on the turn, was asked for more three
furlongs out but could not make up any ground on the leaders, continued to be hard ridden by his rider starting to gain on tiring foes in upper stretch and ran
on mildly in the late stages for a small piece on the prize at the finish. VITALITY broke with the field at the start, was void of early run to trail down the
backstretch, was allowed to find his stride unhurried seeing the pack around the turn, began to figure things out starting a rally shifting inwards at the
sixteenth pole and offered a good late finish reaching for ground at the wire. JO DADDY settled in the third flight all alone rating kindly watching the front
three with five eighths to go, comfortably tracked the leader running around the turn, pounced outside in the four path turning for home, battled for the lead
in upper stretch but levelled off in the final seventy yards losing a few positions at the wire. JOHNNY GOLD assumed command down the backside, set a
modest pace running on the turn while under no pressure, was engulfed outside at the top of the lane and backed away through the field at the furlong pole.
HARD DIAMOND was steadied in the three path between runners down the backside at the three quarters pole, made little progress running on the fence
throughout the turn, shifted outside under a ride at the top of the lane but could not offer a finishing kick and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
IT'S A FLUKE cleared early and shifted in, set the pace inside, spurted away in upper stretch and held safe. MIGHTY SEA settled off the pace racing inside,
saved ground on the turn, swung out five wide at the head of the stretch, was gaining too late. POSTURING exchanged a light bump at the start, steadied
on heels nearing the half-mile marker, bided time at the back near but off the inside, came out in upper stretch, kicked on to get up for show. SOCIETY'S
THUNDER moved forward between runners pursuing the pace three to four wide into and on the turn, was encouraged along three furlongs out, ran on
evenly and lost show honors late. COLONEL MUSTARD raced mid-pack near but off the inside, steadied at the eighth pole seeking room, ran on well
thereafter. SHAMATEUR exchanged light contact at the start, raced off the inside toward the rear, swung out six wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly.
PUDDINGONTHERITZ shifted in pursuing the leader and eventual winner from inside rivals but off the fence through the turn, encouraged along past the
three-eighths, faded in the stretch. WHERE IS ESSA swung seven wide into the stretch, was not a threat. DISSECTOLOGIST exchanged light bumps on
both sides at the start, chased from outside four to five wide on the turn, weakened. UNCAPTURED MOMENT broke a step slowly, switched out well off the
inside, swung seven wide into the stretch, failed to menace.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MASCOT tracked in the second flight between runners down the backside, started to edge closer inside at the quarter pole, bid for the lead in
the three path straightening out for the drive, shifted inwards gaining on the rail with a sixteenth to go and got the win with a late surge at the wire.
COMPETITIVE TOUCH took this field unchallenged down the backside, opened up mildly running around the turn, still had command in upper stretch,
began to get leg weary at the furlong marker but was fighting on stubbornly between but just was caught at the wire losing the nod in a photo. DRESDEN
ROW prompted two wide outside down the backstretch, chased the frontrunner on the turn taking closer order at the quarter pole, bid outside in the four
path at the top of the lane and determinedly kept on coming to the wire but unfortunately was on the losing end of a three way tight finish. SWIFT
DELIVERY hit the gate on the break, trailed in the beginning, began to lengthen stride picking up runners three furlongs from home, circled six wide with run
at the top of the stretch and finished strongly in the final furlong gaining on the leaders late. AMERICAN DECISION was pushed into the rail at the five
eighths pole, came under a ride midway on the turn but could not close the gap on the leaders, dueled for the minors inside down the lane but was just
outfinished for that placing late. BEYOND ADVERSITY was steadied between horses nearing the five furlong pole, regrouped to not lose any positioning at
the half, came under a ride with horses on each side with five sixteenths to run, could not gain any momentum through the turn and showed little running
inside down the stretch. TECH WIZARD stalked near the rear down the backstretch, could not keep up to runners through the turn and showed some
interest to pass tired rivals down the stretch. CATHOLIC JACKIE stalked close to the back of the pack outside in the early going, put a mild run three wide
with five sixteenths from the finish and could not offer a closing rally down the stretch. SNIPER JACK travelled in the second flight three wide on the outside
down the back straight, was roused trying to keep pace with quickening foes at the quarter marker, could not find more to give driving to the finish and gave
way in the five path in upper stretch. RCOF #2 BEYOND ADVERSITY AGAINST #3 MIDNIGHT MASCOT DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH IN THE VICINITY
OF THE FIVE EIGHTHS POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

SPIRIT ANIMAL saved ground racing inside through the turn, sought room past the five-sixteenths but stayed inside, came out about the three-sixteenths
with aim, ground on and just got up. BOSTON TEA PARTY switched outside the leader stalking just off that one, came into upper stretch three wide, took
the lead about a furlong out, led till late and was just nailed. BODE'S TIPSY broke a bit awkwardly tossing the head, settled outside at the rear, swung six
wide into upper stretch, gained show honors while drifting in a bit. THERE'S NO JOE broke alertly, moved clear, set the pace, raced near the rail through
the turn, weakened in the stretch. TOLD IT ALL settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, ran on. PERFECT SPEIGHTY settled mid-division saving
ground inside, came out three to four wide at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. LAST DAWN raced off the inside toward the rear, ran on
mildly passing foes. ARMSTRONG was up close stalking three wide, weakened. MAGLEV (IRE) pursued from outside going four wide on the turn,
weakened. COINAGE raced off the pace, came into upper stretch six wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TRIPOLINA tracked between rivals in the second flight three wide down the back straight, lost some momentum and positioning three eighths from the wire,
recovered quickly to pounce outside widest in the five path driving for the wire, was set down at the eighth pole under left handed urging and drew off
comfortably for a convincing win in deep stretch. TWO GHOSTS tracked in the second flight outside foes four deep down the backstretch, rallied four wide
three furlongs out getting a jump on the winner, making a bold move around horses at the quarter pole bid for the lead in the four path turning for home,
dueled with the winner until the furlong marker and gave way late to be second best on this day. WESTERN WHIRL prompted the pace three wide outside
rivals down the back straight, battled in the three path between horses for the lead two furlongs out, fought on gamely in the hunt up front at the top of the
stretch, faded from the top two finishers with a sixteenth to run inside and kept to the task at the line to win the bob for third money in the end. BREAK THE
SPELL was allowed to settle down the backside trailing the field, began to extend his stride midway on the turn, picked up runners outside at the quarter
pole and finished with good intent to close in late, just missing third money in a tight photo. MAGIC SLIPS contested for the lead on the rail down the
backstretch, maintained a slim advantage setting a brisk pace on the fence travelling on the turn, was collared outside straightening out for the drive, could
not find another gear in mid-stretch and faded at the furlong pole. GOTTS GOT IT broke in at the start, was in the mix between the leaders down the
backstretch, was roused for more, battling with rivals on either side five sixteenths from home, could not keep pace with others quickening pace at the
quarter pole and yielded behind horses in the three path in upper stretch. BANKINGONAMIRACLE was nestled on the fence watching the trio at the half,
lost inside position into the turn and was shuffled back three furlongs from the wire, tried to play catch up hustled on the fence running around the bend but
could not get involved running down the stretch. KING OF THE TRACK was bumped outside on the break, settled near the rear in a tightly compacted
bunch at the half, offered a mild run between runners in midturn when asked for run but could not more at the top of the lane and weakened on the fence in
mid-stretch.

A LITTLE FRISKY was in just a bit tight at the start, was keen to go on early but rated toward the back racing wide up the backstretch, shifted in advanced
between foes between two to four wide late on the turn, found room to split rivals near the furlong marker, took aim on the leader and rallied past late.
MYSTIC LAKE broke outwardly but alertly, set the pace facing outside pressure up the backstretch, moved clear on the turn and into the stretch, was
caught. WITWATERSRAND pressed from between runners early two to three wide, kept on but needed more. UPHILL DANCE raced outside foes five to six
wide on the turn, kicked on mildly. ZO LEE settled between runners off the pace, went four to five wide through the turn, needed more. BOLT ENOREE was
up close three to four wide pressing from outside early, had no extra. ROSA advanced inside late up the backstretch, was within range of the leaders
leaving the turn, weakened in the stretch. SHE'S FIRE dropped back two to three wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
PRIDEOFDISTINCTION stalked near the rear in the early stages, began to lengthen his stride reaching for more ground down the backstretch, closed the
gap smartly on the leaders with a half left to run, swung outside straightening out for the drive in the six path, closed in on the leaders in mid-stretch, took
control at the furlong marker and just held from his stablemate at the wire. MEYER travelled throughout tracked the leaders nestled on the rail in the second
flight, had to wait at the top of the stretch behind the weakening early leader at the top of the stretch, swung outside to the six path at the furlong marker,
found another gear late and surged at the wire but could not get there in time. RON'S GIZMO was situated just outside in the tracking second flight for most
of the race, angled outside to make his bid in the four path at the top of the lane, battled in upper stretch for the lead, drifted inwards driving to the finish in
the final eighth still in the hunt but faded in the final seventy yards to hold for third after the marathon. CANADIAN PHAROAH stalked outside the winner in
the fourth flight down the backstretch, could not keep pace with the winner starting to make a run with three quarters to go, shuffled back some with a half to
the wire, found more three furlongs out gaining on tiring foes and finished up one paced down the lane to garner a minor share in the end. LIL BIT
GANGSTA sat alone in the third flight down the backside, made an early move going five wide at the top of the stretch, took command at the three
sixteenths marker, could not sustain the run at the eighth pole and stalled between runners in deep stretch. CUPID'S CLAWS settled near the rear down the
back straight, made little headway on the final turn while and showed some late interest to close in willingly in the final furlong. SIR SAHIB trailed the field
throughout, swung outside in the seven path when with two furlongs from the wire, could not offer a finishing kick but did run on to pass the tiring early
leaders down the stretch. POINT TO THE STARS hounded the frontrunner outside down the backstretch to even at times get his head in front, could not
find more between rivals when others were picking up the pace with five sixteenths to run and stopped in upper stretch. LORD OF WAR set the pace inside
while hounded outside for the first mile and a quarter, began to edge away from the early pace foes with five sixteenths to go, was collared outside at the
quarter pole, offered no resistance in upper stretch on the fence, tired at the furlong marker and galloped across the finish.

Footnotes
LA BELLEZA NEGRA got away well, went straight to the front and sped clear, shifted in to dictate terms near the inside, had enough in reserve to spurt
away in upper stretch and hold sway. CITY MISCHIEF bumped a rival at the start, angled in and advanced inside up the backstretch to a more forward
position, came out five wide in upper stretch and a bit wider thereafter, finished strongly to gain the place. RAT PORTAGE was within range two to three
wide, kept on in the stretch but needed more late. SCOOT DADDY was caught five to six wide on the turn, swung out ten deep turning for home, was
gaining but too late. FOUR ACES HIGH was coaxed forward to track from inside foes racing just off the rail on the turn, moved out four wide turning for
home, lacked the needed late kick. NOT SO QUIET exchanged a light bump at the start, settled off the pace two to three wide, angled inside a rival at the
top of the stretch, showed good late interest. LIGHT THE LAMP raced mid-pack going five to six wide on the turn, came out eight to nine wide for the drive,
needed more late. RED LINE OVERDRIVE raced off the pace toward the rear four wide through the turn, ran on mildly to improve. SPITE STORE chased in
behind four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. WEALLLIKEDHIM stalked four to five wide through the turn, faded in the stretch. PRICELESS WILL
switched off the inside, moved out eight deep turning into upper stretch, shifted in for room in mid-stretch, ran on. MAAKWA was hard to load, bumped at
the start, raced at the back, swung eight wide turning for home, failed to menace. BOSSY HOLIDAY exchanged a light bump at the start, raced off the inside
about four deep through the turn, failed to menace. AIM FOR THE SKY stalked three to four wide, came up empty.
