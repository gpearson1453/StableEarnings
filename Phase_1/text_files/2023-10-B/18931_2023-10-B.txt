Footnotes
LADY BOO pressed the pace on the rail in the early going, assumed command by the half mile marker, set the fractions through the turn with only mild
pressure from behind, opened up in upper stretch and was kept to the task to hold on at the finish by a diminishing margin in the end. WORKING HOLIDAY
tracked the front two on the outside down the back straight, started to make a move between foes midturn, loomed the only threat at the top of the stretch,
was gaining late with every stride on the tiring winner but could not get there in time. ZODIAC BEACH stalked three deep down the backstretch, started to
rally with runners on each side midpoint on the turn in the three path, shifted out four wide turning for home and finished up willingly to just hold for third
money crossing the line. TEXENSIS hopped at the break to trail down the backside, was unhurried seeing the field around the turn, angled out to the four
path for the drive to the wire, drifted inwards when urged right handed driving to the finish down the stretch and just missed closing in for third on the fence
at the wire. LADIES RUM tracked in the second flight on the inside in the beginning, came under a ride on the fence trying to keep up with others running
around the bend and was one paced on the rail through the stretch. SOUL JOURNEY settled near the rear in the four path down the back straight, made
little impact running four wide around horses through the turn and was never a presence five wide outside rivals down the lane. FEATHERWEIGHT broke
alertly to have the lead, was relegated to chase the winner and the half, continued to be behind the winner applying only mild pressure throughout the turn
and retreated between foes at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN SOUND was bumped outside when the gate opened up, settled nicely alone in mid-pack on the rail at the half, was nudged to go after the front
trio midturn, loomed in the three path between horses at the top of the stretch, took command at the furlong pole and was going away convincingly when
crossing the finish line. MOET MONET had a good position on the outside watching the contesting duo at the half, crept closer to the front three wide on the
turn, pounced outside in the four path in upper stretch, was no match for the winner with an eighth to run but determinedly won the duel for place at the wire.
MY ASSISTANT was brushed at the start, had a slim lead when shadowed outside down the backstretch, stubbornly got her head in front running
throughout the turn, battled on the inside at the top of the lane, could not threaten the winner who had another gear at the eighth pole, fought on gamely to
the finish but just missed holding onto the place share nearing wire. FEW REGRETS was bumped inside on the start, stalked near the back of the field with
runners on either side down the backstretch, made a brief rally to separate from rivals at the back with five sixteenths from the line and showed some late
interest on the fence to settle on the fringes at the finish. MOMASCREST broke out on the break, stalked outside near the back down the backstretch,
showed little run seeing the field around the bend and could not reach contention running to the wire. TANGERINE TWIST broke inwards at the start,
prompted the pace outside down the back straight, dueled between runners midpoint on the turn, was roused for more at the quarter pole, could not keep up
with rivals on either side and weakened in the final furlong. GAMBLER'S POSE hopped on the break to trail down the backside, offered a brief run on the
fence at the half until midway on the turn and yielded on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHERIF ALI leapt up at the start, improved smartly on the rail while in hand down the backstretch, waited to pounce on the rail through the turn behind the
leaders, angled just outside for the drive, wore down the front runner in the final furlong and was extended his advantage with every stride at the finish.
FAST AND READY dictated the pace narrowly on the inside down the back straight, began to edge clear from the early speed rival with three furlongs to go,
opened up mildly at the top of the stretch but could not find more to fend off the stablemate in deep stretch. COUNTRY LIVING broke outwards to begin,
had a good spot watching the front duo engage in the early going, could not match strides with the winner but was making progress outside to other rivals
three furlongs out and ran with intent down the stretch to be a clear but non threatening third at the finish. SMART ALMASTY was pushed out on the break,
stalked near the rear outside of rivals, improved position when roused on the rail at the quarter pole and finished up down the stretch get a minor role but
could not pose a threat to the top three finishers at the wire. SPEEDY BULLEIT was off slow to begin, trailed the field down the backside, saved ground but
could not make any headway running through the turn and passed a straggler in the stretch run. SCREEN LEGEND dueled for the lead on the outside down
the backstretch, gave way fighting up front three furlongs to go, was hard ridden trying to keep position between foes midturn, lost ground to runners at the
quarter pole and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN GAMBLE settled off the pace, advanced inside a rival off the fence and guided out three wide late on the turn with aim on the leader, took over
at the three-sixteenths, drew away under urging. HIT AND RUN broke just a hair slowly, lacked early speed despite being ridden along, advanced about two
wide but inside foes in late stretch to secure the place. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER broke a step slowly and very lightly bumped at the start, advanced between
foes at the back in the early going then again moved between runners three to four wide past the quarter pole, ran on but needed more. AIRY FAIRY settled
outside at the back, advanced five wide on the turn, kept on but needed more. FRESH DREAMS chased four wide, dropped back and shifted in, came out
again in the stretch, was not a threat. SILENT GHOST broke outwardly lightly bumping a rival, was overtaken for the early lead by an inside rival, pursued
that one three deep, faded. BILLYJANE soon moved to the lead under some coaxing, set the pace inside a rival racing on or off the fence through the turn,
faltered and faded, was vanned off.

Footnotes
LOIS tracked from between runners in the second flight about three wide, shifted five wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch making a bid, took
the lead about the sixteenth and prevailed. VERY SAVVY was well-placed tracking from inside, saved ground early on the turn, came out four wide turning
for home, sought room in upper stretch and soon found it between runners after altering in a path, was put to stout urging to rally between foes at that
juncture, ran on to get up for place but was only second best. SONET'S NAME pressed the pace from early on, was mostly two to three wide outside the
early leader, bumped with that one about the half, took the lead by the five-sixteenths, was clear in upper stretch but outfinished. CLIFF'S HEAD hopped at
the break, advanced between foes from at the back about three wide, moved out six wide leaving the turn, ran on. ABSOLUTE JEWEL settled off the pace
inside, waited briefly about the three-eighths, continued saving ground through the turn cutting the corner and advancing but ran on evenly in the stretch.
CHROME'S ANGEL shifted in, steadied on heels about the quarter and was under a hold till the top of the stretch, ran up again into horses and altered out
at the furlong marker, ran on. EYE GOT IT GOOD broke on top but was soon outsprinted, settling in stalking the leading pair from outside four wide, drifted
in then out a bit in upper stretch, flattened out. NORTHERN RUBY chased from between runners in the second flight going four to five wide on the turn,
came out six to seven deep for the drive, failed to rally. GORMLEY GIRL chased from outside foes in the second flight five to six wide, came out ten wide in
the stretch, faded. WAKE UP MAGGIE chased from between runners four wide mid-pack early, dropped back to the rear racing four to six wide on the turn,
came out twelve wide in upper stretch, failed to threaten. MERITAMEN moved quickly to the lead, set the pace inside a rival on or off the rail, exchanged a
light bump at the half, was overtaken midway on the turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
MAKAYLA stalked in the fourth flight outside of trouble with a half mile to run, advanced between runners entering the far bend, closed the gap through the
turn, was patiently handled weaving through horses at the quarter pole, briefly waited behind rivals at the top of the stretch, angled to the rail for running
room at the eighth pole and burst up the fence late to nab the leader in the shadow of the wire. FOREVER DANISH rated kindly on the inside tracking the
frontrunner down the back straight, was nestled on the rail waiting for the que to go at the three eighths marker, slipped through on the fence in upper
stretch to lead at the furlong pole, did not switch leads to the finish and was caught by the winner nearing the wire in a solid performance. HIGH TREASON
had a tardy start to trail in the early stages, caught up to the field by the half, started to rally three wide around runners at the quarter pole, swung out with
momentum in the six path outside horses turning for home and closed strongly to the wire putting in a good late run to capture third. SMOKEN CHLOE
tracked the leader outside in the third flight down the backstretch, roused in the two path outside of a rival midway on the far turn to take closer order four
wide driving to the wire and was kept to the task through the stretch to offer a mild finish holding for a small piece of the prize. BAREFOOT SERVANTU
travelled near the rear outside foes on the first turn, progressed along the backside outside runners, rallied three wide three eighths remaining, posed a
threat in the five path in upper stretch and stalled with a furlong to run. TAKE CHANCES stalked in the two path close to the back in the early stages, was
asked to quicken between rivals three furlongs from the wire, shifted four wide at the top of the lane and showed good late energy between horses from the
sixteenth pole to the finish line. LOOK AT LIL SISTER tracked the pacesetter on the outside down the backstretch, began to inch closer to the leader at the
quarter pole, had a brief lead in the three path straightening out for the drive, could not find more down the lane and tired with a sixteenth left to run. SPIRIT
O'TIPPERARY stalked near the rear at the beginning, improved on the rail through the first turn, was nudged to go inside three eighths from home, could
not gain on runners through the final turn and was not a factor driving to the finish. SMILES FOR DAVID settled on the inside in the third flight, was ridden
for more making little headway on the fence three furlongs from the prize and yielded on the rail in mid-stretch. SEATTLE SIGNAL was hustled to the lead
taking this field into the first turn, travelled up front unchallenged along the backside, under a drive was headed outside while clinging to the lead at the
quarter pole, engulfed by runners on each side turning for home and faltered in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BRIDGE TO NOWHERE travelled in mid-pack along the back straight, cruised around runners in hand three wide two furlongs from the prize, swung out
looming the threat in the six path straightening out for the drive and wore down the leader nearing the wire in a well timed stretch rally. T'PRING was content
to sit behind the frontrunner down the backside, started to reel in the pacesetter midpoint on the turn, took command at the top of the stretch, opened up
mildly with an eighth to run but could not hold off the winner and gave way grudgingly just before the wire. SHEZ A SEALY had one beat running down the
backstretch, began to circle foes three wide at the quarter pole, swung out to the seven path full of run turning for home and closed belatedly to be a distant
third at the finish line. JIMMY IS A BREEZE was forced out on the start, stalked near the back on the inside, began to extend ones stride picking up runners
three wide at the quarter pole, found clear running room in the six path with rivals on each side at the furlong pole and outkicked the inside challengers late
for a minor share in the end. GENTLE SEAS broke out on the break, tracked the front pair down the backside, kept pace with the leaders on the fence
through the turn, was in with a chance for a share on the rail at the top of the lane but was outfinished in deep stretch. TATOOSONMYSOUL was brushed
outside to begin, settled in midfield between runners down the back straight, started a run three wide three furlongs out, posed a threat in the five path
turning for home but could not sustain the rally and levelled off in the last eighth. DADDY'S LEGACY stalked on the rail near the rear, advanced on the
fence getting better position at the half, was hard ridden in midturn keeping pace, angled out from behind runners in the five path in upper stretch, lost her
path at the furlong marker and offered little finish afterwards. SWEET BOMBOLINI rated in the second flight between foes early on, offered a brief turn of
foot four wide at the quarter marker, was floated out to the eight path turning for home and lacked a bid through the stretch run. CLASSICALCROSSOVER
was brushed inside on the break, regrouped quickly to press the issue early on, took control on the rail five furlongs from the line, continued up front running
around the bend, was collared outside in upper stretch and backed through the field on the fence in the last sixteenth. HARD ROCK WARRIOR was
bumped at the start, trailing by many down the backstretch, could not recover throughout the turn and was not a factor running to the finish line. MISS MOE
had a good position travelling outside watching the duo engage down the backstretch, was scrubbed on in midturn, offered a brief run to be in the mix four
wide at the top of the stretch, could not find more driving to the wire and stopped with a furlong remaining.

Footnotes
MISS BIKINI was part of the group in the two path up front in the early going, was reined back to be tucked in on the rail three furlongs from home, waiting to
make a move, shifted just outside to pounce to the lead at the top of the lane, dueled with the frontrunner until the eighth pole and cleared away for the win
in deep stretch. GOLD FORESTER travelled in the two path in the second flight keeping close tabs on the four up front, was coaxed on the rail for more at
the three eighths pole, started to creep closer to the leaders, shifted out to the three path for the drive to the finish, angled back inside on the rail at the
furlong marker and put in a solid late run to best the rest in a good try down the lane. LOADED SECRET had a narrow advantage inside down the back
straight, was shadowed on the outside setting the fractions on the turn, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, battled gamely until inside the furlong
marker and faded late nearing the wire but held for show in a three horse photo in the end. INFINITE PASSION was away poorly to begin, co-trailed on the
inside in the early going, started to close the gap on the leaders commencing a run three wide at the quarter pole, lacked clear running room throughout the
entire stretch and finally found a seam inside off the fading early leader nearing the wire and surged late to just miss getting up for third in the end. GOLDEN
TRAIN forced the pace in the three path as part of the four early foes fighting for the lead in the beginning, was in tight with rivals on each side entering the
turn, throttled down some losing a little position on the turn, rallied to loom in the four path turning for home, never gave in and tenaciously fought to the wire
but was on the losing end of the three way photo for show. ITS A BIRDIE watched the quartet while four deep in the tracking group down the backside, was
roused but made little advance four wide running around the bend, shifted out to be in the seven path for the drive to the wire and ran on willingly, gaining on
rivals in deep stretch. WAR'S END KISS travelled three wide on the outside having one rival beat running around the turn, angled out to be five wide for the
drive and showed some late interest to pass a few tiring foes rallying inside in the final furlong. MURDER HORNET settled in the three path with rivals on
either side tracking the front foursome early, was nudged for more trying to maintain position on the turn, angled to the six path to be in range if good
enough for the stretch run, drifted inwards under right handed encouragement at the furlong marker and evened out in the late stages.
BITTERSWEETBIZNESS trailed four deep outside down the backstretch, angled to the rail saving ground running on the fence through the turn, could see
the field in the three path turning for home, shifted out sharply inside the eighth pole off tiring runners and could no be a factor in the late stages. LULU'S
LULLABY was off a step slow leaving the gate, was rushed up for better position down the backside and steadily faded on the rail running inside throughout
the turn. FOREST CHOICE prompted four deep down the backstretch, chased the leader four wide through the turn and gave way between runners when
they straightened out for the stretch drive. MAMMA KATZ broke with the field but was soon shuffled to near the rear down the backside, rallied four wide
around runners making a bold move three furlongs from home, was fanned out to be widest in the eight path at the top of the stretch, checked mildly inside
the furlong pole and was not a presence in deep stretch.
