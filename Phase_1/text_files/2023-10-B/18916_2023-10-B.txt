Footnotes
ELIA sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway without challenged and held command through the lane. LADY YELLEN hopped at the start,
moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then was no threat to the winner, while clearly best of the rest. MISS GETTY UP mid
pack, moved up inside through the turn angling around a tiring rival, came three wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. AMAZON LIZZIE well
placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, weakened and held a share. DANCE OR STROLL mid
pack, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and improved position. STRAIGHT MADNESS unhurried, moved up two and three
wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had no rally. WINDY CITY GIRL was never involved, widest. LIGHT HEARTED tracked the pace
rating, faded through the turn.

CANTSTEALMYTHUNDER well placed and off the rail, angled in and saved ground through the turns, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. MY ROMEO LIMA led in the early going, stalked the pace outside, held
position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then edged up for the place in the final strides. SHY DA RUNNER
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. NIGHT RIDE passed tiring
rivals, for share. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO unhurried, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had no rally.

Footnotes
SHAKEN AND SHIMMY broke a step slowly from the gate and was allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five
wide into the stretch, edged ahead and lasted. YARDMAN tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then closed fast late and missed. SECRETARY OF WAR unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. INAPPROPRIATE mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and got up for a share. TEPPER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and improved position. UP FOR THE CHANCE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, then faded late. REMEMBER NORMANDY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three
wide outside the leader into the stretch and weakened. LYING JEFF mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the
stretch. UPPITY UP unhurried, moved up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path and had no stretch rally. RAPA NUI never far back, faded on
the two path through the second turn.
