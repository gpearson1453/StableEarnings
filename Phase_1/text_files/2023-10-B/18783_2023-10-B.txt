Footnotes
MAGICAL WAYS was hustled from the gate, attended the pace on the inside of a foe, vied near the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path,
extended the advantage while shaken up in upper stretch, drew off while kept to the task under a hand-ride until inside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up
while much the best. UNION LIGHTS settled off the pace, angled in near the three-quarter pole, drafted behind the leader while inside on the turn, was
given his cue at the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch and was second best. CHEEKY TICO stalked the pace on the inside of a rival, was
asked in the three path on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and tired. CHARGER attended the pace on the outside, dropped back in the two
path while between foes on the turn and came up empty. PRINCE OF JOY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn, dropped back
five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
IRISH GENT (IRE) stumbled at the start, moved in while going to the front, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when roused into the
stretch and held under strong urging. TYPHOON FURY was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then four on the turn, pursued the winner
under a drive in the stretch and willingly earned the place. FIRST TRUMPET lost his footing at the start then bumped with a foe, was well placed just off the
pace, moved out outside the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the turn and tired. PET MAT broke out and bumped with a rival, settled off the pace, saved
ground while roused on the turn and lacked the needed response. STREET EARNINGS angled out early, was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the
five path on the turn and came up empty. WON TEAM was bumped at the start, angled out early, raced at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and
was no factor. BOURBON OUTLAW bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to
respond. WON TEAM RACED FOR PURSE-MONEY ONLY

Footnotes
STRONG LIGHT was last into stride, settled at the rear, moved in outside the half-mile pole, shifted from the rail to the three path while roused on the turn,
moved out while rallying in the final furlong, closed well to make a bid between late and got up under strong urging. GOOD RAPPORT showed the way with
a clear advantage while well off the rail, went around the turn in the four path, came under the crop in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth
but was caught while just able to hold the place. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE broke out and brushed with a foe, moved out early, settled under some urging,
shifted from the two path to the four path while dropping farther off the pace on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong,
drifted in while closing near the sixteenth-pole, made a bid in the final sixteenth and just missed the place. PROVEN HOPE tracked the pace on the outside,
was urged along in the five path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. LEGENDARY LORE brushed with a rival
at the start, leapt in the air approaching the seven-eighths pole, was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty.
UNCLE WATER FLOW was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and tired. SCOTTO settled off the pace, was urged along passing the
nine-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BAD LARRY broke out then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, responded well
in the final furlong and held under steady urging. WOODSIDE WARRIOR was urged along just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two
path at the quarter-pole, angled out in upper stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and willingly earned the place. WAR PRINCE was urged along off the
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. WATCH HILL
dropped well behind, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten then missed the show. MAJESTIC ARC bumped very
hard with a foe at the start, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn and tired. CHALKY CAT bumped very hard with
a foe at the start then was taken up with a snatch of the left-rein, settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the turn and was no factor. MALIBU
MYSTERY was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT ARROW was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path for most of the turn, shifted three then four wide while full of run late on that
bend, rallied to the lead in upper stretch and powered away under steady urging. SHADOW DRAGON prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three
path on the turn and earned the place while no match for the winner. CALLALOO went to the front, showed the way with company to his outside, vied inside
for most of the turn then moved to two path, lost the advantage into upper stretch and weakened then lost the place but was clear for the show. CUT THE
CORD moved out then settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty. BIG BOBBY broke a step
slow, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. LET'S GO BIG BLUE
settled near the back, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GENERAL BANKER was urged along at the rear, moved out while dropping further back outside the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn, rallied
outside in upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to the finish and prevailed. MY LAST MISSION
showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought on well in the final
furlong but missed while clear for the place. G MUNNING was well placed just off the pace, tossed his head under restraint leaving the backstretch, raced
inside to the two path on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, came three wide into the stretch, moved out around the furlong marker and was
along for the show. DR. SETTLE'S DREAM chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead in
upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was headed by the winner and weakened. NEWPORT BRIDGE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two
path on the turn and tired. TEN CENT TOWN stumbled badly at the start and unseated the rider.

Footnotes
CHARISSE stumbled at the start, settled at the rear, moved closer outside the half-mile pole, rallied in the four path on the turn, closed quickly to get the
lead passing the five-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. PUREST PERFORMANCE disputed the pace on the outside, moved clear near the
nine-sixteenths, raced in the two path on the turn, was collared by the winner passing the five-sixteenths and proved no match while well clear for the place.
DEBBIE DARLING was hustled from the gate,. moved in while settling off the pace, was shuffled back some behind BENEVOLENTLY as that foe dropped
back late on the backstretch, started the turn in the two path, angled five wide at the five-eighths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MY
ROYAL VOW settled on the outside, was urged between foes passing the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty.
SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES settled off the pace, was urged between foes late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and capitulated.
BENEVOLENTLY disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, fell further back late on the backstretch and stopped
then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
