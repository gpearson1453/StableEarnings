Footnotes
EL CHUMELITO ran off pace from the leader then coming three wide around the turn took advantage of being on the outside and took off with a late drive to
catch and pass the leader by the wire. ELDORADO DREAM started in the middle of the pack then quickly took the lead with a comfortable length between
the other foes, continued to hold the distance between the foes until the last fifty yards where they got caught. FLAT FAST started off in the back of the pack
then slowly made some ground in the turn but still in the back, and coming on to the stretch that made a strong rally to over take foes coming from the back
to make the show position by the wire. OUR VALLEY ran in the middle of the pack had a slight gain on the turn then evened out on the stretch. HIT A NOTE
ran in the front of the pack early but shuffled back then evened out after the turn. ZENFULLY ZESTY ran with an even pace throughout the race moving
around tired foes on the stretch. EMPEROR'S CHOICE ran in the front of the pack then coming in to the turn started to fall back but by the end of the turn
they faded back thru the stretch. PHANTOMOFTHEOPERE blew from the gate then quickly fell back to last, they trailed until the sixteenth pole where they
finally passed a tired foe. PRINCESS JAYLEEN ran at the front of the pack but started slowing before the turn, just ran out of gas coming down the stretch.
THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

LETTHERAINSETTLEIT started in the middle of the pack then stayed there until about the half pole where they started to make a run at the leaders passing
a couple foes by time the turn ended and mid stretch they took the lead and won by a length and three quarters. I'M NOBLE started in the middle of the
pack but with the speed down the back stretch made up ground and started pressing the pace which wore down the foe on the turn being two wide
continued the good speed down the stretch but unfortunately hung slightly mid stretch. BARNFIELD ran at the back of the pack for almost the entire race
then had a strong rally at the end of the turn and start of the home stretch where they took off and paved a way for another trailing foe. RYDERS UP trailed
for most of the race then had a second wind in middle of the stretch where they over took four foes by the wire. PINEY BLUFF started off at the front of the
pack then started to slow before the end of the first turn, they eventually maintained an even pace throughout the rest of the race after the half pole.
ABETEMARCO started off at the front of the pack then hung slightly at the half pole but evened out by time they reached the stretch. ALL YOUR JAZZ set
the early pace, then kept up the pace but started to fade in the middle of the second turn where they fell back as they came down the stretch. BLUE LUNA
WHO was first out of the gate but throughout the race they slowly dropped back then eventually last about seventy five yards from the wire. THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.
