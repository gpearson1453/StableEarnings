Footnotes
STORMIN DAVE broke out bumping rival on the start, assumed the lead under a snug on the fence in the first turn, continued up front setting a moderate
pace leading by a narrow margin, bunching up the field at the half, was coaxed for a little more keeping his head in front through the final turn, opened up
when asked at the top of the lane and won comfortably while drifting out in deep stretch on the wrong lead. LESLIE CHOW brushed the gate on the start,
pulled the rider between horses improving position down the backside, hounded the pace three deep at the half, dueled for the lead outside throughout the
far turn, could not keep up to the winner turning for home and crossed the line besting the rest easily for second place. ANSELMO tracked the front trio four
deep outside in a stacked up field at the half, started to make a move four wide around runners three furlongs out, could not find another gear to threaten
the first two in upper stretch but did fight on to the wire, winning the battle for show at the finish. MIDWAY MISCHIEF was reined back when in tight soon
after the break to trail inside early on, kept a close eye on the contesting threesome at the half running between horses in the two path, was roused three
wide on the turn making little impact and fought determinedly down the stretch on the fence settling for a minor role but just missed in the end for third
money. BET N WIN tracked the front pair just outside on the first turn, watched the trio engage up front at the half between runners in the three path, rallied
three wide putting in a mild run at the three furlong marker until the quarter pole and faded between in the final eighth of a mile. DREAMS AND SCHEMES
prompted the pace between down the back straight, could not maintain forward position into the turn, was checked mildly three eighths from the wire and
could not regroup down the stretch to be involved at the finish. SIR SAMUEL was bumped inside on the break, tucked inside on the rail watching the front
duo through the first turn, shuffled back on the fence to trail at the half but still quite in range, was urged on the rail three furlongs out, made little headway
around the far turn and was not a factor running down the lane inside.

Footnotes
JULIE'S MIST fought restraint keenly moving forward pressing the pace into the first turn, managed to settle at that point racing off the leader stalking two to
three deep, advanced to take the lead three furlongs out, drifted out a bit leaving the far turn in the clear, held sway while being kept to the task. ELLA
FRANCES stalked from between runners early racing mostly two to three wide, moved to just off the flank of the eventual winner leaving the far turn, was no
match but clearly second best. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY raced between foes at the back into the first turn, angled out five wide later on that bend to avoid a
retreating foe, moved back nearer inside racing four to five wide on the far turn, kept on and just got show honors. INDIANA ROAD broke very awkwardly,
settled inside at the back, came off the fence on the first turn, advanced two to three wide leaving the backstretch racing mid-pack into the far turn, bided
time before coming out near the furlong grounds, kicked on but missed third. BRIEF was caught outside foes four to five wide early, made a swift advance
up the backstretch within range of the leaders, went four deep on the far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY settled between foes
three then four wide through the first turn, raced toward the rear into the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, showed mild late interest. QUEEN OF THE
COURT dropped back three wide between runners late on the first turn and early up the backstretch, brought up the rear into the far turn racing off the rail,
was one-paced. I'M SNOW ANGEL was a bit hard to control in the early going racing forwardly and outside rivals four wide, continued the pursuit three wide
but dropping back on the far turn and continued to weaken in the stretch. MISS MOE moved quick to the lead, set the pace racing inside, gave way.
DEFAMATION was rank early fighting the rider, saved ground inside, tired.

Footnotes
ONELLA emerged with the clear lead at the five eighths marker inside, dictated the pace under mild pressure running on the turn, was nudged to go on at
the quarter pole, then was asked right handed at the furlong marker, quickly responded opening up and held safe while keeping busy to the wire. WHY EM
SEA AY tracked the quartet in the second flight between in the beginning, was shuffled back some in a compact field at the half, rallied three wide around
foes at the five sixteenths marker, swung out to the five path for the drive, surged late outside to take the place share while gaining steadily on the winner
also in the end. BRAQUET was three deep in the second flight watching the foursome early on, made an early move getting better position three wide
outside keeping tabs on the contesting duo on the turn, was asked left handed for more run at the quarter pole to be in the hunt four wide straightening out
for home and stubbornly fought between foes late to be a solid third at the finish. SHAKSHUKA was off a step slow to begin, began to lengthen stride on the
fence down the back straight, had to be throttled down when the field bunched up at the half inside, waited patiently on the rail through the turn, found a
seam in the two path at the top of the lane and out in a good late finish to close in for a minor role in the end. RED SAMURAI prompted outside four deep in
the early going, hounded the frontrunner outside running around the bend, was in the hunt in the three path turning for home, chased the winner in vain until
the seventy yard marker and tired nearing the wire losing positions late. MAJESTIC APPEAL pressed the issue in the two path down the backside, was
coaxed to maintain position at the half, could not quicken on the fence with others in midturn and faded in the final sixteenth. VRANA (IRE) settled in
mid-pack inside down the backstretch, checked briefly when in tight at the half mile marker, could see the field running through the turn and was never
involved driving to the finish line. AMONG THE ROSES dueled three wide between rivals for the lead in the early going, came under a ride with horses on
each side tracking the front pair, three furlongs from the line, could not keep pace by the quarter pole and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SOCIETY'S KAT shifted in, was well-placed stalking three wide into the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, moved clear and held sway. BIJOU BABY settled
mid-pack racing four wide on the turn and put to urging by the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but held the place. NOW IS A BREEZE broke just a
bit awkwardly, raced at the back inside, tapped on the brakes racing up on heels near the seven-sixteenths, came out in upper stretch, ran on well but too
late. GREAT KATE broke just a half-step slowly, raced outside off the pace five wide on the turn coming out six deep for upper stretch, needed more late.
FRIENDS FOR LIFE moved to the lead, was getting out badly up the backstretch moving out about seven or eight paths up the backstretch, managed to
come back in a bit still leading things into the turn but racing wide, given encouragement past the five-sixteenths but continued getting back out, ended up
near the outer rail by late stretch while lacking the needed late kick. BEDAZZLE ME raced off the rail in the back half of the field, moved out from two to
three wide on the turn coming out just a hair more at the top of the stretch and gaining on the leaders, came in a bit in the stretch and evened out thereafter.
PROUD SPEAKER eased back off the drifting pacesetter and angled in, saved ground on the turn taking a narrow brief lead past the quarter pole, was
empty for the stretch run racing just off the rail. BE LIKE LEIGH raced between foes three wide into the turn, was encouraged along while being guided out
five deep later on that bend, failed to rally. SARAH'S DANCER was forwardly-placed inside, taken under a tight hold a furlong from home in behind tiring
runners. ROCKET RILEY moved nearer the inside but off the rail, was not a factor.

ZANA made a good move getting to the rail from the outside post to track the front two into the turn, was roused to go on, gaining mildly with five sixteenths
to go, never gave in through the stretch between runners, wore down the fading pacesetter nearing the wire and had enough in reserve to hold off the late
closer in the end as well. BORN TO BOOGIE brushed the gate to begin, trailed down the back straight, improved on the fence with three eighths to run,
shifted out gaining momentum three wide at the quarter pole, was full of run down the stretch outside but just could not reel in the winner at the line. BOSSY
DIVA broke alertly leading down the backstretch, continued unchallenged up front around the bend, began to get leg weary on the wrong lead in deep
stretch and tired late being caught near the wire just losing out on the place share at the finish in a photo. SOUPER SUNDAY chased the pace down the
backstretch and throughout the turn, was in the hunt three wide straightening out for the drive, could not find more late and faded between horses in the final
sixteenth to settle on the fringes in the end. FRENCH KISSING was situated on the rail in the middle of the pack in the early stages, kept pace running on
the rail but could not make any advance through the turn and was one paced inside down the stretch making little impact to the wire. ADMISSIBLE stalked
near the rear outside in the four path in the beginning, saved ground on the fence trailing through the turn and showed some interest on the rail passing a
couple of tiring foes down the lane. I'M INTO MISCHIEF travelled three deep on the outside in midfield down the backstretch, offered a mild run around the
outside of runners three furlongs out, could not sustain the run at the top of the lane and retreated between rivals in mid-stretch. JUST ON TIME settled in
mid-pack in the two path between foes down the back straight, could not reach contention three wide on the turn and had little to show in the drive to the
wire.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL CREEK settled off the pace mid-pack outside, swept four to five wide leaving the turn taking the lead about the furlong marker, inched away
under urging while drifting in a bit. SAUCY NAME moved clear, set the pace inside, was challenged in mid-stretch by the winner, was no match but held the
place. DIXIE TIMBER broke a half-step slowly and a bit awkwardly, shifted in and moved forward near but off the rail, improved position. FEDOROVA was
forwardly-placed tracking in behind the leader inside the second group but off the fence, moved out three to four wide leaving the turn within range of the
lead, ran on evenly. SPEED INTHE FOREST switched off the inside up the backstretch, moved out from the two to the four path on the turn coming five
wide to the top of the stretch, ran on but needed more. ECHO SEVEN raced outside off the pace going five to six wide on the turn, needed more. SPEED
LOADER broke a step slowly, came out for the drive, was never a threat. HOME FOR A REST broke rather awkwardly spotting the field numerous lengths,
lacked early speed, came out for the stretch, failed to threaten. PORSHAS RUN was forwardly-placed three wide between runners into the turn, came up
empty. I'M TENACIOUS chased from outside four wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
JILL had a good position nestled on the rail behind the frontrunners, liked what she saw sitting on the fence watching the contesting duo on the turn,
pounced shifting outside in the three path straightening out for the drive, wore down the game pacesetter at the sixteenth pole and was drawing away when
crossing the finish. INDIAN MUSIC cleared to the lead, getting to the rail quickly setting the pace, maintained a slim advantage while hounded outside
running around the bend, put away the early challenger at the quarter pole, braced for the winner at the top of the stretch, fought on stubbornly to the
sixteenth pole, yielded to the winner late but held on for second at the wire in a photo. WEEHAWKEN was allowed to settle near the rear three wide
between foes down the backside, started a run three wide around runners at the three furlong marker, found her best stride late and closed strongly to just
miss getting the runners up share at the wire. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) stalked alone in the third flight at the half, made a good move closing in on the
leaders three wide midway on the turn, loomed five wide driving to the wire and ran on evenly between horses in deep stretch for a minor role in the end.
VEERY tracked three wide with runners on either side down the back straight, was urged right handed trying to quicken with others midturn, offered little run
and lacked a closing rally to the wire not posing a threat in the late stages. SOUPER PECAN was steadied soon after the start, trailed in the beginning,
stalked near the rear down the backside, made little progress two wide through the turn and finished up willingly while running on the wrong lead down the
stretch. ATTABE settled on the rail close to the back of the pack in the early going, advanced mildly on the fence running through the turn, was in with a
chance for a small share turning for home inside but levelled off with a furlong to go. CARA CARA chased the pace in the two path down the back straight,
contested outside for the lead running on the turn, was asked for more at the quarter pole trying to keep pace with the leader, had little to give and retreated
between horses at the furlong marker. COLLECT DATTT stalked near the rear in the four path outside rivals down the backstretch, was scrubbed on four
wide into the turn, appeared to be getting out losing ground to runners around the bend and was not a factor running to the wire. SUPER SICILY travelled
four deep watching the frontrunner down the backside, roused three wide tracking the top pair three furlongs out, could not keep up through the turn and
emptied out at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
MY BOY PRINCE broke inwardly a bit then over-corrected outward, was quick to the lead, soon moved clear dictating terms with daylight back to pursuers
racing on or just off the rail, was unasked till the three-sixteenths, niggled along at that point, responded to extend the advantage with just mild
encouragement while much the best. ARASHI switched outside the aforementioned to stalk that one three wide, was no match but second best. KING
ROSSO was coaxed briefly from the break then allowed to settle off the leading pair on or just off the rail throughout, ran on evenly. ENGLISH JUBILEE was
forced out a bit at the start, angled in, saved ground inside through the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, ran on. WAR PAINTER got away well, settled in
to stalk from off the pace, went four wide on the turn advancing rapidly to within range coming past the three-eighths but evened out thereafter. ZIPPY
GIZMO raced off the pace outside four wide, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, showed late interest. AWESOME ENTRY broke just a half-step
slowly, raced at the back off the inside going in the two to three path through the turn, passed tired rivals. PONTIAC was forced out just a bit at the start,
raced between foes three wide and off the pace into the turn, encouraged along past the five-sixteenths, came out five wide turning for home, lacked the
needed late kick. BEARING DOWN raced outside mostly four to six wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
MILLIE GIRL broke in at the start, settled between runners near the rear down the backside, started to commence her run two wide between foes three
furlongs from home, weaved her way through horses at the quarter pole, was in range of the dueling leaders in the four path turning for home and burst past
runners in deep stretch closing strongly at the wire to just get up for the stretch rally. ANGELOU took control inside from the start, set a modest pace while
hounded outside down the backstretch, continued stubbornly up front setting the fractions on the final turn, repelled the first challenger outside in upper
stretch, found more when asked right handed in mid-stretch to keep the inside rival at bay but gave way to a strong closing winner near the wire in an extra
game front running performance. IL MALOCCHIO was brushed outside to begin, tucked in nicely on the rail behind the front duo on the first turn, rated
kindly down the backstretch nestled behind the leaders, took closer order on the fence around the final bend, loomed on the rail at the top of the lane, was
battling inside, inching closer coming to the wire but needed more late to pose a threat. MOUFFY was brushed inside at the start, was under a snug hold in
the two path behind the front pair in the first turn, tracked the top two running between horses down the backstretch, rallied three wide at the quarter posing
a threat by the time they hit the lane, was repelled by the frontrunner in upper stretch, continued to stubbornly finish up to the wire but settled for a minor role
when crossing the line. EPHRATA (GB) stalked near the rear inside on the first turn, settled in a rhythm in mid-pack inside down the backstretch, coaxed for
run on the rail three eighth from the line, shifted outside four wide for the stretch drive and ran on mildly to the finish line. SARATOGA VISION was pushed
in on the break, co-trailed on the outside down the back straight, made little headway on the far turn and ran on willingly passing runners down the stretch.
DEVIL'S BIT tracked outside four wide in the beginning, settled four deep in midfield down the backside, was roused three wide three furlongs to go putting
in a brief run outside runners, had a chance for a small share in the five path at the top of the lane, could not sustain the run and was one paced to the wire.
WHIMSICAL DANCE was checked mildly at the start, co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, kept pace with rivals while saving ground on the fence
in the final turn but could not offer a finish on the rail driving to the line. SOUPER HOITY TOITY tracked the front pair three wide into the first turn, continued
to have a good position outside watching the front two down the backside, was asked for to go three wide outside runners three eighths from home, could
not find more on the far turn and yielded between foes at the quarter pole. TAMARAMA (GB) pressed the pace outside on the first turn, was content to sit
just outside the pacesetter down the backstretch, was hard ridden between horses but could not match strides with foes starting a run in midturn and backed
through the field at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SPUN GLASS was outpaced in the early going racing last but one, angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, encouraged along by
the top of the stretch while guided out, split rivals four deep coming past the sixteenth pole taking the lead and holding sway. AWESOME TREAT broke just
a tad awkwardly but was none the worse, settled off the pace two to three wide into the turn, moved out five wide coming into upper stretch and loomed a
threat, was outkicked by the winner but secured the place. LOYALTY pressed then prompted the pace from outside two to three wide, took the lead about
the five-sixteenths, moved clear into upper stretch, was otukicked. HAZELBROOK pursued from between runners on the second flight moving out from
three to four wide past the quarter pole, loomed a threat in upper stretch but could only run on evenly late. SOUPER MUNNINGS broke a step slowly,
lacked early speed bringing up the rear along the inside, came out for the stretch run, kicked on well but too late. READY TO VENTURE (GB) was
outsprinted in a scramble for the early lead then content to track in behind racing inside foes but just off the rail, kept on evenly in the stretch. OUR FLASH
DRIVE was well-placed stalking a lively pace four to five wide, moved out six to seven deep for the stretch run, lacked the needed late kick. ARTIE'S
PRINCESS raced outside off the pace five to six wide on the turn, swung out a bit further for the drive, failed to rally. HARD EDGE was stoutly urged from
the start, set a pressured pace inside, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRIZZEL TRAZZEL was bumped on the break, was patiently allowed to find her stride trailing down the back straight, began to mount a rally three wide
picking up runners midway on the turn, swung out in the seven path full of run turning for home, took command at the sixteenth pole and was drawing away
smartly when crossing the finish. HOT OMELET stalked near the rear in the beginning, advanced smartly down the backside, had to be throttled down
behind runners seven sixteenths from home, waited behind a wall of runners through the turn, finally had a clear path four wide at the furlong marker,
quickly burst between runners and closed strongly late to get second. ITS A BIRDIE settled between horses in the mid-pack in the beginning, improved
along the backside, was scrubbed on gaining on the leaders running around the turn, was in the hunt in the four path driving to the finish, briefly had the lead
at the furlong marker but could not hold off the closers late and faded to just miss holding for second at the wire. SPEEDY JOHNY trailed the field at the
half, rallied three wide, following the path set by the winner throughout the turn, swung outside seven wide with run and closed in well under left handed
urging to get up for a minor share in the end. ONANDONANDON stalked in the third flight four deep on the outside at the half, was hard ridden to keep
position four wide with runners on either side midpoint on the turn, raced in the five path to be in the mix at the top of the lane, contended for a share
between foes at the sixteenth pole and tired in deep stretch. ROOKIE COURT prompted the pace outside three deep down the backside, chased the
frontrunner outside foes throughout the turn and faded inside with a sixteenth to run. GOLD FORESTER tracked the front trio between horse in the three
path down the back straight, roused between rivals three wide midway around the bend, was in tight in the four path straightening out for the drive and
finished up mildly to the wire. TAYLORMOON travelled outside runners four deep at the half in mid-pack, offered a brief run five wide around horses three
furlongs out, was in range six wide driving to the finish and weakened in mid-stretch. GOLDEN TRAIN pressed the pace inside down the backstretch,
chased the pacesetter on the rail through the turn and gave wat three wide at the furlong marker. TENPENNY NAIL stalked on the rail near the rear in the
early stages, made no headway on the rail around the bend, lost her path on the fence at the eighth pole, angled outside late and could not offer a finish in
deep stretch. SWEET NOLA travelled in midfield inside at the half, saved ground keeping pace throughout the turn, shifted inwards to the rail at the furlong
marker, was steadied at the sixteenth pole and could not be a factor after that. VERI UNIFIED had a slim lead with runners on either side in the early going,
opened up on the chasing rivals through the turn, was clinging to the lead on the fence turning for home, stopped inside at the furlong marker, checked on
the fence nearing the sixteenth pole and was not factor at the finish.
