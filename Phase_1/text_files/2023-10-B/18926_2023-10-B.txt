Footnotes
MYSTIC SEAPORT chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid in upper stretch and drew off to
the wire. TAK E LADY dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend and could not go
with the winner late, but chased that rival home, managing to hold second. BALLYHOOLY raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, navigated
the bend from the two path and improved position in the stretch. BACKSTREET GAL raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground on the outside late. SPOOKY SPICE hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack on
the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the lane. PRINCESS PALMER bumped with the horse to
her inside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. LADY SERENITY
dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and faded in the final furlong. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK
trailed the field on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. GOGO CHANEL bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate and was shuffled back to race at the back of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the lane.
SASSY BABE tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
VENOMOUS VIXEN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole and drew off in the stretch, geared down at the wire. J RIVERS pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the two path and kept on in the lane while proving to be no match for the winner. PRINCESS BLAME led the way on the inside up
the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and chased the winner home in the stretch, no match for that rival. DUELA DENT stalked the leaders on the
outside early, continued around the bend in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. TEQUILA TARA tracked the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. TIZ VINNO raced off the pace through the opening stages, saved ground
around the bend and made no bid. REDFIRE trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.
