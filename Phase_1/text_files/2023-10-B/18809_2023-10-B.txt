Footnotes
SHAKE THE GOLD set a pressured pace inside, repelled a rival near the top of the stretch and pulled away while kept to his task. DOS DE OROS hustled
just off leaders in the two path and closed well inside. SHEER DOMINANCE broke slowly and dropped far behind then finished strongly late. GLORIOUS
MACHO MAN broke alertly and dueled the winner outside then weakened in the lane. BEWARE OF PRIDE chased the pacesetters three wide and flattened
out in the stretch. EDDIE W dropped back outside and weakened steadily. WONTCATCHHIMTODAY flashed speed along the inside and gave way readily.

Footnotes
POWER AGENDA dueled three wide then drew off in the stretch under steady urging. BOOM BOOM KABOOM alternated for the advantage inside and
continued willingly to the wire holding the place. HANEY BOYS earned a narrow lead between rivals then weakened in the stretch. MIZZEN MAN raced four
wide in second flight and lacked a rally. TEMPESTUOUS was urged off the pace between rivals and flattened out in the stretch. GIVE IT A GO dropped
back early and was never in contention. VERO SUN trailed down the backstretch then caught fading rivals. WEGOTTAGUY angled inside early and never a
factor. SAILOR'S RETURN broke slowest, moved wide and gave way. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE drifted very wide on the turn then stopped losing contact
with his field.

CAPITAL CONQUEST awaited room long way behind wall of rivals, altered course and found a seam near midstretch and surged away. BUMP N RUN
dueled four wide, led briefly in midstretch and finished gamely. BLAZING RED vied between rivals in a heated battle to the final furlong and continued
willingly. UNCLE JAKE forced the pace along the inside battling for the lead and weakened. MASK PATROL prompted the pace three wide to midstretch
and faltered. SMARTEN UP trailed far behind throughout.

SCOOP DAWG far behind early, advanced inside then was up in the final strides. MEGA CHARLIE quickly moved clear, was collared into the stretch then
battled to the finish. SENSIBLE JIM settled outside, bid on final turn, led briefly then hung. ET'S MAGIC MAN steadied along into the first turn, saved ground
and tired late. MT SURIBACHI raced in closest pursuit of pacesetter then yielded late. THE TWINS SNEAKERS broke sluggishly and never in contention.
CELTIC TREASURE raced off the pace between foes and flattened out. HEFFNER raced very wide off the pace and faltered. WE READY dropped back
early and was always outrun. SEMPER FI broke a step slowly and trailed throughout. JACOHARE was ordered a late scratch at the gate by the track
veterinarian.

in the stretch. QUICK RETURN lacked speed, faded on the turn but continued willingly. MANAYUNK flashed speed in the two path for half a mile then
faltered. SHIVAREE moved close up outside through the opening quarter then stopped.

OFFALY COOL led narrowly in hand along the rail, edged clear at the quarter pole then widened through the stretch with a brisk hand ride. KING
KUMBALAY prompted the winner outside, was repelled into the stretch and proved easily second. NIMITZ CLASS reserved behind the pacesetter, was
asked on the final turn then came up empty in the stretch. BE BETTER trailed briefly inside then rallied mildly just missing the show. DONTMESAWITHME
moved close up briefly then gave way before quarter mile. LARGE fanned wide on the first turn, stalked three wide then faded on the final turn. NO SALT
lacked speed and weakened steadily losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
JARLIAN lacked speed, advanced outside, moved even wider into the stretch and rallied clear. B B BAD dropped back inside, moved along the rail and
closed well. AMIGOS GUITAR dueled outside, edged clear in the stretch then faltered. NICK THE CARDSHARK stalked the pacesetters then went evenly
through the stretch. U U STAR prompted the pace three wide and continued willingly. COUSIN ANDREW dropped back early, chased very wide and was no
threat. SAPONARA urged just off pace for half a mile and faltered. WAGON BOSS moved very wide on the turn and extremely wide into the stretch.
STRONG BREEZE earned a narrow advantage inside then faded through the stretch. SOPHOS dropped far behind and was never in contention. HIDE THE
RANSOM was squeezed back at the start and lacked a response. NEIGH DUDE chased in midpack and was finished after half a mile.
