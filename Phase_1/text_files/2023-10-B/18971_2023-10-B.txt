tucking to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.

Footnotes
KNOW IT ALL AUDREY coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
rallied and was herded out by the leader ICHIBAN as that foe drifted out three paths from the three-sixteenths to near the sixteenth marker, seized
command at that station and edged clear to the finish to prevail. ICHIBAN showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and drifted out despite a right handed crop herding out the aforementioned foe three paths
from the three-sixteenths to near the sixteenth marker when displaced from command, darted inwards a step spying the tire track of the gate and ran on
clear for the place honors. VENTI VALENTINE got bumped between foes who each broke her way at the start, chased three wide through the first turn and
then three to four wide down the backstretch, went three then two wide through the far turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. SWEET MYSTERY broke out at the start bumping VENTI VALENTINE in tandem with TOUGH
STREET, raced just off the inside through the first turn and then four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide for home and offered up a mild bid. SUNSET LOUISE chased three then four wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. APRIL ANTICS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide at the head of the stretch, weakened. TOUGH STREET three then two wide through the
first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs out, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT ARROW got brushed at the start by CICCIOBELLO due to pressure from UN OJO breaking outwards, raced forwardly placed four then three
wide through the first turn before chasing three to four wide down the backstretch, continued four wide through the far turn given a notch to work and placed
to light coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took over command narrowly swinging five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole
and was under a light drive inside the final sixteenth to prevail kept to task. SHERIFF BIANCO three wide through the opening bend, chased four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped six to seven wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors over his barn mate as they closed belatedly in tandem to the finish. UN OJO broke out at the start bumping
CICCIOBELLO into STRAIGHT ARROW, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in on the winner in concert with the aforementioned foe inside the final sixteenth
while well clear for the show honors. CICCIOBELLO got bumped at the start by UN OJO and in turn brushed STRAIGHT ARROW, raced three then two
wide forwardly placed through the first turn and engaged LOBSTA in head to head combat midway on that bend, traded the front three then two wide down
the backstretch and into the far turn, shook away from his main pace rival safely with seven-sixteenths to go and was confronted by the top with
five-sixteenths remaining, yielded command and swung four to five wide at the top of the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. DRAKE'S PASSAGE
just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. OLYMPIC DREAMS hustled from the gate, chased two then three wide
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. BARESE coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. LOBSTA dueled from the two path getting shaken off with seven-sixteenths to go, came under urging at the three-eighths, faded and swung
three wide at the head of the stretch, then faltered to the finish. CURLIN'S WISDOM away with the field, quickly grew detached at the tail of the field when
sluggish early along the inside through the first turn, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn,
went six to seven wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout while eased home to the wire.
