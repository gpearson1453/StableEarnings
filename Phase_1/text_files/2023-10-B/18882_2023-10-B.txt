Footnotes
HOLYJAZZ off bit slow, showed good speed to hold the rail on the backstretch, continued to hold the rail on the turn, cleared heading into the lane and drew
off in mid stretch. SEIGE THE DAY vied for lead in between rivals on the backstretch continued contesting the pace on the turn and kept on gamely in the
lane. WATER'S FOR FIGHTN stalked pace along the inside, kept saving ground on the turn and launched bid along the rail to get up for third. BOOMER
JUSTICE bumped around at the start, chased pace five wide on the backstretch, kept the terrible trip going by staying five wide throughout, and gamely kept
on after the rough trip. POLLO D'ORO chased pace four wide on the backstretch, continued four wide on the turn and lacked needed response in the lane.
WILEY'S WONDER came out and bumped rival at the start, stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and lacked needed
rally in the lane. TRIBUNAL LOVE came in and bumped rival at the start, contested pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn
and began to weaken entering the lane. OMAHA RUTSCH trailed throughout and never threatened. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
CROWN KITTEN went to rail on the backstretch, had to take up when checking off heels when rival backed into her, regathered and launched bid along the
rail and finished well under a strong drive. ISLAND LIFE stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane in the four
path, rallied well to briefly lead in deep stretch and outclosed late by inside rival. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST cleared rivals just a bit off the rail on the
backstretch, continued to stay clear on the turn, entered lane clear, drifted out a bit while rider was attempting to twirl the crop, asked and failed to have the
needed response while being overtaken passing the sixteenth pole. ABOVE THE STARS chased pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two to three
wide on the turn, launched bid three wide in the lane, and crowded and had to take up when in tight approaching the sixteenth pole. ROCK N ROLL SONG
settled off the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and made mild progress in the lane. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE chased
pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, launched promising bid along the rail, but quickly flattened out. QUEENIES WAY away
cleanly, dropped back and trailed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and passed tired rival in the lane. SECRET OF WAR stalked pace along
the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to produce a finish in the lane. JOCKEY OBJECTION, RIDER F ABOVE THE
