Footnotes
KNICKS STORY was a forward factor from the start along the inside, shifted out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, closed rapidly under left handed
urging through the final stages and was along in time. MOTOWN COLLECTION away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drew clear before the
furlong marker then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner and just missed hanging on. C C'S CLEAR CREEK bumped at the start, prompted the
pace three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. LOCO allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the six path. FINISTERE well placed,
failed to respond. QUICK QUICK WHIT pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. TWELVE MINUS ONE had brief speed. PAPA D L was
outrun. EL BANDIDO bumped at the start and was no threat.

Footnotes
EL MARRO pressed the pace two wide the entire trip, dug in under left handed urging and proved best in a stretch long drive. OL' L B set a pressured pace
inside the winner and finished second best under left handed urging. MANNFORD never far back, finished with good courage four then three wide under
right handed pressure. ATTACK ANGLE with the second flight two wide, lacked the needed response. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE close up early, dropped
back on the turn, was bumped from his inside near the quarter pole causing his rider to lose his irons. MUCHO PRIMO failed to menace. JOES A ROCKIN
had good early speed along the inside, stepped outward bumping YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE near the quarter pole then flattened out. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
R CARDINAL PRINCE broke in front, set all the pace while nicely rated and maintained his advantage under right handed urging. VAIL OF HONOR void of
early speed, angled outside on the far turn, rallied determinedly in the middle of the racetrack and finished second best. ALEXIS N NIKO pressured the
winner two wide around the clubhouse turn, dropped back a bit and shifted three wide, came on again on the far turn then was outfinished.
CENTSOFWANDER unhurried early, improved position along the rail in the stretch. GRAND DEAL raced three wide through the first turn, moved up four
wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. TOYI offered a mild bid along the rail on the second turn then came up empty. POT COMMITTED was no
factor. TOM'S SPIRIT was hung four wide through the first turn, pressured the winner two wide down the backstretch then was through after a half.
THISPOINTINTIME settled widest and was outrun.

Footnotes
HOPPY GILMORE stalked the pace through the turn, responded with a rapid move three wide under left handed urging to make the lead in upper stretch
and drew off to win as much the best under confident handling. GOLDEN MONEY allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch four wide and finished clear
for second. OAKEN was erratic at the start, trailed for a half, swung wide and found his best stride late five wide. TIDE RISING passed tiring rivals two wide.
THE MAN CAN sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, kept momentum until mid stretch then weakened. OHIO
MUNNY pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead briefly nearing the quarter pole then came up empty in deep stretch. MURRY SPUR was no
threat. MA MOO POWER was through after a half.

Footnotes
SALTMAKESHERSWEET broke in full stride to set all the pace, widened unto the stretch under left handed urging and won as much the best while taken in
hand late. COMPUTE THIS never far back, rallied through the stretch four wide and finished second best. CURLIN PEARLS unhurried early, found her best
stride late between rivals three wide. MISS SPRINGSTEEN saved ground and went evenly. DERBY DAY KISS stalked the pace three wide through the turn
then faded. MS. DEBBIE ALAN was no factor. SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL bumped at the start, chased the winner two wide into the stretch then gave way
readily. OPIE'S GIRL bumped at the start, flashed speed along the inside then stopped.
