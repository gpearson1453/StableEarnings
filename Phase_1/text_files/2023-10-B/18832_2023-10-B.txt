Footnotes
WHAT'S UP BRO set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook free of that one entering the lane and held sway under moderate urging. RAYMOND stalked
the top pair from the three path, gained place while taking aim on the clearing leader entering the lane, then chased that one home to prove second best.
HEALING WATERS chased in the two path while inside of rivals, shifted to the three path entering the lane, stayed on to gain show nearing midstretch and
held that position from an outer rival through the final furlong. CATIPARI was briefly fractious awaiting the start, raced off of the pace in the two to three path
before swinging outside of foes and to the five path entering the lane, then ran on mildly but was fended off by an inner rival for show. FABRICATOR saved
ground at the rear and improved position. LUCKY DUDE raced off of the pace in the three to four path and yielded between horses. MUST BE LOVE
prompted outside of the winner, failed to keep pace entering the lane and folded.

Footnotes
MA RAE'S GIRL chased the embattled leading pair from the inside into the turn, shifted outside of them and to the four path at the five sixteenths pole,
ranged up to bid entering the lane, drove clear entering midstretch and held sway. IN GOOD TASTE stumbled at the start, pursued from midpack two wide,
crept closer before awaiting racing room behind and among foes entering the lane, rallied once able to slip through, then edged place at the sixteenth pole
and slowly narrowed the leader's margin. CONTROLLED TEMPER broke well but failed to sustain forward position down the backstretch, fell back to race
off of the pace in the two path into the turn, yet picked up stride while entering the lane in the five path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and
rallied to gain show in the late stages. ADELEKE dueled for the lead inside of a rival while a path off of the inside, disposed of that foe before getting headed
by an outer bidder in upper stretch while greenly reacting from a left handed strike, pursued into midstretch but shied from being shown a left handed crop
while losing place at the sixteenth pole and gave way. CORKAGE FEE tracked two wide, got floated from the three path to the five path by the eventual
winner at the five sixteenths pole, leaned inwardly in upper stretch before changing leads at the three sixteenths marker and ran on mildly. OCEAN BIRD
rushed to spar for the lead outside of ADELEKE into the turn, vied in the three path around that bend, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane
and weakened between horses in upper stretch. SHESPUN pursued from midpack along the inside and gave way on her left lead. IMPECCABLE TIMING
was outrun along the inside. WINDY WALK steadied out of crowded quarters between a pair of foes soon after the start, raced well back in the three path
into the turn, got floated to the six to eight path entering the lane and never got involved.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS GAL stalked behind the leading trio and from the two path, tipped outside of them at the five sixteenths pole, bid entering the lane, drove
clear nearing the furlong grounds and held sway from an inner persistent foe. STORY HOUR dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, got
outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, regained place at the furlong pole, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and ran on well to close
narrow the leader's margin late. STYLE was slow into stride, lacked speed in the four to three path into the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane,
rallied and gain show late. CONDIMENT GIRL dueled for the lead three wide, led narrowly turning for home, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the
lane and yielded in the final furlong. HOME PORT brushed an outer rival before grazing an inner foe at the start, pursued the top flight from the two path,
spun to the five path entering upper stretch and moved up between horses late. TELL ME WHEN tracked the dueling trio from the four path into the turn, got
floated to the five path by the eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole, chased through upper stretch and lacked a bid. GIRL AFRAID dueled for the lead
inside of a pair of rivals but weakened entering the lane. STORMY EMPIRE was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
HE'S GOT THIS pursued from midpack in the three path, gained inside of an rival around the far turn to bid outside of a leading HEARTBREAKER at the
quarter pole, dueled with that one through the late, wrestled an advantage in the final furlong and prevailed. HEARTBREAKER vied for the lead outside of a
rival while in the three path, cleared that one into the far turn before meeting a pair of outer challenges turning for home, dueled gamely inside of HE'S GOT
THIS into the final furlong, but was grudgingly bested late. EXPENSIVE CUT tracked in the three path, inched closer around the far turn along with an inner
rival to attempt a bid in the four path at the quarter pole, vied with an inner pair approaching the lane, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch and
remained clear of the rest. BIRD KING pursued from midpack along the inside, but gave way to the top quartet while taking the far turning the three path,
surpassed a faltering foe for fourth in midstretch and held that position from an outer rival late. WHAT A COUNTRY raced at the rear along the inside,
shifted out in upper stretch but needed more to gain a minor share. SOUL COAXING vied inside of a dueling rival, but gave way entering the far turn.
BEEALEA broke multiple lengths slow, raced at the rear two wide, but lacked a response to urging three wide around the far turn and never got involved.
GITA'S LAD tracked in the two path, but weakened between horses with a half mile to go and was done early.

Footnotes
MAKEUP set the pace along the inside, shook clear entering the lane in the two path and inched away through the final furlong. BEAUTIFUL MISCHIEF
pressed two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leader while spinning to the four path entering the lane, turned away an outer rival
for place in the final furlong and kept an inner bidder at bay late. SHORE WAR tracked two wide and between horses while under a snug hold among foes,
then chased well to bid for place along the inside in the final furlong, but was denied that position. TWO SIP SALLY broke outwardly, stalked three wide,
floated to the five path entering the lane, bid for place in upper stretch but was turned away in the final furlong. LYRICAL PARDON stalked along the inside,
chased through upper stretch and yielded. INTO STARS saved ground off of the pace, then improved in the three path and between horses in midstretch.
LITTLE MISS MUNNY lacked speed in the three to four path around the turn, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. FANTASTICAL
broke a step slow and got floated out by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, then failed to factor in the six path and between horses.
SOTONA saved ground in midpack and gave way. DR. RAY D. lacked speed along the inside, attempted to gain in the two to three path and between
horses around the turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and made little impact. SAVE THE MISCHIEF tracked three wide, shifted out to the five
path in upper stretch and weakened. MISS TAPTRESS broke a step slow and was outrun in the two to three path.

Footnotes
LUCKY BOSS broke a step slow while last away, tracked along the inside, shifted out to the three path entering the turn, inched closer to take aim on the
new leader from the five path entering the lane, ranged up to that one nearing midstretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear.
SHOOTERS SHOOT chased in the four path under strong urging, inched closer into the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, but was
headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and was second best. MAILMAN MONEY prompted along the inside early on, stalked from the pocket
around the turn, but was blocked behind rivals entering the lane and through upper stretch, found clear sailing to split foes entering the final furlong and
edged show. THE QUEENS JULES prompted two wide and between horses early on, stalked into the turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and
lacked a bid. GROUP EIGHTEEN rushed to set the pace four wide after a quarter mile, cleared and crossed down to the two path into the turn, met an outer
pair of challenges at the five sixteenths pole and yielded in upper stetch. UPSTRIKER raced forwardly three wide, moved to press the leader from the three
path as an outer rival ranged up at the three furlong pole, bid along with that one at the five sixteenths marker but weakened in upper stretch. SPEIGHT
AND MALICE trailed in the three path around the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
LINCOLN HIGHWAY stalked along the inside, pursued with run in the two path around the far turn, swung out to the five path to take dead aim on the leader
in upper stretch, drove past that one at the furlong grounds, led into the final sixteenth and held from an outer bidder late. MACKILLOP laid off of the pace in
the two path two three path, shifted inwardly to maneuver around traffic entering the lane, rallied two wide and between horses through midstretch, shifted
out while closing in on the leader late, bid approaching the wire but came up short. CLYDE'S GOT A GUN laid off of the pace in the three to four path,
fanned to the eight path entering the lane and rallied outside of rivals to gain show late. SIR LONDON pressed the leader from the three path, stalked the
new pace setter before ranging closer to once again offer pressure around the far turn, gained an advantage from that one nearing the three sixteenths pole,
but was headed by an outer bidder passing the furlong grounds and yielded late. REDEMPTION TIME pursued from midpack in the three path and between
horses, shifted to the five path around the far turn before tipping to the six path entering the lane and ran on between horses. TEN DAYS LATER raced at
the rear two wide, gained inside of rivals around the far turn, split foes entering the lane before moving out to the four path in upper stretch, but stalled out
while getting outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds and yielded between horses shortly after. EL AHIJADO saved ground at the rear then
improved between horses nearing midstretch. AMERICAN DIAMOND tracked two wide and between horses, chased under urging in the three path among
foes around the far turn then weakened in upper stretch. ENDPOINT pursued from midpack along the inside, then in the three to four path around the far
turn, but was blocked behind rivals nearing the lane and made little impact. TIVERTON (GB) raced in midpack in the five path into the first turn, pulled
around that bend, moved forward outside of foes to gain an advantage at the five furlong pole, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, but was
headed in upper stretch and folded. MENDEL'S SECRET set the pace in the two path, relinquished the advantage to an outer rival at the five furlong pole,
stalked that one into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. HARDY CHOICE stalked in the four path, then weakened between horses in upper
stretch.

WINNEMAC AVENUE pressed the leader from the four to three path around the first turn, vied into the far turn, took charge turning for home and drew off
under a drive in upper stretch. JR'S GIFT pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch, ran on to gain place at the
sixteenth pole and was second best. DANCE SOME MO set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the rail, gave way to that one turning for
home, yet saved show late. BRIGHT SPARK raced at the rear two wide, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and stayed on. WASHINGTON'S UNION
tracked in the five path, pressed the top pair under urging from the four path into the far turn, but drifted back to the five path entering the lane and
weakened between horses in upper stretch. GAMER stalked along the inside, chased in the two path around the far turn, but weakened between horses in
upper stretch on his left lead. GLEN AIRY lacked speed in the four to six path and failed to factor. WINSTON WOLF pursued from midpack two wide, but
failed to sustain positoin with nine sixteenths remaining, took the far turn in the four to five path and made little impact. PRINCELY was outrun along the
inside. HONED tracked in the four path, yielded between horses down the backstretch, then weakened further while drifting to the five path entering the
lane. FUNNY UNCLE never got involved from the two path.

Footnotes
CLOUDWALKER took contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane, rallied to kick past
the leaders in the final furlong. CABERNEIGH set the pace along the inside, repelled an outer bidders challenge passing the furlong grounds but was bested
by another bidder entering the final sixteenth. COPPERDROP pressed two wide, attempted a bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked shortly after,
then failed to gain place. JOKE MASTER broke outwardly and bumped a rival, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, then chased in the five path.
SATIN BLUE transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, pursued form midpack along the inside, tipped between horses entering the
lane and ran on. WONDER WAVE (IRE) was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, save ground off of the pace, encountered traffic in upper
stretch, tipped out at the furlong grounds but lacked a bid. MODERN SOUND bobbled and leaned outwardly into an outer rival at the start, trailed along the
inside, fanned out entering the lane and moved up. HAUNTRESS broke a step slow before taking contact from an inner foe at the start, then made little
impact two wide. UNMATCHED tracked three wide, then weakened in the six path. CHARM OF THE SONG stalked along the inside and weakened in upper
stretch. LUMINOUS RULER never got invovled. LOLA'S LIGHT broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four path and weakened.
