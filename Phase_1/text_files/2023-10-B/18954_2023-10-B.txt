Footnotes
JOLLY TOMMY stalked the early front runners from the five path, advanced at the half and joined the leaders on the outside in the six path, battled for the
lead nearing the top of the lane, fought for the lead the first few strides into the stretch drive and prevailed drawing away for the win. FAR BEYOND raced
mid pack in the four path early, patiently waited, was asked and responded well at the three quarter marker, had plenty left and closed well into through the
stretch drive and to the wire running a game second. GET THEM JUSTIN was off of the pace in the first call, quickly advanced and improved position, made
his way into the first tier of horses by the first quarter, raced in between rivals until the top of the lane, battled briefly with the eventual winner but had no late
kick. CHAPEL BARN vied for the lead, took command and set the pace, raced on the rail, then flattened out and tired. PREMIUM was sharp out of the gate
and a bit keen early on, was forwardly placed on the front end while racing in between rivals in the five path, was in contention but gave way in the stretch.
RUNWAY MAGIC made the lead early on, settled hands along the rail in a stalking position, edged out into the three path near the three quarter pole but
had no late rally. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced from off of the pace, brought up the rear and passed tired rivals late. WARRIOR'S RUN showed little.
MACHINEGUNPREACHER was sharp out of the gate, raced on the outside of the 1st tier, had the lead for a call at the half, then faltered. THE JOCKEY OF
#8 GET THEM JUSTIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 JOLLY TOMMY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER
VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

BOBBY BOY settled into mid pack in the 6 path, raced mid pack, was cued at the half mile marker, responded well by kicking into another gear and circling
the field, matched strides with the leaders entering the stretch, was asked again mid stretch and responded well drawing away from the other for a dominant
win. CAJUN CYCLONE had an awkward start, rushed, raced between rivals, settled into a stalking position from the three path, launched a bid at the half
mile pole, drew closer to the front end, was on even terms with the leaders turning the bend for home, was slightly bumped by another rival in the stretch,
was kept under encouragement, down the stretch and out finished the rest finishing a hard earned second. AUTUMN ROB vied for the lead, led in a set with
another rival, set the pace, raced in the two path, showed the way into the stretch but could not sustain the bid to the wire finishing in the show spot. NOT
LIKELY stalked the front runners from the three path, settled, fell into the middle of the field, raced patiently, was asked at the quarter pole shifted into the

Footnotes
RAIN stalked early, raced four wide, keen through the first turn, led before the half mile pole, was asked to slow the pace down and rate, grudgingly slowed
down, then was cued at the three eights pole, encouraged down the lane, held sway. GLANCE stalked the front runners from the five path, maintained that
position, under heavy encouragement at the three eights pole, up for second. IZEONPOINT was off mid pack, raced on the rail, was allowed to settle and
find her stride, launched a bid at the half mile pole, gained ground and improved position with every stride, shifted into the three path entering the upper
stretch, passed one rival while racing beside another, closing with every step, raced in between rivals, split horses in the stretch and just missed running a
game third. WESTERN DREAM vied for the lead, raced two wide, led, then traded position with another front and stalked, traded the lead again then tired in
the quarter of a mile. ROYAL BONUS raced from off of the four path, launched a bid at the half mile pole, closed well but to no avail. KISS RIDE GOODBYE
raced mid pack, maintained position, running an even race. BOWS N LACE raced mid pack, saved ground while racing on the rail then steadily faded.
START WELL was off mid pack, raced four to five wide but made no impact. J Z'S FIRST trailed through out.

off a step slow, raced in the four path, was in hands while racing mid pack, launched a bid at the half mile pole, improved position, was encouraged down
the stretch but just missed. ZEEROCK raced from mid pack,saved ground and raced on the fence, gained ground through the turn, did not have enough
today. WORLD OF HURT trailed the field early, saved ground, mild gain late. FITTS N STARTS vied for the lead, raced on the rail, briefly led, then faded.

Footnotes
MEGANS MILLIONS vied for the lead, settled and stalked the leader from the four path, was asked and responded well by taking over the lead at the
quarter pole, was encouraged and was able to show the way to the wire breaking her maiden today.. OUR HALLIE vied for the lead, led, battled briefly at
the half mile marker, surrendered the lead, stalked that rival then chased the eventual winner to the wire. PINTORA raced mid pack in the three and four
paths, improved to stalk the early leaders, maintained that position through out the remainder of the race gaining third place honors. SHORT STACK was off
a bit slow, trailed early, advanced at the half, gained ground with every stride, closed well. ILIMITADA raced mid pack in the four path, raced in between
rivals and mildly improved late. BEAT THE DOUBLE was off mid pack, maintained position and raced an even race. LYRICAL MUSIC was forwardly placed
early on then faded. SLIM CAUSEWAY raced mid pack in the three path and gave way after the half mile pole. DREAMED I AM FAST showed little.
PLEADING GUILTY trailed.
