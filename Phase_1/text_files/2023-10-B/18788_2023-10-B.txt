Footnotes
KAITIE KAIT prompted the pace in the five path, was roused to bid in the three path early around the turn, took the lead while drifting inward in upper
stretch, and was driven clear in the final furlong. SKY DIVINE set the pace in the two path, was challenged by the outer eventual winner while along the
inside around the three eighths, lost the lead turning into the lane, had to alter outside the in-drifting leader passing the eighth pole, and kept on for place.
FIELD OF BLOSSOMS stalked in the five path, was under coaxing in the four path around the turn, and finished evenly from the five path down the stretch
for show. WONDERFULVENEZUELA chased in the three path, was driven in the four path around the turn, got floated out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, and made no impact. PANOLA rated from the rail, was coaxed in the three path rounding the turn, floated out to the seven path going into the
stretch, but flattened. QUEEN AIKO tracked inside, but faded in the two path turning into the lane. HERMOSA MUJER raced off the pace in the four path,
was cued in the five path early around the turn, but did not threaten. MAELSTROM SPIRIT broke out at the start, and always trailed from the five to two
paths. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE RIDER OF SKY DIVINE OBJECTED AGAINST THE RIDER OF KAITIE KAIT FOR INTERFERENCE AT
THE EIGHTH POLE.

Footnotes
HYDRIA raced in midpack in the five path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, rallied while tipping inwards into the final furlong, and was up
in the closing stages. MISS UNCONCERNED was prompted along while up close in the three path, tipped to the rail around the turn, bid passing the
quarter, kicked away from outer foes while drifting out passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an inner foe late to place. J J MONET set the pace in the
two path, lost the lead while floating out to the five path turning into the stretch, but fought on to just hold show in a photo. CLASSY SLEW rated inside, was
nudged from the rail around the turn, shifted out to the four path at the top of the lane, stayed on while weaving through traffic in the stretch, but missed
getting up for show in a photo. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY trailed in the six path, fanned out to the eight path going into the stretch, and improved down the
center. ALWAYS CONNECTED tracked in the three path but was one paced. FREE CRISTINA stalked in the four path, floated out to the seven path turning
into the lane, but faded going into the final furlong. BLACK AND SILVER raced wellback in the four path, was in the five path around the turn, but did not
factor. STARSHIP DYNASTY raced off the pace in the three path and never threatened.

WICKED GENIUS chased in the three path, was coaxed from the four path early into the far turn, bid turning into the stretch, took the lead passing the
eighth pole, and was driven clear. DRILLOMATIC raced off the pace in the four path, floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the lane, tipped
back into the four path nearing the eighth pole, and rallied for place. WATCH THE MUSIC stalked in the four path, bid between foes in the three path
nearing the quarter, but evened out in the final furlong to show. ALMASHRIQ set the pace in the two path, was challenged by a pair of outer foes midway
around the far turn, and faded along the inside down the stretch. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) rated in the two path, was coaxed from the four path early around the
far turn, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but flattened. BLACK LIMO laid up close in the three path, but was tired while floating out to the five path
entering the stretch. UNIFIED CONQUEST tracked in the two path, was driven between foes in the six path turning into the lane, but did not threaten.
PLUMA ROJA trailed throughout from the three to eight paths.

Footnotes
ZIO LORENZO set the pace in the four path, was nudged along in the three path around the turn, and opened up down the stretch under a drive. SIMSOUM
stalked inside, was under coaxing between foes in the three path around the turn, and chased on from the two path down the lane for place. RAPSCALLION
was hustled from off the pace in the four path, swung out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, and kept on while on his left lead for show.
MAGIC SOUL rated inside, tipped out under a drive turning into the lane, but made no impact from the five path in the stretch. ROAN tracked in the four
path, received right handed cues around the turn, but flattened while still on his left lead from the three path down the lane. VINSANITY pressed in the two
path, was under coaxing from the rail turning into the lane, had to check nearing the eighth pole, and could not threaten. IMPROPTUDE chased in the three
path but was no menace. OCONEE LIFE trailed throughout from the two to three paths. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN OBJECTION WAS
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF VINSANITY AGAINST THE RIDER OF SIMSOUM FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH POLE.

CONCRETE GLORY set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. RARE JEWEL settled off the early pace inside, advanced two wide around the
turn and was clearly second best in the lane. DANVILLE stalked the pace three wide, lacked a rally and held third. HERE COMES BULLET chased the pace
inside and faded in the stretch. REBELDE failed to menace while racing three wide. WAR CROSS played no factor while racing four wide. DREAM KNIGHT
broke awkwardly, raced three wide and never threatened. ARIES REIGNS had early speed two wide and was through after a half. PIYPA DE LYNDA had
only brief speed three wide.

GO BILLY GO stalked inside, was roused in the three path early around the turn, took aim from the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on to draw past
an inner rival in the final strides. ARROGANCY broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, was nudged along the inside around the turn, kicked
away in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer foe late. VITO'S BROTHER brushed with an outer foe at the start, pressed in the three path, was cued to
bid in the two path early around the turn, but evened out passing the eighth pole to finish with show. GUYS TRIP brushed with an inner foe at the start,
chased in the three path, was driven around the turn, but faded in the stretch. BEYOND REPROACH had to check at the start, trailed from the two path into
the turn, floated out around the turn and was in the eight path entering the stretch, but made no impact. MOBY WARRIOR broke in and bumped an inner
foe, raced off the pace in the five path, was driven in the three path around the turn, but flattened down the lane. IMPERIALTY tracked in the five path but
faded into the stretch. JAKE'S AFFECTION got bumped and had to steady at the start, rated in the three path but never threatened. SMOOTH AN EASY
