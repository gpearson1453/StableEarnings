Footnotes
BETKA was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. ASHWICKEN stalked the early
leader and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. RUMOURS FLY showed speed from the inside and
dueled on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. SMART IRENE was in range and raced evenly from the inside on the
far turn but had no late kick. BELLE FEMME was up close early and roused on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response.
SOVEREIGN TALE was in touch early but trailed the field on the far turn and was not a factor.

BETTABE SWIFT was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. REIGN BY REIN was unhurried early and
moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. PACENZA was in range and hustled along on the turn but
from the seven path at the top of the stretch evened out. JUNGLE GODDESS showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch gave way. SWEET FINALE reared at the start and closed the gap on the turn but was no threat. EASY ACCESS forced
the pace and dueled on the turn but dropped back through the stretch. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

PAPERBACK HERO checked just after the start, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch proved best. TAKE A CHANCE set the
pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. PRIVATE LAKE was off the pace, gained ground on the
turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. MAYITO was in range, raced evenly on the turn and was the best of the rest. WENJACK
was well back, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. W W SPRINGTIME tracked the early leader but chased on the turn and
from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. THELONIOUS showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. MOBILIZER
was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

pack and a factor on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. PERFECTION SAVER was off the pace, saved ground on the far
turn and was up for a share. MR. RUDY forced the early pace and had a slim lead going into the far turn but from the four path at the top stretch gave way.
SING DIXIE set a pressured pace and dueled on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. NGABE was unhurried early and
showed little in a dull effort.

STRIKE THE POSE stalked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. ISA
BREEZE was away alertly and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SUPER COOL
STORM was in touch, hustled along on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. TURF AND SURF was unhurried early
and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. HEAR ME KNOCKING was hustled early but lost ground on the
turn and was empty. ORIGINAL ME was in range early but trailed the field on the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
GLITTER BAY set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and with mild pressure in deep stretch just lasted. TRISH THE DISH stalked the early leader,
closed the gap on the far turn and from the four path through the stretch rallied late. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far
turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. SANTIAGO SALSA showed no speed, saved ground on the far turn and was up for a
share. UNILATERAL was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. HIT THE POINT was in range
but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. DIAMONDBACK was unhurried early, showed little and was never a threat. IRIE ISLAND MAN was well
back and showed nothing in a dull effort.
