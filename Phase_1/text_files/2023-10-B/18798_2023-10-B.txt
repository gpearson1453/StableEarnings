VICTORY MARCH settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. STRONG ENDING was unhurried
early, roused from the inside on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. STRIKING MOON stalked the early leaders and
was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. HAPPYMAC forced the early pace and had a slim lead on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. VINNIE VAN GO set the pace and dueled on the turn but came up empty. HALF LIT was off the pace
and showed little in a dull effort.

early leaders from the outside and had a clear lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. ORBITING THE SKY
was unhurried early and a factor on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. AWILDAS TREASURE forced the early pace
but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. DOODLE DANDY was off the pace, trailed the field on the far turn and failed to fire.
REMEMBEROLDTYMES set a pressured pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
SNELL FLICKA was hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. MUSICAL RIDE was off
the pace, trailed the field on the turn and rallied late. SOMEONE ELSE was in touch, hustled along on the turn and from the four path at the top of the
stretch finished evenly. HASN'T HIT ME YET stalked the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but leveled off. SILVER TUNES was in range and
roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no response. DETERMINED LOVE set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the
turn but dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
HALF TO RELOAD stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. WOOD BE WILD set a
pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. RAGING BEAR was hustled early, raced evenly from the inside on
the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. STUBBORN STREAK was unhurried early, roused on the turn and from the six path at
the top of the stretch was up for a share. ARTIE'S ALL IN was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch
needed more. EL FANTASMA was up close and forced the pace on the turn but had nothing left.
