Footnotes
CHUCKIES CHANCE was never far back from the lead then waited for the gap to open up in the middle of the track as the kept pressing the pace and
eventually surpassed foe at the wire. JOKER MATT ran with good speed even though the pace was being pressed, they took the three path down the
stretch to only get caught at the wire. ARIMONY ran in the middle of the pack then coming out of the turn started to have a slight kick with a mild gain on the
stretch. PARTYOFSIXTEEN ran with an even pace throughout in the middle of the pack on the outside. GLENDORA MINECAT ran at the back of the pack
then coming down the stretch had a very slight change of pace to pass a couple tired foes. DOM WAYNE ran in the middle of the pack but as the race went
on they shuffled back. POLICY LIMIT ran with early speed then pressed the pace thru the end of the turn which when coming on to the stretch they faded
hard dropping back. BIG MAC DADDY ran at the back of the pack had a slight gain then coming on to the stretch they hung and rode out the race. NOT
TODAY SATAN ran with a slowed pace throughout the race. MORE HONOR trailed throughout the race only catching a already tired foe very late in to the
stretch. THIS RACE IS HAND TIMED.
