FAMILY BAND sprinted to a clear lead off the rail soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, drew off, then lasted under steady
pressure. REAL GOOD VYBZ well placed and between, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and
closed the gap on the winner late. UPTOWN CHARLOTTE well placed and inside, steadied for racing room inside through the turn, got through inside the
leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and held the show. ABUNDANT STORY unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn,
fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. MY BRIDGET VERDOT passed a tiring rival. KEEN ON ME well placed and outside, moved up four
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded.

GOOSE HUNTER never far back, looped up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drew off and was
kept to the task. UNCLE JOCK rated back inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside a drifting leader, gained a short lead, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. HAMMER LANE stalked the pace outside, gained a striking position and bid three wide outside that one into the
stretch, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. GIACOMETTI hopped at the start, rushed up to a clear lead, drifted out slightly into the stretch
while being challenged, then faded in the lane. SHOOT YOUR CUFFS was never involved.

Footnotes
CANDY CORN set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then dueled with a rival, loosing the advantage, came again late
and edged ahead. FOURONEOHSMOKESHOW tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a
steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker and dueled, then was no match late, while clearly best of the rest. ABRAMS unhurried, gained position three
wide through the second turn, drifted out into the stretch and flattened out. IRISH STONE stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the
two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then drifted in and faded.

to position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, veered in and lacked the needed late kick. POKER PARTNER broke sharply from
the gate and sprinted clear quickly, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. UNCLE KENNY well placed and
