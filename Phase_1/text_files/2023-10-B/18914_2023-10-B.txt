broke poorly spotting her field five lengths, bid strongly wide on the turn then faded. DENIM N LACE stumbled slightly at the start, raced close up briefly, and

broke slowest, advanced inside and was easily second best. ONLY GIRL saved ground close up early then faltered but held the show. WILD N' SASSY
dropped far behind inside then caught tiring rivals. OVERTHEBLUESKY raced wide off the leaders and gave way. MAP OF LIFE put to urging wide before
half a mile and stopped. SWEET EMSY fanned wide on the first turn then stopped losing contact with her field.

ABIDALE set slow fractions in hand, repelled a challenge at the quarter pole and drew clear again in a drive. UNADULTERATED saved ground close up,
angled out on the final turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. JULIET'S MUSIC settled inside, raced along the rail throughout to gain third.
GINGERS WISH raced three wide off the leaders and lacked a response. AMATERASU prompted the winner for half a mile then gave way readily.

NOTICE OF ACTION settled off the pace, bid three wide on the turn, drew away through the stretch and was being geared down late. KISS FOR LUCK
outrun early inside, split rivals in the stretch and was just up for the place. KELLY'S KIDZ was unruly in gate prior to the start, moved close up inside, was
blocked on the turn, angled out to secure room but lacked closing kick. SHARP TONES lacked speed, raced wide on the turn then offered some late energy.
UNCLE CAT hustled to a clear lead in the opening quarter, dueled on the turn and faded. PALLINO prompted the pace outside then gave way through the
stretch. HIS RIGHTS dropped back early and trailed throughout.
