Footnotes
TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE quickly moved clear to set the pace racing near but off the fence, had enough left in reserve and held safe under steady
handling. THE BEARRISH ONE was kept wide in the early going off the leader, went three then four deep on the turn, angled eight wide into upper stretch,
kicked on to gain the place. DORSODURO raced outside foes four then five wide on the turn, went evenly in the stretch. TRIPLE TITOS broke a step slowly,
lacked early speed, saved ground inside a foe on the turn on or just off the rail, ran on. MOON CONNECTION stumbled at the start, moved forward inside
foes but off the fence, went in the two to three path on the turn in pursuit of the leader, came out a bit in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick.
RECKLESS PLACE lacked early speed racing two to three wide into the turn, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
CARSONSTRONG was quick to the lead setting the tempo from off the rail, raced in the two to three path on the turn drifting out leaving that bend then back
in while spurting away from pursuers in upper stretch, held sway while being kept to the task. YODA GLITZ pursued the leading pair four to five wide on the
turn floating out a bit wider into upper stretch, kept on to gain the place. SWEET SUMMER LOVE rated just off the leader pressing that one early, was
floated five wide leaving the turn, weakened in the stretch and lost place late. REE NEE'S SIX was well-placed very early but steadily dropped back up the
backstretch and on the turn racing near the inside, came out in the stretch and kept on late to come again and improve. RITZ ON BROADWAY chased from
inside, came out for the stretch run, went evenly. HARLEE lacked early speed dropping back toward the rear, raced in the four to five path on the turn and
encouraged along past the three-eighths, improved in the stretch. MISS OMAHA was encouraged along early racing in behind foes mid-pack and off the
inside, failed to menace. BUONA SALUTE lacked early speed, advanced inside on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. JASSAI chased from outside
dropping back five to six wide on the turn while encouraged along past the three-eighths, faded. PER RULING 2023-00967 FROM HISA, YODA GLITZ
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED.

Footnotes
THREE CARATS bobbled slightly at the start, settled off the leaders tracking inside, bid past the quarter pole taking the lead at the top of the stretch, moved
clear, held. STEPHANIE MY LOVE settled off the pace racing near the inside into the turn, angled six wide late on that bend, was gaining but too late. BALI
MOON bobbled into a rival at the start, settled off the pace and off the rail, kept on between runners late. TOUGH ENOUGH switched outside the leader
stalking three wide into the turn, went three to four deep in range, kept on evenly. LADY LANCER was bumped at the start, stalked from outside four wide
into the turn, fanned seven wide out of that bend, ran on. SAVANNAH'S SUGAR moved clear, set the pace racing off the rail, faltered.

Footnotes
LAUNCH exchanged light contact at the start but was quick to the lead, moved clear on the turn, drew away in upper stretch under steady urging but was
just mildly ridden late. COPPER BOUND chased from inside, came out a bit for the drive, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. FLEET
FROST tracked in behind, made a mild move between runners two to three wide on the turn to gain more forward position, needed more late but held show
honors. MAXS PICK shifted in racing near but off the rail, ran on and missed show honors. BURNING EMBERS chased in behind four to five wide, needed
more. RUE CAMBON was reluctant to load then fractious when in the gate, shifted in racing toward the rear three wide, failed to menace. RED HEAD
ITALIAN bumped with the inside foe lightly at the start, chased the winner briefly two to three wide, steadily retreated. SHEZA NASTY GIRL caught wide
going five deep on the turn and outside, was not a factor.

Footnotes
MYSTIC SEAPORT stalked two to three wide, moved to the lead at the quarter pole, was never asked for much, drew clear and taken in hand late. SISTER
SUPREAM was urged strongly from the break, chased inside, shifted out four wide leaving the turn, was no match but second best. IRISH LACE settled off
the pace inside, kept on for show. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY was off the pace going two to three wide on the turn, needed more. FAST COREY sped clear,
set the pace from just off the rail, weakened. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX raced well off the inside at the back in the four to five path through the turn, swung
nine deep into upper stretch and passed tired foes. BIG AMBITION was encouraged along outside a foe three to four wide through the turn, faded.
CREATIVE CADENCE raced inside a rival two to three deep on the turn toward the rear, tired.

Footnotes
BROTHER CONWAY pressed the pace from the outset under modest early encouragement, went two to three wide into the turn taking the lead past the
three-eighths, drew clear in the stretch, held sway. GOLDEN CANDY broke outwardly, tracked in behind, sought room near the quarter pole, advanced
inside in upper stretch, got the nod for second. HEADS OR TAILS stalked the leading pair with good position in the clear outside going three to four wide on
the turn, missed show honors. SPOTTED BULL was shut off at the start, encouraged along to catch up with the leaders, advanced four to five wide on the
turn, evened out in late stretch. TETSU raced off the pace, fanned six wide into upper stretch, was not a threat. PYRON raced off the pace inside, shifted
five wide leaving the turn, failed to menace. SHACKS WAY broke in just a bit, set a pressured pace inside just off the rail, weakened. BABY BOOMER was
outpaced and never a threat.

Footnotes
CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH stalked the leading pair from outside three to four wide, bid coming to the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch then edged away
late. TOUGH TICKETS set a pressured pace inside on or just off the rail, was overtaken narrowly about the quarter pole, fought on before yielding
grudgingly. LEASE pressed two to three wide, began to drop back and switched out past the quarter pole, was no match for the top pair. KOBLA MAS
shifted in from five to four wide while easing back off rivals into the first turn, advanced four to five deep on the far turn, needed more late. SILENT MALICE
raced off the pace two to three wide, moved between foes on the far turn, failed to menace. ROMP bobbled slightly at the break, raced off the pace while

Footnotes
ALBOROTO stalked from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch taking a narrow lead, drifted out a bit, just held. WEST STAR got
away well, steadily dropped back between runners two to three deep up the backstretch into the turn, came again in the lane rallying between runners but
missed. HOLLYWOOD CLOSEUP was bumped at the break, moved closer in behind the leaders two wide, waited briefly near the quarter pole, cut the
corner and advanced inside rivals through the stretch then evened out late. GAMERUN was quick to the lead, set the pace inside on or just off the rail facing
outside pressure, yielded in the stretch. REBEL JOKE pressed two to three wide, weakened. WALK SADLY raced outside off the pace, went three to four
wide on the turn, failed to menace. SEAX broke awkwardly, chased briefly from inside, dropped back. VIDA FINA bumped a rival at the start, shifted in, was
outpaced.
