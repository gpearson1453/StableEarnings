ITASCA sprinted up the inside to make the lead entering the clubhouse turn, set a pressured pace into the stretch then responded under mild right handed
urging full of run to win going away while being ridden out. PERCENTAGE never far back, rallied determinedly along the rail through the stretch and got up
for second. MAXIMIZER pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. DUEL FUEL settled outside, rallied three wide through the far
turn, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack late and leveled off. ONLYATTHESHOE was no factor. LUCKY ANDY was no threat. BRIAR JUMPER stalked
the early pace two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
SUDDEN SHIFT prompted the pace from three wide through the far turn, assumed command turning for home, dueled with the runner-up down the lane
and prevailed at the wire. MY TWO AUNT JOANS stalked the pace from the fence to the far turn, angled four wide at the head of the lane, engaged the
winner in mid-stretch, raced close together to the wire and was denied in the final strides in a good effort. WHISKEY ROAN set the pace from the fence
under pressure to the head of the lane and weakened in the drive while holding the show. BOSS BEAR unhurried for the first five-eighths of a mile and
closed through the lane passing tiring rivals. FISHING FOR FUN pressed the pace from between rivals to the far turn, took a brief lead at the quarter pole
and faded in the stretch. UNCLEJACKOMO reserved off the pace down the backside, made an early bid four wide in the turn and flattened out coming
home. AT THE BEACH was never a factor. THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE LANE UPON REVIEW
THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

PAT DADDY tracked the leaders to the turn, made a steady advance through the lane when angled out three wide and pulled clear late. KOSCIUSZKO
dueled on the lead from two wide to mid-stretch, took command briefly inside the eighth pole and was outkicked in the drive. TWICE AS SMART set a
pressured pace from the fence to upper stretch and weakened late in the lane. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER broke outward bumping rival leaving the gate,
chased the leaders to the head of the lane and kept on with a mild bid in the stretch. THE EQUINEST raced four wide the entire way and failed to mount a
closing rally. NO COMMISSION raced wide the entire way as a non-factor. PER HISA RULING DATED 11/02/2023, PAT DADDY WAS DQ'D DUE TO A
WHIP INFRACTION.

Footnotes
LIONISTIC set a pressured pace from the fence to the head of the lane, quickly opened a clear advantage when called upon in upper stretch and held the
clear lead in a decisive run through the lane. LIBERTY BELLE stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide down the lane to be second best in a
good try. AUJARA reserved off the pace while racing along the rail, saved all the ground and made a willing bid up the fence as best of the rest. SQUID
tracked the pace from four wide to the top of the stretch and failed to gain in the drive. JEN'S BATTLE unhurried early to be at the back of the field while
racing wide the entire way and made a mild late bid. QUARANTINA trailed to mid-stretch and showed late interest nearing the wire. MIDNIGHT IN OHIO
pressed the pace for a half mile and gave way through the stretch. ANNMARIA failed to menace.

MISS SENSIBLE pressed the pace to midway on the bend, took command nearing the quarter pole, dug-in gamely when challenged in mid-stretch and
prevailed in a determined drive. TRICKED OUT reserved off the early pace, split rivals in the turn to commence a rally, angled out four wide in upper stretch
and closed willingly only to be denied. SHEWEARSMYRING stalked the pace from the rail through the turn, saved ground cutting the corner and finished
well in a good effort. DANCE MY WAY flashed speed to lead the field into the turn and weakened coming home. HOLY SKULL prominently placed three
wide within striking distance of the leaders midway on the tun and lacked a closing response. SISTER CODE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MAGIC PALACE well placed, split horses two wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run to win going away under a brisk hand
ride. CATCHAFALLNSTAR trailed into the far turn, swung wide, circled her field and finished second best. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD forwardly place two
then three wide, lacked racing room into the far turn, clipped heels past the three furlong marker, lacked racing room at the head of the lane, altered course
to the four path then improved position late. FULL TIME STRUTIN pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the
stretch and weakened late. HIGH FASHION LADY failed to menace. LADY GIULIANA stalked the pace five then three wide, offered a strong bid on the
second turn, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. DONNA LIRICA away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the far turn then weakened.
MO RISSA close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide on the second turn then faltered.

Footnotes
WHO DA BOSS broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened at will through the stretch under a hand ride to win as much the best. ROMANIAN
PRINCE bore in at the start bumping SGT YORK, settled in a stalking position, had a mild rally two wide into the stretch and finished clear for second. BLUE
NOMORE unhurried early, found his best stride late in the four path. SGT YORK was bounced around between rivals at the start, pinched back then passed
tiring rivals through the stretch in the five path. GRAY TORMENTOR was no factor. CANNON MAN failed to menace. NOAH MY BABY chased the winner
two wide from the four path and stopped in the stretch. ROLLIN MY WAY reared while loading unseating his rider, ran off briefly, settled mid pack and had
no response. GOLDSTRIKER bore out at the start bumping SGT RORK and offered little.
