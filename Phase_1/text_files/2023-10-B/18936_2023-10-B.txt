Footnotes
RED WINE TIME was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, made a strong move through the far turn, circled the field six wide under
strong handling and bled per stewards. DIA DE SOL showed good early foot, drifted through the stretch run to race wide and kept on to the wire. VIKING
QUEEN stalked the top pair down the backstretch, was forced to alter out in the stretch to race from the far outside and kept on to the wire. Jockey of Viking
Queen claimed objection against Dia de Sol for interference in the stretch and stewards ruled no change. SUIKO tracked the early leader from the inside
and weakened through the drive. SWEET TALIA stalked the pace between rivals down the backstretch, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no
late rally. HELEONORTIZ raced five wide into the first turn, raced off the early going, was near the rail past the quarter pole and had no late response.
BELLE BREZING dropped back early on, was six deep into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
ALMOND CIDER vied for the early lead, dug in between rivals and proved best under strong handling. WILD TIME dropped back off the early pace, moved
up four wide around the far turn and closed in well late racing five deep in the drive. ONEHANDSOMEDUDE vied three deep from the outside of foes, drifted
in the stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. OUR RONNY ALAN was allowed to settle early, saved ground and finished willingly to the wire. BET HE'S
READY vied for the early lead near the rail and weakened through the stretch run. STELLWAGEN BANKER void of early speed, raced along the inside
around the far turn and had no final winning bid. RUNAWAY ROAD race mid pack early on, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally.
MR. COWBOY BRADLEY stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn and faded in the drive. SILVER R void of early
speed while being coaxed along, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. FAST RIDE dropped back early and failed to respond.

MIRACLE SILVER was allowed to settle early, raced three wide near the three eighths pole, challenged four wide into the upper stretch and just missed in a
game effort. MISTER WINSTON showed good early foot to have a clear early lead, angled off the inside near the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
MOUNT TRAVERS settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and raced even with no closing run. CAMP PENDLETON stalked
the pace, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole and weakened in the drive. CHRIS AND DAVE was forwardly placed to lay up close and faded along
the rail. ROYAL COUP raced at the back of the pack early and failed to respond.

pace, raced three to four deep and had no final winning bid. CITI CREEK was allowed to settle early on, raced near the rail around the far turn and lacked a
bid. DAVID'S PROSPEC set a pressured early pace from the inside and faded. TYLER TIME dropped back early and failed to respond.

SITTIN ON GO was unhurried early on, moved up from the inside, into the far turn, angled out near the five sixteenths pole and finished gamely to get up
under strong handling. PASSAGE OF LINES rated along under a hold early, moved up three wide near the quarter pole to challenge and kept on gamely to
the wire. WINTER'S GHOST tracked the early leader near the inside, raced two deep between in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. PRACTICAL
WAY showed good early speed and weakened in the stretch run. MACHEN'S RIDGE was allowed to settle early, raced four to five wide and lacked a bid.
HOP AND SCOTCH dropped back to race mid pack early, saved ground and never threatened. GUILLAUME trailed early on, was four wide around the far
turn and never was a factor.
