but repelled those bids and drew clear off the turn, then remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. SIR LUMPALOT was settled back early on the
inside, saved ground on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn, then angled back in leaving the furlong marker and finished well on the inside to
gain the place award. LIGHTNING LAD was off a step slow, settled back and three wide into the first turn, then advanced three wide on the far turn, swung
out six wide leaving the turn and rallied, out-kicked for the place award. CORONOVA was keen early three wide under a hard hold, then was coaxed along
on the far turn and came four wide into the lane but flattened out. BALLYHOO PRINCE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace and then went up to press
the pace two wide by the half mile marker, then made a bid to vie for command between rivals nearing the quarter pole, but weakened in the drive.

TIRICO was off a step slow and then bumped at the start, shifted to the outside and chased the early pace five wide, made a four wide move on the turn to
be clear off the turn and droop towards the inside, then was kept to right handed crop to remain clear to the wire. XCELLENT MEN showed good speed
three wide while being tough to handle, was lugging out on the turn and the rider had to check while dropping back four to five wide, then when straightened
off the turn closed full of run despite being on the left lead the final sixteenth. NAPOLEON'S WAR vied for the early lead on the inside, then shook clear, but
was headed leaving the five sixteenths and weakened in the drive, bested rest. TAP YOUR HEART tracked the early pace in between rivals, then made a
two wide bid on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn but came up empty. CLANCY FANCY chased the early pace four wide, then was forced five
to six wide on turn by XCELLENT MAN and weakened. TRUSTME IAMADOCTOR hopped at the start and was not a factor.

between rivals from the quarter pole to the sixteenth marker and had a mild late kick. PUTIN ONLINE tracked the pace on the inside and had no late kick

Footnotes
NORTH HIGHLAND was rated early, made a three wide move on the turn to vie for command outside the trio, took over off the turn and kicked clear leaving
the quarter pole, then was kept to crop urging to prove best. SUPER ACCELERATE was well placed on the inside, eased out leaving the five sixteenths to
make a bid, came four wide off the turn and finished willingly but could not get to the winner while second best. THUNDERIAN was allowed to settle early,
saved ground on the far turn, angled out in the lane and had a late rally but needed more. NO EASY DAYS stalked the pace two wide, made a bid to vie for
command between rivals by the half mile marker, then shifted out four wide leaving the turn and faded the final furlong. AMPERSAND was off slowly, then
pulled his way towards the front four wide, came five wide off the turn and faded. HAY CHIEF was outrun early, came three wide into the lane, angled out in
the lane and had a mild late rally. CLOUD MUSIC was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then was headed by the half mile marker and gave way
the final quarter of a mile. CRITICAL THREAT was settled three wide and tired. STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the start, after reviewing the replays the
race was left as is.

Footnotes
KING COVEE was rated three to four wide, made a quick three wide move on the far turn and opened up off the turn while dropping to the inside, then was
kept to mild right handed crop to prove much the best. SWING SAMMY was rated two to three wide, made a three wide move following the winner on the
turn, but proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. HOLEY MOLEY was bumped at the start, well placed along the inside, was blocked
on the turn, shifted out to get by the tiring pace setters and came two wide off the turn but lacked a late rally while staying on for the show award. BAD
LINEAGE was bumped hard at the start, settled back early to trail, made a four wide advance on the far turn, then lacked a late rally while missing the show
award. LUNAR DASH was allowed to settle on the inside, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. HERE'S LIAM was reserved early and failed to
menace. THE BIG ENCHILADA set the early pace while clear, then was pressured and dueled for the lead on the inside down the backstretch, then
weakened. AFFAMATO was reserved early and failed to respond. GOLDEN SALUTE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked the pace two wide
and tired after six furlongs. FAZZANI pressed the early pace three wide, then went up to duel for command on the backstretch, then stopped after six
furlongs.

Footnotes
ROANAN GODDESS was well rated early, saved ground on the turn, waited for room by the quarter pole, then cut the corner and made a inside bid leaving
the turn, then drew away in the furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. KISSEDBYANANGEL stalked the early pace three wide, then went up to vie
for command on the outside of the trio, made a three wide bid off the turn but proved to be no match for the winner in the final furlong, clearly second best.
LOW SOCIETY was settled early, advanced three wide and made a four wide bid off the turn but flattened out, bested rest. FEELIN SO LUCKY was hard
held early, saved ground on the turn and cut the corner leaving the turn and improved position late. FAINOR'S FILETS was bumped at the start, settled
back early, three wide into the lane, angled out in the lane and passed the tiring rivals. TRUE SUNSHINE showed good speed early to set the early pace,
then vied for the lead nearing the quarter pole and weakened. CHUBLIN prompted the pace two wide, then went up to vie for command between rivals
nearing the quarter pole and weakened. MOMMA'S LINO chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. FOREST FUEL stumbled at the start, then
chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
CRISPER was reserved early, advanced three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up in time, driving.
LANDBISCUIT was allowed to settle early, advanced two wide on the far turn, swung out four wide for aim leaving the turn, made a bid and got the lead
nearing the sixteenth pole but was denied late to just miss. DEAR SANTA was rated early, advanced in hand on the turn, made a two wide biid off the turn
and gained a short lead leaving the furlong marker but flattened out, bested rest. CODE NAME was three wide into the first turn while clear and setting a
fast pace, then shifted to the inside and was headed by the furlong marker and weakened, stayed on for the last spot in the superfecta. MR MATUSCHEK
was reserved early, three wide by the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. PAVONI passed the tiring rivals. BENNY HAVENS was
settled early, two wide on the far turn and had no rally. IMAGINE IT ALL was settled on the inside and dropped back. THE HAPPY GIANT had no speed and
failed to menace. HERE COMES BILLY was not a factor.

Footnotes
EYES ELEVEN was allowed to settle early, swung out seven wide leaving the turn by the quarter pole, closed well, then shifted in late and exchanged
bumps with MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE while getting up to prove best, driving. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE broke outwardly at the start bumping a foe, then
settled on the inside, saved ground on the turn, tipped two wide off the turn and split rivals leaving the quarter pole, then angled out for racing room and
closed well, then exchanged bumps with the winner late and just missed. SUGAR HOOF pressed the pace on the inside, then steadied slightly by the nine
sixteenths, remained well placed on the inside on the turn, made a inside bid and got through leaving the quarter pole and drew clear by the furlong marker
but was caught late. TIZAWINNER was off slowly, reserved early, then advanced on the inside on the turn, was in tight by the quarter pole and then was
bumped nearing the furlong marker and got through but needed more late, bested rest. GINO THINKABOUTIT stalked the pace three wide, made a two to
three wide bid on the turn, came four wide off the turn and weakened. SIMON'S CHOICE tracked the pace four wide and came five wide off the turn and
was empty. ERIC'S GIFT set a pressured pace two wide, then shook clear and dropped to the inside on the turn, then was two wide off the turn and bumped
by the three sixteenths and gave way. BOWIE MUN was bumped at the start, reserved early, then advanced and shifted out and was six wide leaving the
turn and then was empty. The rider on number two claimed foul against the number six the winner for interference nearing the wire, after the STEWARDS
reviewed the replays the race was left as is and the OBJECTION was disallowed.
