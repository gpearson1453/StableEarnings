Footnotes
MADNESS rated in the four path, tipped to the two path and was cued going into the turn, swung out to the seven path while rallying entering the stretch,
swept to the lead under a drive nearing the final sixteenth, and was wrapped up late. ON THE DOT stalked in the four path, was roused to bid midway
around the turn, kicked away from inner foes from the four path in upper stretch, but was caught around the sixteenth by a surging outer foe to place.
ERNESTINA chased in the three path, was under coaxing in the four path early around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept
on for show. MISS CASSIDY trailed from the three path into the turn, and made no impact from the four path down the lane. PROBLEMATICA led from the
two path into the turn, was roused when challenged by an outer pair early around the turn, but lost the lead, and faded in the stretch. ARDUOUS threw her
head at the start, vied for the lead in the three path, stuck a head in front passing the quarter, but weakened down the lane. TUNGARA tracked from the rail
but was empty entering the lane. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TUNGARA AGAINST THE RIDER OF PROBLEMATICA WAS
DISALLOWED.

LINCOLN PARK pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole and powered clear under moderate urging. CART GIRL SAM set the pace
along the rail, was no match for the winner in the lane but kept on to hold the place. GET FROSTY tracked the pace three wide and was one-paced through
the lane to hold the show. HERE'S THE KICKER chased the pace inside and finished evenly. NOBATIA was in range inside, steadied while racing
awkwardly nearing the half-mile pole, raced two wide around the turn and never threatened. GRAND LADY MO failed to menace while racing three wide.
WARDA played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
HARRY'S ONTHEFLY pressed in the three path, bid going into the turn, dueled with an inner foe around the turn and in upper stretch, inched ahead of that
foe while drifting into the two path passing the eighth pole, and held off an outer foe late under a drive. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS chased in the three path,
was driven in the two path around the turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. ROLLING ON set the pace in the two path,
was challenged by the outer eventual winner into the turn, dueled with that foe along the inside up to the eighth pole, began to fade late, but just held on to
show. BELLA FUTURE stalked in the two path, was coaxed in the four path early into the turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, but was one paced
to just miss minor placings. SKIPPERINI got brushed by an outer foe at the start, rated inside, tipped out to the five path and was cued early into the turn,
but did not factor from the seven path in the stretch. STERLING HARMONY broke in and bumped with foes on both sides at the start, trailed in the three
path, shifted to the rail around the turn, but did not threaten. EXCHANGE DAY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but
never menaced.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS chased in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, and stayed on down
the center to get up on the wire. ATOMICALLY stalked in the five path, was roused from the four path into the turn, kept on from the five path into the
stretch, led passing the sixteenth, but was nailed at the wire by an outer foe to place. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC prompted the pace in the two path, lost ground
and was under a ride along the rail rounding the turn, angled out to the six path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. MISS UCRANIA bumped
with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the six path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, but made no impact from the four path in the
stretch. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU set the pace in the four path, was roused in the two path early around the turn, under right handed urging turning into the
lane, but yielded in the final furlong. CAMI RUNNER trailed from the rail into the stretch and did not factor. SEDUCTION rated out in the seven path into the
turn and never threatened. SILVIA V'S HEROES bumped with an inner foe at the start, was up close early but dropped off the pace in the second quarter
along the inside, and never menaced.

bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace and finished willingly to be clearly second best. HE'S A COMMISIONER was bumped at the start, saved
ground well back and was along for the show. DOLLAR LIBERTY hit the starting gate, chased the pace four wide and had no response. REAL MACHO was
bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. EXCLUSIVE DANCER was outrun while racing four wide.
BEE A SKY BEAM had only brief speed. ICE MOON bumped a foe at the start, dropped far back and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
TODO FINO (CHI) set the pace in the two path, was put to ride entering the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and inched clear under a
drive. REAL TALK pressed the winner in the three path, was floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and chased on to hold place. KHOZEIRESS
tracked in the five path, was roused into the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. AVANT GLORY chased in
the three path, was coaxed along the inside around the turn, but flattened from the two path in the stretch. GANGLY rated in the two path, was coaxed along
the inside into the turn, floated out around the turn and was in the six path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. CATTIN trailed from the rail, had to
check nearing the half, was ridden in the four path around the turn, and did not threaten from the seven path in the stretch. ZYDECEAUX prompted the pace
in the four path, but faded in the stretch.
