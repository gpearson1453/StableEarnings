Footnotes
JUBILANT JOANIE set a clear pace early on, showed the way from an outer bidder around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and held sway safely while
hanging on her left lead. IMPERATOR FURIOSA broke a bit outwardly, tracked four wide, gained into the turn to press the leader passing the three furlong
pole, was turned away by that one in upper stretch, yet kept on to remain well clear of the rest. DERBY WIFE broke a step slow, recovered to stalk along the
inside, but failed to keep pace with the top pair while chasing around the turn, yet held show thereafter. LADY FREE WILL saved ground off of the pace,
improved inside of faltering foes at the five sixteenths pole before tipping two wide nearing the lane, then ran on between horses but lacked a bid. ALTER
THE STARS laid off of the pace in the three path, pursued four wide around the turn, then ran on mildly but failed to menace. DOODLE DOO chased two
wide and between horses, took light contact from an outer rival while put to tight quarters at the half mile pole, failed to sustain position into the turn, then
gave way before being subtly shuffled behind a rival turning for home. VELOCHEETAH stalked three wide and between horses, brushed an inner foe at the
half mile pole then weakened among foes turning for home. FRACING ALLSTAR broke a step slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SOLIDIFY saved ground off of the pace, gained turning for home, slipped through inside of the leader to offer a rail bid passing the furlong pole, then edged
ahead with a sixteenth to go. TEE BURNS took light contact from an inner rival at the start, set the pace inside of a sternly pressing foe around the turn,
shook clear in the two path entering the lane, but met an inner challenge at the furlong grounds, got bested a sixteenth late then lasted for place. PURE
PANIC vied two wide, yielded in the three path entering the lane, sustained a chase while getting outkicked for show by an inner rival at the furlong grounds
and kept on to maintain show. BLUE KENTUCKY brushed an outer rival at the start, chased three wide, pursued four wide into the turn, moved to the three
path around the turn, ran on while tipping to the four path in the final furlong but needed more to reach show. LYKAN laid off of the pace in the three path,
entered the lane in the five path and ran on willingly but failed to menace. COUTH stalked along the inside, moved outside of the top pair to press entering
the turn, but chased turning for home, faded in the four path entering the lane and weakened between horses. SLAM DUNK SERMON lacked speed in the
four to six path and made little impact. FRANZ JOSEF stumbled severely at the start and lagged behind throughout.

Footnotes
I FEEL THE NEED broke slowly, raced at the rear along along the inside, advanced inside of rivals approaching the far turn, saved ground while creeping
closer around that bend, bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch and drove clear passing the furlong pole. EAST SHORE pursued from midpack three wide,
ranged up to the leaders four wide entering the lane, but shifted inwardly and bumped MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM into an inner rival at the furlong grounds,
yet ran on to secure place. WINDY BAY set the pace in the three to two path around the far turn, showed the way just off the fence around the far turn, met
an inner challenge in upper stretch, got headed by that one before taking firm contact from an outer foe to his hind quarters passing the furlong pole, shifted
ground a touch outwardly as a result, then lost place to an outer bidder a sixteenth late. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM tracked in the three to four path, moved
to press the leader into the far turn, chased in the three path and between horses entering the lane, but was bumped and forced inwardly by an outer rival at
the furlong pole firmly knocking her into an inner rival's hind quarters, checked hard in the aftermath and ran on for a minor share. STEEL RACER pursued
from midpack along the inside, advanced approaching the far turn to gain show with five sixteenths to go, but chased the main group entering the lane and
flattened out. ROSARIO'S PRAYER lacked speed in the two to four paths and moved up. EFFICACIOUS broke outwardly, stalked three wide into the turn,
pressed the leader from the three path entering the backstretch but wilted between horses around the far turn. FLORIS prompted along the inside while in
the two path into the first turn, backed off to stalk around that bend, but weakened between horses approaching the far turn. CATHERINE BLAZE laid off of
the pace in the two to three path, lacked a response to urging in the four path with nine sixteenths to go and was done early. THE RIDER OF
MIDNINGHTCANDYSTORM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF EAST SHORE FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH; FOLLOWING THE
OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE SAME INFRACTION, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
THESTRAL bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide, dueled around the far turn, kicked clear entering the lane and lasted safely while
begininng to tire. MUSTANG LADY laid off of the pace two wide, floated to the four path into the far turn, then rallied on her left lead to gain place at the
sixteenth pole. WITS AND WAGERS laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced two wide and between horses entering the lane and ran on along the
inside for a minor share. SANDRA D bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, dueled with the eventual winner around the far
turn, proved no match nearing the lane and weakened between horses. C C CRUISE CONTROL broke a bit outwardly, pursued from midpack two wide,
lacked a response to urging in the three path around the far turn and yielded between horses turning for home. MARSHSIDE MAMA broke slowly, lagged
behind and never got involved. SPICY ITALIAN tracked along the inside, chased into the far turn and weakened. SUCH SOUNDS broke a bit out, stalked
three wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
AIR OF DEFIANCE dueled three wide into the turn, led in the five path entering the lane and kicked away through the final furlong. NYQUIST FREQUENCY
dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, fought on gamely in the three path while headed by an outer counterpart entering the lane, but proved no match
for that one at the furlong grounds and remained well clear of show. RIVETAGE tracked four wide, entered the lane in the six path, stayed on to vie for show
with an inner rival in the final furlong and prevailed. POPWEISER raced forwardly two wide and between horses, shifted to the four path in upper stretch,
vied with an outer rival for show in the final furlong but was bested. YELL COUNTY stalked along the inside and gave way. JUSTIFREAK took contact from
an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses while hanging on
his left lead. ANTHEM KING raced off of the pace while hung in the five to six path around the turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and gave way.
IT'SMYLUCKYTIME lacked speed in the three path and failed to factor. SO SMOOTH bumped an inner rival at the start, then steadied out of tight quarters
between horses leaving the chute, trailed in the two to three path and made little impact. SPECIAL ELEMENT sparred for the lead two wide and between a
pair of foes, but yielded entering the lane and weakened on his left lead. NULLIFY chased three wide and between horses and faded at the three furlong
pole. BLUE LINE stumbled soon after the start then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
SKRATCH KAT broke slowly, trailed along the inside, gained inside of foes approaching the far turn, stalked before taking aim three wide and between
horses in upper stretch, grinded away on her left lead, bid while changing over at the furlong grounds, wrestled an advantage entering the final sixteenth and
held from an outer rival thereafter. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked the embattled leading pair from the two to three path
around the far turn, pressed under urging three wide and between horses around the far turn, got floated four wide entering the lane, yet sustained a
grinding charge to bid at the furlong grounds, vied into the final sixteenth, but was denied by an inner vying counterpart in the late stages. JAG WARRIOR
took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, dueled inside of a rival around both turns, gamely sustained the battle through as a pair of outer rivals
joined the fray at the furlong grounds, but was headed nearing the sixteenth pole then narrowly saved show. PUNCHBOWL bumped an inner rival at the
start, dueled for the lead with an inner rival while remaining a path away from that one around the first turn, continued to spar while taking the far turn in the
two path, sustained the battle between horses entering the final furlong, but yielded to outer bidders then hung late and failed to reach show. INSIGNIA
pursued from midpack along the inside, chased two wide and between horses approaching the far turn, remained under urging around the far turn, steadied
out of tight quarters to trail at the five sixteenths pole and was outrun thereafter. MUSIC STREET laid off of the pace two wide, trailed briefly before inching
closer four wide around the far turn, but was floated five wide entering the lane and gave way. THE RIDER OF INSIGNIA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF SKRATCH KAT FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

BEACH WALKN saved ground off of the pace, narrowed the gap on the main group in midstretch, shifted out and split foes in the four path at the sixteenth
pole to bid between horses in the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. HOLA GATA leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, saved ground in midpack,
fanned out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to bid for the lead in the final sixteenth but was outfinished by an inner bidder late. AROUND THE SUN
set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of bidders around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage while dueling into the final sixteenth,
but was bested by a pair of outer bidders in the shadow of the wire. OUR DOTSIE pressed two wide, bid in the three path along with an outer rival around
the far turn, dueled and vied through midstretch, then was outkicked by an outer pair in the final sixteenth and missed show. EMPIRICAL VIEW laid close up
along the inside, steadied repeatedly while rank around the first turn, checked once again passing the nine sixteenths pole, stalked around the far turn, took
aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch, but lacked the needed punch to offer a bid. HOLY FOLEY settled well back in the two path, then rallied willingly
and advanced between horses late to miss reaching a minor reward. CHARLEE O stalked in the four to three path around the first turn, bid outside of the
top pair and from the four path around the far turn, but failed to sustain vying position in upper stretch, then flopped back to his left lead and weakened
between horses at the furlong grounds. MINT EDITION tracked in the three to two path while keen under a snug hold between horses around the first turn,
pursued from the three path around the far turn before floating to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. CONDONE got rank while off of the pace
two w ide and between horses into and around the first turn, fanned to the six path entering upper stretch and failed to factor. YARBOROUGH took light
contact from an inner rival at the start, trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn and made little impact. JENNY LIND pursued from
midpack three wide, shifted out to the five path turning for home and gave way. LAKESIDE MUSIC was put to crowded quarters between horses at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three to for path, got forced to the six path around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
KNICKS STORM brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide and between horses, took first run at the leader to bid two wide turning for home,
assumed command at the three sixteenths pole and kicked away. CATALINA CRUSH brushed with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, tracked two and
between horses, tipped three wide into the turn and ran on to prove second best. RUNAWAY JOKE leaned inwardly at the start, raced off of the pace two
wide and between horses, then stayed on to edge show at the sixteenth pole. RUNNIN MUNNIN saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room nearing
the lane, shifted out five wide approaching midstretch and moved up. ARMY KID raced off of the pace three wide and lacked a bid between horses. TRACK
LIGHT prompted along the inside, chased into the turn, then raced uncomfortably along the inside through the lane. FINISH THE MISSION set the pace
along the inside, but was no match for an outer rival in upper stretch and weakened on his left lead. WE MISS ARLINGTON lunged inwardly at the start,
raced forwardly four wide and outside of rivals, but faded entering the lane in the six path and gave way on his left lead. KARLWITHANARL never got
involved. STERLING HONOR was outrun.
