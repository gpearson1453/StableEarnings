Footnotes
DAISY DANCER was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set a solid pace into the turn, was pressed along the bend by SAHARA SUE,
drifted to the two path into upper stretch, held a narrow lead over SAHARA SUE into mid-stretch, dug in under moderate urging into the final sixteenth and
lasted at the finish to prevail. SAHARA SUE was prominent in the early running and tracked the early pace outside of DAISY DANCER, advanced into the
turn and pressed the pace two wide to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch and kept pressure on DAISY DANCER to the furlong marker,
battled into deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner in the late stages, made a final surge and just missed for the win, while holding for
second. AUTISM SHINE was away a step slowly, recovered and chased the decent early pace, improved position two wide on the turn, came three wide
into the stretch, rallied in the late stages but could not catch the top two and held safely for third. JUST SERENE was a bit slow into stride early on and
trailed to the half-mile pole, improved position two wide on the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, offered a late bid in the final sixteenth but
could not reel in the top three. SILENT GIRL chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost ground along the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY DAD IS THIRSTY tracked the solid early pace from the inside, raced closest to the leading pair through the backstretch run, was roused into the far turn
and vied for the lead two wide at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, held SGT POWELL at bay into the final furlong and drew clear in
deep stretch. SGT POWELL broke alertly and was sent in the early running, was engaged by CALARI BLUECAT into the first turn and set a pressured pace
into the backstretch run, set solid fractions to the half-mile marker, was confronted by MY DAD IS THIRSTY approaching the quarter marker, lost the lead to
that rival into the stretch, fought back into the lane, could not make headway on MY DAD IS THIRSTY in the final stages, was outfinished and held for
second at the end. PORT O' CALL was off a bit slowly away from the start and was unhurried into the first turn, tracked the solid pace outside of rivals along
the backstretch run, loomed four wide at the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and remained within aim to the furlong grounds, could not muster the
needed response in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. WINTER SOLDIER was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide
path into the backstretch run while between rivals, was roused three wide into the far turn and came within aim nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into
the stretch and finished evenly. MISSING MAURICE settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run and improved position at the
half-mile marker, came two wide into the far turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch and weakened. CALARI
BLUECAT was hustled away from the start and contested the early pace with SGT POWELL into the first turn, pressed the solid pace through the
backstretch run, lost position into the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOOD LOVIN was asked for speed away from the start, engaged with LAST BABY in the early stages and disputed fast fractions with that rival into the turn,
dueled outside of LAST BABY to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch, drifted out a bit into the lane and raced in the three path into upper stretch,
drew clear approaching the furlong marker, drew off in the final stages and was hand ridden to the finish to be much the best in an impressive debut win.
REGAL REDWOOD was prominent away from the start and tracked the quick early pace, chased two wide along the turn, was put to urging four wide into
the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and ran on the late stages to secure the place. ELEGANT BOY chased from towards the rear to
begin, improved position three wide on the turn, was coaxed along six wide into the stretch, could not muster the needed response in the late stages but ran
on in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding safely at the finish for third. LAST BABY broke alertly and showed good early speed, was
engaged by GOOD LOVIN and dueled inside of that rival into the turn, disputed the fast pace from rail heading to the quarter marker, could not keep pace
with GOOD LOVIN into the stretch, faded in the final stages and was outfinished for third. COACH RANDY B raced close to the quick early pace, came in a
bit tight entering the turn and lost position heading to the quarter marker, gave chase from the inside into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.
EFFORT bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up in the early running and tracked outside of rivals into the turn, improved position three wide
heading to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch, could not keep pace approaching the furlong marker and tired. EMBERS OF GOLD
attempted to wheel at the start, spotted the field in the early running and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
LESSONS OF AUTISM was away in good order, took back off of the fast pace and settled in the early stages, raced outside of rivals into the turn and came
four wide to the quarter marker, was roused five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds while trailing, closed with a rush into the final
sixteenth, came within aim in deep stretch and was up on the wire to prevail in a blanket finish. MOB BOSS was asked for early speed away from the gate,
assumed command and set a fast early pace into the turn, dictated terms along the bend while carving out quick fractions, drew to a clear lead into the
stretch, was kept to task into deep stretch while maintaining a clear lead, felt pressure in the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win, while just
holding for second in a game runner-up effort. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL tracked the fast early pace outside of rivals, improved position three wide along the
turn, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth, vied between rivals in the final yards and just missed for the win and
place, while clear of the rest for the show. BOSS OF THEMOSS tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, advanced three wide along the turn,
maintained that three wide path into the stretch, lost a bit of ground at the furlong pole, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was
outkicked. HAY JUAN rushed up in the early running and pressed the fast pace from the inside, kept close attendance to MOB BOSS along the turn while
pressing from the rail, tipped two wide into the stretch and lost position heading to the furlong marker, lacked a late response and faded. GALOPIN
GOURMET chased the fast early pace from the inside, gained ground along the turn, swung three wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker
and did not threaten.

Footnotes
SUPERMAZEL never far back early on, tracked the fast pace two wide into the backstretch run, made a mild gain at the half-mile pole, was coaxed along
four wide along the far turn and loomed approaching the quarter marker, took a narrow lead from CONUNDRUM into upper stretch, battled with that rival
into the furlong grounds, continued to battle outside of CONUNDRUM into the final sixteenth, shook free in the final stages and edged away in the end to
determinedly prevail. CONUNDRUM was off a step slowly away from the start, settled along the inside into the first turn and tracked the fast pace into the
backstretch run, gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, continued that gain while saving ground into the far turn, angled three wide leaving the
quarter marker and took a brief lead approaching the top of the stretch, lost the lead to SUPERMAZEL into upper stretch and battled with that rival to the
furlong grounds, gamely battled into the final sixteenth, relented in the final stages and was outfinished in deep stretch, while well clear of the rest for
second. VANTAGE POINT was sent leaving the break, engaged with PLAYING HARDBALL into the first turn and contested fast fractions with that rival into
the backstretch run, carved out quick fractions to the half-mile pole and dueled inside of PLAYING HARDBALL into the far turn, was overtaken into upper
stretch and chased to the furlong marker, faded in the stretch but stayed on and outfinished PLAYING HARDBALL for third in the late stages. PLAYING
HARDBALL broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, engaged with VANTAGE POINT into the first turn and disputed fast fractions with that rival
into the backstretch run, pressed outside of VANTAGE POINT into the far turn, raced three wide into the stretch, lost position heading to the furlong marker,
tired in the final stages and was outfinished for third. GALOPING CAT was allowed to settle, tracked the quick early pace from a two wide path along the
first turn, chased the fast pace through the backstretch run, was outrun into the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY broke out a step at the start, recovered and was prominent into the first turn, tracked the decent early pace from a two wide path
into the backstretch run, advanced approaching the half-mile pole and prompted the pace into the far turn, overtook GROWTH ENGINE and took command
heading to the quarter marker, responded to urging into upper stretch and extended the lead nearing the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final
sixteenth and drew away in the late stages to prevail. LOVE CANDY stalked the early pace outside of the leading pair, gained ground along the backstretch
run and was well positioned three wide heading into the far turn, chased I'MGONNABESOMEBODY into the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner
into deep stretch and was outkicked, while besting the rest. CELESTIAL MOON tracked the early pace four wide into the first turn, tucked in into the
backstretch run and tracked inside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, was well positioned approaching the second turn, chased two wide along the far
turn and came three wide into the stretch, lacked a response in the final furlong and held for third at the finish. GLORIOUS SPRING crowded DRUIDIC a bit
away from the start and settled three wide into the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run while not far back, gained ground three then
four wide nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages. DRUIDIC was crowded leaving the start and was a
bit slow into stride early on, settled in the two path into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the far turn
and did not threaten in the stretch. GROWTH ENGINE broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions along the first turn and
showed the way into the backstretch run, was prompted to the half-mile marker by I'MGONNABESOMEBODY and dueled with that rival into the far turn,
could not keep pace heading to the quarter pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PERFORMATIVE broke with the pack then backed off the developing speed duel, bided time through the turn, waited for, then took advantage of an
opening along the rail, responded when called upon near the three-sixteenths marker, took command and went on to win clear under intermittent urging.
DECIMATE broke well and was sent hard for the lead, outsprinted a horde of challengers to the turn, kept at bay a pair of challengers pressing the issue to
the outside, could not match strides with PERFORMATIVE when that foe slipped inside at the three sixteenths, but kept to task and held the place spot in a
good effort. OBVIOUS was three deep on the pace in the early stages, made a run at DECIMATE approaching the quarter pole but was rebuffed and unable
to pass that rival in the stretch, but was able to hold third. DR PESCADO raced near the rear of the field through the early stages despite urging from the
rider to stay close, made a three wide bid through the turn, kept on well but was not enough to crack the top three. ARTHUR SPOONER close up while five
wide early on, chased outside into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late response. DUMB LUCK broke in at the start then was
hustled forward, raced close up while three wide in the tracking group, chased two wide along the turn and lacked a late rally . WHATWASITHINKING broke
well and raced up on the early pace three deep, was still in contention at the top of the stretch despite still racing wide but dropped out before the furlong
marker. ZHIVAGO broke a bit behind the field then was rushed up into contention, was looking for space to make a run passing the quarter pole but had no
response when called upon near the three-sixteenths and was not a factor down the lane. BIG FASHION broke well then was unable to keep up with the
early pace, settled behind the speed through the turn, started to lose ground passing the three-eighths pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch. WART
was outrun after the break, raced wide through the turn and made no impact late.
