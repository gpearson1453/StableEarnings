Footnotes
PARTY AT GRANTS bumped with a rival at the start then was shut-off, bobbled while possibly clipping heels then was taken up, saved ground while settling
at the rear, was asked outside the three-eighths, squeezed through inside of the tiring pacesetter to make a bid around the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of
VANISHED under a left-handed crop in the stretch and gamely prevailed under strong urging. PARIS STYLE (FR) was taken in hand early, went four wide
on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging after being let out near the half-mile pole, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five
wide into upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss. VANISHED bobbled at the start then came outward, raced in the two
path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead in the two to three path on the far turn, dueled outside of the winner under a
right-handed crop in the stretch and was denied then lost the place at the wire. RAYYA VALENTINE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then
was brought back around and reloaded, traveled three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three to four path on the far
turn, battled outside under a drive while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, dropped back into the final turn and weakened while remaining on her
left lead to the finish. DREAMING OF MO wen to the front, showed the way on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, lost the advantage
outside the three-eighths, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired. MISS OUR HERO broke out at the start, went around the opening bend in the two
path, tugged hard at the bit under restraint and pulled closer early on the backstretch, was rated just off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the
far turn, dropped back behind a tiring foe near the five-sixteenths then shifted to the three path, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was just up in the last jump to prevail. CHILI FLAG (FR) just off the inside tracking from just
off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole tipping out, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in
under a drive under growing threat to the inside and was flashed the crop to left side drifting out slightly late when nailed on the line. AVENUE NIEL (IRE)
saved ground at the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. IMPLICATED

and narrow command with three-sixteenths to go, got collared near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. UNRULY JULIE two to three wide in

Footnotes
CROWDING OUT angled in while going to the front, made it tight on LADY SHYLOCK near the five-eighths, controlled the action while inside to the two
path on the turn, responded well under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, came under the crop near the furlong marker and was fully extended to last.
LADY SHYLOCK showed good speed from the inside, was taken back off the pace when crowded along the rail near the five-eighths, chased inside on the
turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner into the final furlong then made a bid under a right-handed crop, drifted out when switched to
a left-handed crop and given one pop inside the sixteenth-pole, was straightened then put under a strong hand-ride to the wire and just missed. JUST A
NYQUIST broke out at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and just got up for the
show. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH was coaxed along on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn and tired. SIMPLE SUGAR was urged early then
forwardly placed, chased three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. SWEET AS SUGAR bumped soundly with a rival at the start, moved up to track
the pace, chased in the two to three path on the turn and capitulated. SYNONYMOUS bumped soundly with a foe at the start, dropped well behind the rest
of the field, went three then four wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
KHADULLAH went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms while inside on the turn, responded well when put to a left-handed
crop in upper stretch, drifted out coming to the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop and held sway under strong urging. RUNNING
LUCKY was bumped soundly at the start, raced up close on the outside, chased in the two to three path on the turn, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the
stretch and willingly earned the place. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, chased inside to the
two path on the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. SEBA M broke out then bobbled and had the
rider lose his left iron briefly, angled in at the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and improved position with good
late energy. ONE WITHEVERYTHING was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. KING KHALI was bumped at the start then forced soundly into another foe, saved ground towards the rear and was no factor. MORQ broke in
and bumped with a rival, was urged along on the outside,went three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SMILE TAKES CHARGE broke near the
back of the field, raced off the pace under some urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to
respond.

FORT WASHINGTON three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch,
came inwards straightened away and dug in head to head between foes through the final furlong and gamely got up in the last jumps to prevail by a noggin.
JAMES ALOYSIUS just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch,
took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat from a pair through the final furlong and fought on gamely clinging to command until losing
the nod at the very end. EMARAATY (GB) coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn before tracking three wide, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive outside a pair through the final eighth and just missed at the finish.
DANCIN IN DA'NILE tracked along the inside and then two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild kick. NAPOLEONIC WAR saved ground just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper
stretch, was rallying along the inside using the path of the inner chute then lacked room suddenly at the eighth pole along the inside and was paused in
behind the leader, kept on to the finish and was outfinished in the late going. DAUNT just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. JAMIE DREAMS four then three wide through the first turn, chased four wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and had no kick. GREAT KING (FR) coaxed from the start, showed the
way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE
saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and came
up empty. Please note due to a timing error the three-quarters and one mile splits were unavailable.

three path, moved to the four path late on the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final
furlong, drifted in while gaining fast into the final sixteenth and got up under good handling to prevail. ROYAL SPIRIT bumped with a rival at the start, was
hustled to the lead, showed the way while saving ground, extended the advantage on the far turn, drew off under the crop in upper stretch, remained clear
into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. CYBER NINJA dropped back early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear in the
two path, was roused on the final turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved with late energy for the show. SWORE was
reserved while racing in the three path, came under urging on the final turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and also improved position. OMNI KING
floated five wide for most of the first turn then dropped to the four path, moved to the three path entering the stretch for the first time, was reserved in the
three path, came under encouragement on the final bend, spun four wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. GHOSTLYPRINCE broke
out at the start, was taken in hand before the first turn then rated on the inside, saved ground through the final turn, was asked while cutting the corner into
the stretch and lacked the needed kick. FATIMA'S BLESSING saved ground while reserved towards the back, was roused on the final turn, angled out in
upper stretch and failed to rally. CLASSIC CREATION was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, raced in the two path while rated just off the pace
through the opening two turns, saved ground while given his cue on the final turn and came up empty. HOLD THE SALSA hit the inside of the gate then
bumped with a foe at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, came out four wide entering the stretch for the first time, stalked the pace on the
outside in the three path, was asked in the two path on the final turn and also came up empty.
