Footnotes
ONE RICH KITTEN stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, moved to engage the leader at the top of the lane, dueled with the pacesetter down
the stretch, was bumped by that one several times and prevailed in a drive. MOBIL MEMORY raced up the fence to set a pressured early pace, shook off
the presser in the turn, was engaged at the quarter pole by the winner, dueled with that one through the lane while getting out, bumped the winner several
times in deep stretch, was out-finished late in a game effort. CANELA FINA rallied up the rail inside several rivals into the turn to be prominent turning for
home and failed to sustain the bid while best of the rest. MOST ADORABLE rushed up through the pack down the backside to be threatening from four wide
in the turn and finished evenly. SISSY'S MAY slow early to be at the rear of the field and showed late interest in the lane with a mild bid.
UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN went one-paced and failed to menace. SHE'S A BIG GIRL shuffled a bit at the start, angled eight wide down the backside
shortly away from the gate and was never a threat. MOTOWN HARBOR trailed most of the way and passed weaker rivals in the lane. CABARET FLEUR
flashed speed for a quarter mile to be on the pace and came up empty in the turn. BOLD NICKY raced three wide down the backstretch in mid-pack and
weakened having bled.

Footnotes
SOCIALBUTTERFLYTAM pressed the pace to the turn, rallied from between horses to take the lead turning for home and cleared off in the lane. KACHOW
raced off to a clear early lead along the fence, responded when challenged by rivals in the turn and kept on gamely through the lane to hold the place.
QUALIFICATA took an awkward step leaving the gate to be last in the field, rushed up four wide into the turn to loom boldly at the quarter pole and failed to
sustain the rally in the lane. KATERYNA trailed to the turn, angled six wide at the head of the lane and made a mild late bid. SHE'S WICKED chased the
leaders from five wide through the turn and failed to gain ground. BIG R. NAUFFAL raced prominently in the early going, dropped back along the fence into
the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
JOSH'N tracked the leaders into the turn from the fence, angled out three wide turning for home and made a steady advance to be clear late in the drive.
STARS N SPACE broke outward bumping rival at start, moved up to press the pace from two wide to the turn, took command to open a clear lead on the
bend, could not hold off the winner down the lane and finished willingly to be second best. MIXTER JENSEN showed early speed to set the pace from the
rail to the turn, was overtaken at the tree-eighths pole and kept on well to hold the show. IMA BELIEVER reserved off the early pace, cut the corner turning
for home and showed late interest in the lane. AWESOMELY INSPIRED prompted the pace from three wide through the turn and weakened in the stretch.
TEQUILA FLATS made a brief rally in the turn from between horses and failed to sustain the rally. MATTHEW'S PATRIOT rallied seven wide into the turn
and flattened out. RED COMET bumped at the start from the inside, ducked out to be wide down the backside and never menaced. DANCE MOVES was
never a threat.

Footnotes
KOSCIUSZKO broke alertly to set the pace from the gate, opened a clear advantage in the turn, shook off a bid from the runner-up in upper stretch and
drew off down the lane as much best. BROADWAY JONES stalked the leader into the turn from three wide, made a bid turning for home to loom up at the
top of the lane but could not go with the winner despite a good effort. MAXIMIZER prompted the early pace from the fence, angled out down the lane to be
three wide and kept on willingly. CALL WEST trailed in the early going, angled out to be six wide down the backstretch, circled the field turning for home to
be well wide in the lane and made a mild late rally. KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE raced up the rail to make a brief bid turning for home and flattened out. DUEL
FUEL was never a threat. POWER SONG prominently placed to be well positioned to the turn and gave way coming home.

Footnotes
BUCKEYE PRINCESS crowded at the start to be near the back of the field, circled four wide in the turn to mount a strong rally, closed well in the lane to
engage the leader in mid-stretch and drew off to the wire as much best. NEAR PERFECT stalked the pace through the turn from three wide, rallied well
down the lane to be up late for the place. ANCHORWOMAN sped off to the lead opening a clear advantage, responded when called upon turning for home
and weakened late in the stretch. IN TROUBLED WATERS well placed stalking the pace from three wide to the head of the lane and failed to gain ground.
DRIVEN FOR SUCCESS tracked the pace from the rail and lacked a late response. I'M LEGIT slow early to trail and showed late interest rallying along the
fence in the lane. SERGER chased the leaders while racing wide down the backstretch and failed to mount a rally. STEALTH MODE went evenly as a
non-threat. FACTISIMFLASHY prompted the pace from three wide to the head of the lane and stopped in the stretch. COSTUME JEWELRY was never a
factor.

MALIBU CLASSIC stalked the pace through the turn, rallied five wide at the head of the lane and wore his rivals down through the stretch to be up in time.
TIME HEIST tracked the pace from the fence, saved all the ground cutting the corner turning for home and finished willingly up the rail to just miss.
AMIGO'S AFFAIR sped up the fence to take the lead, kept a clear lead turning for home, dug-in gamely when challenged in the lane and couldn't last in
deep stretch. GEHRIG prompted the pace through the turn, loomed up at the head of the lane and flattened out in the stretch. K P SILVER BULLET tracked
the pace from five wide, was set to an early drive and failed to respond. LAZARUS PROJECT unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field and
mounted a mild late rally down the lane. MAKING ME CRAZY was well placed for a half mile and tired. NO COMMISSION was never a factor.

JOLIE RULER prompted the pace to the top of the lane, engaged the leader in upper stretch and prevailed in the stretch duel to the wire. LATER DAYS
broke alertly to set the pace, responded when challenged turning for home and was out-finished late in the lane. TEAM GOLD DIGGER trailed early,
exchanged bump with rival into turn, took up briefly, saved ground through the turn, angled out for the drive and closed well belatedly. SUPORB stalked the
leaders to be well placed at the quarter pole in striking distance and failed to gain in the stretch. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL reserved off the pace at the back
down the backside, exchanged bumps in the turn, angled four wide to rally in the turn and flattened out coming home. GRAN MAMIBELLA flashed brief
speed to be prominent early, dropped back in the turn and finished evenly.

Footnotes
KAT TRAX stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, angled out turning for home and wore down the pacesetter in a determined drive. DOLCE
MARIE sped to the lead to open a clear advantage on the turn, held a clear lead in mid-stretch and could not hold off the winner deep in the lane while
clearly second best. RATATAT tracked the pace from three wide in the turn, made a bid turning for home and failed to gain ground down the stretch.
MANDOLIN BREEZE reserved off the pace early, circled five wide in the turn and closed mildly in the lane. MY TWO JAKES prominently placed between
horses into the turn, lost position on the bend and came on again mildly up the fence. GHOSTLY REVIVAL never menaced at any time. HALO EFFECT
prompted the early pace and faded in the turn. DESDEMONA KAY broke a step slow and trailed as a non-factor.
