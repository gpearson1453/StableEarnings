Footnotes
SPOILER set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer DARK VECTOR into the turn, got narrowly headed turning for home, reclaimed a short
advantage entering the final sixteenth, leaned out and brushed his counterpart with thirty yards to go and prevailed via a head bob. DARK VECTOR
prompted two wide and between horses, vied and dueled with an inner foe into the turn, wrestled a small advantage with five sixteenths to go, but
relinquished the lead to his inner counterpart in midstretch, sustained the war through the final furlong, took light contact from from the aforementioned one
in the final sixteenth and missed the head bob at the wire. POWER SEEKER tracked along the inside, came under urging as the leading embattled pair
shook away turning for home, shifted outside of them at the furlong grounds, offered a late kick to close into their margin in the final sixteenth, had to shift
ground outwardly while ranging up to the leaders approaching the wire and ran out of ground. PENZANCE broke a step slow at the start, raced off of the
pace two wide, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and failed to threaten the top trio. B SUDD broke outwardly and bumped a rival causing his own
hind quarters to be knocked from underneath him, stalked outside of the top pair into the turn, chased under urging while failing to keep pace around the
bend and gave way through the final furlong. RUNNINGFORCASH leaned inwardly and bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path and
made little impact along the inside. FAST FALL took simultaneous bumps from rivals on both sides and was pinched back at the start, tracked four wide and
weakened turning for home.

SHOWDOWN KING set the pace inside of a vying rivals, kicked away from that one while entering the lane in the two path and held sway safely.
COLLIER'S TIME leaned inwardly at the start, raced off of the pace in the two to three path into the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, ran on
while hanging on his left lead to bid for place passing the furlong grounds, edged that position at the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the leader late.
FREE RAMBLING MAN tracked along the inside, chased around the turn, bid for place at the furlong ground, drifted slightly out leaving that station while
vying for that position with an outer bidder, but was outkicked at the sixteenth pole. TIME ANDBEYOND vied outside of the eventual winner, failed to keep
pace with that one while floating to the three path entering the lane and yielded between horses leaving the furlong grounds. HARBOUR BRIDGE broke half
a step slow, raced off of the pace in the four path, was floated to the five path by an inner rival with five sixteenths to go and was outrun from there. BE
THERE stalked outside of the leading pair into the turn, but faded between horses entering the lane.

OLGA ISABEL set the pace outside of a pressing foe, shifted inwardly and created cramped quarters for that one at the five sixteenths pole causing her to
check back, drew off in the three path entering the lane and held sway as her aforementioned counterpart gave chase. YOUR SO SILLEA pressed inside of
the leader into the turn, but was put to tight rail quarters by that one at the five sixteenths pole, checked and altered course over that one's hind heels in
order to retake aim outside, then only managed to chase through the lane while proving second best. BE LIKE WATER laid off of the pace two wide, shifted
to the five path entering upper stretch and failed to threaten. BHOMA chased along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
THORPEDO ANNA settled off of the pace, launched a four wide gain into the turn, sustained progress to boldly bid outside of the leading pair and from the
five path entering the lane, swept past approaching midstretch and drew off under moderate urging. UP ON THE EDGE was sent to spar for the lead with a
pair of outer rivals, dueled inside of only a single foe while shifting off of the inside turning for home, but offered little resistance to an outer foe's challenge in
upper stretch and held place through the final furlong. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA vied three wide, but was no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch, kept on
in hopes of vying for place in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. QUEEN LEXI broke slowly and steadied via a strong left handed rein at the start, raced
at the rear along the inside, improved position entering the lane before tipping three wide and between horses, then ran on while hanging on her let lead to
gain a minor placing. KENTUCKYTERMINATOR brushed with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased in the two path around the turn,
gained four from an inner rival in upper stretch but was caught at the wire. STEPHANIESWARRIOR brushed with an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear
two wide, then moved up between horses in the final furlong. GUEST OF HONOR faltered out of uncomfortable quarters between horses with eleven
sixteenths to go, raced far back in the three path into the turn, shifted to the five path and between horses in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CLASSY'N
CONNECTED tracked three wide and gave way around the turn. FLUID broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, encountered traffic before altering at the
three sixteenths pole and came up empty. LOU ANNA lost position while subtly being shuffled back at the eleven sixteenths pole, came under urging far
back in the five path nearing the turn, entered the lane in the seven path and failed to factor. CHIQUITA REINA dueled for the lead two wide and between
horses, but weakened passing the three furlong pole and caved. JOCELYN chased two wide and between horses and weakened around the turn.

EXCELLENT QUESTION saved ground off of the pace, picked up stride entering the lane, tipped out in upper stretch, angled five wide and outside of the
leading group at the furlong grounds, then surged late and reeled in the leaders at the wire. MIRARI tracked two to three wide, got floated four wide turning
for home, pursued on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over to produce a bid at the furlong grounds, dueled and wrestled a narrow advantage inside
the final sixteenth, but got nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. LADY EMILY KATHRYN stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair turning for
home, bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong as an outer rival bid, sparred with that one into the final sixteenth but was bested late. JUNGLE CAT
tracked along the inside, pursued from just off of the rail turning for home, shifted back inwardly to take rail aim in midstretch, but lacked a kick through a
narrow seam leaving the furlong grounds, then slipped through while getting outkicked for show a sixteenth from home. RED RIVER MAGIC set the pace
along the inside, vied with an outer prompter around the far turn, got headed by an outer bidder in midstretch and yielded between horses. CALL ME TONI
laid unhurried three wide, entered the lane in the four path and ran on mildly. MUCHO MACHO CHICK pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch. LADY DYNAMO pursued from midpack three to four wide, chased in the three path around the far turn and
gave way. SILENT REVENGE lacked speed along the inside, was shuffled behind a tiring rival around the far turn and made little impact. SKIP TO THE
BEAT (IRE) leaned into the inner part of the gate and was off slow, trailed, went three to four wide around the far turn and was outrun. MON DIEU raced off
of the pace two wide and faded around the far turn. LADY TREMAINE broke slow and never got involved two wide.

MENA stalked in the three path, bid outside of the leader around the far turn, took over with a quarter mile to go and drew off under a drive. ULTIMATE
STRIKE took brushes from rivals on either side approaching the first turn, tugged clear in the three to two path around that bend, met an outer challenge into
the far turn, proved no match with a quarter mile to go and lasted for place. MOR JAZZ pursued from midpack in the four path, gained in the five path
approaching the far turn, claimed show in the three path turning for home, ran on to bid for place in the final sixteenth but hung. BRILLIANT MAN steadied
when bumped and crowded between rivals soon after the start, lacked speed two wide and stayed on between horses in the final furlong. ASPIRING
COMEDIAN was off a step slow, took light contact from an outer rival and steadied at the start, lacked speed along the inside, advanced down the
backstretch, shifted outwardly entering the lane and flattened out. THE RUSH IS ON laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, chased from
midpack around the far turn, floated to the five path entering the lane and gave way on his left lead. COMMISSIONER OSCAR leaned in at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside, yielded position between horses approaching the far turn, yet subtly regained stride while swinging to the six path
entering the lane but failed to menace. MASTER OF THE NITE brushed with an outer rival approaching the first turn, stalked along the inside, faded around
the far turn and was eased up through the final furlong. LEAD FOOT was outrun in the three path. METRONOME tracked in the four path, weakened around
the far turn and was eased through the final furlong. MAGICAL MONARCH was off a step slow and steadied at the start, was hung in the five path while off
of the pace, weakened entering the lane and was eased thereafter. PRINCE IS MY BOY brushed with an inner rival before checking back out of tight
quarters between horses into the first turn, tracked along the inside, but was done early and eased turning for home.

BLUE EYED GEORGE stalked along the inside, took aim four wide in upper stretch, bid passing the furlong grounds and edged past. PLEASE ADVISE
tracked from midpack two to three wide, bid as an outer rival forced his hand into the far turn, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, led into the final
furlong as an outer foe challenged and was bested a sixteenth from home. FORTUNE SELLER took contact from an outer rival at the start, stalked two
wide, bid along with an outer pair at the three furlong pole, fought on while headed in upper stretch, but yielded to an outer pair entering the final furlong and
kept on to maintain show. GOOD BALI bobbled slightly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, was outmoved to the rear entering the far turn, yet stayed
on in midstretch, split foes two wide at the sixteenth pole and gained a minor share. TOUGH LITTLE NUT fanned outside of troubled rivals while towards the
rear around the first turn, settled five wide, quickly gained outside of foes approaching the far turn, sustained progress to vie outside of a trio of rivals turning
for home, but yielded while flattening out entering the lane. BAYTOWN PARFAIT pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room around the
far turn, tipped to the three path and between horses in upper stretch, chased among foes into the final furlong, but drifted outwardly entering the final
sixteenth and gradually gave way. MISSION READY laid off of the pace four to three wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, leaned inwardly in midstretch,
but steadied when an inner rival drifted across his path at the sixteenth pole. COPPER MISSILE raced at the rear along the inside, improved four wide and
between horses entering the far turn, but failed to menace among foes in the final furlong. SAVE THE KING leaned inwardly and bumped a rival at the start,
pursued from midpack three wide, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch ad failed to factor among foes.
FAMILY FACTOR broke a bit outwardly, set the pace along the inside, met a trio of bids around the far turn and weakened in upper stretch. CODE OMAHA
was keen between horses early on, drifted outwardly entering the first turn, settled in midpack two wide and between horses, retreated to the rear into the
far turn and made little impact. LEGAL TITAN was keen among foes early on, steadied hard when an inner rival drifted across his path into the first urn,
settled off of the pace in the three to two path, improved in the five path and outside of rivals into the far turn, but tired entering the lane.

Footnotes
ROCKETEER prompted along the inside, stalked the leader approaching the turn, bid for the lead outside of that one in the three path while well in hand at
the three furlong pole, then drove clear in upper stretch. D DAY SKY leaned in at the start, stalked three wide, moved forward outside of the bidding
eventual winner to prompt the pace from the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane and edged place from an inner rival at the
furlong grounds. WARP NINE took a brush from an outer rival while along the fence at the eleven sixteenths pole, settled along the inside, improved
entering the lane, and ran on in the two path to gain show late. WORLD FAIR set the pace two wide, cleared and crossed over into the turn, but was headed
by an outer bidder turning for home and faded. CHARLESTON was last away, pursued from off of the pace in the five path and continued on one paced.
STOP THE PRESS bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and ran on willingly.
HIGGINSVILLE hopped slightly and took contact from an outer rival at the start then made little impact from the two path. NO JUDGMENT pursued from
midpack in the three path and between horses, then weakened entering the lane. TUSCANY'S EAGLE broke a step slow and was outrun along the inside.
MELEE raced at the rear two wide and was outrun. STINGER BEE checked between horses at the start, brushed an inner rival while gaining midpack
position in the two path, then weakened.

Footnotes
JUDGE DAVIS shook his head and broke a step slow, settled off of the pace three wide, tipped six wide in upper stretch and rallied to reel in the leader in
the shadow of the wire. JEFE DE OBRA (CHI) set the pace along the inside, shook away from chasing rivals passing the furlong grounds but was caught
late. TRUST DADDY brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, grinded away to bid for place
in the final furlong but was outkicked. ZARTOWNIS bumped with an inner rival at the start, saved ground, moved closer behind the leaders entering the
lane, bumped an outer rival while attempting to tip outside of the leader in upper stretch, jostled with that one again while subtly short of room at the furlong
grounds and lacked a bid. GILDED RULER brushed with an outer rival leaving the gates, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, floated three wide
entering the lane, bumped with an inner rival in upper stretch before attempting a bid, but bumped with that foe again at the furlong grounds and yielded
between horses. HUNTERTOWN leaned out at the start, stalked along the inside, took aim two wide and between horses entering the lane, but took contact
from foes on either side in upper stretch, was jostled and put to crowded quarters by them at the furlong grounds, steadied and gave way. VOCALIZE
bumped with an outer rival at the start, trailed into the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and moved up. RUTHLESS RUA chased three wide and between
horses then weakened entering the lane. STAR SLUGGER pressed two wide, but weakened while drifting out entering the lane. CONGRATS ON FIFTY
tracked four wide, fanned seven wide into the lane and faded.
