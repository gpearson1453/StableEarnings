Footnotes
SHADOW CREEK (IRE) rated in the two path, bid three deep on the far turn, bumped at the top of the lane, took over in upper stretch, fought with PLAYER
B in the furlong grounds and held gamely. PLAYER B unhurried in the beginning and moved into the two path, tipped out on the far turn, rallied and fought
outside of SHADOW CREEK (IRE) in the furlong grounds but could not go by. CRYPTO MAN broke a step slow then settled inside, tipped two wide on the
far turn but lacked room behind a wall of rivals, angled out in the lane, bid three deep and finished a game third. QUINTECENTS stalked along the rail,
waited for room on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path and churned on for a minor award. NOBEL GARY brushed the gate, pulled
to the front then moved inside, set the pace along the rail to the far turn, pressured around that bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. HARD
TIMES rated in the two path, closest in pursuit from outside up the backstretch, challenged on the far turn, bumped with rival at the top of the lane and
weakened.

whip midstretch, dug in under strong handling and prevailed. ROSIE ANN RULES settled early outside a rival, rounded the bend three deep, drifted inward

her head at the start then bumped with CHEVY GIRL three times, raced four wide at the back into the turn, chased outside inner trio around the bend and
summoned a mild response once straightened away in the lane. CHEVY GIRL bumped with JUST IS repeatedly leaving the gate, started to climb and was
steered down to the inside, saved ground through the turn and kept on trying through the drive but was unable to threaten. COME JOIN THE BAND got
bumped outward leaving the gate, went up to take control then dueled with inner rival, fought two wide through the turn, could not kick on with the

Footnotes
HOT ROD MAMA broke a step slow, unhurried in the beginning and lagged behind, trailed along the inside into the turn, tipped out approaching the quarter
pole, spun three wide into the lane, rallied while drifted inward on the wrong lead, drew alongside BARBERA in the final sixteenth and drove past.
BARBERA got bumped and forced out leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter from outside up the backstretch, bid three wide around the turn, put away
SUGAR SUGAR in upper stretch, drifted out and inward in the furlong grounds and could not fend off the winner late. SUGAR SUGAR got knocked into
outer rival leaving the gate, sat off the pace early, rounded the bend three then two wide, showed a mild response going between foes in the lane and
finished evenly late for a clear third. ROSE GIRL veered out and bumped SUGAR SUGAR at the start, cleared quickly and showed the way to the turn,
pressured by BARBERA around the turn, fought two wide into the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MAHINA unhurried and moved into the two path, trailed on the inside into the far turn, swung out past the quarter pole, surged widest and got up.
PRINCESS MIDNIGHT showed good early foot to establish the front, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, met the bid from PORT ELLEN (IRE) in
upper stretch, maintained command into the final sixteenth but had no answer for MAHINA in the closing moments. PORT ELLEN (IRE) stalked from inside,
tipped two wide leaving the far turn, challenged PRINCESS MIDNIGHT from outside in upper stretch failed to find the needed late kick. VIEWERS
DISCRETION stalked in the the two path then between rivals, eased out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, shifted in to bump rival in upper
stretch and kept on for a minor award. HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) was closest in pursuit early on in the two path, took aim three wide entering the lane, got
bumped by VIEWERS DISCRETION in upper stretch and faltered late. NICELY CURVED forwardly placed early and got fanned four wide into the first turn,
moved into the three path around the bend, rounded the far turn two then three wide, angled out then back inward in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
CHRISTINA'S CANDY was off slow to begin, settled inside, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened. VULIN tracked three deep early, started to
weaken under coaxing three wide on the far turn, trailed four wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT VIEWERS DISCRETION AND HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) BOTH CONTRIBUTED
TO THE INCIDENT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SATELLITE HEART bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside, inched ahead in the lane and held gamely over MISTY MUPPET.
MISTY MUPPET chased three wide around the bend, bid outside the top pair in upper stretch, fought outside SATELLITE HEART into deep stretch and was
denied. BEAU SOLEIL took control early then dueled outside SATELLITE HEART for command, battled two wide around the bend, stayed on to the eighth
pole then yielded to the top pair and managed to save the show. SUPER ENTICING bumped inner rival at the start, climbed early and dropped back off the
pace, rounded the bend four wide, summoned a mild rally and missed the show. DORIE MILLER bobbled a bit leaving the gate then bumped, settled inside,
angled out and came three to four wide into the stretch and could not rally. DREAMING OF HOPE broke a step slow and bumped with inner rival, chased
along the inside into the turn, lost ground around the bend, moved out in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
PRIVATE GEM stalked between then had to pause when put in a bit tight past the half-mile pole, ridden along while outside a rival then ran into traffic from
the five-sixteenths pole to the top of the stretch, angled in then back out midstretch, then rallied three deep to be up in time. HALO UNCLE stalked from
inside, ran into traffic midway around the turn, rallied up the rail and took over past the sixteenth pole but was outclosed by the winner. FACT OR FICTION
sped to the front, showed the way two wide into the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend, put to left handed urging in upper stretch, challenged past
the eighth pole, clung to a short lead at the sixteenth marker and passed on both sides. MR BIG BUCKS raced up close under coaxing early, had to pause
behind FACT OR FICTION at the five-sixteenths pole, driven two wide into the lane and finished evenly late. LAST CALL PAUL chased five deep early,
moved into the three path for the turn, moved in a bit then spun three wide into the lane and weakened. GRAZEN BOY chased off the pace up the
backstretch, rounded the bend three wide and failed to menace. THIRSTY LOV got brushed from outside at the start, forwardly placed six deep early,
rounded the bend four wide and weakened. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN broke in and bumped at the start, climbed a bit and dropped back, trailed three to four
wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LADY LITHESOME broke a step slow then was content to sit off the pace early and moved into the two path, angled out while on the move on the far turn,
spun four wide into the lane, got bumped in upper stretch, floated out a bit past the eighth pole, rallied to the front approaching the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. KITZKATY settled three then two wide outside a rival, moved closer between foes on the far turn, waited for room behind the leaders with a quarter
mile left to run, shifted out and bumped rival in upper stretch, altered in at the eighth pole and kept on to get up for second. ASADA FRIES dueled for the
lead from inside, fought through the far turn and into the lane, cleared in upper stretch, relinquished the lead outside the sixteenth pole and got edged for
second. O K ROSE settled inside then had to steady when running up behind a rival into the backstretch, raced inside a rival off the pace in the middle
stages, lacked room past the three-eighths pole, found traffic again briefly in upper stretch, altered to the inside and finished willingly to round out the
superfecta. BEAUTIFUL JANET dueled outside a rival into the first turn, drifted out and had to be reined in while continuing to fight for the lead and racing
keenly, battled through the far turn and into the stretch, got floated out at the eighth pole and flattened. EBOK'S DREAM GIRL chased two wide into the first
turn, had to take up when outer rival crossed in front early on the clubhouse bend, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn,
moved out and exited the bend five deep, was forced to check behind rivals in upper stretch and could not rally. WAILEA SUNSET was off slow to begin,
trailed on the inside early, moved out and went four wide into the far turn, altered out in upper stretch and failed to make an impact. LOOKATHERGLIDE
pulled three wide into the first turn, steadied and shifted into the two path bothering rivals, was closest in pursuit of the top pair up the backstretch, took aim
three wide into the lane, got pinballed in upper stretch and was not persevered with after. COCKTAIL CUTIE rated on the inside, had to check when put in
tight by LOOKATHERGLIDE early on the clubhouse turn, moved closer up the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and faded. THE RIDER ABOARD
LOOKATHERGLIDE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST KITZKATY FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH AND THERE WAS ALSO A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KITZKATY FROM SECOND TO
EIGHTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AND COSTING LOOKATHERGLIDE A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
