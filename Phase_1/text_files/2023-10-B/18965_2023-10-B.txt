ROOKIE MISTAKE lugged in early and brushed with rival exiting the chute, vied in between rivals for the lead, continued in between on the turn, cleared
heading into the stretch, kept under a strong drive to be best. ECHO ALPHA SIX vied for lead four wide entering the turn, continued widest through the turn,
stayed on gamely in the lane to come up second best. MONGOLIAN BOX vied for lead three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn,
entered lane in range and failed to improve while besting the rest. RUNAWAY WYWY tracked hotly contested pace on the backstretch, continued off the rail
on the turn, swung five wide into the lane and failed to make any headway. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT off bit slow, settled off the pace along the rail, continued
along the rail through the turn and showed mild late interest to gain on rivals in the lane. MAJESTIC WIND broke in, asked for speed, brushed with lugging
in rival early, held the rail on the backstretch, continued to vie along the rail on the turn, unable to match strides late in the turn, asked and kept on in upper
stretch before succumbing in the final sixteenth. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
