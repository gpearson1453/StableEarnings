raced in close quarters, stalked inside, and lacked the rally needed. WILD ARCH raced four wide into the opening turn, drove five wide at the head of the
lane, and was along late for show. CARRIE'S SUCCESS lost position early, and was worn down for the third. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE fought bit into the
opening turn, stalked three to four wide, and faded nearing the stretch.

HARD TO COME HOME quickly took command, dueled through the backstretch inside of CARSON'S LEGACY, edged away at the head of the lane and
was kept to task. NORTH FORK stalked the dueling pacesetters, moved up closer nearing the far turn, drifted out at the head of the lane, and improved
position deep stretch. CARSON'S LEGACY moved up to contest the pace entering the backstretch, dueled through the far turn, was unable to get by then
weakened. ESCROW STYLE lodged a late mild bid. JUMEIRAH COAST was not a factor.

Footnotes
TUCKER TIME stalked three to four wide into the opening turn, set sights on SMASH FACTOR leaving the backstretch, dueled through the stretch, and
prevailed after a long drive. SMASH FACTOR vied four wide then angled down to the rail, saved ground while showing the way, was joined at the head of
the stretch, dueled inside and was outfinished. EXPLODE raced five-wide through the backstretch, was gaining on leaders late, and finished with good
energy. MOONSHINE NOW raced near the back, lacked running room in the backstretch, swung out, and offered a late kick. WHITEROSE SPIRIT was
under a snug hold into the opening turn from a rail position, and was done early. SASSY CINDERELLA stalked the pace early, and came up empty for the
drive. REDNECK REMARK stumbled leaving the gate, lost rider, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the starting involving REDNECK REMARK but made no change.

Footnotes
SPORTSCARR stalked early then took over the lead entering the backstretch, responded to looming threat into the stretch and just held. THE BEAT settled
off the early pacesetters, chased wide through the backstretch, drove four to five wide under urging, closed gradually and narrowly missed.
RUNNINFORCOVER trailed the field, hustled inside when leaving the final turn, lacked running room then held for show. SILVERFOOT fractious in gate
then left awkwardly, raced four wide into the opening turn, chased wide through the backstretch, rallied four to five wide at the head of the lane, and lacked
the closing response needed. BEAUGATTI contested the early lead, drifted out when entering the backstretch, was overtaken and gave way in stretch.
DANCING WILLIE pressed the early pace, and tired. TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection was lodged by the trainer of RUNNINFORCOVER against
SPORTSCARR alleging interference into the stretch was disallowed after review of the Board of Stewards. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection was lodged
by the jockey of RUNNINFORCOVER against SPORTSCARR alleging interference into the stretch was disallowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

FLASHFORDANI settled inside early then shifted out to the three path entering the backstretch, gained the advantage when turning for home, dug in, and
edged clear. TOOL TIME hurried to the front, contested the lead leaving the backstretch, dueled, and gave way grudgingly inside. WALKTHELINE raced
four wide through the opening turn, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, was unable to move on with rivals and weakened. MOUNT ASGARD trailed
the field early, and rallied mildly late. SLEW'S BAK raced wide into the opening turn, chased four-wide leaving the backstretch, and gave way. LINCHPIN
STORM chased the pace early, drifted out in the backstretch, steadied and yielded.

Footnotes
DECOY reserved off the early pacesetters, shifted out to the four path then gained closer order, gained an advantage entering the stretch, and won driving.
WHERE'S THE GOLD settled inside early, moved up into striking distance, closed gradually and just got up for place honors. IMPACTO sent for outside
speed then crossed over to the rail expeditiously, led the way under a snug grip, was overtaken by GLAVA leaving the backstretch, rallied inside when
challenged into the stretch then gave way late stretch. ROCKTILLYOUDROP saved ground inside early, moved up closer to the leaders in the backstretch,
rallied between foes into the final turn and wilted. DRINKING AGAIN offered little. GLAVA stalked the early pace in the two path, moved up alongside
IMPACTO to challenge the lead, and stopped. RACE HOME outrun throughout, was distanced and eased.

Footnotes
PLUM BLUE saved ground inside, took closer order leaving the backstretch, closed steadily under encouragement through the drive, and was up in time.
MISSCZECH quickly took command, saved ground while setting the pace, saw margins decrease nearing the stretch, and was run down. ORANGE
THEORY raced in closest pursuit, chased through the final turn, but lacked the kick needed in the stretch and finished clearly third best. TONE IT UP raced
near the back of the pack, gained closer order, but was unable to threaten in the drive. MINE ME sat off the pace inside, and tired. BURROW DOWN no
factor. AFTER A FEW offered little. DANCE SHOES sat in range and tired early.

Footnotes
NIGHT FLYER chased the early pace, moved up alongside LIL ZAPPER, gained the lead, and held under a late drive. BOSS MAN CAN rated well off the
pace from the three path, went in pursuit of the leader into the stretch and missed. LIL ZAPPER quickly sped to the front, was joined nearing the final turn,
lacked the rally needed, and clung to third. AGENT C unhurried early, angled down to the rail in the backstretch, advanced quickly through the far turn, and
flattened in stretch. SNAP COUNT showed a mild interest late. SPOT ON DUDE chased five to six wide in the backstretch, and faded. REBATE failed to
menace. JHAWK FLYER was no factor.

SECRET HAVEN broke alertly to set the pace, responded to looming threat from SUGAR MOON, and held under handling. SUGAR MOON tracked from
the two path, moved up menacingly midstretch but was unable to reach the winner. DAZZLING CHIC took closer order nearing the stretch from the rail, and
lacked the kick needed in the stretch. VIVIEN'S CHARM shifted outside into the backstretch, lodged bid into the stretch then flattened.
WHEELSUPINTHIRTY closed late. EDGE OF OKOTOKS stalked the pace from the three path, and faded gradually. NO BAKK TALK failed to menace.
PONY GIRL offered little. MARGOT'S GIRL was not a factor and bore out in the final turn.
