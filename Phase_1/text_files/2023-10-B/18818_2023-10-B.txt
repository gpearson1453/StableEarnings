Footnotes
MISSIONSNINETYNINE raced with the early pace then stalked two deep on the first turn, took the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole and contested the
edge two deep on the far turn, dug in under determined handling and inched clear later yards. AUBURN MILL became a bit anxious in the gate and raced
with the early pace inside, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, contested at a close disadvantage
nearest the rail on the far turn and dueled gamely to deep stretch before relenting. GOLDEN APPEAL was forced out leaving the gate then settled off the
rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and came along for third the final strides. OUT OF CENTS
stalked from the two and three paths the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. SHAMELESS RISK veered out leaving the gate then rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn and showed little further.

lane, took the lead nearing mid-stretch and drew clear under steady handling. NO ME DIGAS settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase
and closed to the heels of Bali's Shade approaching the head of the lane, angled to the four path leaving the far turn and dug in to take second later yards.
GAMMA SQUEEZE took the lead passing the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to set the pace, dug in to the challenge of Bali's Shade
nearing the three eighths pole and dueled at near even terms from that point, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was caught while flattening
stride approaching mid-stretch. AKINGISALWAYSKING rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
