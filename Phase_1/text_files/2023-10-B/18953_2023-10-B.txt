Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL STAR settled three wide, went after the leader on the final turn, was put to urging in the stretch long drive and was up in time nearing the wire.
CHICA RABIOSA firmly rated behind the pacesetters, took over when ready at the three eighths pole, rallied clear to the late stages but was nailed nearing
the finish. CAGED PIXIE alternated for the advantage inside and began fading on the final turn. NURSE RACHETT earned a narrow lead in the two path,
dueled to the far turn and faded. MS BOOMBASTIC stumbled slightly at the start, trailed early and was always far back. LONDONDERRY lacked speed and
chased well off the pace and lacked a response.

DESTINED TO DANCE unhurried early, rallied three wide on the turn, took over into the stretch and extended her advantage under moderate pressure.
ALLIE'S HALO raced close up near the inside, angled out on the turn, rallied mildly but was no match for the winner. STRIKING MELODY broke alertly and
set a clear pace, was collared midway on the turn and faded. APRIL'S GOLD raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, led at the five sixteenths pole then
faded through the stretch. AKIVA dropped well behind in the opening quarter and was never a factor. SEA IMAGE chased along the rail on the backstretch,
was taken up sharply into the far turn and had no further response.

BUSTIN TIME hustled to the front, repelled a rival at the quarter pole and edged away while just being shown the whip in the final yards. BLUE EYED
WARRIOR broke slowly, advanced wide, loomed a brief threat, nearing the stretch but flattened out. UPTOWN GOLDENGOODS outrun early, commenced
her rally on the turn and closed well. SWEET SUMMER LOVE prompted the winner to the quarter pole and weakened. MYA C chased within striking range
inside and faded. BOBBI TWO STEPS raced very wide throughout and failed to menace. CHICA MUSIC flashed speed along the inside and gave way
readily.

Footnotes
SUPREME LAW settled off the pace, was blocked trying to rally from midway on the turn to the stretch, angled out to secure room and gamely held off
outside challenger. NO CONFESSION lacked speed, advanced very wide, loomed dangerous but could not get by the winner. TAKE A HINT forced the
pace in the two path then led inside and weakened in the stretch. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN prompted the pace in the three path then proved empty in the
stretch. SWIFTY DEVIL raced wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. VICTIM OF THE NITE broke a bit awkwardly, moved up inside then faltered.
GALAXY MUSIC hustled to the front inside then gave way on the turn.

IN THE DANCE saved ground off the dueling leaders, began advancing on the turn, split foes late and was just up in time. DUBAI FIRE engaged in heated
duel outside, alternated for the lead, led to the final yards, held gamely but was nailed at the wire. SECRET SATURDAY raced three wide off the pace and
rallied late but was edged in tight finish. DALINAR broke alertly and led inside, dueled long way, resisted then tired slightly. SILVERBULLETTWENTY
soundly bumped just after the start, raced between rivals and continued well with no solid bid. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN dropped back early and was never
in contention. EASTBOSTONBENNY sluggish at the break, chased inside and was no factor. FINAL OPPORTUNITY bumped hard with inside rival just after
start and always outrun.

settled four wide, made a menacing bid on the turn and continued gamely. RUN POPPY lacked speed, moved extremely wide then went evenly late. BOAT
SONG raced off the leaders in the two path, bid inside in the stretch and tired. SPOTTED BULL moved off the pacesetters inside and lacked a solid rally.
MR. SWAGGER lost position in the opening quarter mile, chased inside and was no factor. ENTRUST chased wide off the early leaders and gradually
weakened. MOTIVATING forced the pace to the stretch in the two path and faltered. BUSTIN LOOSE hustled to the front inside, dueled to the stretch and

Footnotes
BOLD MEDICATION fanned wide into the first turn, stalked outside, bid and led on the final turn then drew off while kept to a drive. NIEUWENDYK broke
slowest, advanced outside but was no match for the winner. POP SOCKS vied inside, shook loose briefly after half a mile then came up empty in the lane.
WALK SADLY eased back on the first turn, saved ground and was no threat. TO LIVE IS TO LOVE trailed early then passed fading rivals. FINN'S POINT
saved ground off the leaders and gave way readily. IT'S BIRDIE BIRDIE prompted the pace in the two path then stopped abruptly into the far turn.
