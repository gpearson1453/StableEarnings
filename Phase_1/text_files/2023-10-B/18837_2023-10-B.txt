Footnotes
YA MAR took command from the rail at the break, was left alone dictating terms down the backstretch, was headed outside with two furlongs to go, repelled
the early bid in upper stretch, was well rated early on to have something left in reserve late and held off the closing rival for the win. RETAIL THERAPIST
watched the front two leaders down the backside in the early going, had a good position nestled on the rail keeping a close eye on the pair that were battling
up front with a quarter to run, swung outside to loom in the three path turning for home, found more to close in at the furlong marker but could not reel in the
leader who had something saved for deep stretch. REMEMBERING RHODA was off a step slow to begin, trailed the field down the back straight on the rail,
advanced on the fence midway on the turn, was in range of the leaders at the top of the lane running inside, ran on willingly through the lane and was
closing the gap on the front trio when crossing the finish line. LANTANA LADY was content to track the frontrunning winner down the backside, pounced
outside to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with the winner in upper stretch and faded between runners late to keep third money at the finish line.
KNOW HOW (GB) stalked near the rear on the outside in this compact field down the back straight, offered a brief run two to three wide outside horses from
the three eighths marker until the quarter pole, had little to show turning for home and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LADY MAEVE (IRE) had an ideal trip tucked on the rail watching the contesting runners on the lead throughout the turn, bid for the lead in the three path
between horses at the furlong pole and when called for more run drew clear in deep stretch. UMNEYAAT travelled in mid-pack on the rail with five eighth
from the wire, saved ground improving inside on the turn, was behind the leaders looking for a seam turning for home, followed the path three wide set be
the winner at the furlong marker and closed belatedly late to just up for the runners up share before the finish. LOIS LEN pressed with runners on either side
down the backstretch, dueled for the lead outside on the turn, poked her head in front briefly, three sixteenths from home, chased the winner in vain in deep
stretch and faded late to be caught nearing the wire for second placing. KITTEN'S ROMANCE settled three wide between foes in midfield down the back
straight, took closer order through the turn to be in the mix in the five path driving to the finish and could not find another gear late and evened out the final
eighth to settle for a minor role in the end. FLORAL prompted three down the backstretch and through the running around the turn, was in the hunt in the
four path straightening out for the drive but faded between horses in the last sixteenth. EMERALD LAKE co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, put
in a brief turn of foot around runners commencing at the five sixteenths marker, shifted out with momentum in the six path at the top of the lane but could not
sustain the run and stalled in the final furlong. SILENT GUROO tracked the front trio outside in the beginning, was in with a chance behind the leaders
turning for home, could not find more through the lane and levelled out in mid stretch. BAYOU BELLE co-trailed on the inside in the early going, made little
headway running around the bend and could not get involved through the stretch run. MAKE NO MISTAKE travelled in the middle of the pack in the two
path between horses along the backside, kept pace running throughout the turn, angled out five wide for the drive and offered little finish to the wire. SENSE
YOU LEFT showed the way on the rail down the back straight, was hounded outside clinging to the lead on the turn, collared by runners in upper stretch
outside and retreated on the fence at the three sixteenths marker. PLUIE D'AVRIL stalked four deep on the outside down the backside, made little progress
four wide running on the turn and was uninterested driving down the lane to the wire.

Footnotes
LIPLOCK broke out at the start brushing the outside rival, was unhurried near the back running down the backside, crept closer going around horses three
wide around the final bend, found her best stride late to take command in the five path in mid-stretch and held safe from the late closer at the wire.
ENDORPHIN RUSH was in the mix between foes up front into the first turn, was throttled back to have a good tracking position behind the front pair down
the backside, had to wait with horse behind the contesting foursome on the final turn, was looking for clear running room at the top of the lane, finally found
a path with an eighth to go, was gaining late but could not get there in time. CHEEKY PINT tracked the front duo outside down the backstretch, was coaxed
for more run having to go on the maintain position with three furlongs from home, assumed control in upper stretch, could not hold off the late charge by the
winner at the furlong marker and faded some late to lose third money nearing the wire. PHIL IN ECHO stalked on the fence in the third flight, was allowed to
settle on the rail still near the rear along the back straightaway, swung outside gaining momentum five wide turning for home and showed good late interest
to finish up on the fringes in the end. TEXT ME UP could see the field on the rail in the first turn, stalked three deep outside in early backstretch, advanced
down the back straight to bid four wide three furlongs from home, was in the path four wide for the stretch drive and could only finish up with a mild effort in
mid-stretch. STOLE THE RING prompted three wide on the first bend, pressed the issue down the back straight, came under a ride cling to the lead midway
on the final turn and yielded on the fence in the last furlong. NADIABIZNIZ maintained a slim lead inside on the first turn, continued setting the pace on the
rail when hounded outside along the backstretch, was collared outside by three runners closing in, offered no resistance and backed away on the fence at
the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SUZIE went straight to the front, set the pace shifting in and facing outside pressure, spurted clear of foes turning for home and drew away.
MOON POOL was in tight and taken back off a rival's heels in the early going, settled into stride shifting nearer the rail, saved ground racing mid-pack, bided
time through the far turn, came out a bit for the drive, split foes mid-stretch, got the place. P. S. RISING STAR rated off the leaders two to three wide and in
behind, came out six wide in the stretch, kicked on well but missed second. RAVELLO BEAUTY broke poorly coming away slowly, awkwardly, and hitting
the gate, angled in a few strides later, moved up passing inside foes heading to the first turn, raced two to three wide about mid-pack on that bend, moved
out a bit further on the far turn, altered inside a foe at the top of the stretch before being guided out again racing five wide by mid-stretch, needed more late.
SERENADING HALL pressed the eventual winner from the outset, lacked the needed late kick. MENAGERIE was forwardly-placed racing outside just off
the leading pair three to four wide, was still within range racing off the inside on the far turn, drifted out a bit leaving that bend then continued to float out in
upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. CRASH THE CREASE tracked from inside, weakened. HALLANVAARA settled at the back off the rail, came out
six wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. REINS OF PURPLE settled outside at the back, swung nine wide, was not a threat. SHARP
AZA RAINBOW chased three to four wide, faded.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC STRIKE stalked the leading pair in behind and off the inside, moved three wide to challenge taking the lead by the top of the stretch, drew away
when asked. WHO'S THAT BABY was in just a bit tight at the break, settled off the pace racing outside, advanced four wide on the turn, was no match for
the winner but secured the place. HYPER HOLIDAY was urged from the start, moved forward between runners two to three wide up the backstretch, moved
out a bit leaving the turn before drifting back in, secured show honors. UNDER BUDGET was forced out a bit at the start, lacked early speed racing near the
inside, came out five wide in upper stretch and ran on. GLENROSA switched out off the inside early, moved out further from two to four wide on the turn
eventually swinging six wide into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest. NOT TODAY settled off the pace inside, was never near enough to threaten.
NACHO GIRL broke out a bit, pressed the pace from outside, took a brief and narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch. SUGAR
DROP chased three wide, retreated. BLUE TANGO set a pressured pace inside, gave way.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S GIRL stalked in the third flight inside rating comfortably down the back straight, began to inch closer to the lead through the far turn, swung out
four wide to be in touch with the leaders driving to the finish, found another gear with right handed encouragement at the furlong pole and got up at the finish
under a well timed late surge. GABBY SQUARED tracked inside in the early stages of the race, loomed a powerful presence on the fence in upper stretch,
poked his head in front with a furlong to go but could not hold off the late charge by the winner nearing the finish. BIZYMALINE took command leading into
the first turn, set a moderate tempo down the backside uncontested up front, was clinging onto the lead in the two path with runners closing in on either side
in upper stretch and faded compared to the top two finishers but stubbornly held off others late to hold for third money. BUTTERED TOAST settled near the
rear outside down the backstretch, made a mild run three wide around horses five sixteenths from the finish, continued to gain slowly when straightening out
for the drive and come on willingly late to capture a minor share on a tiring foe at the wire. MOSLER'S IMAGE tracked the pace outside on the first turn,
watched the frontrunner, sitting close down the backside, inched closer on the far turn to loom in the three path at the top of the lane, could not rally when
urged for more in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch losing positions nearing the wire. AMI'S LINK stalked near the rear in the early going, was
nudged for more to go after the leaders three furlongs out, offered little response going around on the final bend and lacked a stretch rally to be a non factor
running to the wire. ERASMO'S GIRL stalked on the outside in the third flight down the back straight, was scrubbed on trying to go with the eventual winner
making a run on the inside with three furlongs to go, could not keep up with rivals on the far turn and gave way turning for home. SPIDER BELLE was
unhurried in the early stages trailing the field, could not make any improvement throughout the backstretch, made little run on the final turn and never
reached contention driving down the stretch to the finish line.

Footnotes
MR CROWLEY took control from the onset, was unchallenged setting a comfortable pace down the backside, opened up on the chasing runners throughout
the far turn, drifted out under right handed urging while clinging to the lead in mid-stretch and just held off the quick closing rival at the finish. SUNRISE
DRIVE was allowed to settle seeing the field down the back straight, began to pick up runners going around foes three wide midway on the final turn, posed
the only threat running in the three path turning for home and was gaining steadily late but just missed with the late burst at the wire. HELL BENT stalked
near the back in the beginning, came under a ride three furlongs from home, saved ground but could not close the gap through the final turn, showed good
late energy down the lane and closed to be a distant third in the end. COMMANDER JOE was content to track under a snug hold on the outside along the
backstretch, was asked between runners three furlongs out for more run to go after the pacesetter, could not make any progress through the far turn and
wilted inside in deep stretch. NATIVE PRINCE tracked the leader on the fence travelling down the backside, came under a ride trying to close in on the
frontrunning winner two furlongs to go, made little impact, then gave up the chase turning for home and weakened on the fence inside the three sixteenths
marker. JUST START ME UP sat alone in midfield in the early stages, made an early move three wide outside runners advancing down the backstretch,
could not sustain the the run with three eighths remaining and tired between runners at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SECRET STORM took control inside on the first turn, got a breather in the second split still dictating the pace bunching up the field a the half, was let out a
notch to open up comfortably around the final turn and cruised home down the lane in a very savvy front running score. ROCK BULLET travelled in
mid-pack two wide in the first turn, was unhurried down the back straight to be closer to the rear at the half, began to lengthen stride rallying three wide at
the quarter pole, unleashed a good closing kick turning for home and closed in to just get up for second at the wire in a tight photo. CELENTANO settled
close to the back in the early stages, sensing a soft pace made an early bid three wide around runners quickly passing foes on the final turn, loomed the
only threat at the top of the lane, chased but to not avail in upper stretch and faded late just a touch, losing second money at the finish line. HYGGE pressed
the issue on the outside down the back straight, kept pace with others dueling in the second flight behind the loose frontrunning winner around the final turn,
was in the hunt in the two path straightening out for the stretch run, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and had to settle for a small share in the end.
WICKEDBLACKBULLET tracked the front twosome three wide on the first turn, was shuffled back with horses on either side three furlongs out, was in with
chance behind a wall of runners turning for home for a minor placing but lacked a closing kick and finished up one paced through the stretch. JACK stalked
near the rear into the first turn, offered a brief run three wide three furlongs out, was in the mix in the three path for a minor share at the top of the lane,
could not offer a finish and faded between runners in the final sixteenth. MAGIC TOMAHAWK trailed on the fence in the beginning, was on hold inside when
the field bunched up at the half, shifted outside off a fading rival beginning to make a run midway on the final turn and showed some late interest in the last
furlong to close the gap on runners at the wire. SHAMROCK AMBASADOR settled on the rail in midfield early on, pulled the rider between horses improving
position when entering the backstretch, watched the front pair between foes at the half, came under a hard ride on the fence at the quarter pole and
retreated on the rail at the furlong marker. CORONATION BOY had a good position earlier under a tight rein nestled behind the front duo down the
backstretch, was checked briefly losing position on the fence three furlongs from home and gave way running on the far turn inside.
