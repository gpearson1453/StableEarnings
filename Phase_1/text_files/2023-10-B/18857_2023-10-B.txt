Footnotes
QUANTICO CREEK tracked the early leader from the inside, raced between two deep near the three eighths pole, raced well clear nearing the eighth pole
and prevailed late under strong handling. CIVIL NOTION rated along early while racing under a hold, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and closed
in gamely in the final stages while racing from the outside. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn,
shifted out to race four deep and finished willingly to the wire. JESS'S GYPSY GIRL showed good early foot along the inside and weakened in the drive.
CHEZ SOLEIL was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CHASING ARTEMIS
stalked the pace racing four wide from the outside and faded. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM stumbled at the break, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole
and never threatened.

TANKINATOR was allowed to settle early, moved up two deep near the quarter pole and finished well to get up under strong urging racing four deep.
BUSTINUPISHARDTODO dueled outside of foe, dug in through the stretch drive and kept on gamely to the wire. CLAW dueled for the early lead from the
inside of foe and gave way grudgingly. PEPE AND HEYWOOD stalked the top pair, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late with
no closing run. FOREST SURVIVOR sent along early while racing off the early pace, raced three to five wide around the far turn and had no late response.
GREAT GO GO dropped back off the early pace, saved ground and had no rally. PER RULING FROM HISA, TANKINATOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR

PAPPY'S REVENGE set an uncontested early pace, asked through the upper stretch and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. EDDIE FELSON
stalked the top pair, hard ridden near the rail past the three eighths pole and was no match for the winner. ARROW SPEED was off slowly, raced five wide
around the first turn, loomed three wide near the quarter pole and flattened out. EVASIVE MOVES dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and lacked a bid. SMOOTH PLAYER was forwardly place three deep early on and tired readily.

Footnotes
GRAND MANNER showed good early foot from the outside to set the pace and held gamely to be well clear late under strong handling. SIR SMOAK stalked
the early leader, raced three deep between near the three eighths pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. ON OUR WAY BOYZ tracked the early
pace under a hold from the inside and weakened a bit through the drive. AWKWARD PAUSE dropped back off the early pace, raced three to four wide
around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. CALL ME MAESTRO void of early speed, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a
bid. DART stalked the pace top pair from the outside, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and faded. CODE NAME BRODY was allowed to settle
early, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
OUR FANTASY was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack after the poor start, made a strong inside bid near the quarter pole and finished well to
prove best under strong pressure. ONE LAS OLAS was unhurried early on, raced near the rail past the three eighths pole, shifted out while racing three to
five wide in the drive and rallied for the place position. CHALK HILL was allowed to settle early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up
to improve position. PARTY MONSTER tracked the early leader from the inside and weakened through the drive. TIZ HERSELF tracked the pace setters
from the outside, ridden along past the three eighths pole and faded in the drive. CHLOE ROSE showed good early speed from the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
ONE TOUGH DAME dropped back off the early pace, circled the field six wide around the far turn through the upper stretch and edged clear late under
strong pressure. BODACIOUS BREN dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and held well to be second best. MYSTIC STORM stalked the dueling
pair down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. I'M NERVOUS NOW was off a step slow, raced near the inside past
the quarter pole and lacked a rally. THE SWEATY FOX dueled for the early lead from the inside of foe and gave way in the drive.
