Footnotes
TOM SEAVER broke a bit slow, chased off the pace two wide into the turn, moved out three wide around the bend, tipped out into the stretch, rallied four
deep and proved best on the wrong lead. KISS FOR LULU away quickly then ceded command to outer rivals but began to pull, stalked from inside through
the turn, tipped out and launched a bid between rivals midstretch but got outkicked by the winner. DON'T HIT ME BASH stalked two wide into the turn, took
aim three wide entering the lane, bid three deep and got outkicked by the top pair. WESTERN GRIT bumped leaving the gate, stepped to the front and set
the pace inside a rival, cleared at the quarter pole, collared outside the sixteenth pole and yielded late. DRIVE FOR SHOW broke a step slow, traveled two
then three wide around the turn, angled out in the drive and summoned a mild rally. STAGGER LEE broke a step slow, had to pause when bothered by
outer rival early then steadied behind that foe shortly after, coaxed along the inside on the turn then had to pause in mild traffic around the bend, remained
inside to the stretch, altered out late and finished willingly. CODY BOY broke a bit slow, climbed crossing the dirt, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was
not a factor. SMILING JOJO brushed the gate and bumped with inner rival at the start, pressed from outside while tugging keenly, lost contact with the
leader at the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MISS PIXY STIX showed early speed three deep and pressed from outside, vied for command into the far turn, dueled outside ASIAN MATRIARCH past
the five-sixteenths pole, bothered a bit by ASIAN MATRIARCH shifting out in upper stretch, then steadied briefly when that rival ducked out at the eighth
pole, inherited a clear lead in the process and was ridden out to the wire. HIGH FLYING GRACIE fought for the lead along the rail into the clubhouse turn
then took control from outer rivals, set the pace under pressure then fought head to head into the far turn, could not match strides with the leaders at the
five-sixteenths pole, churned on down the lane next to the fence and edged CALIFORNIA CODE for second. CALIFORNIA CODE chased four wide,
remained wide and asked around the far turn, altered in a bit at the eight pole and missed the place. ASIAN MATRIARCH prominent early between rivals,
pressed the pace then vied between leaving the backstretch, dueled along the inside past the five-sixteenths pole, shifted out from the left hand in upper
stretch, ducked out when asked again at the eighth pole and lost the rider, then walked off following the race.

Footnotes
SECRETS TOLD chased keen along the inside early, saved ground through the turn, moved out into the stretch, drew alongside the leader with a sixteenth
remaining and proved best in the end. MISS LIZZY tracked two wide into the turn, ridden through the bend, chased between foes past the quarter pole,
brushed with outer rival and was put in tight briefly in upper stretch, rallied while drifting out a bit and kept gaining to the wire. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) was
closest in pursuit up the backstretch, headed the leader from outside around the bend, took over late on the turn, put away inner rival at the eighth pole but
got outkicked in the late stages. VINCERO GRANDE broke a step slow on the outside, angled in and settled at the back, saved ground through the turn,
tipped off the fence in the lane, then finished willingly inside outer rivals in the final sixteenth. GYPSY LYNN broke in and bumped, showed early speed to
take control and moved inside, tested from outside around the bend, lost command leaving the turn, stayed on to the eighth pole, then weakened in the
furlong grounds. FLAME MCGOON got bumped back leaving the gate, rushed up but had to take hold when in tight between runners early, stalked two wide
into the turn, moved out three wide around the bend, brushed with inner rival at the top of the lane and weakened.

BELLA VIENNA stepped to the front quickly, set all the pace from inside to the top of the stretch, roused then urged right handed once midstretch and
padded the margin under steady handling. BIG RAINBOW chased along the inside under coaxing into and around the turn, moved out at the top of the lane,
continued to give chase within range entering the final furlong but could not make any headway on the winner. MUMBLES BROCKMAN broke a step slow,
angled to the inside, eased out to the three path around the bend and gained the show. COCONUT GIRL dropped back early, raced three wide into the turn,
four wide into the lane, came in upper stretch and failed to menace. JAZZY EMPRESS threw her head and hopped at the start, recovered and moved up to
be closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased two wide through the bend and weakened. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF JAZZY
EMPRESS AND RULED SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
SORBET set the pace outside HA HA GLORIA (IRE) up the backstretch, dueled with that rival around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch, then drew
away in deep stretch. HA HA GLORIA (IRE) showed early speed and pressed SORBET from inside, moved up on even terms and put a head in front on the
turn, lost command in upper stretch, failed to kick on with the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and was clearly second best. CUTE KHLOE settled outside
a rival, moved over to the rail around the bend, chased two wide into the lane and finished evenly late. MY MOON got crowded leaving the gate, trailed on
the inside into the turn, tipped to the two path then swung out leaving the bend, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. ENCOLPION sat off the
pace, went two wide into the turn, moved out to the three path, got floated five wide leaving the bend and could not rally. SHE'S MUY MUY allowed to settle
early, saved ground through the turn and lacked a response when called upon. CY'S SILKSTOCKING raced up close early, rounded the bend two then
three wide and tired.

TURQUOISE BIKINI broke in and brushed TIFF WITH JIMMY, sped clear and moved into the two path, remained unchallenged to the stretch, roused and
put to left then right handed urging and stayed clear to the wire. UNKEPT SECRET tracked off the rail early, raced three wide at the back into the turn,
roused on the turn, moved out in the lane and rallied for the place. MISS COMMANDER chased from inside to the stretch and finished evenly for the show.
TIFF WITH JIMMY brushed with outer rival leaving the gate, closest to the pacesetter early then chased three deep into the turn, remained three wide into
the drive and lacked a bid in the final furlong. CALIFORNIA DIVA was off slow to begin, moved up between rivals, chased two wide into the lane and
weakened. ALLOCATE hit the gate to lose a step at the start, coaxed along early chasing four deep, rounded the bend four wide and came up empty in the
lane.

Footnotes
DON'T SWEAR DAVE broke a bit slow, dropped back outside rivals then moved closer up the backstretch, moved into range two wide around the bend,
tipped out into the lane, headed the leader at the eighth pole and drove clear. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU stalked from inside, moved out and commenced a
bid three deep on the turn, took over at the top of the lane, put away inner rivals but was challenged by DON'T SWEAR DAVE at the eighth pole,
relinquished the lead shortly after and stayed on for a clear second. TIGERHON (FR) was off slow to begin, raced between rivals at the back then moved
inside, saved ground through the turn while making progress, tipped out in the lane and gained the show. DEVIL MOON dueled for command from outside,
inched ahead around the bend, vied between rivals approaching the stretch, lost command at the top of the lane and weakened. BARSABAS broke a step
slow and shifted a bit, trailed on the inside into the turn, looked to rally but lacked room in traffic to midstretch, moved out in the final sixteenth and could not
threaten. FAST PER SE dueled inside DEVIL MOON up the backstretch and around the turn, could not go on with the leaders approaching the eighth pole
and weakened in the late stages. SO I'M TOLD off alertly from outside, chased the top pair three wide into the turn, asked right handed around the bend,
spun four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CENTRAL DISPATCH took a bump from outside in the beginning, set the pace under pressure from MATANZAS CREEK to the outside, maintained a short
lead along the rail through the turn, put away outer rival in upper stretch and held safely under urging. PALAGIO bothered leaving the gate and dropped
back early, trailed three then four wide on the turn while making progress, put in a late run and rallied for the place honors. DEVILISH DESIRE broke inward
while quick into stride, raced up close stalking the top pair from inside, ridden along through the turn, tipped three wide into the lane, altered back inside in
upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. DAZZLEMESILVER stalked off the inside, went three wide into the turn, floated four wide into the stretch
and flattened in the late stages. MATANZAS CREEK broke in and bumped rival at the start, prompted the pace up the backstretch, kept the pressure on
through the turn, then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SILENT HEAT set a pressure pace while along the inside, showed the way with TOPPERS WAGER still alongside on the second bend, shook free at the
top of the lane and was kept to task in deep stretch. DARK MARCUS broke a step slow, traveled along the inside towards the rear in the early stages,
ridden along while continuing to save ground on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. TOUCHDOWN
KITTLE stumbled leaving the gate, stalked from inside, tipped out a bit in upper stretch and could not produce the needed late kick but was able to secure
the show honors. TOPPERS WAGER brushed with outer rival at the start, stalked in the two path then went up to press the pace between rivals, kept the
pressure on from outside through the far turn, was no match for the winner at the top of the lane and flattened to fourth. CHROME TO RICHES pulled first
time through the stretch and into the first turn, tracked in the two path, went between rivals into the far turn, roused around the bend, tipped out into the
stretch and lacked a bid. AVIATOR NATION was off a bit slow from outside, unhurried in the early going racing outside a rival at the back, trailed into the far
turn, angled in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MAXVILLE broke in, allowed to settle at the back on the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, asked left
handed in the stretch and lacked room in deep stretch. CITY OF ANGELS broke in and brushed rival, traveled outside a rival near the back early, angled
four wide leaving the far turn and came up empty. VENOM stalked three deep through both turns and weakened in the stretch.
