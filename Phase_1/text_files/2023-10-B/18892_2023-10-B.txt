APPEALINGTOTHE EYE led off the inside, widened in the stretch, drifted out through the final furlong and remained clear. TWO MINUTE LICK settled off
the pace inside then closed well narrowing the gap. ONE OF THE ONES settled just off the pace outside, bid on the final turn then flattened out. CHANCE
OCCURRENCE raced close up inside then began fading on the final turn. ONE VIOLENT AFFAIR moved inside before half a mile and gave way readily.
ME SO LUCKY lagged far behind and trailed throughout losing contact with her field.

LET IT FLOW JOE set the pace off the inside, dueled outside after half a mile, edged clear in the stretch, drifted in slightly and stayed safe. CUPID'S DART
bid inside to challenge before half a mile then steadied briefly inside the eighth pole.. ALONZO MOSELY prompted the pace for nearly half a mile and
faltered. MAJOR CAM broke poorly, chased outside and was never a factor. DAD'S ON A ROLL trailed whiled displaying poor action and was eased
through the stretch. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
RIVERVIEW shook loose into the far turn, widened on the turn and lasted while never threatened. DUNE JUMPER moved closer three wide on the turn and
continued willingly. NOW ACT SURPRISED broke slowly, saved ground advancing to get up for the show. INCOMPARABLE lacked speed then passed
rivals without menacing. BAY AND GOLD pressed the winner inside and proved empty in the stretch. ANGELIC GAL raced between rivals down the
backstretch and faltered. KEFALIANI moved briefly closer on the turn then gave way. WICKED LADY dropped far behind and was never in contention.
QUEEN LUCKY trailed early racing wide and was never a factor. DIVINE TWIST showed brief speed in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
WEDNESDAYNIGHT LAD controlled the pace, easily widened on the final turn, ducked out late under left handled whip but was clear. MAJESTIC LION
trailed into the first turn, moved wide and closed well too late. MERGING TRAFFIC raced in closest pursuit of pacesetter then faded in stretch. BIG
POPPER saved ground and weakened steadily. SETTE STELLE dropped far behind inside then passed tiring rivals. FRUGAL JUDE trailed to the stretch
and was never in contention. PRINCIPE was fanned wide into the first turn and gave way readily. FACTUM LOVE STYLE chased between rivals in the
second flight and stopped. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
