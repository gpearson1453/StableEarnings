Footnotes
LIFESPAN stalked from between runners three to four wide in the early going, was within range in behind off the fence on the far turn, cut the corner to bid
inside the drifting leader in upper stretch, took the lead a furlong out, was guided out past the sixteenth engaging a foe and held that rival to prevail.
MUSICAL HEART was hard to control racing forwardly four wide on the first turn, settled down and pressed the pace up the backstretch, was within striking
distance of the leader three to four deep leaving the far turn and floated out by that one leaving that bend and then again in upper stretch, sought a new rival
who had bid up the inside but was held at bay while second best. ARTISTIC REASON set the pace from off the rail facing pressure by an outside foe up the
backstretch, drifted out leaving the far turn then further in upper stretch, was soon overtaken and weakened thereafter. PURPLE SHIRT got away slowly,
settled at the back off the inside, swung nine wide into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest. KINETIC SWAGGER raced outside four to five wide
early, failed to rally. MELINA'S DREAM tucked in behind the leading pair heading to the first turn saving ground along the rail through the first turn, dropped
back on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
THE GOLDEN ONE ducked in soon after the start passing the gap, tracked in behind the pace inside, bid along the rail at the top of the stretch, moved clear
by mid-stretch and held. CIRO THE BOSS settled at the back inside a foe but off the inside, swung six deep into upper stretch, drifted out a bit further,
gained steadily but too late. MORALES LITTLE KID set the pace racing off the rail, was challenged by inside and outside foes at the top of the stretch, kept
on but was outkicked. DIVINING STONE raced outside a foe at the rear, floated six wide leaving the turn while shifting inside a rival at the top of the stretch,
was never nearer than at the end. KAMIKAZE FOX stalked three wide, altered outside a foe past the quarter pole then shifted back in once in upper stretch,
made no late bid. WYNN TRIP stalked from outside, advanced three to four wide, bid at the top of the stretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
LA FAMILIA forced the pace from outside, moved clear into the turn racing in the two to three path, drifted out through the stretch but held.
PERFORMANCEANXIETY was off a step slowly, bumped and in tight at the break, settled at the rear, swung four wide into upper stretch, gained but too
late. EPICUREAN was within range two to three wide on the turn, kept on evenly in the lane. RAISE YOUR GAME switched out, raced outside four to five
wide on the turn, floated seven wide into upper stretch, needed more. PROSPERA vied inside, eased back and switched out at the three-eighths racing
outside and just off the leader three to four deep, floated six wide into upper stretch looming a threat, lacked the needed late kick. SQUARE PEG chased in
behind, was shuffled back at the seven-sixteenths and failed to rally thereafter. SOUPSTER broke a bit awkwardly and slowly, was encouraged forward
inside tracking the leading pair, tired.

Footnotes
NAVANI set a pressured pace in the early going just off the rail, edged away on the far turn, drew clear by upper stretch and was kept to the task.
SOFSTER was caught four wide tucking in three deep on the first turn, raced at the back near, rallied inside foes but off the fence for the place. LITTLE
CRYBABY angled in at the start, saved ground racing at the rear early, moved out for the second turn then further from three to five wide on that bend
floating seven wide and drifting a bit in upper stretch, kept on to get up for show honors. PRINCESS ALESKA pressed four wide in the early going, eased
back but still racing close, encouraged along three eighths off the leader, drifted out leaving the turn, was outkicked for the place. TRENDY was urged at the
break but caught five wide on the first turn, pursued from mid-pack, continued four to five deep on the far turn, had no rally. AMORICA was urged at the
start, tracked from inside, was not a threat. AMIRATI bobbled at the break but recovered to be coaxed forward and press the eventual winner three wide,
prompted the leader a bit up the backstretch, could not keep pace and retreated. HIGHLADY was urged from the break, raced off the inside lacking speed,
tired.

Footnotes
TREPAT was quick to lead, set the pace inside foes on or just off the rail, moved clear into the stretch under urging and held safe. SUPER ROCKER shifted
in settling off the leaders, took closer order willingly late on the turn, moved off the inside in the two to three path, kept on in the drive to gain the place.
PROVISION was bumped and squeezed at the start, raced unhurriedly at the rear, put to some urging in upper stretch, was guided out six wide in
mid-stretch showing good late stride to get up for show. DISCO DEVIL bumped a rival a couple times at the start, pressed from two to three deep, lacked
the needed late kick. COLLECT REDEMPTION was up close outside three to four wide, ridden from three furlongs out put to very strong urging by the
quarter pole, dropped back and faded. SIX WHIPS tracked from inside, lacked the needed late kick. SPRITZER settled last but one racing in the three to
four path, floated eleven wide in upper stretch, had no rally.

Footnotes
GRANDPA'S KID settled off the pace, saved ground inside, came out two to three wide at the top of the stretch with aim on the leader, ground on steadily
and just got up near the wire. STONECOLDWARRIOR shot clear at the start, set the pace in the clear on or just off the rail but shadowed by a foe, was
clear into upper stretch, gradually weakened and was just worn down late. BROOKLYN GUY stumbled at the start, raced outside three wide early at the rear
well back of the leaders, lost more ground heading to the far turn, raced near the rail on that bend, improved position inside. EL DE CHIMI broke a step
slowly, settled well back on or just off the rail, advanced some on the far turn two wide, passed tired rivals. DOUBLE O OTTO was within range stalking
three wide from the early going and well clear of the rest, continued through the far turn drifting five wide out of that bend, dropped back and faded.
BUSHWICK BRUISER settled mid-pack racing well off the inside four deep, drifted eight wide leaving the far turn, tired. MEAN TWEETS was rather
reluctant to load, raced four to five deep in the early going, fanned seven wide into upper stretch then altered outside a foe eight wide but continued to tire.

SHARP EYES vied between runners then inside a foe but off the fence, moved clear while drifting out leaving the turn, held. SPIRITED RIDE stumbled at
the start, raced between up the backstretch then switched outside foes about the seven-sixteenths, advanced outside runner four to six wide on the turn,
angled inside in upper stretch, was gaining inside the winner but too late. KAPATUDE moved forward to press the pace outside three to four wide into the
turn, floated out five to six deep leaving the turn, was no match for the top pair. MUCHO TIGGER was among the early leaders three wide, steadily dropped
back late up the backstretch into the turn, came again in the stretch. LIVING IN STYLE chased and advanced four wide on the turn, floated six to seven
wide leaving that bend, lacked the needed late kick. BROWN SUGA BABE raced near the inside off the pace, altered outside foes in upper stretch, was
never a threat. LUBU chased going about five wide on the turn, failed to menace. NEISSA had brief speed inside contesting the early pace, faded.

Footnotes
WHATTA NOTION advanced three wide into the turn taking the lead three furlongs from home, kicked away in upper stretch then held from a fast-charging
rival. ABBY'S LUCKY GIRL was in tight at the start, settled at rear inside, shifted seven wide into upper stretch, was gaining but too late. BEST WORST
IDEA bumped a rival at the start, was urged, chased two to three wide, was within range coming past the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick.
VIROLOGIST tracked from inside, came out a path midway on the turn to pass a tiring foe, kept on evenly. SPEIGHTS DELITE switched outside foes racing
off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, fanned out five deep into upper stretch, evened out thereafter. SHORT OF DINERO failed to threaten
while racing off the inside. VISUAL ILLUSION was bumped at the start, broke alertly, set the pace shifting nearer the rail, was overtaken at the three-eighths
and faded thereafter.
