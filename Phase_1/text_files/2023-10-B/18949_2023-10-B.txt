coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. TORIGO stumbled at the start, recovered to race
forwardly placed along the inside early on, then chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to take back command five-sixteenths
from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught a sixteenth out, then got outfinished in the late stages. THE JACKAL
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. CASPIAN SEA (GB) chased just off

yielded the front at the five-sixteenths and continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. ABSOLUTE CONTROL (FR) chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, tired. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY broke a half a beat slow, chased four

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT five then four wide off a duel, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
steadily getting on track to take command seventy yards from home, then inched away late on to the finish. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF led briefly early on
before prompting the pace of FLINT RIDGE from the outside four wide, advanced and dueled from the three path through the turn, swung three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was caught seventy yards from the finish. TETSU chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. SCILLY CAY stumbled at the start, chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, offered no response. ROYAL TRYST coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish. FLINT RIDGE coaxed from the gate, raced
forwardly placed in the two path before taking over command under pressure from the former leader to the outside, tucked inside and had that rival advance
outside and knocked heads through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from the front and weakened in the late stages. BIG
BOBBY chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, made
no headway. LIFE AND LIGHT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide at the head of the stretch, weakened.

YOU LOOK COLD chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, had to alter out a path
a furlong out as RACHEL'S ROCK had to alter to her inside when LADY MILAGRO drifted out, offered up a good finish and caught the once clear leader in
the final jumps to the finish. QUICK MUNNY seven paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide advancing on the
leader to take command near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, forged clear under a drive to inside the eighth pole, dug in leg
weary and was caught in the final strides to the wire. RACHEL'S ROCK eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was forced to alter out when LADY MILAGRO
came outwards from along the inside, then offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. LADY MILAGRO showed the way in hand four then three wide
before tucking to the two path into the turn coming under increased pressure to the outside, yielded nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in and was flashed a left handed crop and shied out three to four paths while uncorrected forcing both RACHEL'S ROCK and YOU LOOK
COLD to alter out a path a furlong from home, then weakened to the finish. TAMING THE TIGRESS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. REMAIN ANONYMOUS chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. MORE THAN VOWS coaxed from the start,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, went four wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
EVERSO MISCHIEVOUS two to three wide in pursuit, advanced on the leader in tandem with FILM STAR to his outside three furlongs from home, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch seizing narrow command, dug in under threat from a trio and then a quartet and
gamely fended them off to the finish. DR ARDITO chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch, kicked on belatedly to just get up for the place honors in the final jump. ACCRETIVE chased five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly through to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the wire. FILM STAR broke in at
the start, chased just off the pace four wide down the backstretch before advancing on the leader four to five wide midway on the turn, offered up a bid
swinging six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. SWIFTSURE showed the way in hand along the inside, took to
the two path through the turn coming under pressure from a pair midway on the bend, got placed to coaxing in response at the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened in the late going. BUSINESS MODEL five wide early on, tucked inside with
nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. DOUBLE CROWN
chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.
