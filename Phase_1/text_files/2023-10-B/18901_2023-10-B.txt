TIZ TACT TOE allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in the final
strides. DUDEWITHTHEDIAMOND tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then dueled with
that one through the lane, edged ahead in the final strides and was outfinished. GRAVE DANGER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on
when challenged into the stretch, dueled, then weakened late and held the show. EIGHT WEEKS LONG unhurried, moved up inside through the turn, came
through on the two path into the stretch, angled three and four wide and got up for a share. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE well placed and off the rail, angled in and
saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. DAD'S LIL SPARK stalked the pace on

Footnotes
CEDUNA stalked the early pace on the inside, edged ahead of that one through the second turn, shook clear into the lane, then held under steady pressure.
GIANT PAYDAY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place.
EL SOLITARIO allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
for the show. SIDE TRACKED well placed and between, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, angled in late
and lacked the needed late kick. LONG RAP SHEET unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled five wide and
passed tiring rivals. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX set the early pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded late. HEIRLOOM
KITTEN mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out the final furlong. REGAL
SPEAKER well placed and outside, faded four wide through the second turn. MOUNTAIN TREE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the
second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. GOODTIME ARTIE showed little. PONT DU GARD was no factor. INNUENDO was never
involved and was outrun.
