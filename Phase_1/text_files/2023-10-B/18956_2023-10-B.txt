Footnotes
TAP THE SKY crowded at the start, was rated off the early speed, roused with a half mile to go, took over two wide on the second bend, floated out entering
the lane, lengthened command under a drive, was allowed to relax with a sixteenth left and held sway under confident handling. TIGGER ATTACK reluctant
to load, was settled off the inside, picked up his pace on the backstretch, angled out widest midway on the second turn, steadily altered out to keep a clear
path outside MS KS DYNASTY in the lane, took over second with seventy yards left and was closing in on the leader late. MS KS DYNASTY bumped and
forced out at the break, raced in contention from inside, angled out as she took over second on the second bend, came into the stretch outside TAP THE
SKY, steadily drifted out but was clearly best of the rest. DANCIN' MOLLY was bumped and forced outward at the start, hustled up to race in contention
from outside then began to fade from path four on the second turn. C C RITHMS broke inward, bumped DANCIN' MOLLY solidly, was then forced into MS
KS DYNASTY, quickly recovered to vie for the lead, moved clear on the backstretch, was overtaken from outside on the second bend and steadily yielded.
MAD WISH vied for the lead briefly but began to fade before finishing a half mile. SOLICITOR showed little.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI POINT jostled briefly with REMEMBER THE MAINE leaving the chute, was boxed in behind the early speed on the backstretch, gained a clear
path along the rail on the bend, rallied, moved clear upper stretch and maintained control under steady handling. MY LITTLE TIPSY vied for the lead outside
BACKSHOT, moved clear after a quarter mile, stayed just off the inside, drifted out upper stretch, losing the lead, kept a straight path the final furlong, was
closing the gap on the leader late, came up short but was unchallenged for the place. BACKSHOT displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up after
two furlongs, angled out some through the bend, ran evenly in the lane and narrowly held on for the show. REMEMBER THE MAINE was soon well back,
stayed in path three on the turn, angled out to the middle of the track upper stretch and rallied belatedly. STUMP was a contender from outside but faded
four wide on the bend. IT'S BELLAMY TIME raced in contention three wide, floated out further entering the lane and gave way. SIRCORRI failed to menace.

Footnotes
UH OH IT'S MAGIC was sent to move clear on the first bend, showed the way just off the rail, was roused leaving the second turn, widened command upper
stretch and kept ELECTRIC CHARGE at bay under steady handling. ELECTRIC CHARGE without early speed, was urged along from just off the inside on
the backstretch, progressed between rivals early in the second bend, swung to the outside nearing the end of six furlongs, came into the lane five wide,
battled for second, shook off CREPE YAMS inside the last sixteenth and lugged in through the waning yards. CREPE YARNS came into contention
between rivals on the backstretch, brushed with TEMPLE FOOL as he went for the lead two wide on the second turn, fanned out some into the stretch,
fought to keep second, slowly began to yield inside ELECTRIC CHARGE inside the last sixteenth and altered in as the latter came in nearing the wire.
TEMPLE FOOL advanced inside to press the leader on the backstretch, was steadied briefly when brushed by CREPE YAMS while in tight along the rail
nearing the quarter pole, failed to have the needed late kick but proved easily best of the others. MY TENNIS SHOES trailed from inside, angled out on the
second bend, moved back inside upper stretch and improved position without threatening. SECRET HONOR prominent from outside, threatened three wide
on the second turn, swung out a bit further leaving that bend then gave way. HOT CUPPA COFFEE was hustled to vie for the lead briefly outside UH OH
IT'S MAGIC, did not keep up on the first turn and quickly faded from between rivals after a half mile.

Footnotes
BLUE NORTHER pressed from outside, advanced four wide on the bend, was forced out further entering the lane, floated out some as he vied for the lead
midstretch, edged ahead nearing the final sixteenth and held sway. TIZWOW prominent three then four wide, also floated out some as he battled for the
lead between rivals midstretch and gradually wore down in the waning yards. CHARLIE'S BEACH broke a bit awkwardly, trailed from well off the inside,
angled in as he picked up his pace into the bend, rallied two wide, found best stride too late but finished on even terms with TIZWOW for the place.
IMMORAL contested the pace between horses, floated out to path three entering the lane and wore down deep stretch. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS
disputed the pace from inside but began to wear down nearing the end of five furlongs. ACCELERITAS a step slow at the break, chased from off the inside,
saved ground taking the bend and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
KRUELESS emerged with the lead from between horses nearing the end of two furlongs, was just off the rail on the bend, drifted out to path four entering
the stretch, lengthened command upper stretch, began to drift out in the late going but held sway. NOBLE CREEKER bumped with JAKES CHANNEL
leaving the chute, gradually angled out after the first eighth, drifted out briefly midway on the backstretch, was four wide on the turn, drifted out to path eight
into the lane, drifted out again midstretch, held a straight path the last sixteenth, closed well and got up for second in the final strides. SMOOTH ATTACK
bumped shortly after the start, vied for the early lead from inside, did not stay with KRUELESS nearing the end of a quarter mile, angled outside that one
upper stretch and was closing the gap on the weakening leader in the waning yards. SHEBA'S PAL broke outward, raced in contention toward the outside,
progressed two wide on the turn, lost ground fanning out to path five into the stretch, came again inside the final furlong and altered inside KRUELESS in
the late going. BRUCE ATTACK broke inward, bumping CHERRY ORCHARD, chased from midpack, saved ground through the bend, was just off the rail
into the lane and ran evenly the rest of the way. CHERRY ORCHARD bumped at the break, was forced out by NOBLE CREEKER early, angled in with four
furlongs to go, advanced two wide on the turn, swung out to path four and gradually made up ground without threatening. HALF THE BATTLE started to
veer in shortly after the break, bumped SMOOTH ATTACK then continued to veer into the gap, was corrected, just off the inside on the bend and lacked a
significant stretch response. GRAND FESTIVAL also broke outward, displayed early speed from outside, began to retreat three wide on the turn, floated out
to path six into the lane and continued to fade. JAKES CHANNEL bumped leaving the chute, showed little in a ground-saving trip.

TRIPLE SCOUT stalked the early speed from outside, took over two wide when allowed on the bend, floated out some into the lane, was put to a drive
midstretch and proved much the best. LIL BIT TIPSEY in contention just off the inside, went for the lead outside TRIPLE SCOUT on the turn, was no match
for that one when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for second. PRANCIPANTS prominent from inside on the backstretch, was two wide through
the bend and had no stretch rally. APOLLO U ANYWHERE displayed early speed, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch and began to fade after
three furlongs. BEIRUT BEAUTY abruptly turned inward when the gate opened, the rider prudently dismounted then she left the gate riderless far behind the
rest. There was a stewards' inquiry into BEIRUT BEAUTY'S start. After their review, it was determined she was prepared to start with the rest of the field but
tried to turn when the gate opened.

Footnotes
RACEDAY ATTIRE in contention from the beginning, went for the lead in tight quarters along the rail on the bend, began to float out as she edged ahead
nearing the eighth pole, started to bear out after moving clear inside the furlong marker but held on. SALLY'S SUPRISE chased from outside, came into
contention four wide on the turn, lost further ground floating out to path six into the lane, surged the final eighth but was too late. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN an
early factor toward the outside, closed the gap three wide on the bend, fanned out some entering the stretch and also rallied belatedly. LICHITA broke on
top and soon drew clear, showed the way from off the rail, was challenged from inside on the turn, angled out some as she began to yield approaching the
last furlong, altered inside RACEDAY ATTIRE when that one moved clear and continued to gradually fade in the waning yards. BETHY chased from inside,
was checked briefly in close quarters along the rail into the bend, floated out through that turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. The rider of BETHY
lodged an objection alleging interference from SALLY'S SURPRISE into the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD MINISTRY was kept close outside the early leader, moved clear when asked on the bend, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure in
the lane, was corrected deep stretch and maintained control. GOLD SMOKE chased from off the inside, came into the lane from path three, angled out
widest upper stretch, rallied belatedly but caught BERNIE LOMAX for second nearing the wire. BERNIE LOMAX raced in contention from path three or four,
moved clear for second upper stretch, leveled off the final furlong but was easily best of the others. LORD DYLAN moved toward the inside for a clear path
midway on the backstretch, angled out upper stretch and failed to have a significant response. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN chased from outside and was never
a factor. SWISS GUARD displayed early speed, did not stay with WILDWOOD MINISTRY on the turn and gave way along the rail the last quarter mile.

Footnotes
SANGFROID moved up to contention along the rail on the bend, angled outside TINA'S TAPIZAR at the top of the lane, moved clear for second, caught the
latter inside the final sixteenth and began to draw clear nearing the wire. TINA'S TAPIZAR shared the early lead inside BUNNY SHINE but well off the rail,
moved to the rail into the turn, drew clear, widened her lead upper stretch, began to gradually drift out, held a straight path the last sixteenth, did not have
enough left to contain SANGFROID but was easily second best. BRIANA HARPER prominent from outside on the backstretch, did not stay close as she lost
ground four then five wide through the bend, lacked a stretch rally but got up for third late. HEY MA dwelt at the start, was void of speed, though hustled
along, saved ground and passed inside tired ones in the stretch. BUNNY SHINE displayed early speed from outside, did not stay with TINA'S TAPIZAR on
the turn and gave way between rivals in the lane. DART ATTACK prompted the early pace but faded three wide on the bend. BLUE EVEN SCORE also
dwelt at the break and showed little.
