Footnotes
MAGICAL SURPRISE took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was hand ridden past the seven sixteenths pole, drew off under steady
pressure at the rail on the far turn then kept alert through the stretch. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE rated close to the early pace inside, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, but flattened later yards while settling for second best. COLONIAL ROAD raced in the five path the first
turn and left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and just lasted for third. IRISH
FLIGHT settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and passed rivals in the lane.
CHARTERED COURSE saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. TRAP HOLLER became
a bit anxious in the gate then stalked two deep, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. VIESTE showed
little response after a half mile. LUNAR GHOST was not a factor.

Footnotes
FREE DROP BACH pressured the pace through the backstretch and raced close two deep on the turn, was carried out leaving the turn but dug in under
steady encouragement to take over in later yards and raced clear toward the wire. ADIOS COOL ARROWS had a brief early lead then pressured the pace,
raced close at the rail on the turn, dug in to recover the lead toward mid-stretch but relented in the final yards. CAJUN JOE was hustled along the rail and
took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and relented in the stretch duel, but held on
for third. BRADLEY DO RIGHT chased outside, raced in the five and six paths on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SISYPHUS gave chase, raced in the
four path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SILVER REDESDALE steadied on the chute and gave chase to no avail. GOLD DILEMMA gave chase and
raced at the rail on the turn. HOT ROD LOVE appeared off stride and was eased.

lead toward the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met past the five sixteenths, continued close in the three path on the turn but
weakened inside the eighth pole. INCLUDE THE BEAST gave close early chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. AT

Footnotes
I SEE NOTHING stalked off the rail on the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and steadily improved in the three path on the far turn, dug in
determinedly leaving the turn and took the nod in the final strides. SMOKIN SMITTY took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely under steady handling leaving the turn but ceded
the nod in the final strides. TAKE AIM hesitated leaving the gate then saved ground racing well back, bid past the three eighths pole, steadily improved near
the rail on the far turn, angled in toward mid-stretch and finished well for third. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. FLOOR IT rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn then flattened stride. AGAIN WE MEET saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. CAPT COMPLICATED rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. ROLL ME OVER stalked three wide on the first turn, challenged
two deep toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back approaching the quarter, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened. KING JOEY raced
four wide on the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.
