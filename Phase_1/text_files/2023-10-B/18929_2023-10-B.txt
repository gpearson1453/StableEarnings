Footnotes
ON AN ISLAND set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. CHANGE THE HOUR reared at the start,
sprinted up quickly to the lead in the early going, was allowed to settle three wide outside the leader, came four wide into the stretch, then was no threat and
held the place. HUMBLE JOE mid pack and inside, saved ground moving up through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, and closed well
for the show. RECKLESS JONES mid pack, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and got up for a share.
MAC'S CAT passed tiring rivals. JUANSEN stalked the pace from between, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into
the stretch, then drifted in and faded. GRUIT hit the gate at the start and was never involved.

LEONARD'S LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. LISA
MARIE mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, then angled out late and edged up for the place.
GOLDEN SODA mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged up for the place and
was outfinished, settling for the show. JOSH'S HONOR tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to come three wide into the stretch,
then flattened the final furlong. LARZ mid pack, looped three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. MOON HUNTER
passed tiring rivals, inside. SHOSHA well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded the
final furlong. ARGYLL mid pack and inside, bore out through the turn, then had no rally. BACKDOORPARTY was no factor. GOLDEN OAK was never
involved.

FIERCE AND STRONG well placed off the rail, moved up into the second turn, gained a striking position on the two path and bid outside the leader into the
stretch, took command quickly, then drew off and was kept to the task. MORNING MARCH set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch,
stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. SACHMO unhurried, angled out three wide mid
way of the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. SANTO well placed, gained position two and three
wide through the second turn, came three wide, lugging in slightly into the stretch, angled out and flattened out the final furlong. T REX passed tiring rivals.
ZAMBONI WARRIOR well placed, faded inside through the second turn. REBEL RULER stalked the pace outside and faded into the second turn.

Footnotes
STARSHIP EMPIRE lost his path at the start and rated inside, angled out through the second turn three and four wide, fanned widest into the stretch, then
drifted in and drew off under steady right hand pressure. COLONEL POPPY broke out, causing rivals to be in tight quarters at the start, moved up quickly to
stalk the pace, bid outside of that one into the stretch, dueled and edged up for the place late. E MINOR set the pace on the inside, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, dueled through the lane, then weakened late and held the show. SILK WAR unhurried, moved up into the second turn, looped to
position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and evened out. TEMPUS allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the
second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. SAKETUMI well placed, gained position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. DIABLO DADDY allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and improved position. HASHTAG NO WONDER had a wide trip and passed tiring rivals. ROUND OF APPLAUSE well placed and between,
gained position on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. YOUMUSTBEA
WEASLEY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and faded the final furlong. GREG'S HONOR mid pack, held position
inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked and boxed through the lane. METATRON'S MUSE well placed
and outside, faded through the second turn.
