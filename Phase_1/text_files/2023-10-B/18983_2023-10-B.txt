Footnotes
LOOSE WIRE settled nicely in mid-pack alone along the backstretch, was nudged three furlongs out, keeping position from the outside horse trying to circle
around the field, quickly took control by the five sixteenths marker and was drawing away easily, extending the advantage with every stride down the stretch.
GIOVANNINO tracked inside on the first turn, watched the front two down the backside, had to wait when sitting behind the fading leader inside at the three
furlong marker, angled out three wide midway on the turn and chased the winner home but was a distant second at the line. JUNIPERO SERRA prompted
the pace three wide on the first turn, was content to sit just outside the frontrunner down the back straight, could not go with the outside flow when runners
were starting to rally at the three eighths pole, was shuffled back between horses in midturn and determinedly re-rallied on the fence to get up and capture
third money. RUNAWAY CHARLIE co-trailed on the inside in the early stages of the race, angled outside in the five path gaining momentum at the top of the
lane and ran down the stretch offering a mild finish to pass a fading rival for the minor share in the end. ENAHM was off a step slow on the break, stalked
near the rear on the rail, made an early move for the lead four wide trying to circle around runners, could not go on with the winner with at the quarter pole
and stalled in mid-stretch. BIG SHOOTER co-trailed on the outside for most of the race, swung outside in the six path straightening out for home and could
not find more running down the lane. JAGGERSGOTAGUN took this field into the first turn under a snug hold, continued setting an honest pace while mildly
pressed outside down the back straight. offered no resistance on the fence when quickening rivals circled outside at the three furlong marker, gave way
through the final turn and was empty for the run to the wire.

SOVEREIGN CAUSE was bumped in the early going, settled off the leaders in behind just off the fence, came out in upper stretch seeking room and carried
out by the drifting leader, contended between runners then spurted clear late. TREBUCHET was prominent for the very early going then settled and dropped
back toward the rear racing outside, came again making a five wide move on the turn, bid and took a narrow and brief lead in mid-stretch but was outkicked.
CELENTANO was bumped into a rival soon after the start, tracked from between runners in the second flight into the turn racing three wide on that bend,
was forced out in upper stretch by the drifting leader and ran on. ASTAPOVO moved forward inside under mild coaxing to take the lead, set the pace inside
but just off the fence, drifted out several paths in upper stretch and was outfinished. CADFAEL settled off the pace, waited briefly coming to the quarter pole
racing in behind runners and off the fence, shifted ten wide in upper stretch and ran on. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN had the early lead but was soon outpaced,
pursued the leading pair from outside the second flight four wide on the turn, was between runners in upper stretch and in contention but lacked the needed
late kick. DATS TRUE LOVE broke a step slowly, raced at the back and was not a threat. TODAY came in soon after the start bumping a rival then moved
forward between runners, pressed the pace about three wide, was in tight in upper stretch, clipped heels and stumbled badly, dropping back to last.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF TODAY AGAINST BOTH CELENTANO AND ABSOLUTE
CHAIRMAN ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, ASTAPOVO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED LAST BEHIND TODAY FOR CAUSING
INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
MIGHTY SEA stalked on the rail in the third flight down the backside, had nowhere to go when stuck behind horses with five sixteenths to run, continued to
look for running room at the top of the stretch inside, finally found a seam in the two path at the furlong pole, quickly burst between runners and closed with
a flurry to get the win on the last jump. MORE THAN FIVE settled in the third flight stalking on the outside, started to rally, getting the jump on the winner
three wide in midturn, loomed in the four path turning for home, seized control outside at the eighth pole and ran on the finish but just lost the nod at the
wire. HUNGRY WOLF was void of speed trailing the field in the early going, made little progress throughout the turn, swung out widest in the five path at the
top of the lane, found his best stride to the wire and closed well to be a clear third at the finish line. CLASSIC DANCER had a good position on the fence
watching the engaging duo at the half, crept closer to the leaders running on the turn, shifted out to be in the mix three wide turning for home but was
outfinished down the lane and settled on the fringes in the end. SOCIETY'S THUNDER had his head narrowly in front running down the backside, battled
inside for the top spot around the bend, fought on gamely on the fence in upper stretch, could not find more late and retreated in deep stretch.
UNCAPTURED MOMENT broke out at the start, was under right handed encouragement to keep straight and get involved down the backstretch, tracked
the contesting pair at the half, was hard ridden between foes at the quarter pole, could not match strides with rivals and weakened between runners in
mid-stretch. FIELD HOCKEY prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, dueled outside for the front throughout the turn, arguably had a slim
advantage between foes at the top of the lane and emptied out between horses backing through the field at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
DERZKII settled not too far off the leaders shifting in to the two path tracking in behind, took closer order two to three deep on the far turn, came out at the
top of the stretch for room and with momentum, struck the lead by the furlong marker and drew clear. STEAK AND CHEESE moved to the front to set the
pace racing two to three wide and with inside pressure, was clear turning for home, no match for the winner but held second. ROCKET JOE COPPER
settled off the pace in the three path, advanced between runners three then four wide on the far turn, came out eight wide in upper stretch, was gaining but
too late. KIDDIE HOLIDAY was unhurried early racing at the rear, switched out and advance four to five wide on the far turn, kept on but needed more.
SUNSPEAR settled mid-pack inside, raced two wide on the far turn, ran on. READY HERO was unhurried outside a foe at the back early, still had much to
do three to four wide on the second turn, passed tired rivals to improve. CHAIRMAN BOB was within range three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick.
MAD DOG N JOE stalked in behind three to four deep, ridden by the quarter, failed to rally. RELIABILITY settled at the back early, advanced inside late up
the backstretch into the far turn but lacked room at the three-eighths, steadied at the five-sixteenth while being shuffled well back, moved out to pass a tiring
rival at that juncture and was left with too much to do. HALF LIT was caught four to five wide and prominent into the first turn, steadily retreated between
rivals back to last by the far turn and racing nearer the rail, came out for the drive, ran on. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) failed to threaten racing mostly three wide
on the turns. MONSTRODAMOUS was close early three to four wide, dropped back to mid-pack, ridden along by the five-sixteenths but faded. TARADAR
pressed the pace from inside, dropped back tired.

Footnotes
NAPTOWN advanced smartly between foes along the backside nearing the half for a good position tracking the front quartet, slipped through on the fence in
fence turn starting to lengthen stride, angled outside three wide with run at the quarter pole, cruised to the lead outside four wide turning for home and drew
off convincingly in the final furlong. WAGNER watched the front pair four wide outside horses entering the turn, kept pace with the leaders four wide around
the bend, shifted outside just a touch more in the five path for the drive, chased the winner in vain down the stretch but finished up well enough and was a
clear second crossing the line. FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN argued for the lead inside down the back straight, continued dueling outside up front around the turn,
was collared outside by the winner turning for home and stubbornly fought to the wire to hold comfortably for the show in the end. BEYOND ADVERSITY
settled near the rear early on, progressed outside runners down the backside, start a rally midway on the turn picking up horses four wide, was in range for
a share at the top of the stretch and closed in for a minor share not switching leads to the finish. FIFTY B M G tracked the front foursome on the outside at
the half, was urged for more five sixteenths from home, could not quicken as much with the winner inside around the turn, but was in the mix behind the
leaders in the three path straightening out for the drive and mildly finished up to the wire just losing the battle for the minors. HAWKESBURY contested for
the lead on the rail down the backside, dueled inside up front through the turn, began to weakened on the fence in upper stretch still in contention and faded
inside in deep stretch. ROSCAR travelled on the rail in midpack down the back straight, came under a ride with rivals on either side making little headway
around the bend and had little to give finishing up down the stretch. LAKEFIELD hopped on the break, travelled near the rear outside in the beginning,
angled to the rail midway down the backstretch to save ground, offered a mild run between horses midpoint on the turn but stalled at the furlong marker
posing no threat at the finish line. MOTION GRANTED stalked near the rear outside foes, was asked for more three furlongs from the prize but backed away
on the turn and showed some late interest in the stretch passing tired runners. JO DADDY chased three wide between rivals into the turn, was scrubbed on
with five sixteenths to go, could not accelerate with others and yielded on the fence at the furlong pole. CATHOLIC JACKIE travelled in midfield on the rail in
the early going, gave way to runners while hard ridden on the fence though the turn and was not a factor driving to the wire. GOLD BONANZA was away a
bit slowly to begin, was steadied on the rail down the backstretch, trailed by many running throughout the turn and could not get involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE settled last but one racing off the inside, rallied between foes in upper stretch with aim on the leader, took over seventy yards from
home. NIAGARA SKYLINE set the pace inside, moved well clear into upper stretch but was caught. TARANTO TITAN tucked in behind the leaders settling
off the pace two to three wide, shifted five wide leaving the far turn, ran on to get up for show honors. JOURNEYMAN broke just a tad slowly and awkwardly,
was caught outside three to four wide mid-pack early, took closer order while ridden along past the three-eighths racing four wide, lost third late. KEROUAC
was forwardly-positioned three wide stalking the pace, ridden along three furlongs out, needed more. ELUSIVE KNIGHT settled at the rear, swung eight
wide, ran on mildly. BRITISH ROYALTY raced off the pace and off the fence, came out four wide by the top of the stretch, went evenly and made no bid.
TOP OF THE CHARTS tracked from inside, faded.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH was under a snug hold quite content to sit behind the frontrunner down the backside, waited to pounce inside with three furlongs to run,
moved off the rail going for the lead three wide at the top of the lane, drifted inwards driving to the wire in mid- stretch, was urged left handed taking control
by the sixteenth pole and was edging away for the win at the finish line. PALIO was nestled on the rail stalking all alone in the third flight down the backside,
took closer order making a move three furlongs from home, shifted outside three wide midway on the far turn, loomed in the four path at the top of the lane
and closed belatedly to get the runners up share in the end. TREASURE KING took this field unchallenged in the first turn, was comfortable up front with on
mild pressure down the backside, was collared outside by the winner in mid-stretch, had little in reserve offering no resistance and faded late saving the
show award. COLLECTIVE FORCE smartly got to the rail saving ground stalking near the back on the first turn, patiently improved weaving through horses
running around the final bend, sat behind rivals in the three path in range for a share of the prize at the top of the lane and finished with intent down the
stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. CALL CURT settled near the back three wide in the beginning, started to rally splitting horses three wide at the
three furlong marker, angled out with momentum in the six path turning for home and was one paced to the finish line. WINSTON BLUE travelled in
mid-pack on the rail down the backstretch, advanced smartly on the rail through the final turn to be in range inside turning for home but could not find more
late and stalled in the final sixteenth losing. CHAMBER MUSIC travelled in midfield on the outside in the early stages of the race, was roused to go three
eighths from the wire between rivals, offered little response and showed some interest through the lane to pass weary foes in the final sixteenth. EXUDE
trailed the field for the first part of the race, advanced on the fence catching up to the pack at the quarter marker, continued to have clear run up the rail at
the top of the stretch but could not get involved driving to the wire. STOWAWAY tracked outside four deep on the first turn, made little progress outside
horses four wide down the back straight, came under a vigorous ride midway on the final turn with others on each side and gave way when losing his path in
mid-stretch. AVOMAN was allowed to settle having one beat down the backside, started to pick up runners four wide at the quarter pole, swung out widest
in the eight path straightening out for the drive but could not get involved running to the finish. STOLEN MONEY chased the pacesetter down the
backstretch, was scrubbed on to go after the leader three furlongs from the wire, offered little run, lost positions around the final turn and faltered in upper
stretch. PERFECT SPEIGHTY down the backstretch stalked on the outside settling near the rear, offered a brief turn of foot circling around four wide
outside horses three furlongs out, shifted out to the seven path for the drive, could not sustain the run and stopped in the final furlong. GREEN FLEET
tracked three wide between foes on the first turn, stalked outside in the third flight down the backstretch, was urged for more three furlongs out, offered little
response and backed through the field on the far turn.

Footnotes
HALAGA broke on top, was soon clear, shifted in setting the pace but off the rail in the two to three path, drew away in the stretch. MACHINA exchanged a
minor bump and was in a bit tight at the start, settled off the pace, advanced steadily two to four wide between rivals late on the turn and in the stretch,
gained the place. MI CORAZON exchanged bumps and was in tight in the early going, moved out a bit in the stretch, gained show. GOLDEN SUZIE chased
from inside a foe on or just off the rail, had no extra. CLOUD STORAGE exchanged bumps and was in tight behind and between runners early, raced three
to four wide on the turn, swung out six deep, kicked on mildly. GOOGLY EYES chased from outside two to three wide, weakened. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN
was mid-pack going four wide on the turn, failed to rally. OLD SECRETS failed to threaten while racing off the inside. TIS A PITY was bumped around
between runners and in tight early, altered out, raced four to five wide on the turn, failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK missed the break at the start, was allowed to find her feet down the backstretch, improved on the fence getting good position at the three
eighths pole, shifted out to challenge three wide at the quarter pole, loomed in the four path at the top of the lane and gamely outfinished the boys in deep
stretch to get up at the wire for the victory. JAZZ HANDS seized command from the onset, dictated the pace down the backside, opened up mildly on the
chasing rival through the turn, was engulfed on either side at the furlong marker, found more late and resurged at the wire just losing in a photo with a gutsy
front end effort. FLAG OF HONOUR (AUS) was away slowly trailing down the backside, made a strong move around the turn on the fence to contend for the
lead straightening out for home, took command on the rail at the eighth pole but needed more late and was caught a few jumps before the wire holding for
third in the end. SENBEI tracked outside down the backstretch, kept pace with the leaders running four wide throughout the turn, shifted outside in the five
path turning for home, was gaining steadily to the wire, could not get to the top pair in time and just missed with a late surge for the show share in the end.
OLD CHESTNUT settled close to the back three wide between horses, could still see the field travelling around the bend and rallied, showing good late
energy on the fence finding his best stride in deep stretch. SECRET RESERVE stalked near the back of the pack in the beginning, began to pick up runners
on the rail with two furlongs remaining, showed late interest down the stretch but was outkicked by others in the last sixteenth. SOUPER WATSON was in
the middle of the pack in the two path in the early going, had to wait behind plus between runners three furlongs from the line, offered a mild move when
clear four wide at the quarter pole and finished up willingly on the outside crossing the wire. ROCKCREST stumbled at the start, recovered to chase the
pacesetter around the turn, was in the hunt three wide driving to the finish, battled courageously in upper stretch but wilted with a sixteenth left to run.
SILENT RUNNER stalked near the rear four wide outside down the backstretch, could no making any gain running three wide on the turn and could not
reach contention in the stretch drive. ROARING FORTIES travelled in midfield four deep down the backside, offered a brief run four wide three furlongs from
the wire, could not find more running around the bend and gave way five wide at the quarter pole.

GRACEFUL FIGHTER tracked from inside, shifted five wide leaving the turn, took aim and powered past. LOBBY BAR settled at the back, shifted in on the
turn, cut the corner, bid inside in mid-stretch but was second best. ADELAIDE COURT vied inside but off the fence, yielded late. RIVER OF BABYLON
settled at the back, saved ground, improved position inside. MIA AND ME chased from between runners, moved out from four to seven wide turning for
home and ran on. BENLION dropped back early, raced outside at the back four wide into the turn, fanned eight deep for the drive and ran on. GRAND
AMBITION vied for the lead three wide, weakened. AIR FORCE RESERVE raced outside five wide through the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE chased from between runners two to three wide into and on the turn, had to tap on the brakes slightly near the five-sixteenths,
came out for the drive and was not a threat. BET N WIN chased from between runners three wide, steadied about the seven-sixteenths, had no late bid.
MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE was up close four wide, in a bit tight at the top of the stretch, faded.
