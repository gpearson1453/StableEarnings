Footnotes
ROYAL MAHOGANY broke awkwardly and lunged outward into Trappe The Bold then accelerated to the front approaching the three eighths pole, drew
clear past the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the turn and was ridden out under a hand ride. POLITICAL DECISION had a brief early lead then gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and couldn't improve in the lane. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND chased toward the inside,
eased outward through the turn and entered the stretch widest, dug in the final furlong and took third under the wire. DANCIN IN DUBAI ducked in and
made contact with Trappe the Gold leaving the gate, gave chase outside, raced in the five path on the turn and was nipped from third under the wire.
BUBBA G chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. TRAPPE THE GOLD was pinched back and jostled soundly at the start but
steadily improved his position, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. DINNER BELL gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn
and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
RRACE DAY WARRIOR stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead past the
quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and was kept sharp through the stretch. NO FOOLING DUDE took a quick lead and moved in to rate the pace,
came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was met past the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane
and just lasted for second. FORT FORTITUDE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail, eased out entering the stretch and just missed third in an even finish. MOON OVER MONTANA saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. ELEVATED FOREVER saved ground off the pace, gave
chase from the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. EISELE raced in the three path the opening turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY raced in the four path the first turn, bid from the three eighths pole but weakened in the five path on
the far turn. ATTENTIVE rounded the first turn in the five path and raced wide.

RIDE THE RAPIDS rated the early pace inside but was met into the backstretch and raced close from that point, recovered the advantage toward the five
sixteenths pole, contested the rail on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. MARQUET CLASSIC came away awkwardly and exchanged
contact with Looking For Flare at the break, stalked from the four path the first turn, took the lead into the backstretch but was met toward the five sixteenths
pole, continued close two deep on the far turn, flattened inside the sixteenth pole but held on for second. HOLY HIP rated close inside on the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for third. DIAL FOR LOVE stalked from
the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in the stretch duel for third. ALL
THE WAY MAE saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LOOKING FOR FLARE veered outward and
exchanged contact with Marquet Classic leaving the gate, raced in the five path on the first turn and never factored. HONEYCAMP raced off the rail on the
first turn and was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
SING A LULLABYE rated the early pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, drifted under a left hand drive leaving the turn, varied paths
through the upper stretch, though, held on well with steady handling. COWGIRL ATTITUDE chased through the backstretch and raced off the rail on the
turn, steadied at the heels of the errant path of Sing A Lullabye into the lane, lugged in mid-stretch and was outfinished later yards.
KNOBIESMAGICSONDE chased inside and raced near the rail on the turn, steadied in tight at the rail mid-stretch but came again and finished well. BLUE
MOUNTAIN chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and flattened in the lane. GLOBAL EMPRESS chased, raced two deep on
the turn and showed little in the lane. MICHEAUX gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened. FIFTY GRAY SHADES gave chase and raced in
the five path on the turn. PATTI BLUE EYES gave chase and rounded the turn about the six path. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected claims of foul
against the riders of both Sing A Lullabye, for interference leaving the turn, and Cowgirl Attitude for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the riders of Cowgirl
Attitude and Knobiesmagicsonde respectively.

Footnotes
URBAN BANDIT stalked the early leader two deep then took over toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the
three eighths pole, drew clear at the rail into the far turn and held on well with steady handling. MUD BUG was reluctant to load then saved ground, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. MASTER THIS stalked from the three path, picked up the chase
approaching the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back nearing the head of the lane and flattened inside the eighth pole. CHROME HEIR raced well off
the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved his position in the six path on the far turn, but showed little in the lane. VOLIERO raced in the four
path early then stalked through the front stretch, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded from the five sixteenths. PURSUING PACE left the
second turn outside and gave chase from that point, but weakened approaching the far turn. UNION LEAGUE took the lead and moved to the inside on the
first turn and raced with the early pace, was met approaching the three quarter pole, dropped back into the second turn and gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, but weakened nearing the far turn.

GOLD FIBER took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, drifted toward mid-stretch then lugged in
late and held on. HARDLY EVER BETTER had a brief early lead then pressured the pace, raced close off the rail on the turn, angled in from the heels of
Gold Fiber mid-stretch then steadied at the rear of that one late stretch. TURTLE DOVE chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, angled
out leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. JUBA BOUND was kept in check near the rail through most of the backstretch, started a bid past the five
sixteenths pole, angled to the three path midway on the turn but flattened stride mid-stretch. RIVER WARRIOR RVF gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. MAKIN' GOLD gave chase, entered the turn about the four path, left the turn in the six path
and showed little more. DIXIE YODELER came away a bit rank and raced well back early. LEMONSONDESURPRISE gave chase through the backstretch,

Footnotes
NORLANDER stalked inside, gave chase past the three eighths pole and entered the far turn at the rail, angled to the five path approaching the head of the
lane then dueled through the final sixteenth and edged clear nearing the wire. ROYAL AIR FORCE settled in the three path early, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and challenged from the five sixteenths, raced close two deep on the far turn and dueled to a brief slim lead mid-stretch, but relented later
yards. ICETECA saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out into the lane and
dug in to take third the final yards. IRISH KING took over and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure approaching the three eighths
pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. CAIRO BREEZE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole then flattened in the five path of the far turn. LORD GRANDE broke a step slow and loped along well back. DOUBLE MAKER
rated close to the early pace about the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn and was eased.
