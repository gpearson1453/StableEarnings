Footnotes
SCORCHED sped to the front to set the pace down the back stretch, maintained an easy hand ride while clearing the turn then kept on down the stretch
while drifting out late and was determined to win in the end. RB MALEXIS stalked the leader from the inside, was under a long drive leaving the turn then
attempted to take over in late stretch, steadied slightly and was best for second in the end. HONEY PROOF stalked the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, then settled back to third position on the turn and held the show prize in the end. QUICK RAE AA chased the pace while three wide then bid on
the turn but came up evenly in the stretch. WMA BIG BABY chased the pace while four wide, then bid in the upper stretch and came up empty. RB
HASHTAG stalked the pace from the three path early then lost ground on the turn and continued to flatten out in the stretch. RB MUNCHIE settled along the
inside at the back and was no threat. UPTOWN RINGOFFIRE waited in the gate at the start and was always behind the field. There was a STEWARD'S
INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION, The rider of RB MALEXIS claimed foul against the rider of SCORCHED for interference in late stretch. After
reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish. SCORCHED officially set a new track record.
