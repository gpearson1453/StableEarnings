Footnotes
HOBNOBIN GENERAL stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, bid near mid-turn while in the three path, hooked up with the
runner-up through late turn and into the lane, inched away from that one outside the eighth pole then continued to slowly widen to the wire. RUN AWAY
ROJO pressed the two wide down the backstretch, moved to the lead into the turn, was joined by the winner soon after, dueled with that one into the lane
then could not keep up. BASSCOAT set the pace while under pressure until near the half-mile pole, dropped out from the pacesetters into mid-turn, stayed
on through the final three-eighths and was gaining on the place rival late. BULLBRIAR trailed the three rivals throughout while moving into the five path into
the lane and maintaining interest to the end.

COMPRESSED ENERGY chased the pace from the two path into the turn, asked for more nearing the five sixteenths pole, moved three wide near the
quarter pole to catch the leaders, swept past that pair while straightening in the lane and widened. MOON DAZE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn,
was no match for the winner into the lane but stayed on well to gain the place spot late. SHEZA NUT set the pace while under pressure through the far turn,
was no match for the top one into the lane, weakened inside the eighth pole, lost the place spot late and just lasted for the show finish.
ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE was in the two or three path through the turn when unhurried, came into the lane from the five path and offered late interest to move
up while not a threat. NO TRUST was in the two or three path throughout and turned in an even effort. MYGALJUSTICE saved ground through the turns
and tired. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE trailed throughout along the inside.

Footnotes
GHOST BIKE stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, bid three wide into the turn, cleared in late turn and into the lane and held. CANBOULAY
was unhurried while in the three path, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenth pole, came into the lane with momentum while being floated into the
seven path by another, continued willingly through the final sixteenth and was clear for the place spot while closing in on the winner. TOTALITARIAN was in
the four path into the turn, bid four wide in late turn, got closest to the winner into the lane, could not get closer and weakened a bit late. LEFT POCKET
MONEY saved ground into the lane and finished evenly. BOLD BALI vied for the lead from between rivals into the lane and weakened. CADE'S GOAL was
in the two path through the turns and never factored. LITTLE RUSTY vied for the lead from along two others into the far turn then gave way entering the
lane.

Footnotes
HARD TRUTH WINS vied for the early lead from between rivals, continued in the two path into the turn when gaining a short lead, continued to hold the
advantage to the end in a game effort. TURBO GAL chased the pace from the two path through the turn, cut the corner into the lane, came off the rail to the
two path then back to the rail and was gaining to the end. WHEN'S FOREVER raced in the four path through the turn when never far back, bid three wide
into the lane, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go then was outfinished. NO LACA CHARM trailed into the turn while near the inside, angled into the
six path for the drive and moved up while not a serious threat. EYE SHADOW vied three wide through mid-turn, was getting out in late turn while rider
attempted to keep her straight, came into the lane from the six path and weakened. CHARMING JAZEL raced in the three or four path through the turn and
into the lane and moved up while not a menace. ROSAS FOR LUZ pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, remained close up into the lane then
faded. JELLO BEAN was jostled between rivals early, raced in the back through the turn while in the two or three path, angled sharply into the eight path
and never menaced. LOTTA LATTE saved ground into the lane and tired. TOUCHDOWN PASS never a factor while near the inside. EURCOOL chased the
pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane and was empty after turning into the lane. UNBRIDLED MISS was outrun while in the four path.

ZIPPIN PIPPIN stalked the pace in the four path, moved out slightly at the quarter pole, angled in at the three-sixteenths pole, held steady in the stretch
outside of a rival, surged late and was clear under steady handling. BRISBANE ROAD dueled outside of a rival, bid at the seven-sixteenths pole to take
control and was caught late. MAGGIE E saved ground, bid at the quarter pole, dueled for the place against the winner down the stretch, then had no late
bid. KATERINA PETROVA raced in the three path, was steadied at the three-sixteenths pole in tight, then bid late along the rail. MALI BALI raced five wide
and bid belatedly. FLAT OUT FAY stalked the pace in the four path but had no late bid. MIDNIGHT XO hit the gate, saved ground, then had a mild late bid.
