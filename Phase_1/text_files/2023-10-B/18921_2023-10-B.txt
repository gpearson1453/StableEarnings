Footnotes
OTRA COSA sprinted to the front, drove clear, pulled away down the home stretch and won under steady urging. SOUNDS LIKE POWER raced within
contention, came around the second turn three wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. I NITA WARRIOR raced in the middle of the
field, came around the first turn on the outside, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but held on for show. MISTER BANDERAS pressed the
early pace, eased back, came again and was outfinished for third. COURT JESTER broke a step slow, racing from the back, moved up down the stretch
and hung late. BOLD CARLOS raced in the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a late bid. PLUM WINE lacked early speed and was
never a factor. CANAL ST. CUPID raced evenly near the back and showed little. GLAMORDINI challenged on the front end and dropped back.
DADSAMUMBLER always raced near the back and was outrun.

DOLLY'S GUITAR vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. BRAVE CITY
GIRL dueled on the front end, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. SUZY DOLL'S READY broke out, pressed the
pace, raced close throughout and proved no match for the top two. DREAM TOWN raced evenly near the back in the early going, showed late interest, but
was no rear factor. TEXAS RED BEL lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, improved position, but was no threat. SOPHIE'S PRAYER raced
within contention, faded and finished evenly. ESSENTIAL BELLA raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside and faded.
LUCKYHOTSTUFF bumped at the start, raced in the back and showed little.

throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ALPHIN raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the top
two, but held on for third. ASTROLOGY WONOWON raced near the back in the beginning, had an outside trip, showed late interest and was outfinished for
third. ST PIERRE had a tight start, racing in the back, moved up wide around the final turn and gained ground. SMOOTH CUSTOM raced evenly near the
back, improved position, but was no factor. CLEARLY A JET raced within striking distance, moved up at the 1/2 mile pole and faded down the home stretch.
UNCLE CHAN challenged for the early advantage and made a steady retreat. BOSS MAN ZONG void of early speed, raced evenly near the back and was

SUPER OCHO (CHI) dueled on the front end in the beginning, drove clear around the turn, pulled away down the lane and won handily. BLACK SWORD
unhurried in the early going, raced outside around the turn, made a wide rally down the stretch, was no match for the winner, but got up for second.
TOPPER T challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. MIDNIGHT FIRE raced near the middle of the field
and lacked a late bid. OIL MONEY showed early speed and faded. MY PAL MATTIE bobbled at the start, racing from the rear and was never a threat.

Footnotes
EYE DEE KAY unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the second turn and drove clear down the lane. DAVIDIC LINE vied for the early
lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. DRIED PEPPER within contention, raced close
throughout and outfinished for second. SUPER WISE raced evenly near the middle, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ONCE UPON A DREAM lacked
early speed, finished four wide and showed late interest. VITALE raced within striking distance, came around the first turn on the outside and weakened.
MOSQUITO FLEET vied for the early lead and faded. SMOKY TOPAZ void of early speed and was never a threat. IRISH VALOR always raced near the
back and showed little.

CINCY'S ANNA unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the second turn, rallied down the lane and finished strong. RING TWICE

speed, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but was best of rest. MALIBU TOAST pressed the pace, weakened and finished evenly. TIZ MY
PLAN raced evenly near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and was never a factor. QUEEN OF THE MOON void of early speed and was
never close. CAHUILLA flashed early speed and dropped back. LA VILLANA raced within contention, made a steady retreat and was eased to the wire.
