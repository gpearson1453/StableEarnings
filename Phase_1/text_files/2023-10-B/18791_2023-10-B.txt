Footnotes
DIVINE ROMANCE chased the duel around the turn, eased out to three path approaching the stretch, took command approaching the sixteenth pole and
drew out. GET LOADED lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. FORGOTTEN GIFT sped to the
early lead, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace around the turn and weakened in the drive. LADY BANKER bore out leaving the starting gate, disputed
the pace outside FORGOTTEN GIFT and gave way inn upper stretch. PUNKIN showed speed along the inner rail, steadied when shuffled back leaving the
backstretch, swung out on the turn and gave way. ROUNDBBALL , sluggish to begin, dropped back on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
MISS GEORGIE , four wide outside a rival stalking the early pace, dropped in some leaving the far turn and edged up under little asking to take closer order,
moved to engage TRITONE GIRL with a quarter to go, was floated out to the five path while taking over into the stretch, kicked away nicely under right
handed nearing the sixteenth marker and was kept alert to deep stretch. FIVECOMMATWO , urged inside while not being able to quite keep pace early on,
moved up then altered off heels into the lane, advanced between runners leaving mid stretch and kept on willingly to earn the show. TRITONE GAL was
nudged clear soon after the break, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on nearing the quarter pole, drifted out to about the four path battling inside the
winner into the lane, straightened past the three sixteenths, stayed on willingly to about the sixteenth marker then faded late. MEETMEATTHEBEACH broke
slowly, made a three wide run under some coaxing mid turn, chased the leaders into the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. RUN RAEGAN RUN , a
touch rank leaving the gate, prompted three wide to the inside of the winner heading to the half, dropped down to the rail around the turn, pursued into the
lane and weakened. MAIL CALL gave early chase outside a rival, dropped back mid turn and was reported by the stewards to have bled.

Footnotes
RUNNING RIVER assumed the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, pulled away through the stretch and was under urging in the drive. FUN LOVIN
CRIMINAL drifted out a bit brushing ELUSIVE AGENT leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three deep, floated to the five path entering the stretch and
gained the place. ELUSIVE AGENT , brushed soon after the break, was a forward factor in the two path on the turn, drifted out a bit entering the lane,
chased the winner and faded. STAR SHOPPING , three deep on the turn, floated to the four path at the lead of the stretch, chased the winner and
weakened. VAIL OF HONOR trailed to the stretch, worked between horses and passed tired ones. PRINCE OF CAPS raced in the middle of the pack and
failed to rally. PRINCE OF PORTLAND saved ground around the turn and weakened. RIPKEN , outrun, swung to the six path in upper stretch. BODE LYNX
raced along the inner rail around the turn while outrun. NEVERFOLD was never a factor.

Footnotes
PEYTON ELIZABETH rated off the inside and edged up to be in range into the turn, shifted four wide under some coaxing into the lane, advance between
rivals while being flashed the stick leaving the three sixteenths pole, moved clear a furlong out once set down, kept on under pressure through the final
sixteenth and held sway. HASHTAG LUCKY quickly went clear, set the pace well off the inside, was joined from her inside nearing the turn, sparred under
asking past the three eighths, wandered out to about the five path maintaining the advantage into the lane, straightened away to fight on heading to mid
stretch, saw the winner get away a bit near the sixteenth pole but kept on gamely despite swapping leads to come back on some and hold down the place.
CHAMPAGNE TOAST , four wide early, dropped in to about the two path mid turn, came back out through the drive and closed steadily. I CAN RUN
stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled off the inside, angled six wide into the lane and rallied. HAINT BLUE lagged back while saving ground, angled
three to four wide for the drive and closed between runners. GOOD PENNY saved ground under some rating, remained inside making steady progress past
the quarter pole, eased out, churned on to the inside of rivals then flattened out. CONTINENTALCONGRES pulled her way forward and bid inside
HASHTAG LUCKY heading to the turn, dueled around the turn and into the lane, stayed on with interest to mid stretch, could not offer more near the
sixteenth marker and weakened. DRY WELL steadied at the break, lagged back, saved ground into the stretch but failed to menace. SILVER CURRENCY ,
four then three wide stalking the pace, was under pressure mid turn, lacked a kick nearing the lane and retreated.

CIRCLE P broke alertly then was rated back off the leaders, edged up off the rail leaving the far turn, moved boldly three to four wide approaching the
stretch, responded when asked inside the three sixteenths and forged past JOLLY BOSS, was given a couple taps then drew out emphatically while steadily
hand ridden the final sixteenth. JOLLY BOSS pressed two wide outside a rival, moved to command near the three eighths, briefly went clear under rating
mid turn, came under a ride once collared from his outside entering the lane, ceded to the winner nearing mid stretch, faded late but had enough left to save
the place. FORMAL AFFAIR saved ground, steadied near the three eighths, eased out and moved up between runners into the lane, came out past mid
stretch and continued on with effort. THIS IS GOOD broke outward a bit, bumped with a rival then checked, covered to advance off the rail leaving the far
turn, knifed his way three to four wide between runners nearing the stretch, angled out a bit for the final furlong and kept on trying. ALBERT FINNIGAN rated
inside early, eased out then was stalled behind foes mid turn, dropped in to gain past the three sixteenths, angled out then went even late. NEVER GREW
UP was checked when in tight between rivals soon after the break, gained five wide outside rivals leaving the five sixteenths but failed to sustain through the
final three sixteenths. HANKSDIVININGROD broke slowly, raced well back early on, swung five wide into the lane and offered some late action. RETURN
FIRE , bumped at the break, moved up and stalked off the inside, was lightly steadied in upper stretch and faded. HYTECK PRINCE stumbled at the break
and failed to menace. SCRAPPY T LEE , four wide pursuing, raced between foes past the five sixteenths and weakened. ROCKET DRAGON rushed up
inside to take command after a sixteenth, set a pressured pace, stayed on to the head of the lane then tired. NO WORRIES , bumped leaving the gate, gave
early chase between rivals and tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AMAZON QUEEN stalked the pace outside GALILEI for five furlongs, secured command entering the stretch then drew away under some urging. SURYA ,
off slowly and rank, saved ground on the turn, swung outside in mid stretch, rallied and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. GALILEI sprinted to a clear, early
lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was overtaken in upper stretch then gradually weakened. CUPID'S STRIKE stumbled at the break, circled the turn
three wide and faltered entering the stretch.

Footnotes
WAR MASTER broke a step slow, moved up between foes nearing the half then steadied briefly into the turn, recovered and was put to a hustling ride,
advanced to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths, angled out to take aim on the leader into the lane, leveled off to a nice stride while under a solid
ride and rolled past in mid stretch, powered away after given a few asks then was geared down through the final fifty yards. BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH sped
clear early, set the pace two wide into the lane, could not resist the winner's surge nearing mid stretch but kept on to be clear of the rest. EYES ELEVEN ,
three wide mid turn, angled in some for the drive and lacked a serious finish. MY ENDEAVOR edged up between rivals early and attended the pace,
prompted three wide past the three eighths, was under pressure into the lane and faded. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN saved ground, failed to keep pace into
the turn, came out through the final sixteenth but failed to menace. JACK CLOUD , three deep under early rating stalking the pace, was nudged on near the
three eighths and faltered.
