Footnotes
HOT LE ROY pressed the pace from the onset, moved up at the 1/2 pole and raced behind the leader, made a bid down the home stretch, drove clear and
won under steady urging. SPHEROID vied for the early lead, raced close throughout, but couldn't match strides with the winner. MIAS MOONBEAM
unhurried in the beginning, while racing on the inside, swung to the outside entering the second turn, made a wide rally and finished willingly. COOL
INDIVIDUAL raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SERMONONTHEMOUNT lacked early speed, moved up to the middle of
the pack and hung. HARD TO DENY broke in the air at the start, rushed up, vied on the front end, took the lead and lacked a late finish. DEALIN' STELEN
void of early speed and passed tired ones. NATE'S REVENGE dueled on the front end and made a steady retreat. TEMPRANO always raced near the
back, came around the final turn wide and was never a threat. BIG MONEY MACHINE raced within striking distance and dropped back.

Footnotes
CARPE HORSESHOE challenged for the lead, took command, pulled away and was ridden out. LORRAINE'S LEGACY void of early speed, made a late
rally, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE raced in the back in the beginning, moved up, racing within
contention and was caught for second. CAVE CREEK dueled on the front in the early going and faded. WATERS OF MEROM broke out, raced in the
middle of the field, came around the turn five wide and put forth an even effort. TEASE ME NOT squeezed back at the start, moved up, within contention
and faded. RIOBELLA always raced near the back and showed little. MISS LONELYHEARTS vied for the early lead and dropped back.

Footnotes
MICHELLES LIL STAR pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, was all out and just prevailed for the win. BLESSED ASSURANCE lacked early
speed, made a late rally, closed fast and needed more ground. MISS PRIORITY went to the front, drove clear, raced close throughout and proved third best.
CUTE DINERO QUEEN pressed the pace, came around the turn three wide and weakened. THAT'S MY MAMA raced in the middle of the pack, put forth an
even effort and lacked a kick. CATCAKE raced evenly near the back, came around the turn five wide and was never a threat. LUMINOUS FLIGHT raced
within contention and made a steady retreat. SERIOUSLY SAM void of early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY SAMARI stalked the leaders down the backside, came around the turn four wide, entered the stretch six wide, pulled away and proved the best.
JENNYSBIGBABY vied for the lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. E R'S MIREYA went to the
front, forwardly placed throughout and weakened late. FLYING I raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but
was no factor. GRACE'S VISION lacked early speed, showed late interest, while racing on the rail and was no threat. WHEELS LIKE NALA void of early
speed, moved up, but was no factor. SHARE THE DOE showed early speed and was finished early. LIL PARTY CRASHER raced evenly near the back and
showed little. DON'T BLINK TWICE always raced near the back and was outrun. MAGIC GRAY raced near the middle of the field and dropped back.
