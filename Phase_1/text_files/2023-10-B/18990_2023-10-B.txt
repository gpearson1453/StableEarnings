BACK TO D' FUTURE settled inside, advanced on the turn, angled out into the stretch and pulled away under moderate pressure. TAKE IT TO THE MAX
lacked speed, saved ground throughout, rallied but was no threat to the winner. ROAD TO DREAMS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and faded in
the stretch. BELLA MARIA trailed racing along the inside then passed rivals while no threat. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY raced within striking range three wide
and gave way. PEACH BE WITH Q quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn then stopped in the stretch. JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL steered wide in the
opening quarter and weakened steadily. PRINCESS EMMA JO broke poorly and raced far behind throughout.

RERALLY rated three wide, vied through the final turn, drifted in between the eighth and sixteenths poles and drew clear. WE BE THERE split rivals
advancing before the half, dueled, was taken up nearing the sixteenth pole and altered course to the outside. KODAPENDENT trailed far behind, circled his
field and was easily third best. MR. EINSTEIN dwelt at the start, moved to contention wide then faded. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM prompted the pace
outside for half a mile and gave way. LORD DARNLEY hustled to the front inside for half a mile and stopped. CAPE HEDGE chased off the pace outside
and faltered. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of the second finisher against the first finisher for interference in the stretch
RERALLY was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
RUNNIN JOKE controlled the pace, shook loose after after half a mile, repelled a challenge and pulled away driving. AFY KID settled inside, went after the
winner on the final turn, tired but finished second best. OMERTA CODE dropped far behind then offered some late energy outside. LIBERTY RUNNER
lacked speed, moved inside and narrowed the gap while no threat. BOINTHEBACK gave way after a quarter mile then came again wide with a strong late
bid. DISTURBED prompted the pace three wide briefly then faltered. EXCLUSIVE ORDER dropped back early and was never in contention. GOLDEN
WILDCAT moved closer three wide before half mile then had no further response. CHIP'S FRIEND bobbled briefly soon after the start, forced the pace and
stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

SHELL BELLE quickly sprinted clear then widened throughout while kept to her task. LOST LUGGAGE lacked speed inside, angled out into the stretch and
closed well too late. DIVINARY pursued the winner on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. ROYAL PARTY raced far behind, moved inside and
lacked a solid rally. WHY NOT BABE was urged close up inside early then began fading on the turn. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS was crowded soon after the
start then passed rivals while no threat. LIL' LATE LUCK was crowded soon after the start then never involved. ALL HAIL MO chased four wide just off the
leaders and gave way. CASH ON FIRST raced wide and weakened steadily. LOUELLA STREET flashed speed in the opening quarter, stopped and was
eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
COLLIN'S GREY LADY settled close up in the two path, bid on the turn then outdueled rival through the stretch and moved clear. MORE RANSOM trailed
briefly, advanced inside and was up for the place late. VANISHING FAITH stalked the pace three wide, moved with the winner on the turn and yielded in the
final furlong. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE moved close up inside, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly. LITTLE RED BUTTON lacked speed along the
inside and finished well while no threat. SCINTILLATING STAR rated off the leaders in the two path and lacked a rally. BABY FADE was urged to the front
inside to the three eighth pole and faded. SWEET LILLY FACTUM was squeezed back early then moved very wide on the turn. SCHNUER WILL raced wide
and was never in contention. CRAZY SERENA chased in midpack and was never involved. MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES prompted the pace outside to the
three eighths pole and stopped.

MOVISITOR hustled to front inside, widened in the stretch and remained safe under mild urging. HELIUM far behind early, split rivals rallying into the stretch
and was up for the place late. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE was fanned five wide into the first turn, raced close up and continued willingly. SIMOVITCH raced
in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then drifted out badly through the lane. TEN GAUGE saved ground off the leaders and flattened out in the stretch. YOUR
ANALYSIS broke slowest, chased wide and failed to menace. PEOPLE FORCE raced well off the pace outside and gave way readily.
SPLICETHEMAINBRACE prompted the pace in the opening quarter then was finished after half a mile.

MAJESTIC CREED forced the pace outside, took over into the stretch and edged away under moderate urging. GUNFYRE GAL saved ground throughout,
raced close up and continued gamely to the finish. MIA TOSCA moved three wide off the pace then weakened in the final furlong. BAZINGA C was blocked
briefly into the far turn and lacked a response. IN MY OPINION trailed for half a mile then picked off rivals while no threat. DISTORTED VIEW dropped far
back and was never in contention. KNOWING GLANCE flashed speed outside and weakened steadily. EMPIRE PASS hustled to the front inside to the
stretch, stopped and returned bleeding. KNICKERSINATWIST chased wide and gave way readily.

then faltered. DOCTOR DOOM prompted the pace three wide then began stopping on the turn. SMARTHUMOR earned a narrow advantage in the opening
quarter and was finished after half a mile. STRAWBERRY CONE chased five wide off the pace and faltered through the stretch.
