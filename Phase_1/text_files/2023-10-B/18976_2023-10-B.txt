Footnotes
PRINCESS BELLE was pinched back at the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was taken off of the rail midway
through the turn and loomed two wide at the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch, took command at the furlong pole, was kept to moderate
urging into the final sixteenth, drifted out in deep stretch but held for a clear win at the finish. OOPS AND DOWNS was a bit fractious prior to the start, broke
in a bit leaving the gate and chased from the outside in the early running, was steered two wide into the turn, swung four wide for the stretch drive, rallied
into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in the late stages and held safely in the end for second. CLICKING chased the decent early pace from
the inside, saved ground to the top of the stretch, offered a mild late rally and was up in the final strides to secure third. STEPHANIE'S CANDY was sent in
the early stages and took command in the opening furlong, set a decent pace into the turn, extended the lead heading to the quarter marker, was confronted
in upper stretch by PRINCESS BELLE and met that bid to mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and was just edged for third. LONGHORN LASSIE
assumed command away from the start, ceded the early lead to STEPHANIE'S CANDY and stalked that rival through decent early fractions, stalked two
wide into the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and chased three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and gave
way. MIRAGE CODE bobbled slightly away from the start, tracked the decent early pace from the outside, raced three wide into the turn, chased four wide
into the stretch, lacked a response in the late stages and tired.

Footnotes
CAPO LUIGI broke in at the start and was away a step slowly, tracked the decent early pace from a two wide position, came in a bit tight nearing the top of
the stretch and angled five wide for the drive, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, caught CLEVER CLOVER inside of the sixteenth-pole and edged
away in deep stretch to prevail. CLEVER CLOVER was hard to place early on and lugged out in the first furlong, raced in the six path into the turn then was
guided to the rail and chased to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took command at the furlong pole, was overtaken inside of the
sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and was second best in the end. LAST BABY assumed command away from the
start and set a pressured early pace, carved out decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, met the bid of CLEVER CLOVER in upper stretch and
battled with that rival to the furlong grounds, weakened in the final sixteenth and held safely for third. CRAZY STORM was prominent leaving the start and
pressed the decent early pace, pressured LAST BABY while outside of that runner along the turn, raced three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace at
the furlong marker and faded. COACH RANDY B hopped leaving the start and was away a step slowly, was hustled to be forwardly placed in the early
running and pressed three wide into the turn, kept pressure on the decent pace to the quarter marker, chased four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the
furlong marker and tired in the late stages. WE CAN chased the decent early pace from a three wide position, ran in pursuit three wide to the quarter
marker, swung to the five path into upper stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and tired.

Footnotes
LUVAHAPPYENDING settled along the inside into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and gained ground while between runners heading
to the half-mile marker, was given her cue entering the second turn, advanced between rivals and vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, took
command into upper stretch, drifted out a bit into the drive and extended the lead at the furlong marker, drew clear at the sixteenth-pole, kept to task in deep
stretch and held safely for the win over the oncoming runner-up. TIZ A TIGER was unhurried early on while not far back, saved ground into the backstretch
run, improved position heading to the far turn and advanced two wide at the quarter pole, swung three wide for the stretch drive, closed well in the late
stages, could not reel in the winner in the final sixteenth and held clearly in the end for second. RIVIERA SUNRISE was hustled leaving the start and
assumed command into the first turn, set pressured fractions into the backstretch run, contested the decent pace with NOMI LACKEE to the half-mile
marker, shook free of that rival into the far turn then was confronted by LUVAHAPPYENDING nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch,
chased LUVAHAPPYENDING to the furlong grounds, weakened in deep stretch, was outfinished for second in the late stages and just held for third at the
wire. BIG JOLT was forwardly placed early on and tracked between rivals into the first turn, was floated out by a drifting rival and in turn floated out GET MY
POINT leaving the seven-furlong pole, settled three wide into the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch,
mounted a mild late rally and just missed for third on the wire. KERRYGOLD LADY stalked the decent pace from the inside, was well placed while saving
ground through the backstretch run, waited for racing room into the second turn, found an opening into upper stretch, lacked a response in the final furlong
and did not offer a late rally. GET MY POINT tracked outside of rivals into the first turn, was floated to the four path entering the turn and stalked four wide
into the backstretch run, maintained a stalking position from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, raced three wide into the far turn, chased four wide
into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong pole and tired in the late stages. NOMI LACKEE was forwardly placed in the early running, was a bit hard to place
into the first turn, came in tight, drifted to the three path and floated out a pair of runners leaving the seven-furlong pole, moved up while three wide and
pressed the pace into the backstretch run, contested the solid pace to the half-mile pole, lost position into the second turn and chased to the quarter marker,
dropped back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DR PESCADO broke inward and got away a bit awkwardly giving the field a bit of a head start, was being pushed on by the rider from the start to keep up
with the field, raced between horses down the backstretch in the tracking group, was looking to swing out for the stretch run but was blocked and forced to
steady near the three-sixteenth, dove to the rail and produced a bold rally to get up in time. EDDIE CROSSWIRE raced three deep down the backstretch
well behind the pace, responded when asked to go on passing the three furlong marker, swung four wide into the stretch and ran on well to get up for
second despite racing on the wrong lead for most of the stretch run. DR. FLASH DANCER got away best and took command in hand, held sway through the
turn, extended the lead at the top of the stretch, began to shorten strides near the furlong pole and gave way. WART broke well and settled into a tracking
position early, was put into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, had a response when set down at the top of the stretch and ran on willingly but was
outfinished for a minor award. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE was slow into stride and lost contact with the field early, launched a rally through the turn while
saving ground and did improve position but had far too much ground to make up. SASQUATCH RIDE outrun from the break, took the rail path while put into
a drive from the half-mile pole, got into contention going into the turn, loomed a threat passing the three-sixteenths marker but could not keep up in the late
stages. NAUGHTY NIKO broke a step slow and got squeezed after the break, fell far behind and was under a drive throughout, was kept to task and passed
a straggler in deep stretch. TEAGANS ATM broke well, chased DR. FLASH DANCER to the turn, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and
came up empty in the stretch.

COOPERKLIMT was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, was content with his position at the half-mile marker, was roused two wide along
the far turn and improved position at the quarter marker, swung three wide for the stretch drive, made a steady gain on IMPACT ZONE and came within aim
inside of the furlong marker, caught IMPACT ZONE at the sixteenth-pole, gained command in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail.
IMPACT ZONE broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, vied for the lead between rivals into the first turn then took back to track the pace into
the backstretch run, tracked LET GEORGE DO IT through fast fractions to the half-mile marker, overtook that rival entering the far turn and drew to a clear
lead at the quarter marker, extended the lead at mid-stretch, was caught by COOPERKLIMT at the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the winner in deep
stretch and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for second. ALGERIA (IRE) was away from the gate a step slowly and was unhurried in the early
stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, swung widest into the stretch and mounted a five wide rally, closed well in
the final furlong, could not impact the top two in deep stretch and was clear for third at the finish. MAJOR TOM settled off of the fast early pace, saved
ground through the backstretch run and into the far turn, angled four wide and was roused for the stretch drive, chased the top two to mid-stretch, lacked the
needed response in the late stages and finished evenly. DANZ TILL TEN tracked the fast early pace from the inside, shifted to the two path into the
backstretch run and chased the fast pace to the half-mile marker, improved position into the far turn, was asked for run three wide into the stretch, could not
keep pace at the furlong marker and gave way. LET GEORGE DO IT was sent leaving the break, vied for the early lead and assumed command into the
first turn, set fast fractions while clear through the backstretch run, was overtaken into the far turn and chased IMPACT ZONE to the quarter marker,
dropped back into the stretch and tired. MUCHO MACHISMO was asked for early speed and was prominent into the first turn, went three wide into the
clubhouse turn and tracked two wide into the backstretch run, chased the fast pace to the half-mile pole, was coaxed along four wide into the far turn, could
not keep pace while three wide approaching the quarter marker, stopped in the stretch, was eased to the finish and walked off under his own power.

in the drive. DEFENSOR FORTIS was hustled leaving the gate, crossed over and cleared the field into the first turn, set solid fractions through the
backstretch run while off of the rail, came three wide into the far turn and carved out the pace to the quarter marker, was collared by DAZZLE THE
COMMAND into upper stretch, chased that rival to the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. BOOMING BERNARDO was forwardly placed in the
early stages, stalked the solid fractions while well placed through the backstretch run, improved position two wide heading to the quarter marker, chased
three wide into the stretch, lost position approaching the furlong grounds and tired. JAFFA broke a bit slowly away from the start, lacked early speed,

Footnotes
LION'S LAIR was asked for speed leaving the break and assumed command in the early running, set a fast pressured pace into the turn while two wide,
dueled outside of DANCING BONBON along the turn and disputed the fast pace to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and was kept to task to
the furlong marker, showed the way into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held SMOOVE AS SILK at bay in the final strides to
determinedly prevail. SMOOVE AS SILK broke in at the start and was off slowly, tracked the fast early pace from the inside, came in tight approaching the
turn and steadied at the three-furlong marker, chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker then was boxed in into upper stretch, split rivals at the
furlong marker, closed willingly into deep stretch, pressured LION'S LAIR in the final stages but could not get by the determined winner and was clear for
second. BACALAR was away from the gate a step slowly and was hustled leaving the break, tracked the fast early pace from a two wide position, gained
ground on the turn three wide, chased into the stretch and continued her advance at the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held clearly
in the end for third. AMANDA ROSE took back off of the fast early pace, tracked outside of runners and raced widest into the turn, chased to the quarter
marker and swung five wide for the stretch drive, ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and finished evenly. DRAW
NEAR was forwardly placed in the early stages, chased the fast pace three wide then improved position four wide into the turn, ran in pursuit three wide into
the stretch, could not sustain her run into the final furlong and flattened out. DANCING BONBON was hustled leaving the break and was prominent in the
early running, lost her blinkers in the first furlong and pressed the fast pace from the inside, dueled with LION'S LAIR into the turn and disputed the solid
pace to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. TEASPOON OF PEPPER chased the fast early pace from the
outside, raced between runners into the turn and gave chase three wide to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
TABLE FOR TEN was content to race in the second flight while two deep down the backstretch, angled out for clear run through the second turn, swept past
a mass of horses making moves heading to the top of the stretch, tried to reel in a stubborn ROBIE for the length of the stretch, responded in deep stretch
and was up in the final strides to determinedly prevail. AUSPICIOUS STYLE settled well off the pace but saved ground through the early stages, navigated
a tricky path through traffic on the far turn, came four to five wide into the stretch and produced a strong late rally to just miss for the win, while just earning
the nod for second. ROBIE grabbed the early lead before the clubhouse turn then led the field through solid fractions, extended the lead on the far turn and
responded when set down for the stretch run, battled gamely when confronted by a pair challengers mid-stretch, just failed to last and was clear in the end
for third. ONE FAST BRO was last into the first turn and lagged behind the field through the first half mile, pulled the rider closer down the backstretch, took
a five wide path through the far turn, came in tight and was held up in traffic nearing the quarter marker, raced five wide into the stretch, could not impact the
top three in the final stages and came on late. SYDNEY STREET (GB) was forwardly placed into the first turn, raced between horses mid-pack, lacked clear
running and was held up though the far turn, found clear run up the rail into the stretch and finished up with some late interest. DESHAMBEAU broke well
and seized the rail, ceded the lead to ROBIE through the first turn, continued to save ground to the stretch, had every chance turning for home but did not
go on when called upon. ARMA D'ORO unhurried through the early stages, made a middle move to improve position approaching the half-mile pole, was
unable save any ground then took a four wide path through the far turn to set up a late run, was in the mix at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed
response and gave way. CARDIFF CRACK was unprepared for the start and last away and settled far off the pace in the rear of the field, attempted to rally
six wide around the far turn but was unable to improve position. SEVENTEEN BLACK made a four wide run through the clubhouse turn to get into a stalking
position behind pacesetter ROBIE, was in striking position just before the turn for home but could not keep up as the bulk of the field quickened away.
TRAVEL THE MAP broke well then was intent on getting to the front of the pack and was put into a stalking trip just off the flank of the pacesetter, continued
to race close up to the quarter pole, then offered no resistance when the entirety of the field surrounded and surged past at the top of the stretch and
galloped home well behind the field.

Footnotes
DEFICIT MAJA hopped at the start and gave the field a head start then was allowed to find a good rhythm near the back of the pack, was patiently ridden to
the turn while saving ground, responded when asked near the three-eighths marker, built up some momentum with a clever run through the turn, swung out
into the clear five wide for the stretch run and powered on to win going clear in a sharp debut. BETTOR BET'R raced between horses in the forward group
contesting the early pace, backed off a bit through the turn then responded when set down near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out to the four path for clear
run, ran on with purpose and outfinished all but the winner. BROOKYS GAL broke well but was caught five wide down the backstretch, went to challenge for
the lead passing the quarter pole, battled a game SILVER MATY to deep stretch, took a short lead inside the sixteenth pole but was outfinished by the top
two within sight of the wire. SILVER MATY came away from the gate best, took a short lead and led the field to the stretch while well handled, dug in when
challenged at the top of the stretch then weakened near the sixteenth pole. SHADOWED THOUGHTS showed good speed from the break then raced
between a group of five contesting the early pace right behind SILVER MATY, went on after a few dropped out at the five-sixteenths pole, made a nice run
up the rail through the stretch but came up short in a good debut effort. SUPER ELLIE lacked any speed from the gate, then launched a sustained, grinding
rally three to four wide through the turn, continued the run through the stretch and finished evenly. SEEYAMIA came away well and vied for the early lead
inside, started to drop out of it with three furlongs to go and was not a factor. MOMOO (FR) was a little slow into stride then was outrun to the turn, dropped
over to the rail came under pressure and did not respond. TIMELY ARRIVAL broke well then was pushed to keep up with the forward pack, got in tight
before the half-mile pole then dropped off the pace through the turn, tried to re-rally near the five-sixteenths marker, encountered some more traffic then had
nothing to offer in the stretch. TREE HUGGER broke well and was up with the tracking group for a quarter mile then struggled to keep up.
