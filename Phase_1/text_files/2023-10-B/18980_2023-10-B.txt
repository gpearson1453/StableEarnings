Footnotes
SUMMER STORM pressed clear on the turn drawing off in upper stretch winning as much the best. DEVILISH MAGIC pressed then chased to upper stretch
proving no match there saving place. GOLD PASS rushed up outside on the turn extending wide down the lane hanging late. BELLA BASORA rallied on the
turn then weakened in upper stretch. FRANCIA (PER) slow early played no factor. THE TWO NANCY'S chased early weakening on the turn. NURSE
KATIE faded on the turn. BIRDIE BLUE was never involved. SOUTHERNPERFECTION gave way on the turn.
