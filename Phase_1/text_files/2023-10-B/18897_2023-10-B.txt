Footnotes
BOULDER BAY was unhurried while two wide through the turn, rallied in tandem with the runner-up, found room along the rail to the two path through the
lane and finished willingly to just out-duel the next rival. UNBRIDLED VICTOR saved ground through the turn and into the lane, gained momentum through
the lane while rallying in tandem with the winner, continued on near even terms through the final sixteenth and was just nosed out or the top spot.
CONQUERED vied for the early lead three wide into the turn, continued under pressure through the turn and into the lane, stepped in when roused
right-handed nearing the eighth pole, re-straightened while moving into the three path thus opening the rail for the top ones and stayed on while being
outfinished. KINGOFTHERAINBOW vied for the early lead along the inside, settled off the pace to chase the leader into the lane from the inside, continued
to inch up on the leader when that one stepped in, steadied, shifted into the three path then was outfinished by the rail rallying top duo while continuing to
gain on the previous leader. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE was off a bit tight at the start, raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five
path and was gaining to the end. MACHO ALEGRE was along the inside through the turn, angled into the five or six path inside the eighth pole and was
outfinshed. OH SO SOCIAL vied for the lead from between rivals early, settled back to chase the pace into the lane then faded. WHERE'S MOE chased the
pace from the four path through the turn and into the lane and was empty. BAKER'S MAN was outrun while in the four path through the turn.

Footnotes
MUTAKATIF (IRE) saved ground through the turns while never far back, guided off the inside into the lane, split the dueling leaders approaching the
sixteenth pole then edged up. JURA chased the pacesetter through the far turn while in the three path, bid into the lane, moved to near even terms with an
eighth to go moved to a short lead and looked a serious chance then could not hold the winner safe. SPEED WARNING was reluctant to load resulting in
being loaded without the rider, hustled to a clear lead into the first turn, continued clear through the turn and into the lane, joined by the runner-up into the
lane, dueled with that one when split by the winner and gave ground grudgingly. JIMMY DAN was in the three or four path through the turns when in
mid-pack, bid from the six path and was gaining belatedly. PERFECT PAINTING raced in the three path through the far turn when near the back, angled
into the lane to the eight path and offered a mild gain. BIG PAPER raced in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane along the
inside, had aim on the leaders inside the eighth pole then weakened with a sixteenth to go. READY PURSUIT raced three wide through the far turn and into
the four path and lacked a bid. NO PROOF never a factor while along the inside.

Footnotes
BENVOLIO chased the pace from the four path into the far turn, took first run to bid for the lead while in the three path through late turn, cleared into the
lane then was kept to the task to hold. LUCKY ROMANCE set the pace from the outset on a clear lead, was passed by the winner and another after
straightening in the lane, continued on gamely to regain the place spot late while along the inside. NEW SPELL was along the inside to the two path through
the turn when moving up, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the five path and was gaining. YELLOW JACKET raced in the two to the four
path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, moved to loom a serious threat then could not sustain the effort while finishing evenly. DADDY'S
DINERO saved ground through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. NOBLE GENTLEMAN raced through the four path on the turn,
came into the lane under a drive and moving into the six path and finished evenly while needing more. CAPTAIN'S FLAG saved ground into the lane and
tired. PAPA'S RANSOM raced in the three path through the turn when near the back and laced a response. SKYPASS chased the pace from the three path
into the far turn then began giving ground after mid-turn. SAINT HELIER never was a factor while racing well back. CALL EM KARL outrun while racing off
the inside. POND outrun while entering the lane from six path.

Footnotes
LEMON MERINGUE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid in late turn while being joined by the runner-up, dueled with that one through the final
eighth and just held. TAP ANCHOR settled off the early pace, bid four wide in late turn, joined the top three into the lane, dueled with the winner through the
final eighth and could not get past while clearly second best. FEAR AND LOATHING set the pace while under pressure through late turn, was briefly on the
inside of the two top ones when straightening in the lane then yielded to them while saving the show spot. WITHOUT OBJECTION was well back while
trailing the field through the turn, began to gain momentum in late turn, angled into the eight path for the drive and finished with good energy while belatedly.
ALL YOUR FAULT was near the rail through the turn when in mid-pack then lacked a closing reponse. FISH TAIL never a factor while in the three path
through the turn and into the lane. SHOTGUN PRO chased the dueling rivals through the turn when moving from the three or four path to the two path in
late turn, came into the lane with aim and folded up. ACACIO raced in the four to the three path through the turn, straightened in the lane from the seven
path and never factored. HOG HEAVEN raced in the three to the two path through the turn and tired.

DO YA WANNA DANCE bobbled and was bumped at the start, was unrushed early, bid in the four path at the three-eighths pole, splitting rivals, rallied at
the eighth pole and was in time under steady handling. PROUD CIVILIAN vied in the four path, rallied at the eighth pole to get the lead and was outfinshed.
VICTOR'S DEAL raced inside, bid in the three path at the quarter pole, lacked running room at the eighth pole and bid late outside of the winner to miss.
EASY OPERATOR led inside, then drifted in late. BAD BOY GEIST stalked the pace in the two path, then had no late bid. CHISEL stalked the pace inside,
then steadied late. DAYKRA trailed. Following an objection by the rider of CHISEL, EASY OPERATOR was disqualified and placed sixth for interference in
the final yards.
