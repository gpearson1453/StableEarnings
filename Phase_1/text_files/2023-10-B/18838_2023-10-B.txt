Footnotes
I'MAGAMBLER ran in the middle of the pack with a slight gain started making a move to the two path on the turn then coming onto the stretch started the
final closing drive to the wire and took the lead late into the race. CLUE had good early speed, dropped back slightly to reserve energy for the stretch, then
started the bid for the finish at the end of the turn to overtake the foes in front and continued to barrel down the stretch getting caught late, just missing the
win. HENRY ON THE RUN ran at the back of the pack then coming out of the turn took to the outside where they followed CLUE partially down the stretch
then drifting in slightly before the wire. OFFENSIVE was off slow at the break, then conserved energy for the stretch coming out in the seven path and with a
massive rally on the outside overtook many foes. SPINNING BLACK had early speed then slowed slightly but coming on to the stretch took to the rail with a
strong rally in the last hundred yards to finish out the race strong. RYDERS UP ran at the front of the pack but started to shuffle back mid way thru the turn.
BLACK EYED BANDIT set the early pace then but was wore out by foes by time they reached the late stretch. DECK HUMOR pressed the pace early on
then coming on to the stretch gave it all but faded late stretch. SIMPLY ELEMENTARY made a slight bid on the back stretch but that was all they had as
they ran out of gas at the end of the turn and start of the stretch fading back to last. THIS RACE IS HAND TIMED.
