Footnotes
HAYEK took command from the onset, was unchallenged dictating the pace down the back straight, comfortably continued up front on in the far turn with no
competition around, was kept to the task late and held safe at the wire by a diminishing margin. DESTINY RO travelled in the third flight on the rail around
the first turn, improved on the fence with four furlongs from the wire, shifted out in the two path for the stretch drive, was gaining with every stride late in
deep stretch but could not threaten the winner at the finish. PENNYJET tracked the frontrunner on the rail, made little progress down the backside to close
in on the winner, was urged for more but chased in vain throughout the far turn and faded at the furlong marker to settle for a clear third when crossing the
finish. GOOD BYE NEW YORK hopped on the break to trail in the early stages of the race, caught up to the field inside by the three furlong marker, began
to lengthen stride running through the final turn, shifted outside in three path for the drive and showed late energy to settle on the fringes in the end.
POWAQA stalked on the outside in the third flight down the backstretch, improved three deep at the half, came under a hard ride with five sixteenths from
home, could not make any headway on the leaders and tired in the final sixteenth. STORMY DILEMMA tracked the pacesetter on the outside in the first
turn, could not keep pace with others starting to move forward at the half, roused but made little impact on the final turn and had little to show in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
CINNAMON BITS moved to the fore soon after the start, set the pace inside on or just off the rail shadowed by a rival, edged away a bit in upper stretch,
drifted in and out just a tiny bit through the stretch and held sway while being kept to the task. MRS. C tracked from inside, sought room in behind the
eventual winner through the length of the stretch, pushed out in late stretch brushing a foe lightly and with the riding crop near that rival's head.
PRINCESSONAMISSION pressed the eventual winner racing two to three wide, was brushed in late stretch and impeded by that rival's crop. TAG TEAM
was encouraged along three furlongs from home racing off the rail in about the three path on the turn, ran evenly. GOOD NEWS MONEY brought up the
rear racing off the rail, made no impact. MARDENE chased from outside three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF PRINCESSONAMISSION AGAINST MRS. C ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND
PLACED THIRD BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
NOVEL emerged from the foursome to have the lead alone with seven sixteenths remaining, set the fractions while not pressured through the turn, opened
up on the closing in rival when encouraged right handed at the furlong pole and comfortably cruised home for the victory. SWEET CHARLIZE tracked the
foursome up front on the inside down the back straight, rated kindly behind the lead trio three furlongs from the line, rallied splitting foes at the quarter pole,
was in range in the four path turning for home and ran on willingly down the stretch to get up for the place share besting the rest at the wire.
MOMUNNYFOR RO contested the pace three wide with horses on either side down the backstretch, chased the frontrunning winner throughout the turn,
loomed the only threat in the three path at the top of the lane, was repelled at the furlong marker and could not hold on late for the place share in the end.
MRS. HOT SHOT dueled for the lead between foes in the two path down the back straight, was nudged inside three furlongs from home, could not match
strides with the others running on the turn and resurged on the rail in mid -stretch to get a minor role at the wire. RYO AMAZING broke sharp, contested the
early pace four deep in the beginning, was the first of the foursome to back off at the half mile marker, offered a mild run three wide outside rivals at the
three eighths marker but needed more turning for home and stalled in upper stretch. MRS. BENJAMIN was off just a step slow to begin, watched the front
quartet on the outside in the early going, could not keep up with rivals seeing the field at the half mile marker, made little impression running around the
bend and could not get involved the drive to the finish.

Footnotes
SOUPER SINCLAIR settled off the pace outside, went four then five wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, drove clear. LIVIN ON LUV broke on
top but was immediately put under restraint and taken back, raced off the pace, swung six wide, gained the place. GRACE ON THE GREEN tracked in
behind, saved ground near the fence, moved inside rivals in upper- to mid-stretch in range, was outfinished for the place. HOT CARGO lacked early speed,
saved ground inside, improved in the stretch. OLYMPIC FENCER was within range two wide into the turn moving out four wide coming out of that bend, had
no late kick. MICHELE M. was bumped lightly at the start, set the pace racing off the rail, faded. GAMBLE'S ORB bobbled into a rival at the start, tracked
from inside into the turn, switched out three wide about midway on that bend, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
MASTER ARAGORN was alone setting the pace down the backstretch, comfortably led running around the bend, was asked for more when pressured
mildly outside in upper stretch, found more to spurt away and prevailed at the wire hold off the late charge. FLASHINTHESKY was coaxed early to get
interested down the backstretch, slipped the fence three furlongs from the finish, shifted outside to the five path fir the stretch drive and offered a good
closing kick reaching for ground in the final furlongs to get up for the runners up share. LOGISTICS was situated in the middle of the pack three deep on the
outside down the back straight, moved smartly outside foes at the half, chased the winner in the turn, took closer order at the quarter pole, could not find
more when the winner spurted away at the eighth pole and faded a touch late to lose the place share in deep stretch. CATCH THE DRIFT settled in midfield
with rivals on each side in the beginning, was roused three wide at the quarter pole, started to make a move, was in the mix at the top of the stretch for a
share and evened out down the stretch run to settle for a small piece of the prize at the finish. KIKITSA travelled in mid-pack between horses down the
backside, appeared to be getting out some nearing the three furlong marker, was taken hold of briefly in the turn to be shuffled back some positions and
rallied when straightening out for the drive to finish with intent in mid-stretch. MITOLE POWER tracked the frontrunner on the outside in the early going, was
urged for more run three eighths from home, offered a mild run between rivals until upper stretch and wilted at the furlong marker. BIRCH BARK hopped on
the break, trailing down the backstretch, continued to see the field running on the turn while saving ground and showed some late interest passing weary
rival in the stretch. DAISYCREST stalked near the rear outside on rivals, made little impact trying to rally four wide outside horses through the turn and could
not get into contention running down the lane. KIMBERLINA tracked inside on the rail down the back straight, was asked three furlongs from home, could
not quicken with others commencing a run and faltered on the fence at the eighth pole.

SHE MAKES A POINT soon led, dictated terms near the rail, was clear on the far turn, drifted out in the stretch, held. SILENT SKY advanced outside foes
four wide up the backstretch, was within range coming to the top of the stretch, proved no match for the winner and got the nod for second. FOXY DIVA
eased back and tucked in behind heading into the first turn, bided time saving ground through the far turn, gained inside in the stretch, missed second.
MORAL TURPITUDE tracked from inside, shifted out three wide past the quarter pole, needed more late. DELPHIA raced outside toward the rear three to
four wide through the first turn, moved out from three to five deep on the far turn eventual swinging about six or seven wide for the stretch run, kicked on
mildly. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY raced up close three wide early, weakened. QUEEN GYPSY settled off the pace racing off the inside in the three path early,
was caught four wide on the far turn, needed more in the stretch. VIVID VIXEN settled at the back racing off the rail, saved some ground near the inside on
the far turn into the stretch, was vanned off. INSCRUTABLE was taken back from between runners and switched out early up the backstretch racing a bit
headstrong, tired.

Footnotes
MOONBRIGHT prompted the pace three wide outside down the back straightaway, was measuring the front runner running on the turn, pounced outside at
the top of the lane, opened up in mid-stretch and was kept to the task to hold rivals at bay at the finish line. CHERRY GARDENS was squeezed at the start,
regrouped to be in the third flight outside watching the dup through the turn, loomed four wide straightening out to the wire and never gave in but could not
reel in the winner in deep stretch. SHAMELESS AFFAIR tracked on the rail in the early going, nudged closer to the contesting leaders at the quarter pole, in
the two path for the stretch drive was in the hunt and finished willingly down the lane to hold for third money. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was unhurried
trailing down the backstretch, continued at the rear but began to close in on rivals gaining momentum, swung outside with run in the seven path turning for
home and was full of run late to close strongly for a minor role crossing the line. CENTENARY stalked near the rear on the outside, began to pick up horses
making a bold move four wide circling foes in midturn, swung out to the six path to be in contention turning for home and levelled off in deep stretch. WAR
VOW ran between horses in the middle of the pack down the backside, was roused at the quarter pole keeping pace with others, had a chance for a share
behind foes at the top of the stretch but needed more late to be a factor at the finish. NEOLITHIC NATION tracked on the rail in midfield, advanced smartly
on the fence running through the turn, tried to rally on the rail in upper stretch, checked briefly at the eighth pole and finished up mildly to the wire.
GUNNAWIN travelled close to the rear down the back straight, was ridden for more three furlongs out, could not pick up the pace and was no menace
through the stretch. CANTHO settled in mid-pack three deep on the outside, came under a ride three wide outside runners making little progression on the
turn and flattened out for the drive. MOTORIN' MAGGIE stalked near the back of the pack, could not get interested running around the turn and had nothing
to give for the stretch run. PEACE IN PARADISE bobbled on the break, recovered to lead this field inside down the backstretch, was clinging onto the front
at the quarter pole, was engulfed outside turning for home and retreated between foes at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE sped clear soon after the start, set the tempo shifting in to set the pace near the rail, asked for a bit more in late stretch and held
safe. MRS. GREEN chased the eventual winner from off the inside, gained steadily but too late. AMBASSADOR LUNA chased from outside three wide on
the turn, went evenly. A GAME chased from inside, needed more. PIONEER'S EDGE was very reluctant to load, raced off the pace near the inside, fanned
seven wide, finished up strongly. GLORIANNIA raced off the pace and well off the inside, came out six to seven wide for the stretch run, kicked on mildly.
VERDEJO lacked early speed despite encouragement, came out in upper stretch, ran on mildly. LADY MOONSHINE was outsprinted racing outside at the
rear, swung nine wide, was not a threat. SACRED DANCER chased going three wide on the turn, came up empty. HAI BOBBI raced inside but off the rail
through the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
SOLO ALBUM took command up front into the first turn, dictated the pace down the backside, repelled the early challengers pressing the issue three
eighths from the wire, opened up when asked in upper stretch and had something in reserve to comfortably hold off any rivals at the finish. TOUCH'N RIDE
tracked in the third flight outside early on, edged closer to the frontrunners through the backstretch, started a rally between horses into the far turn, had to be
throttled down momentarily at the three furlong pole, recovered quickly to bid three wide at the quarter pole but was not match against the winner driving to
the wire. COOL KISS was in the third flight on the inside in the beginning, started to make a run between runners into the final turn, had to check briefly in
midturn, regrouped to be in the mix four wide turning for home and finished up strongly to garner third money at the finish. TWOWAYCROSSING hopped on
the break to trail, was allowed to find his stride down the backstretch still unhurried, began to pick up runners reaching for more ground three wide outside
on the far turn, swung out in the six path to be in range of the leaders turning for home and rallied down the stretch on the wrong lead for a minor share in
the end. TWIN CITY was steadied on the rail entering the first turn, had a good position nestled behind the front foursome at the half, nudged on the fence
keeping pace on the far turn and finished up evenly on the rail down the lane. FOREVER DIXIE stalked on the outside close to the back of the pack in the
early going, made a brief run four wide around foes three eighths from the line but could not find more and yielded between horses at the quarter pole.
STANLEY HOUSE was off slowly on the break, settled near the back into the first turn, made an early move four deep advancing outside down the
backstretch, dueled three wide for the lead three furlongs from the finish, could not sustain the run turning for home and tired at the furlong pole. AMERICAN
BLAZE stalked near the rear on the rail, co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, was roused three eights from home but was losing ground to rivals
and had little to show in the stretch drive. VELOCITOR tracked the duo in the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside down the back straight, came
under a hard ride trying to maintain position up front battling between horses three furlongs out and gave way at the quarter pole. RIDER AND TRAINERS

Footnotes
JOKES UP settled off the pace shifting nearer the inside, advanced on the turn moving out four to five wide coming past the quarter pole, swept past rivals
to the lead in upper stretch, drifted in while clear, was engaged by an inside foe, dueled with that one to the wire and got the nod.
PRINCESSOFTHENORTH settled off the leading trio, waited in behind those past the quarter pole, split foes in upper stretch, gained inside drawing nearly
even, dueled but just missed. TOO MUCH VINO settled at the rear, began to advance three furlongs out when encouraged along, came out for the drive
three to four wide, gained show. BROADWAY FORCE raced off the pace outside the eventual winner into the turn, fanned five to six wide into upper stretch,
improved position. KAVALA lacked early speed, raced last but one into the turn, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. SCOTTISH
SYMPHONY attended the pace from outside three to four wide, weakened. HAPPY VALENTINE was forwardly-positioned between runners just off the lead,
weakened. TAVALINE sped to the lead, set a pressured pace inside, faded.

Footnotes
ALICIA'S KID pressed the pace on the rail in the beginning, spurted clear on the fence from three other rivals midway around the bend, opened up in upper
stretch and cruised home unchallenged for the victory. TOMCAT BLACK settled in midfield between horses at the half, waited patiently looking for a seam
two furlongs from the finish, surged up the fence at the eighth pole and won the battle for place nearing the wire. NEOPHYTE was tucked in the rail behind
the front pack down the backside, inched closer when coaxed on the fence midpoint on the turn, rallied up the fence in upper stretch and was outgamed late
for the second money. MASTER SPY was under a snug hold watching the foursome three furlongs from the wire, lacked running room behind the leaders at
the quarter pole, swung outside for a clear run in the six path at the furlong marker and was gaining late but could do no better than a minor share at the
finish. TRICKY MAGICIAN was void of early speed to settle near the rear, started to rally four wide at the quarter marker, swung out with run in the seven
path at the top of the lane and finished up willingly outside horses down the stretch. CHANCEL forced the pace three wide between rivals, could not go on
the winner midway on the turn, fought on gamely with runners on either side until the eighth pole and tired in the final sixteenth. GRAND ALLIANCE stalked
at the back in the early stages, offered a brief run three wide on the outside three eighths from the line and could not be a presence driving to the finish.
CRAFTY CONQUEST had a slim advantage in the two path on the outside down the back straight, was relegated to chasing the winner a quarter mile from
home, could not find more in the lane and faltered with a furlong to go. COMMANDER TOM tracked behind the engaging four leaders with a half remaining,
had little to offer on the turn, backed through the field with five sixteenths from the wire and emptied out at the top of the stretch. SHAKOO MAKOO was in
the mix up front outside four deep at the half,, continued to chase outside at the quarter pole and stopped in deep stretch. EXECUTIVE SIGHT was bumped
soundly on the break, trailed down the backside, stalked at the back on the rail on the turn and lacked a rally on the fence to the finish line.
