Footnotes
BRACCESCA set the pace in the two path, drew clear rounding the turn and held well clear under a drive. DANCING BULLET broke inwardly into the gap
and had the path taken away by the winner following that inward move, trailed inside, edged closer two and three wide around the turn, swung eight wide
turning for home, lugged in under left-handed urging, straightened out under a hand ride and closed for the place. SKYLANE settled off the pace while
racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and stayed on for a share. DREAM BELIEVER chased the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the
lane and faded. ADIOS FRANK failed to menace while racing two wide. THAT MAGIC MOMENT checked at the start, raced four wide and never
threatened. SLEIPNIR pressed the pace in the three path and retreated after a half. SMOOTH AN EASY was outrun inside. SIR MASON chased the pace
four wide and came up empty in the lane. KINGY was outrun while racing three wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DANCING BULLET
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
HOW SURPRISING raced up close inside of foes, was driven along the rail around the turn, bid passing the quarter, took the lead while tipping out to the
four path entering the lane, and stayed on while still on his left lead to hold off an outer foe in a photo. ONE FAST DREAM bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked in the three path, bid under a ride midway around the turn, was carried out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on, but just missed
getting up in photo. MAGIC HOOH bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace from the two path and was roused into the turn, floated out to the five
path turning into the lane, and evened out for show. VINICIO chased in the four path, was coaxed into the turn, but flattened while floating out to the seven
path turning into the stretch. KOHAKU tracked in the two path but faded turning into the stretch. CHROMOTION trailed from the five path into the turn and
never menaced.

ELUSIVE MISCHIEF pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, quickly cleared and held firm through the lane. HE'S IN
CHARGE tracked the pace four wide, had aim outside of the winner through the lane, made some gain but was held at bay. GRAND MACALLAN set the
pace inside, was collared near the three-eighths marker and held well enough to preserve the show. NATURAL VIBES failed to menace while racing three
wide. ALMASHRIQ raced in range inside, chased in the two path around the turn and weakened through the lane. ASTRAL WEEKS failed to menace while
racing three wide. NATURE BOY had only brief speed inside. UNIFIED CONQUEST trailed inside, appeared to try to leap something not readily apparent
nearing the half-mile pole, landed on his belly, unseated the rider, immediately regained his feet, galloped along behind the field and walked off. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE HALF-MILE POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN ANTHONY tracked inside, tipped out to the three path under a nudge early into the far turn, bid passing the quarter, took the lead while floating
out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and dug in to hold off an outer foe. ORGANIST laid off the pace in the three path, moved up inside of rivals from
the two path midway around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. RACKET set the pace in the two path, was
roused going into the far turn, but lost the lead while in the three path at the top of the lane, and evened out for show. MAKE 'EM TAP rated in the four path,
was ridden into the far turn, but failed to bid from the six path in the stretch. JEBY trailed in the two path, shifted out under coaxing around the far turn, but
did not threaten from out in the eight path in the stretch. TIZ A TALE stalked in the three path but gaveway turning into the lane.

ZAINO raced in range inside, steadied near the quarter pole, got through in upper stretch and rallied inside to gain the place late. ADIOS NOW pressed the
pace three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner and lost second late. REMERTON was reluctant
to load, raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the lane. SETI stalked the pace four wide and weakened in the drive. RING FUND was off
slow and was outrun while racing two wide. TIZAFASTBULLET set the pace in the two path, raced erratically near the quarter pole and retreated through

Footnotes
UNCLE ARMANDO got bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, ranged up in the five path around
the far turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, rallied outside of foes on his left lead while lugging inwards, led before the sixteenth, and drew
clear. UNIFIED WEEKEND raced off the pace in the four path, was roused while shifting inside going into the far turn, angled out to the five path turning into
the stretch, and kept on between on his left lead for place. HARD TO FATHOM rated in the two path, ranged up under a drive in the three path midway
around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. A ROSE FOR RAVEN set the pace in the two path, was
coaxed along the inside around the far turn, tipped out to the two path at the top of the lane, but faded in the final furlong. CAPTURE THE TIME stalked in
the four path, bid around the far turn, but flattened in the six path passing the eighth pole. BIG BUCKSALOT broke out and bumped an outer foe, prompted
the pace in the three path but weakened down the lane. PERFORMING ARTS tracked in the five path but backed up around the far turn.

Footnotes
KITTENZEN broke out at the start, rated in the five path, was ridden from the four path into the far turn, took aim in the six path at the top of the stretch, and
ran on to draw past an inner duo around the sixteenth. PEP RALLY set the pace in the two path, was cued along the inside going into the far turn, floated
out to the four path going into the stretch, and dug in, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. OKAY FINE stalked in the two path, was driven from the
rail around the far turn, and kept on in the two path down the lane for show. DUDEFOOLINGDARLING raced off the pace in the three path, was hustled into
the far turn, cut the corner turning into the stretch, and stayed on. GREY PRINCESS raced near the back of the pack along the rail, angled out around the
far turn, was in the eight path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. ONE SMOKIN' RITA bumped at the start with an inner foe, raced up close in the
five path, bid in the three path around the far turn, but faded from the five path down the lane. PRINCESS TENKO trailed in the four path and made no
impact from the nine path in the stretch. MERRY GOLD bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path but backed up around the
far turn. SUBTLE SENORITA had an awkward start, raced in midpack from the six path but failed to menace.
