bumped at the start, reserved on the inside, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. SECRET WISPER was away alertly to set the pace on the

Footnotes
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL set the early pace while clear, then widened the margin on the turn, then was challenged nearing the furlong marker but repelled
that bid and edged clear to prove best, driving. LUDO tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole and loomed boldly by the
furlong marker but was out-kicked late, second best. I'M NOT A BABY was off slowly, settled three wide, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, then
finished willingly and got the nod for the show award. DISCREETLY THRIFTY was settled early on the inside, advanced between rivals on the turn, then
finished with interest and was bumped late to just miss the show award. OVER THE BORDER tracked the early pace in between rivals, then made a inside
bid off the turn but flattened out late. FLAT BUSTED tracked the pace on the inside, dropped back on the turn, shifted out leaving the turn and weakened.

BEAST OR FAMINE set a pressured pace while in the two path, shook clear leaving the turn and then kicked away by the sixteenth marker and then
maintained a safe margin to the wire, driving. KAZ SWEET HEIST was settled early and four wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and closed full of
run late. PEAKY BLINKERS was fractious in the gate, reserved early, came three wide into the lane and rallied well in between rivals to gain the show
award. COUSIN BOB was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and finished willingly but needed more, missed show. LIONESQUE pressed the
pace on the inside and weakened in the lane. SYNONYM chased the early pace and advanced on the turn and made a mild three wide bid of f the turn but
flattened out. MR BOLDACIOUS was settled back early and then found best stride late. ECLIPTICALS BEAR stalked the pace three wide and then was
empty in the lane. LONG TOM failed to menace.

front leaving the sixteenth marker and edged away to prove best, driving. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to
draw clear leaving the turn, then was headed by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and could not go with that rival, second best. PICTOR pressed the
pace two wide and faded in the drive, held show award. EAGLES CRY was settled four wide, continued four wide on the turn and had a late rally. TRIBAL
NOTION was settled back early, swung wide for the drive and had no rally. MOBEER was off a step slow, then chased the pace on the inside and
weakened. NICE WEATHER chased the pace three wide and weakened. TUFF CONSTITUTION tracked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane
and was empty.

LADY AHAVA set a pressured pace while two wide, then shook clear and dropped to the inside on the turn, then widened the margin off the turn, then was
given a couple left handed pops with the crop to maintain a safe margin to the wire. BACK FORTY was off a step slow, advanced two wide on the turn, split
rivals leaving the turn, and then finished well late but could not get to the winner, good effort. WARRIOR ON THE RUN pressed the winner early on the
inside, then faded while besting the rest. DANCING CHIME was between rivals early, steadied slightly and shifted out and tracked the pace four wide, made
a mild bid four wide on the turn but flattened out. PHABULOUS PHOEBE was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and improved position late.
UNIVERSAL DESIGN was bumped at the start, chased the pace on the inside and weakened. LUCY FIELDS stalked the early pace two wide, made a mild
bid three wide on the turn and weakened. PROMISE MADE was not a threat while three wide.
