Footnotes
WILD SEAN raced on a clear pace into the far turn, dueled with another through late turn, repelled the challenger straightening in the lane, re-cleared to the
sixteenth pole then held. AUDEN raced in the four path into the far turn, continued well off the inside into the lane, bid from the five path once straightened in
the lane and was gaining to the end. FUNSTRUCK saved ground while never far back, came into the lane as a threat and lacked a finishing response. TAP
TARGET was squeezed at the start and settled to near the back, bid three wide into the far turn while in the four path, continued as a threat into the lane
and flattened out. RAMSEY raced near the inside into the far turn, came off the inside in late turn and never was a factor. WESTERN MOON chased the
pace from the two path into the far turn then tired. ANCIENT MAN chased the pace from the four path into the turn and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
CIELO AZUL stalked the two rival duel through the turn, bid from the three path into the lane, was three wide just outside the eighth pole, gained the lead
with an eighth to go then edged clear. FLOWERPECKER vied for the lead along the inside into the lane, was no match for the winner inside the eighth pole
although stayed on well to regain the place spot late. AZZARO STEEL settled off the early pace while near the inside, cut the corner into the lane, guided off
the rail and into the three path inside the eighth pole then was gaining to the end. SPOKE vied for the lead two wide and in the three to the two path through
the turn, continued on near even terms for the lead into the lane, could not go with the winner and weakened late. TOO BAD JUSTICE was in the two or
three path through the turn when tracking the duel, tipped into the lane from the four path, was well placed with an eighth to go then weakened.
BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER was three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and finished evenly. A FEW TOO MANY was in the two
path through the turn when shuffling back to trail the field, came into the three path and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SAND AND SEA cleared early while off the inside, continued to race on an open advantage while slowly widening, came into the lane from the two path, lost
some of her advantage after straightening in the lane, was asked for more and extended the lead to the wire. DASH OF SIMPLICITY raced along the inside
through the turn and into the lane, moved closest to the winner and briefly looked to be a threat outside the eighth pole then continued on to be well clear for
the place spot. LIEUTENANT KITTY settled off the early pace while off the inside, bid three wide into the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and
moved up while not a serious threat. AMAZINGNESS saved ground into the lane and weakened in the drive. SKIPPINJUSTICE trailed through the far turn
while along the inside then passed tired ones while never a menace. SINGLE HER chased the pace from the three path into the turn and faded. CHIMES
chased the pace from the four path into the turn, was passed on both sides in mid-turn and was empty turning into the lane.

kept to the task to finish well clear. WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER settled off the pace early while in the two path, was asked for more approaching the
five-sixteenths pole then moved up for the place spot and second best while never a match for the winner. LOBO SALVAJE was jostled early while in the
two path, raced near the inside through the turn, straightened in the lane from the four path and finished best of the rest. HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY was well
back while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path then moved up while never a threat. BE RUTHLESS chased the
pace while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane near the rail, stepped out sharply near the eighth pole when urged left-handed and tired. BIG
ANCHOR was well back into the lane, was steadied and shifted out just inside the eighth pole when rival came out then moved up while not a menace.
PRINCE OF PENNIES set the early pace before the first call, chased the winner through the turn and was empty. QUALITY TEMPER was off at the back of
the group then was slow to get going, trailed into the lane while in the three path then passed a couple tired ones. SMILING STORMY raced in the four path
