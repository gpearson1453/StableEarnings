Footnotes
THE GATEKEEPER vied two wide, forged an advantage in the long battle with his inner counterpart in midstretch and drove clear through the final furlong.
FIGHT'N READY trailed, gained in the four path around the far turn then sustained his rally to reel in a tiring rival for place at the wire. AWAY FROM HOME
vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, sustained the long battle in upper stretch but yielded at the furlong grounds, then got nailed at the wire for
place. UNWRAPPED tugged keenly between horses into the first turn, backed out around that bend, shifted to the five path and outside of foes leaving it,
but came under urging in the three path around the far turn and offered a mild response. ROCKSTAR RED stalked four wide around the first turn, then failed
to keep pace with the top pair while chasing in the three path around the far turn and gave way. EXEMPLIFIED made little impact from the two path.
SOLOMON VANDY raced forwardly in the three path and between horses early on, but steadily faded down the backstretch and was done early. BIG
SKIPPY hopped and spotted the leaders a few lengths at the start, tugged forward inside of rivals into the opening turn, pulled while just off of the leaders
around that bend causing a steady at the three quarter pole, then chased into the far turn and weakened turning for home.

MY GOOD FORTUNE raced at the rear along the inside, pursued from the three path around the far turn, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to
join the fray for the lead at the furlong grounds, took light contact from an inner rival while bidding entering the final sixteenth and edged ahead late.
XYLOPHONE pursued from midpack in the five path, chased in the five path and between horses around the far turn, sustained striking range in the five
path in upper stretch, bid before being joined by an outer rival in the final furlong, brushed that one while embracing his bid but, dueled into the final
sixteenth but was outkicked late. CANDY ISLAND set the pace inside of a rival while a path off of the rail around the first turn, backed off to stalk that one
leaving the eleven sixteenths pole, chased along the rail around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, drifted out coming to midstretch while vying with a set of
outer foes, but yielded to a pair of them entering the final sixteenth. MISS MOON PIE prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, led in the two
path down the backstretch, showed the way from an outer vying foe around the far turn, sparred between bidders in upper stretch, got subtly floated out
coming to midstretch and yielded among foes with a sixteenth to go. CHOCTAW BINGO stalked three wide, vied with an inner rival around the far turn, rifted
to the four path entering the lane, got put to tight quarters among foes in midstretch and yielded in the final furlong. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN stalked
behind the leaders and from the two to three path, pursued between horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, took aim at a narrow seem
between rivals in upper stretch, but was blocked when that hole was closed at the furlong grounds and chased from there. PELLETIER saved ground off of
the pace, but to no avail. SEAWARD laid off of the pace two wide, inched closer in the five path approaching the far turn, chased around that bend, then
weakened turning for home. KITTEN CALLS raced at the rear in the four path and was outrun. DRE ME LESS pursued from midpack in the three path, but
steadied back between rivals with five furlongs to go, was eased around the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
NORISKIT NOBISCUIT stalked along the inside under a snug hold, backed off to midpack entering the backstretch, was roused for gain while tipping to the
four path around the far turn, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage from an inner STANDOUTSENSATION coming to midstretch and held off that one
thereafter. STANDOUTSENSATION set the pace inside of rivals early on, stalked outer rivals entering the backstretch, decisively rebid for the lead with
seven sixteenths to go, led around the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and fought on grudgingly through the final furlong.
BUSINESS AS USUAL prompted in the three path, vied with outer rivals while taking the backstretch in the two path, sparred between horses approaching
the far turn, but yielded to a pair entering it and sustained a chase thereafter. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the
five path around the first bend, vied in the four to three path while between horses down the backstretch, pressed the new leader from the three path around
the far turn but yielded between horses entering the lane. MONEY WORKS raced at the rear along the inside, improved inside of rivals turning for home,
entered the lane in the four path and ran on. IUKA MISS bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, got caught in the six
path around the far turn and failed to factor. CHAMPAGNE SURPRISE pursued among foes in the three path, but checked out of tight quarters between
rivals around the first turn, raced at the rear into the far turn and made little impact. LIAM'S MESSAGE advanced in the six path around the first turn,
prompted in the four path down the backstretch but weakened in the five path around the far turn. MOTHER FREEDOM tracked in the two path, pulled
between horses around the first turn causing a steady approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, then weakened around the far turn.

thereafter. DOUBLE CLUTCH transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, shifted four wide to
take aim outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to range up to the new leader in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay.
TOWN BARBER set the pace inside of a pressing rival, shook clear in the two path entering the lane, met bids on both sides leaving the furlong grounds,
then bumped an outer rival while yielding between horses entering the final sixteenth. DONEGAL MISCHIEF received a bump from an inner foe at the start,
prompted the pace two wide, failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart entering the lane, sustained a chase between horses into the final furlong, but
was bumped by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole and lacked a rebid. SUMMER IN MALIBU laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted ground outwardly in
upper stretch but lacked a bid. ELI'S PROMISE broke slowly, raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. ARABIAN PRINCE lacked speed
along the inside, trailed turning for home, angled out and moved up. CHIRINGO broke out and bumped a rival at the start, trailed in the four path, improved
swinging to the six path entering the lane but lacked a rally. WESTERN COMMAND tracked four wide and gave way nearing the lane. FIRST DEFENDER
raced forwardly three wide and between horses but weakened turning for home.

TARIFA tracked along the inside, loomed a danger while tipping off the rail turning for home, split foes three wide at the five sixteenths pole, produced a bid
and wrestled an advantage entering the lane, drew off under a drive in midstretch and was put to wraps with seventy yard to go. REGULATORY RISK
prompted three wide, but was floated four wide while getting outkicked by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace with the leading pair
entering the lane, yet kept on to gain place from a tiring rival in the closing stages. SNOW DANCE dueled for the lead with an inner rival as an outer foe
applied pressure, led with five sixteenths to go, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, proved no match in upper stretch, tired in the final
furlong and lost place late. NOTA BELLE pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped two wide and between horses entering the lane and chased
thereafter. YES TO CHAMPAGNE bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted out to the four to five
path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. CIRCLING broke half a beat slow and was floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, tracked while tucking to the
three path approaching the turn, but chased the main group turning for home and faded. SCENIC BEAUTY made little impact from the two path.
STREETWHEREYOULIVE broke slowly, raced at the rear along the inside and moved up between horses in the final furlong. LIFE ADVICE took contact
from an inner rival at the start, dueled along the inside, gave way turning for home and weakened. WAGGLE PASS pursued from midpack in the four path
around the turn and faded. IDALOU broke outwardly, stalked in the five path and weakened nearing the lane. DIVINE TREASURE broke slowly and was
outrun two wide.

Footnotes
DOZEN DIAMONDS set the pace along the inside, showed the way in the two path around the far turn, drew off entering the lane and maintained a wide
margin through the final furlong. YATTA settled off of the pace in the three path, rallied four wide turning for home, sustained progress to gain place at the
furlong grounds and was second best. GIGI'S WORLD laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide in midstretch
and ran on outside of rivals in the final sixteenth to gain show. RAINING SUGAR tracked two wide and between horses, cut the corner entering the lane,
chased along the rail to bid for show entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by an outer bidder. ASK AMANDA pursued from midpack three wide,
chased between horses around the far turn, got outkicked for minor rewards by rivals on both sides in midstretch and kept on mildly between horses.
LEUCADIA stalked along the inside, took aim outside of clearing leader in upper stretch, lacked a bid before getting outkicked for place by an outer rival at
the furlong grounds, then faltered between horses in the final sixteenth. KAMIKAZE UMAGI settled off of the pace in the three path, approached the far turn
between horses, bumped an outer rival while shifting five wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. MO SENSE raced at the rear in the four path, entered the
lane five wide, but took contact from an inner rival in upper stretch and was outrun. SMOOTH WAVES pressed outside of the eventual winner around both
turns, but failed to keep pace entering the lane and caved between horses.

Footnotes
NIGHT TIME stalked along the inside, loomed a danger from the pocket around the turn, took aim outside of the embattled leading pair entering the lane,
bid at the furlong grounds, led entering the final sixteenth and narrowly held from an outer on-charging bidder late. W W CANDY lacked speed in the four
path, shifted out to the six path at the five sixteenths pole, rallied outside of rivals while hanging on his left lead in the final furlong, surged to offer a bid
approaching the wire but narrowly missed. ANGKOR sparred for the lead two wide, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer bidder
nearing the final sixteenth and held show. NELSON AVENUE tracked from midpack in the three path and between horses, tipped four wide turning for
home, then five wide entering the lane, chased the leaders to vie for minor placings in the final furlong, but was outkicked for show by an outer foe in the
final sixteenth. DUCALE saved ground off of the pace, chased while tipping off the rail coming to midstretch and ran on between horses in the late stages.
VITTORIO rushed to duel for the lead along the inside, but was headed by his vying counterpart in upper stretch and weakened a sixteenth from home.
EMBRACE trailed in the three path and moved up between horses in the final furlong. FAN CLUB saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CONDEMN
pursued from midpack in the five path and faded between horses entering the lane. MAJOR BLUE chased forwardly three wide, but weakened four wide
and between foes at the quarter pole. DETERMINEDLY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
SWING SHIFT tracked in the four path and weakened between horses with three furlongs to go.

WEYHILL ROAD tracked three wide, rallied to bid in upper stretch and drove clear in the final furlong. NATION leaned in at the start, raced off of the pace
while keenly shifted out to the five path into the first turn, pursued from the three path into the far turn, fanned back to the six path nearing the lane, offered a
good kick to reach place at the wire. HEART N SOUL set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the furlong grounds, gave way and was nailed at the
wire for place. NOW THAT ICAN ROCK stalked along the inside and chased evenly. AS ONE DOES tracked in the two path, but steadied and lost action
nearing the three quarter pole and failed to menace. CROSSING pressed two wide, but gave way between horses. LITTLE NICK broke a step slow, lacked
speed in the two path and moved up. EGYPTIAN KING pursued from the four path but yielded between horses while hanging on his left lead. COMMAND'
ORO saved ground to no avail. MOESAHANDFUL broke inwardly and made little impact along the inside. ADDED MISCHIEF broke slowly, trailed and
failed to factor. TEXAS TOAST raced keenly between horses into the first turn, checked in the three path behind a troubled rival nearing the backstretch and
faded between rivals around the far turn.
