Footnotes
SCHMEAR settled in the three path the first turn then gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod three wide midway on the far turn and
dug in under determined handling to inch clear the final yards. SEIZE THE BREEZE rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Country Charlie leaving
the half mile pole and put that one away approaching the five sixteenths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in gamely to deep stretch before
ceding; reluctantly. PERSONAL FINANCE came away a bit awkwardly then settled in the three path the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn, but flattened leaving the eighth pole.
SURF CITY GOLD came away awkwardly then saved ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then
flattened in the lane. COUNTRY CHARLIE stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the half mile pole, dropped back toward the five sixteenths and
weakened at the rail on the far turn. LOVE MACHINE rounded the opening turn in the five path and never factored. MISS YOU AJAX raced in the four path
the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. STILL THE ONE was through after a half mile.

MARKETABILITY was shuffled back at the start and settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed,
rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in to take over later yards. WAGER WORTHY took a slim lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to
show the way, was met at the nine sixteenths pole but recovered the advantage past the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through
the stretch for second while outfinished for the win. ADABEL raced off the rail on the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the
three eighths pole, contested the far turn two deep and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved ground off the pace,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly down the lane. LIGHTFOOT MISS raced in the four
path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path on the far turn and showed little further. SO RED THE ROSE raced in
the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path on the far turn and passed some rivals in the lane.
CONNOISSEUR raced with the pace two deep and took the nod at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled through the backstretch but faded off the rail on the far
turn. DANCE LIGHTLY saved ground on the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. MISS BETTE LUTE
ducked in leaving the gate and raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran wide on the far turn
and was eased in the lane.

CASTLE OF CAYLEE stalked off the rail, gave chase past the half mile pole and took the lead in the three path approaching the head of the lane, raced
clear into the stretch and held on under steady handling. CICI UNIFIED raced in the five path early on then saved ground, picked up the chase past the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out into the lane, dueled clear for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner.
URKILLINGMEBETH rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then
flattened stride the final sixteenth. ONEPRETTYTHING rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled close to the mid point of the far turn,
but dropped back toward the eighth pole and weakened in the lane. MISS WILD came away awkwardly then stalked from the three path, challenged and
kept the edge over Oneprettything from the half mile pole, but was met at the rail nearing the eighth pole and weakened. CHINA CAT was not a factor while
saving ground. UPSY DAISY DO raced off the rail early, left the second turn outside and was not a factor.

PHANTOM QUEEN took a quick lead and set a pressured pace, contested the edge off the rail on the turn and dug in under steady handling to widen later
yards. GHOST OF ALCINA gave distant early chase, raced at the rail through the turn and gained steadily to take second later yards. XTENDED STREAK
chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, steadied toward mid-stretch but came back to duel for third. ESSENTIAL MAGIC chased
through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, eased to the four path leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. LIL BOUGIE
pressured the pace and raced close at the rail on the turn, but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. OUR GREAT NOTION chased outside, raced five wide
on the turn and flattened in the lane. SHEWEARSSTILETTOS gave chase, ran in the five path on the turn and weakened in the lane. LAURA'S GRAND was
not a factor.

Footnotes
ROAD PUNCH gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths, dug in under steady handling and got up the final strides. RAISE A RUCKUS
pressured the pace between horses and took the nod past the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady handling
but was caught in the final strides. DOG TOWN ALLEN pressured the pace, raced close two deep on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. LORD CLANCY
engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch and finished evenly outside. J. WICK
pressured the early pace inside, steadied at the rail nearing the quarter pole and flattened stride in the lane. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE gave chase, rounded
the turn about the six path, entered the stretch outside and showed little more. MYLASHURRAH steadied at the start then gave chase, raced at the rail on
the turn and showed little more. NEEDNOEXPLANATION was hustled along with the early pace but faded in the four path on the turn.
