Footnotes
U S NAVY CROSS void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, racing six wide and got up in time. MR. FOUR SEVENS
vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, dueled down the lane and was caught for the win. PAYDAY TOO raced in the middle of the field,
came around the second turn on the outside, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. APPLEWOOD lacked early speed, gained
ground late, but was no real factor. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) raced near the back of the pack in the beginning and passed tired ones. WHISKEY'S
GONE raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. BIRTHDAY PARTY dueled on the front end and faded. STANDING MAN
bobbled at the start, challenged for the early advantage and made a steady retreat. YES BAB raced within striking distance and dropped back.

middle of the field, made a late bid, racing between rivals and was outfinished for the win. SHEZA CAT broke a step slow, racing in the rear, made a late rail
bid and was outfinished for second. JUST A WIN raced within contention, made a bid and hung. OUR CLOVER GAL vied for the early lead, drove clear
around the final turn and faded down the lane. REINA ACES raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the second turn and was never a factor.
CALIFORNIA CALI pressed the pace, faded, entered the home stretch six wide and was no threat late. THURSDAY MORNING went to the front, drove
clear and stopped.

Footnotes
BIG BROTHER void of early speed, came around the final turn five wide, made a wide rally and got up in time. MORO FLYBOY dueled for the early lead,
drove clear down the home stretch and was caught at the wire. AWESOME CAJUN vied on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished by
the top two, while running a game third. CAPTAINS COVE pressed the pace, had an outside trip, lacked a late kick and was outfinished. DARK MATTER
lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. DOUBLE BOGEY raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. MULETRAIN always
raced near the back and was outrun. D W STRONG challenged for the early lead and dropped back. AMBASSADOR HOUSE lacked early speed, racing
near the back and was never a threat.

early advantage, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished by the top two. NEW DICE raced within striking distance, came around the first turn on
the outside, made a late bid, but lacked a big enough kick. AMERICAN SMOOTH raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and
finished evenly. QUARTER RAT void of early speed, saved ground and was never a threat. RUSH THE COLORS sprinted to the front, drove clear and was
finished early. HULK void of early speed and was never close. CHEERFOR MSHAWISH always raced near the back, never engaged rivals, distanced and
was eased to the wire.

within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MOON TIME raced within
contention, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. CALL ME FIREY lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no real
factor. COLE'S SENSATION raced near the middle of the field, came around both turns on the outside and finished evenly. MUSTBELIEVE lacked early
speed, improved position, but was no threat. SPOONMAN always raced near the back and showed little. DOCE DE LA NOCHE raced within striking
