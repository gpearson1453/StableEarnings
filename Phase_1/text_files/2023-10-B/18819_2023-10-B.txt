Footnotes
SHA KON O HEY stalked the pace from the two path down the backstretch, bid into the turn, quickly cleared after mid-turn then drew off to the eighth pole.
YOSHIDA'S IMPACT was three wide through the first turn and into the backstretch, continued in the three path through the far turn and into the lane and
finished well clear of the next rival while not a threat to the winner. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and
never was a threat. CROSSROADSCORREDOR was off a step slow to trail the field early then passed a couple tired ones while not a factor. SLACKER set
the pace while near the inside and under pressure from the winner into the far turn, gave way readily once headed in mid-turn and was eventually eased
through the final sixteenth while along the inside and walked off. PRADO CITY was far back in mid-turn while off the inside, came into the lane from the four
path and was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GOODY FOUR SHOES pressed the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid after mid-turn while still off the inside, dueled with another into the
lane, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole then widened to the wire. D' KITTEN was close up while four wide into the far turn, asked for more in late
turn, dueled with the leader into the lane then could not keep up with that one while second best. FOREVER BLESSED raced in the two or three path
through the far turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three path, dropped to the inside for the drive then lacked the needed response.
BICARB BETTY saved ground throughout while never far back, cut the corner into the lane and moved up while not a serious threat late. EMPIRE
SUNRISE raced three wide through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and lacked the needed closing response. MEAN
ELENITA chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch, stayed on into the lane while in the three path then weakened. RED ROSEBUSH never
a factor while in the three path through the far turn. TRIP CHARGE raced five wide through the firs turn when close up, continued well off the inside down
the backstretch and steadily lost ground. QUITE WHIMSICAL set the pace while near the inside then gave way in late far turn. SUTTON'S PASS was well
back while off the inside then straightened in the lane from the eight path.

Footnotes
RIVER BOY set the pace while under pressure down the backstretch, continued under pressure from inside and outside through late turn, shook clear while
straightening in the lane and drew away. JOB SECURITY tracked the pace along the inside through the turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, in a bit tight soon
after, was no match for the winner through the lane while still along the rail but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. CELERITY settled off the pace
while off the inside, bid four or five wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, drifted down to the two path approaching the eighth pole
then could not gain further while being clear for the show spot. BIG HELLO was off the inside while well back early, continued in the three path through the
turn, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a serious threat to the top ones. MR CREED tracked the pace from the two path through
the turn, settled behind a wall of rivals into late turn, split rivals into the lane when gaining momentum, was impeded and taken up nearing eighth pole,
shifted out and was no longer a menace. GET THROUGH trailed for half while near the inside, angled into the seven path for the drive and passed a few
while not a threat. STEALTH MISSION saved ground through the turn , was off the rail into the lane and lacked a rally. SIMON PETER never a factor while
near the inside. KING SOCIAL was fractious in the gate resulting in the rider be unseated, reloaded, raced off the rail through the turns and never was in it.
DEUTERONOMYSTRONG chased the pace three wide into the far turn, bid four wide in late turn and into the lane and was empty after turning into the
lane. BLACKSMITH STRONG pressed the pace two wide through the turn then retreated through the lane. UNDISMAYED was outrun while along the
inside. AN OBECTION BY THE RIDER OF #7 MR CREED AGAINST THE RIDER OF #8 CELERITY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH POLE
RESULTED IN #8 CLELERITY BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD (3RD) AND PLACED FIFTH (5TH). AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #3 JOB
SECURITY AGAINST THE RIDER OF #10 RIVER BOY WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
CRINGE pressed the pace from the gate, came in and cut off a rival at the five-eighths pole, led in the two and three paths and drew off under mild urging.
TIZ EDDIE stalked the pace in the three path, then had no late bid. UNBRIDLED SLOPE pressed the pace inside, was cut off and took up at the five-eighths
pole, stalked the pace inside, then couldn't close late. CREEK VALLEY was off awkwardly before fading in the stretch. REFLEX hopped and was impeded
at the start, then saved ground. RAZED was off awkwardly, then improved position late outside. CINCO DE OROS was squeezed back near the half-mile
pole, then raced evenly in the three path. MY NAME'S JEFF pressed the pace in the three path before giving way in the stretch. EL TULIPAN raced evenly
in the five path. V MAX raced evenly. INSTINCTUALLY was bumped and checked at the start. HOLIDAY CITY was not a factor.
