second turn, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. FLIT N FLOT TIME raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. SWEET RACHEL void of

RANCH WATER went to the front, led throughout, drove clear and won under steady urging. CREEKSIDE pressed the pace, raced close throughout,
proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. BOY CHARLIE bumped, then shuffled back at the break, moved up within contention and followed
the top two to the wire. REDDINGANDLEE void of early speed, raced outside around the second turn, moved up and finished evenly. JAYS HOLIDAY
bumped at the start, raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. RUN ON ACES always raced near the back and showed little. JOSAN challenged
for the early advantage, dropped back and was outrun.

GOLDEN PALACE stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up, three wide around the turn, rallied, drove clear and finished well. GENTLEMAN'S
SECRET vied for the early lead, drove clear, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but was best of others. CODETOWIN lacked early speed, made a
late bid and proved no match for the top two. COROT had an awkward start, racing in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was no real factor. HIS
GIANT dueled on the front end in the beginning, saved ground and faded down the home stretch. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn and retreated. HUNTERS GHOST always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND CREEK unhurried in the beginning, moved up between rivals around the second turn, waited, blocked, angled out entering the stretch, rallied
and proved the best. EXTIRPATOR raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid down the home stretch, took the lead, but couldn't
hold off the winner. LANGS DAY void of early speed, moved up on the inside around the final turn and finished willingly on the rail. GRAVES MILL ROAD
lacked early speed, made a steady gain and was outfinished for show. MEANT FOR ME pressed the pace, raced close throughout and weakened. DIAL IN
FOR LUTE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. HIGH CRUISE went to the front, drove clear and faded. PALATIAL TIMES raced
within striking distance and made a steady retreat. HARD ATTACK void of early speed and was never close. HOME VISIT raced near the middle of the
pack, dropped back and lost contact with the field.

CAUGHT OFF GUARD raced within striking distance, made a bid deep in the stretch and proved the best late. MORE THAN DESTINY vied for the early
advantage, dueled throughout and was outfinished for the win. MONSIEUR CANDY lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside, entered the
stretch six wide and finished willingly. MR. SHORTY pressed the pace, raced close throughout, made a bid and lacked a late kick. PHILANTHROPER raced
near the back in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, moved up, but was no factor. SCAT FREE dueled for the early lead and made a steady
retreat. ITZCOATL always raced near the back and showed little. PUPPETEER raced near the middle of the field in the early part, dropped back and was
outrun.
