stretch then finished second best. APACHE with the second flight two wide, fanned out five wide in upper stretch and finished with good courage. BLUE

Footnotes
ORBIT MARS showed early speed to duel on the lead, settled off the pace into the turn, re-rallied turning for home and drew clear down the lane.
SHELLEY'S GEM tracked the leaders from a clear pocket through the turn, was set to a drive midway on the bend and made a steady advance down the
stretch to gain the place. JOAN'S WAY slow early to trail the field into the stretch and closed well belatedly to be gaining ground late. BACKSPLASH
reserved off the early pace, commenced a five wide rally in the turn and continued grinding down the outside through the stretch. SIERRA DIAMOND
stalked the pace to the turn, rallied up to take the lead in upper stretch, bobbled in mid-stretch causing the rider to lose his right stirrup, was gathered up and
finished evenly. DON'T LOSE HOPE broke a step slow, raced up to be mid-pack early and went evenly as a non-threat. STORM CHARGING unhurried
early, moved up three wide in the turn and failed to sustain his rally. SOFIA STRONG rushed up to the lead down the backside, set a pressured pace for a
half mile and stopped.

TRULY INCLUSIVE stalked the pace to midway on the turn from the fence, angled out three wide turning for home to engage the leaders, dueled through
the lane and narrowly prevailed at the wire. DANCE DRAMA prompted the pace through the turn, took a brief lead in upper stretch, dug-in gamely when
engaged by the winner and just missed in a good effort. SWEET AS MERRIE set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, responded when challenged in
upper stretch but could not go with the top pair while clearly much the best of the rest. TITEBLUEJEANS travelled one-paced along the rail while failing to
menace. TWILIGHT BEAUTY raced prominently from five wide into the turn and faded. HAUGHTY PRAISE the rider lost the crop turning for home while
racing as a non-factor.

Footnotes
TIER ONE reserved off the pace into the turn, saved ground along the fence to the head of the lane, angled out splitting rivals in upper stretch and closed
determinedly to gain the victory. FAST CLIP stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to engage the leader turning for home, took a brief lead in
mid-stretch and finished willingly to be second best. MAN'S CHOICE unhurried early, circled the field turning for home and closed well on the far outside to
be gaining late. WILDCAT PRIDE prompted the early pace, was taken in hand to settle off the pace down the backside, rallied three wide to take the lead in
the lane and was outkicked coming home. I STRONG unhurried racing off the pace from six wide down the backstretch and made a mild bid in the lane.
BUCKEYE CHARLIE tracked the pace from five wide through the turn and failed to mount a rally. ORFANO trailed early on and passed tiring rivals in the
stretch. BUCKEYE RED well placed in striking distance for a half mile and faded in the lane. YOU'RE OUT was never a threat. BAD BOY BOOGIE flashed
speed up the fence to set the pace for a half and stopped in the stretch.

DISCLOSURE stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied up the inside turning for home, drifted out down the lane but kept on determinedly to prevail by the
shortest of margins. AULD LANGE SYNE prompted the pace down the backstretch and through the turn, assumed command from five wide in upper
stretch, dueled with the winner to the wire and was out-nodded. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and mounted a late
rally to gain the show. CUMBER tracked the pace through the final bend and went evenly failing to mount a closing bid. WAR NOVEL took command to
open a clear lead in the first turn, stayed well off the fence while setting the pace down the backside and through the final turn and weakened in the lane.
SURF AND TURF was never a threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH.

SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS took the lead from the gate, opened a clear advantage down the backside, widened in upper stretch and kept-on through the lane
unchallenged. CHANEL SPIRIT crowded at the start, stalked the pace from two wide down the backside, mounted a bid in the far turn, could not go with the
winner but finished willingly to be second best. LADY JASPER reserved off the pace while travelling four wide, circled tiring rivals in the final bend, angled in
toward the rail in upper stretch and made a mild rally to gain the show. SEEYOUINMOTOWN slow early to trail in the first turn, gained ground while wide
turning for home and closed ground late. GOODNESS SAKES well placed tracking the leaders into the far turn, mounted a rally leaving the three-eighths
pole and flattened out in the lane. I'M JAC'D tracked the pace from the fence to the far turn and faded. STATE OF GRACE was never a factor.
WHYNAUGHTY raced mid-pack along the rail down the backside and gave way coming home.

Footnotes
SHOWTIME BOY set the pace under pressure through the turn, repelled the challengers turning for home to shake clear and drew off convincingly in the
lane. EL SORDO reserved off the pace while racing along the rail saving ground and closed willingly in the lane to be second best. MAILS HERE slow early
to trail the field to the quarter pole, angled four wide and mounted a belated rally in the stretch to be up for the show. STORMED OUT well placed to be in
striking distance late in the turn, made a brief bid in upper stretch and finished evenly. MILAGRO DE JOVANNI tracked the leaders from three wide in the
turn and flattened out in the lane. SAMURAI WAY prompted the pace into the turn, ranged up to challenge the winner at the quarter pole and weakened in
upper stretch. ROUGE TU RICHES broke wide leaving the gate and never posed a threat.
