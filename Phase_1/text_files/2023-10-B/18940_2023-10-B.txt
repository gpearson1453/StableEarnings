Footnotes
SECRET CASTLE rated off the early pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep toward the head of the lane, dueled
clear past the eighth pole and held well under steady handing. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
steadily improved in the three path on the far turn and finished well to take second later yards. EXPRESS LADY raced in the three path the first turn, picked
up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly to take third the final yards. EXTRA CRUNCHY
stalked off the rail on the first turn, closed to the lead three wide at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear into the far turn but was met approaching the
eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY stalked from the three path the first turn, dueled at even terms leaving the half mile
pole but was met toward the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. BONNIE BLUETOOTH saved ground off the pace, steadied off
the inside flank of Flava's Dream into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE moved to the inside and
rated the early pace, was met past the half mile pole and faded through the backstretch. FLAVA'S DREAM suffered a fatal injury into the first turn and had to
be euthanized on the track. The Stewards reviewed the incident into the first turn before declaring this race official.

Footnotes
MITOLE CANDY stalked from the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out leaving
the turn, was bumped off stride at the eighth pole but never lost a beat and took the lead mid-stretch and edged out JUNE BELLE through the final
sixteenth. The latter came away awkwardly and raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four
path on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. PETTY PERFECT stalked off the rail the first turn, challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, dueled between horses through the upper stretch and flattened later yards. MALIBU YEARS was
roughed from a boxed in situation passing the five eighths pole, gave chase from the nine sixteenths and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled outward
and made sharp contact with Mitole Candy at the eighth pole, was roughed behind a wall of horses in the upper stretch but came back to finish evenly.
LIGHTNIN QUEEN rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but
was met nearing mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. ROMAN CANDLE raced two deep on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and weakened off the rail on the far turn. QUINN ELIA raced off the pace inside, faded past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far
turn near the rail, angled to the outside leaving the turn and showed no more. SHOTGUN MARGARET bobbled at the break and never factored. FLAMME
FATALE raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BEVERLY'SACTINUP raced well back. The Stewards
conducted an inquiry to review the incident into the first turn and past the eighth pole before declaring this race official.

Footnotes
LIEUTENANT BROWN came away awkwardly and was bumped leaving the gate, saved ground well back from early contention, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, angled out through the far turn and entered the stretch six wide, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards.
COMEONTURNMELOOSE raced well off the pace about the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the half mile pole and entered the far turn in
the three path, angled five wide leaving the turn but relented in the duel through the stretch. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM tapered in and rated a slim lead
inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, cleared Monkey Wrench at the quarter pole but was met
passing the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. ASTRAYAL saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. SCARE DEM saved ground well off the pace the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths and passed some rivals. JOOBY DOOBY DOO rated off the pace inside on the opening turn,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced four wide on the far turn, then weakened mid-stretch. MONKEY WRENCH stalked three wide and
moved to even terms at the nine sixteenths pole, was checked off the heels of Burr Hill Bullet at the seven sixteenths pole, quickly regained stride to resume
the chase and raced close through the far turn, left the turn in tight between horses and flattened stride. SUGAR LIPS exchanged contact with Lieutenant
Brown leaving the gate and raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. ON A WHIM
stalked two deep while between horses in the front stretch but dropped back at the nine sixteenths pole and faded past the three eighths. BURR HILL
BULLET stumbled losing his rider leaving the gate.
