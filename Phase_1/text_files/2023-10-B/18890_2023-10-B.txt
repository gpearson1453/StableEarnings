Footnotes
ALWAYS LAUGHING reserved early through the first turn off the pace, slipped through on the rail entering the far turn to commence a rally, tipped out three
wide at the head of the lane and drew off in the stretch as much best. LUCKY PENNY ROSE tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside, angled
to the clear in upper stretch and kept on grinding down the lane to gain the place. LOFTY COWTOWN prompted the pace down the backstretch, rallied to
the lead on the turn and was outkicked to the wire. KETTLE KISS rated in mid-pack to the far turn, responded mildly when called upon to make a steady
advance through the stretch. COURTED trailed to the far turn and showed some late interest rallying up the rail in the stretch. SAVE THE FLAG raced near
the rear of the field throughout and passed weakening rivals in the lane. ELIKA prominently placed for the run down the backside, rallied five wide in the turn
to threaten and flattened out coming home. UNESCORTED raced wide all the way and never menaced. MY DANCING QUEEN showed speed setting the
pace for the first half mile and stopped at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
EL BAMBINO stalked the pace from the second flight two wide into the turn, circled four wide to rally turning for home and wore down the pacesetter in a
determined drive. MEXITEXAFORNIA broke outward leaving the gate while speeding to the lead, shook off the pressure in the turn to open a clear
advantage in upper stretch, finished willingly but could not hold off the winner. CUSSIN N FUSSIN tracked the leaders from the fence through the turn and
kept on in the lane to hold the show as best of the rest. DIXIE MAN pressed the pace through the turn to the head of the lane and weakened coming home.
M EIGHTY trailed to upper stretch and passed weaker rivals in the lane. ZHU DADDY went one-paced never posing a threat. MR. BLUTARSKY chased the
pace for three-eighths and faded. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO MALFUNCTION WITH THE TIMING SYSTEM.

Footnotes
FLIPPING FISH stalked the pace from three wide in the turn, made a bid in upper stretch to overtake the pacesetter, cleared off in mid-stretch and was
geared down nearing the wire as a convincing winner. MON CAMO set a pressured pace to the head of the lane, responded when challenged in upper
stretch and finished gamely to be second best. AUGER tracked the leaders through the turn and rallied mildly from five wide down the lane while failing to
change leads. MASAI MAN pressed the pace from the fence through the turn and finished evenly. HAGLER trailed turning for home and split rivals down the
stretch showing late interest. VENETIAN DREAM raced four wide throughout and failed to menace. GORMLEYS GOT GAME was never a threat.
D'MONEY HONEY well placed in the early going and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
TOTAL SMOKESHOW set a pressured pace from the rail through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and drew off to the wire as much best.
SMARTASSET tracked the pacesetters from the a clear pocket through the turn, was set to an early drive and finished willingly to gain the place. WINDY
VALLEY prompted the pace from three wide through out and kept on down the lane. DOMINUS O'S ME pressed the pace from between horses to duel on
the lead to the head of the lane and was out-finished in the drive. STORMINATOR slow early to be at the rear of the main body of the field and made a mild
rally down the lane. J. P INDY stumbled leaving the gate giving the field a five length head start, made a rally down the backside to get to contention into the
turn and flattened out having lost all chance at the start. SHEZ IN A TIZZY chased from four wide through the turn and failed to mount a rally. CRYSTAL M
was called upon into the turn while well off the pace and lacked a response.

Footnotes
MISS ELLIE bumped rival at the start, stalked the pace down the backside, took command turning for home and held on gamely. YOU NAME IT tracked the
leaders to the turn rallied four wide on the bend and kept coming down the lane to just miss. MAYBE FRANKY squeezed between horses leaving the gate to
lose position, gained ground down the backside to be prominent six wide at the head of the lane and was gaining late in a steady drive. CHILLVILLE rated in
mid-pack to the top of the lane from the rail and showed late interest to be gaining late. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ broke inward squeezing rival at the start,
dropped back to race near the rear and made a belated rally down the stretch. TWENTY FOUR KARAT set a pressured pace for the first half mile and
weakened in the stretch. ARTIES CRYPTONITE bumped at the start by his inside rival, bobbled briefly causing him to lean outward into his outside rival,
was caused to drop to the rear of the pack and showed late interest. TV TIZ GORGEOUS failed to menace. C MORE PRIDE was hung out wide throughout
and never posed a threat. HOSANNA pressed the pace from between horses through the turn and tired. WAR MOON well placed along the fence in early
contention and faded.

Footnotes
SKY stalked the pace down the backside, rallied four wide in the turn to gain on the pacesetter, engaged that one in mid-stretch and prevailed in the drive.
ROSE KNOWS sped to the lead to open a clear advantage in the turn and could not hold on down the lane while clearly being second best. VAVITE tracked
the pace from the fence and rallied up the rail to gain the show. SWEEPINJUSTICE slow early to trail the field and made a belated rally down the stretch.
YOU'RE A DANDY rated in mid-pack just off the fence, tipped to the clear turning for home and made a mild bid in the lane. MY GIRL GABBY made a rally
into the turn from four wide to mount an early bid and flattened out coming home. SOULSTONE went one-paced and never menaced. JUMP INTO SANITY
was never a threat. LA SMOOCHIE broke alertly to be in front early, settled just off the pace and gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
OKLAHOMA JOE prompted the pace from two wide through the turn, took command turning for home and drew off down the lane a clear winner. INTO
GOLD set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, could not go with the winner but held on gamely for the place. PAINT THE TOWN slow early to trail the
field, mounted a rally into the turn circling the field and ground his way to the show while continually gaining. HITE brushed his outside rival leaving the gate,
was reserved in hand along the fence down the backside, cut the corner coming home and made a mild bid in the lane. K KID tracked the pace from the
outside through the turn, made a bid in upper stretch and finished evenly. WETZEL raced near the rear of the field to the head of the stretch and passed
weaker rivals in the lane. THE PINK Z stalked the pace through the turn to be prominent turning for home and weakened in the drive. CONDEMNATION
well placed to be in striking distance in the turn and gave way in the stretch. CRYPTO COPY flashed brief speed for a quarter and dropped back as a
non-factor.

Footnotes
MARGARITA CINCO rushed up the fence to take the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear advantage and kept the field safe having never been
threatened in the lane. QUEENIE ROSE broke wide leaving the gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled five wide in the turn to loom in upper
stretch and failed to gain on the winner. FANTOOSH tracked the leader from just off the pace into the turn, was called upon early and finished willingly but
unable to narrow the margin. DOMINIQUE'S NIGHT slow early to be near the rear of the pack, swung out in upper stretch and closed with a good belated
rally. HERE COMES DOLLY saved ground cutting the corner turning for home to threaten in mid stretch and flattened out late in the drive. OH EYE SEE
chased the leaders from three wide through the turn and failed to gain ground. PENNY'S TREASURE reserved off the pace along the rail and failed to
mount a closing bid. STORM OF NINETEEN hustled from the gate to prompt the pace for a half mile and faded in the lane. EMERALD EYES was never a
factor.
