Footnotes
STRAWBERRY KWIK set a clear early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, drifted out late, kept on and held for the win. CABLE READY was reserved
early, advanced five wide through the second turn, was gaining steadily and finished second best. HOW U DOIN broke out at the start, chased the early
pace throughout, raced three wide into the second turn and weakened late. BOLD FORCE was allowed to settle early, saved ground into the final turn,
angled out through the turn and offered no late rally. RORY'S ORCHARD was void of any early speed, raced four wide into the second turn and never fired.
DERBY CHILD was away awkwardly, raced along the inside and was never a factor.
