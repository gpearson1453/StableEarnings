Footnotes
FAKE CELEBRITY tracked two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking over command
straightened away, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to the finish. BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD tracked the pace along the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors. SLAPINTHEFACE just off
the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick.
DOMINATION broke a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, got set down angled two to three wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid. DOLLY'S BANK two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on
under a drive to the finish but was outfinished. EGYPTIAN QUEST chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch, offered no response. MUGSY FURY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened in the final furlong. CLEVER FOREVER
two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, had no rally. TONY O three wide through the first
turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. KID KREESA stumbled
badly at the start belly flopping before recovering his legs under him while conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased just off the inside through the
first turn before tipping three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, steadily lost ground detached at the tail of the field, went five to six wide into
upper stretch well behind and was eased along to the finish, then walked off under his own power.
