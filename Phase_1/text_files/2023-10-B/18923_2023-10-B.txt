Footnotes
SISTER JOANN pressured the pace and raced at even terms nearest the rail on the turn, took the nod passing the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and
held on under steady encouragement. I'M A TOTAL DIVA set a pressured pace and contested even terms two deep on the turn, was met passing the eighth
pole but finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out
entering the stretch and ran evenly in the stretch. ULTRA DIVA chased the leaders, rounded the turn off the rail, eased out leaving the turn and flattened in
the lane. MOIRAINE steadied from tight quarters between horses nearing the seven sixteenths pole but quickly recovered stride, rounded the turn in the four
and five paths, left the turn outside and finished well. C TWO gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path and weakened in the
lane. MOJO MATTERS was shuffled back early then gave chase outside and raced in the five path on the turn. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a
claim of foul against the riders of both Dats A Superstar and Curlin's Dove for alleged interference approaching the seven sixteenths pole, lodged by the
rider of Baylis Street.

Footnotes
COMIDA COMIDA set a pressured early pace, was met and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, recovered the advantage two deep
approaching the quarter pole and was steadily handled in the stretch. LIKELY CHOICE angled in leaving the chute and gave chase through the backstretch,
raced off the rail on the turn and dug in to clear second later yards. SURCHARGE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and came along for third later
yards. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR was shut off leaving the chute then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride. ZUPITA
pressured the pace and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, was met at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the turn
and weakened in the lane. RED PRIESTESS was steadied leaving the chute, gave chase through the backstretch and raced in the five path on the turn.
The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Likely Choice for interference leaving the chute, lodged by the rider of Watch Me Disappear and
as a result, disqualified the former to fourth place.

SIDESWIPED settled back in the four path the opening turn then moved to the inside entering the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole,
angled widest through the far turn then dug in under steady handling to take over later yards, and drew off approaching the wire. LACE REVOLUTION
saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dueled to a slim lead past the eighth pole but was
caught in late yards. GOLDEN BELL rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and
came along to take third the final yards. BABA took the lead while tapering in and set the early pace, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and dueled at even
terms from that point, recovered the nod toward the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn but was caught leaving the eighth pole and weakened.
SHERIFF'S KID was not a factor. COMPLETE SURPRISE raced two deep the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
at the rail on the far turn. ROCK ROSE closed to even terms two deep into the first turn and contested the edge to the three eighths pole, but dropped back
toward the five sixteenths, raced in the three path on the far turn and gave way.
