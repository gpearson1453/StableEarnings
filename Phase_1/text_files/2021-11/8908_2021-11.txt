Footnotes
BIG BEN AA settled off the early pace, moved up four wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. FLEET DE SAND showed
good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, raced between rivals in the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. RB RATH stalked the early
pace, moved three to two wide in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. RB BLYTZ settled off the early going, moved up along the inside in the stretch
run and had not enough. RB WHISTLIN DIXIE pressed the early leader and gave way. FLYINGJ GIDEON dropped back early, raced five wide near the
quarter pole and had no late response. WMA FIREBALL was unhurried early on, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.
SOUTHERN BELL MHF dropped back in the early stages, raced six wide into the upper lane and never threatened. WMA FLINTSTONE dropped back,
raced towards the inside and had no response. RECKLESS LOVE MHF failed to sustain a bid. LAPCOS LA VIMA raced far back and never threatened.
