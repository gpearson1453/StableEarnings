Footnotes
SIR MICHAEL set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals into and around the turn, shook clear at the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway.
LEMON AND DIEM stalked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, chased a clearing SIR MICHAEL through upper stretch, and grinded away
at that foe's margin in the final furlong to claim place at the sixteenth pole. AMERICAIN JOEY bumped an inner foe at the start, vied two wide and between
horses around the turn, but proved no match for his inner counterpart a the quarter pole, chased through upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong, and
just lasted for show. MURDO was bounced around between horses at the start, got caught five wide around the turn while far off of the pace, shifted seven
wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes through the stretch, but missed reaching show on the wire. JINGLE took the turn four wide while well back,
tucked to the two path entering the lane, and chased on his left lead. BEBOP SHOES pressed the pace three wide, drifted five wide entering the lane, and
weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. COLOMBIANO bumped an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, shifted six wide
entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival while having his path taken away by an inner foe at the furlong pole, and failed to mount a rerally.
NEWS BOX broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
TEMPER TIME dueled for the lead two wide, drew clear of her inner counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, and widened under mild urging through the lane.
SOVEREIGN APPEAL stalked the dueling leaders from the inside, chased those foes from the two path around the turn, and caught a tiring foe late for
place. UPANDCOMINGSTAR dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, failed to keep pace with that foe at the five sixteenths pole, gave way
thereafter, and lost place in the final furlong. BAHAMA MISCHIEF saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. EPONA BAY failed to factor.
BERATE tracked the pace two wide down the backstretch, but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
LADY SCARLET cleared early on, met VOW's bid at the five sixteenths pole, inched away from that foe in upper stretch, and held sway. VOW was mildly
forced inwards while bumping between horses soon after the start, shifted out to track the clear leader three wide, bid outside of that foe at the five
sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, chased his counterpart home, and proved second best. COCO PUFF was
bumped by an outer foe early on, settled off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path before tipping four wide entering hte lane, and
moved up in the final furlong. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN chased two wide, but was outmoved by an outer bidding foe at the five sixteenths pole, lacked a
whole to bid between horses in the process, chased those foes in upper stretch, then faded. UNDECODED was reluctant to load, bumped an inner foe at
the start, shifted across that rival and other foes in the early stages, then chased along the inside, but tired turning for home. BALL GOWN was bumped by
an outer foe at the start, then got shuffled back after being forced inwardly by that foe soon after, laid far off of the pace, and never got involved. DERONDA
was pinched back and shuffled behind a retreating BALL GOWN early on, then got outrun. TRIPLE P broke slowly but avoided trouble by doing so, tucked
two wide into the turn while off of the pace, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
ROYAL TRYST comfortably trailed the field behind run-away dueling leaders, commenced a rally three wide around the far turn, took aim on a clear
MISTER CANDY RIDE entering the lane, bid outside of that foe at the furlong pole, dueled thereafter as that rival battled on gamely, but edged ahead
approaching the wire. MISTER CANDY RIDE stalked the embattled pair of leaders, pursued a clear VOILENT PASS while in hand and inching closer
around the first turn, made first run and blew past that foe entering the lane, met a rallying ROYAL TRYST's bid at the furlong grounds, gamely dug in to
resist that foe into the closing stages, but gave in a few strides from the wire. BEACHWALKER laid unhurried far off of the fast pace along the inside,
chased under heavy urging around the far turn while getting outmoved by an outer rival, then failed to bid through the lane while moving up for a minor
share. VIOLENT PASS dueled for the lead inside of a hard pressing SPANKHURST, cleared off after that foe tired at the five furlong pole, but was
overhauled by a bidding MISTER CANDY RIDE entering the lane, and weakened. SPANKHURST dueled for the lead outside of VIOLENT PASS, engaged
and sparred with that foe around the far turn, but yielded at the five furlong pole, weakened around the far turn, and was eased entering the lane.

Footnotes
ENGLANDER established a loose advantage early on, stayed in the three path while well in hand, widened while shifting outwardly to better ground in upper
stretch, and drew off while being ridden out. SOUTHERN RAGS sat reserved off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, rallied three to four wide
around the far turn to bid for place outside of STUD PUPPY in upper stretch, vied before reaching that position at the sixteenth pole, then failed to threaten
the leader, but held place. MR. BIFFLE settled at the rear while four wide around the first turn, rallied from the three path around the far turn before swinging
to the six path entering the lane, sustained his charge to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was denied reaching that position. HELLUVA LIFE was off
slowly, settled far off of the pace while shifting to the three path into the first turn, picked up stride turning for home, rallied between horses to bid for place
inside of a group of rivals approaching the final sixteenth, but flattened out late. STUD PUPPY stalked the loose leader three wide and between horses,
chased that foe while the closest pursuant around the far turn, dug in for place in upper stretch from an outer bidding SOUTHERN RAGS, then yielded
between foes at the furlong pole. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY chased along the inside while under constant urging, but failed to keep pace around the far turn,
shifted out from behind tiring foes in upper stretch, and faded. ALTERNATE NIGHTS broke slowly and never got involved. BOLD MINISTER laid off of the
pace two wide, split foes at the three furlong pole to pick up chasing position behind the clear leader, but tired approaching the quarter pole. THUNDER
AHEAD stalked four wide, chased down the backstretch, but weakened at the three furlong pole. AL MILLON BOB stalked two wide, but was through after a
half mile.

BLAME while attempting to split foes five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick through a very narrow seem, dove inwards to clear rail sailing shortly
afterwards, rallied to bid inside of rivals at the sixteenth pole, dueled inside of MAJOR FED to the wire, and prevailed. MAJOR FED tracked along the inside
while in the two path, stalked around the far turn, but bumped BEAVER HAT while tipping outside of the leading pair approaching midstretch, bid
approaching the sixteenth pole as BEAU LUMINARIE did the same along the rail, dueled with that foe thereafter, but was outfinished. YOU'RE TO BLAME
settled off of the pace in the three to five path, inched closer turning for home, but was bumped by an inner foe in upper stretch, then sustained his grinding
rally thereafter for show. DEAN MARTINI set the pace in the two path, bounded along with low head carriage while in hand, vied inside of OLLIEMYBOY
around the far turn, dug in through upper stretch, but yielded between horses approaching the sixteenth pole. OLLIEMYBOY stalked from the four path
around the first turn, vied outside of DEAN MARTINI around the far turn, then yielded between horses in the final furlong. BEAVER HAT tracked four wide,

Footnotes
GERRI B broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked the pace four wide, ranged up to bid outside of MINUTE WALTZ at the quarter pole, dueled with that foe
through the lane, and edged clear at the sixteenth pole. MINUTE WALTZ pressed three wide, bid turning for home, dug in inside of an outer GERRI B
entering the lane, dueled with that foe thereafter, but gave in a sixteenth from home. STREET OF DREAMS rushed to vie for the lead along the inside,
disposed of her outer counterpart while meeting a pair of bids in upper stretch, but yielded to those foes approaching the furlong pole. MIDNIGHT
BALLERINA took the turn in the three to five path, and failed to factor. THUNDERING CREED stalked along the inside, but lacked a kick through the lane to
produce a bid, chased, and faded. LA TOURISTA chased from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane,
and tired. COLOR OF DAWN was minorly forced outwardly at the start by an inner foe, trailed the field by a distance early on, and was outrun. KONA KAI
vied for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SOUNION stalked the loose leader from the outside, inched closer around the turn, got floated to the four path in upper stretch while continuing to range up,
bid for the lead passing the furlong pole, dueled with his game counterpart to the wire, and edged an advantage late. BEVERLY PARK cleared off early on,
managed a loose advantage in the two path around the turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch while holding a margin, but dug in while meeting
SOUNION's bid passing the furlong pole, shifted closer to that foe while dueling gamely, but was bested late. FLAP JACK laid off of the pace along the
inside into the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and chased the leading pair home. ISOLATE broke slowly, pulled against restraint through the
opening furlong to track the clear leader, stalked that foe around the turn, but lacked a bid along the rail through the lane, and chased while losing show.
SAVVY tracked the pace three wide, inched closer outside of foes turning for home while getting floated to the four path, but flattened out in midstretch.
SHACKLEFORD'S JOY settled off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
HEFFNER stalked three wide, bid in the five path outside of PRAYFORPEACE entering the lane, dueled with that foe while forging an advantage at the
furlong grounds, then swiftly drew clear, and was wrapped up late. ARROW STRIKE settled off of the pace two wide, altered course from the four path to
the six path to switch outside of a tiring foe passing the quarter pole, rallied while shifting inwardly, and continued to accelerate in the final furlong to drive
past an outer PRAYFORPEACE in the late stages to claim place. PRAYFORPEACE vied two wide, shifted to the four path while meeting HEFFNER's bid
entering the lane, dueled with that foe through upper stretch, but was headed passing the furlong pole, yielded, and lost place late. SENSEI LAWRENCE
tracked the pace two to three wide, moved up to claim show at the three sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase from there. BENNY'S FIDDLE broke
outwardly, vied for the lead inside of PRAYFORPEACE, but weakened turning for home. TEE BURNS hesitated at the start, took the turn in the two path
while at the rear of the field, and improved late. COMBAT MEDAL saved ground from midpack, but lacked a rail rally through the lane. NATE'S REVENGE
hopped slightly at the start, laid at the rear three wide and failed to factor. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT chased four wide early on, but steadily faded thereafter.
BLOWDACOALWHISTLE hopped at the start and was off slowly, then never got involved. CAN MAN DO took up at the start, took the turn four wide while
tracking from off of the pace, but faded on her left lead in upper stretch, was eased through the final furlong, and was found to have bled.
