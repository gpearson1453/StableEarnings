Footnotes
ESSENTIAL BELLA broke outward and bumped INFINITE PASSION, sprinted clear, set a reserved pace then widened in hand through the stretch. MOON
POOL raced from off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. MISS THE HYPE pressed
the pace, chased two-wide on the turn but leveled out in the stretch. POSITIVE was away slowly and settled off the pace, was roused on the turn but never
reached contention. STOLE THE RING, off slowly, moved up to stalk the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but never reached contention. INFINITE
PASSION was bumped by ESSENTIAL BELLA at the break, settled in mid pack, chased two-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. HIT ME UP
showed brief early speed, dropped back and trailed home.

Footnotes
DEVINE DANCING sprinted clear quickly from her inside post, kept the chasers at bay and drifted off the fence to the five path in upper stretch when
roused, held safe to the wire under strong handling. DEEPLY IN LOVE chased inside the winner throughout, skimmed the fence when that one drifted out
turning for home but was no match, second best today in a race dominated by front end runners. SEA FRET stalked the winner in the three path throughout,
looked dangerous late on the turn but levelled off in the final sixteenth. KATY AND EMMA began sluggishly and trailed the field, rallied three to four wide on
the turn between rivals and out in the eight path turning for home, lugged in down the lane but kept gaining ground to grab a minor award. FEDERAL
COURT sat in midpack along the inside, rode the rail on the turn and continued to inch up late without threatening. QUIET ASCOT bumped a rival at the
start and was off the pace, moved up in behind a wall of runners late on the turn and came out to get a seam turning for home but could only rally mildly
when asked. PSARRIS was bumped by a rival at the start but quickly recovered to chase four wide, loomed three wide late on the turn but faded in the final
furlong. GOSPEL HILL was three wide off the pace early, floated four to six wide on the turn and came in to the three path down the lane but never in
contention. MI TORMENTA chased between rivals down the backside, steadied out of contention into the turn and did not recover. RALEIGH alone in the
three path chasing the early leaders, was carried out early on the turn when a steadying foe presented a problem, was again steadied in midstretch when
losing her path although no bid was evident at that juncture. ONLY BELIEVE trailed throughout and was never a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH DRIVE REGARDING THE FOURTH PLACE FINISHER KATY AND EMMA. AFTER REVIEW, THE RESULT REMAINED
UNCHANGED.

ALLPAIDUP raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the turn, led a furlong out and held sway well in hand. GORMLEY GIRL stalked the pace, came
two-wide through the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and finished under a determined drive. LADY FORTUNE was off slowly, settled in mid pack,
angled in from three-wide to the rail on the turn, angled back out at the top of the stretch and closed gamely. DISTORTED SUCCESS forced the pace, bid
three-wide mid turn, led at the top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and gave way. PARADIGM SHIFT was pinched back just out of the gate,
settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. VENENOSA was away slowly
and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. SASSYWITHATTITUDE led quickly, was engaged early turn,
dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. BIRD SAVVY forced the issue, challenged mid turn, dueled, was headed at the top of the
stretch and faded.

on the turn behind a wall of rivals, was set down upper stretch and rallied gamely. SENOR JOBIM was off slowly and lost his path, trailed, was hustled on
the turn and closed with determination. SILENT JIMMIE was rated off the pace, bumped several times with SELFMADE in mid stretch then finished gamely,,
came back in distress and was vanned off. SELFMADE was off a step slowly, raced in mid pack, was checked late turn then bumped several times in mid
stretch and finished in hand. ROSE'S VISION, in range, was hustled three-wide on the turn and chased gamely through the stretch. TRICKY MAGICIAN
held a short lead, dueled on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. CARMENOOTZ pressed the pace, dueled on the turn, was headed
at the top of the stretch and gave way. SOLIDIFY settled at the rear of the pack, drifted out late backstretch and was pulled up, did not finish and was

stages and finished under a hand ride. TUSCAN DAMSEL was off slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out between foes
in the stretch and closed fast. GELATO AMORE set a pressured pace, was engaged at the top of the stretch, dueled, then gave way grudgingly. SAVVY'S

four and five-wide through the turn, rallied outside the field and was gaining late. SEA ANNA DREAM pressed the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on
the turn, closed in the stretch but leveled out late. DISCREET BEAR raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the
stretch. PIERIAN had a poor start but gained a foothold in striking range, was hustled on the rail through the turn then chased gamely in the stretch. J M R

on the turn, was pinched back in the final furlong and evened out. REINE SECRET broke alertly then settled in range, was hustled four to six-wide through
the turn, was in tight in the final furlong and evened out. ENHANCED FINANCE broke outward and settled off the pace, dropped back late turn and trailed
