Footnotes
GUITAR SLIM tracked from midpack along the inside around the first turn, gained down the backstretch, chased the clear leader around the far turn while
under a drive and not progressing, shifted outside of that foe entering the lane, maintained stride and began to gain in upper stretch, produced a bid passing
the furlong grounds under a long drive, and drove clear. COMMANDER SCOTT set a clear pace while well in hand in the two path, was set down at the
three sixteenths pole as GUITAR SLIM pursued, dug in to meet that foe's challenge at the furlong pole, but succumbed a sixteenth out. ARCTIC ROSE
stalked two to three wide, chased outside of the clear leader around the far turn, got outkicked by an inner foe entering the lane, then failed to keep pace
with those foes at the furlong grounds, and was best of the rest. DAPPER DAN MAN was put to a bit tight of quarters between horses, trailed the field down
the backstretch, improved inside of foes in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. WILD FIREMAKER laid off of the pace four to five wide, and
failed to factor. SEMI CHARMED LIFE stalked three wide, but faded four wide around the far tunr. GUILTY LOVER settled at the rear, advanced outside of
GUITAR SLIM at the five furlong pole to a chasing position, but failed to keep pace with that foe into the far turn, and weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN cleared off early on, managed a loose advantage while well in hand, got a breather into the far turn, showed the way in hand as foes inched
closer, but responded to driving pressure in upper stretch, and safely held from a rallying PICKING ROSES late. PICKING ROSES settled at the rear two
wide, gained in the five to six path around the far turn, then rallied willingly outside of foes through the lane, claimed place at the sixteenth pole while gaining
on the clear leader, but ran out of ground. TIGERBEACH stalked two to three wide, ranged up outside of the clear leader around the far turn, but quickly
proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, chased thereafter, but lost place at the sixteenth pole, then held show. SHARPENDUP raced far off of the
pace three wide around both turns, then stayed on mildly to miss reaching show late. NEW EAGLE broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path
around the first turn, tracked before gaining three wide to stalking positing around the far turn, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and flattened out in
midstretch. FOLDOVER tracked along the inside, improved to stalking position at the ha lf mile pole, but chased around the far turn, and faded through the
lane. BIG FALCON ROCKET stalked along the inside, then two wide at the five furlong pole, but faded between horses into the far turn. TIO BLAS broke
slowly, saved ground at the rear, and was outrun. FRANKINCENSE saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. BRIAR JUMPER laid far off of the pace
two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
MAKATI PHIL broke inwardly and bumped an inner foe at the start before being brushed by an outer rival, recovered and rushed to vie for the lead inside of
PILLAGE DA VILLAGE, showed the way before shaking clear of that rival at the quarter pole, then drew off under driving pressure. HARBOR KNIGHT took
a bump from an outer foe at the start, tracked from off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to claim place at
the sixteenth pole. BLAZING FIRE stalked along the inside, shifted three wide at the quarter pole, grinded between horses to claim place at the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked for that position at the sixteenth pole. CHAMBLISS saved ground while chasing from midpack, and failed to menace through the
lane. MY LITTLE FLACO brushed an inner foe soon after the start, then trailed and got outrun. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE vied two wide, but failed to keep
pace with his inner counterpart at the quarter pole, hung on his left lead, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.

MONEY WELL SPENT broke through the gate pre-race, then broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked three wide, bid in upper stretch, forged
an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear. G'S DEADLINE was slow into stride and settled very far off of the pace two wide, gained five wide
and outside of foes around the far turn, then sustained his rally through the lane to reach place in the closing stages. SPIDER LEGS broke through the gate
pre-race, then broke outwardly and forced his outer rival out at the start, pressed the pace setter two wide, vied at the half mile pole, forged an advantage at
the quarter pole as MONEY WELL SPENT ranged up alongside, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong grounds, and lost place in the final sixteenth.
CRIMSON FELINE tracked along the inside, shifted two wide and behind the leaders in upper stretch, and chased those foes home. THEBOYZGALAXY
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. THE MISSING PIECE set the pace inside of a pressing SPIDER LEGS, vied inside of that rival around the far
turn, but gave way to that foe and another bidder in upper stretch. VITA broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer foe and steadying hard
between horses at the start, then trailed along the inside, and never got involved. CALAJA was bumped and forced outwardly by an inner foe at the start,
tracked four wide, laid in range down the backstretch, but faded around the far turn.

FANNIE AND FREDDIE stalked the pace along the inside, shifted two wide into the far turn, split tiring foes at the five sixteenths pole to take aim on a clear
PRIMA BALLERINA, ranged up to that foe in upper stretch, led passing the three sixteenths pole, drew off at the furlong grounds, and was ridden out under
mild urging to the wire. PRIMA BALLERINA prompted the pace two wide, vied down the backstretch, then from between horses at the half mile pole, forged
an advantage approaching the seven sixteenths, shook clear passing the three furlong marker, showed the way entering the lane as FANNIE AND
FREDDIE pursued, dug in to resist that foe in upper stretch, but yielded at the furlong grounds. FREUDIAN shifted outside of foes early on, tracked two to
three wide, pressed the pace into the far turn, but chased around that bend before fading entering the lane. BUNNIE RAE set the pace inside of a pressing
PRIMA BALLERINA, got headed by that foe approaching the seven sixteenths pole, then gave way passing the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
YLIKEDIS was bumped between horses soon after the start, settled off of the pace three wide, gained four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead at the
quarter pole, drifted to the seven path while vying with inner foes, led at the furlong grounds as a pair of foes made bids on either side, but held firmly to the
wire. PRINCESS THEOREM bumped an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear of the pack while caught four wide around the first turn, gained steadily five
wide around the far turn, got herded to the eight path to stay outside of a bidding YLIKEDIS in upper stretch, grinded away at the furlong grounds to bid
outside of that foe a sixteenth from home, but was denied. RUSSIAN MAFIA settled at the rear along the inside, shifted two to three wide entering the lane,
rallied to split foes at the three sixteenths pole, bid inside of YLIKEDIS passing the furlong pole, but flattened out late. SUNNY ONE stalked along the inside,
but was outmoved by a group of outer foes while awaiting racing room turning for home, chased through upper stretch before tipping three wide
approaching the furlong grounds, then produced a late kick along the inside for a minor share. VIVIDLY (GB) bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked from
the two path, gained three wide around the far turn as YLIKEDIS forced her hand, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied among rivals through upper
stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and faltered. SILVER TAKE CHARGE was significantly bumped between horses at the start, pressed the
pace two wide, vied among horses entering the lane, but faded in upper stretch. STILLCHARGINGMARIA bobbled at the start, but quickly recovered to set
the pace along the inside, met a trio of bids entering the lane, and yielded to those foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
UNDERHILL'S TAB stalked the embattled leading pair along the inside, smoothly shfited outside of them at the five sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid for the
lead outside of BOSS' DIALIN IN at the three sixteenths pole, dueled with that foe through midstretch, forged an advantage a sixteenth from home, and
edged away. BOSS' DIALIN IN vied for the lead two wide, led entering the lane as UNDERHILL'S TAB menaced outside, dug in from that bidding foe at the
three sixteenths pole, dueled gamely thereafter, but was headed at the sixteenth pole, and got bested. MIDNIGHT HURRICANE broke a step slowly and
trailed the field into the turn, gained in the two path around the bend, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair in midstretch while claiming show, and
chased thereafter. BALTIC FLEET chased from the two to three path around the turn, but faded turning for home. GRAN MUCHACO tracked three wide
early on, but tucked to the inside while failing to keep pace with the leaders at the half mile pole, and was outrun thereafter. PRATHER broke a bit
outwardly, vied for the lead inside of BOSS' DIALIN IN, but gave way to that foe and another bidding rival at the quarter pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
EXCESS MAGIC broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, split foes through tight quarters four wide and the three
sixteenths pole, rallied while shifting inwards passing the furlong grounds, surged inside of HIGH LIMIT ROOM in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. A SONG
FOR ARCH got caught four wide while tracking the pace, inched closer while shifting six wide entering the lane, but hung on his left lead, drifted outwardly in
upper stretch, quickened passing the furlong pole to produce a late gain, but was outkicked by an inner foe. HIGH LIMIT ROOM took bumps on both sides
at the start, sped clear, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong, but was overhauled by rivals on both sides in the closing stages. VICE VERSA
stalked five to four wide around the turn, took aim as the closest pursuant to the leader turning for home, but only produced a mild bid, flopped back to his
left lead at the furlong pole, got outkicked by rivals on either side passing the sixteenth pole, and chased between. JACK THE UMPIRE laid off of the pace
along the inside, but backed out into the turn shifted to the three to four path around the bend before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and rallied
belated outside of foes in the final furlong. SEVEN SCENTS raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but faltered to be off of the pace around
the turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, but lacked a re-rally. MCFEELY trailed along the inside, shifted four wide in midstretch, and moved up. REAL
MONEY took the turn three wide and between horses while off of the pace, shifted five wide entering hte lane, but lacked a bid. WAR MACHINE saved
ground in midpack around the turn, but to no avail. HOPE AND DIGNITY broke in and bumped a foe at the start, chased three wide and between horses,
but was outmoved turning for home, then tired between horse a the furlong grounds. SHACKLEFORD STRONG stalked four to three wide and between
horses into the turn, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for home, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TAMBOURINE STAR set the pace along the inside, drew off from a pressing ORDER UP while shifting outwardly passing the quarter pole, and was ridden
out to the wire. HELAIRE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, rallied between horses in upper stretch before bidding
for place inside of ORDER UP passing the furlong pole, then reached that position a sixteenth from home. ORDER UP pressed the pace setter from the
outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole before shying outwardly from that shifting rival in upper stretch, but shifted back
inwardly approaching midstretch to meet HELAIRE's inside place bid, but was bested by that foe at the sixteenth pole. GUTZY tracked five wide, failed to
keep pace with his leading entry-mate in upper stretch then kept on to claim a minor share. BOULDERING chased three wide and between horses, but
failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, and was outfinished by an outer foe for a small placing. ALL MIKE NO MAE broke a step slowly, settled
far off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, and moved up in upper stretch before flattening out. SCORING DRIVE took the turn
in the four path while well off of the pace, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, but failed to rally. IKNOWIDIDN'TDOTHAT broke slowly and outwardly
at the start, got caught in the five path around the turn while far off of the pace, and never got involved. I LIKE DREAMING stalked along the inside, but
faded through the lane. LS'SHOE'S IMAGE was outrun. MR. K W laid forwardly placed four wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened
entering the lane.
