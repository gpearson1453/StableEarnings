Footnotes
TAP THE FAITH TAP THE FAITH raced behind the field until they reached the three-eighths when he began to show a more concerted interest, as they
were midway through the turn the rail opened, giving him a clear path, unbothered, with a strong hand ride, and going to the crop only once, he was all out
through the lane to prevail. A MO REAY A MO REAY traveled up the backstretch in the three path just off the leaders, midway around the turn she traveled
slightly wider to the four path until they hit the straight, came under coaxing with repeated crop urging, she ducked in closer to the eventual winner, driving
alongside until the final yards where she couldn't catch the winner but was clearly second best. KHULUQ KHULUQ traveled along the inside for most of the
early going then was fanned five-wide at the head of the stretch, running an even trip throughout. OH MRS. MAISEL OH MRS. MAISEL stumbled at the
break, recovered and sat behind the leaders, swung into the three path turning for home and although receiving strong encouragement she lacked the
needed response to affect the outcome. MARYSVALE MARYSVALE raced just off the flank of AFILADA for most of the early going, necks apart, until they
reached the stretch when, maintained her trip along the inside until the stretch and could do nothing about her rivals passing her by. AFILADA AFILADA,
who set the pace for the first three quarters, was unresponsive when called upon late and continued without urging in the final eighth. BELLE GOSSE
BELLE GOSSE raced five wide up the backstretch, was the first of the field to receive any urging midway through the turn, when others drew clear she
moved to the rail but was not a factor here. FRACTIONS AND FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.
