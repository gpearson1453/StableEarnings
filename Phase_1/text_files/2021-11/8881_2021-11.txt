Footnotes
UNTREATED was rated along early while four wide by the half mile marker, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front shortly before the
furlong marker, then was kept to left handed pressure to kick clear. ADARE chased the early pace while racing in the two path, eased out on the turn to be
four wide by the quarter pole, made a bid leaving the turn, but could not go with the winner in the furlong grounds while trying to drift in despite left handed
crop urging, second best. TOP GUN TOMMY set a pressured pace early, then shook clear and dropped down to the inside, remained clear on the turn and
was headed nearing the three sixteenths and faded the final furlong while staying on to best the rest. MY FIRST GRAMMY was allowed to settle early while
three wide by the half mile marker, then was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the drive and offered no rally. EYES ON TARGET pressed
the early pace four wide, then was three wide by the half mile marker and weakened the final quarter of a mile. TIZ MANDATE was off slowly, then was on
the inside on the backstretch and had no response. ROMAN EMPIRE was settled back while four wide by the half mile marker and was not a threat.
ASHAAR stalked the early pace and was two wide by the half mile marker and then stopped.

Footnotes
GAMBLING CAT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and came in straightened away
bumping EXOTIC WEST taking over command, tussled with that rival to the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. EXOTIC WEST two to
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took narrow and brief command between foes spinning just off the inside at the quarter
pole, got bumped and headed for the front straightened away into upper stretch, battled head to head to the eighth pole, then got shaken off to the finish
while running on to preserve the place honors. GABBY SQUARED three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and kept on to miss for the place honors. CHEROKEE SONG four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. COMMAND POINT chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild bid, then flattened out in the late stages. FUNWHILEITLASTED chased just off
the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FIVE ALARM ROBIN spurted away along the
inside early on, had the field take closer order midway down the backstretch, came under coaxing under pressure at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front
near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. PRINCESS NINA got checked off the heels of LIDO KEY out of the
chute with one mile remaining, chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made
no impact. MIA BEA STAR chased three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. LINNY
KATE stumbled at the start getting away last, raced two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch
and never got involved. LIDO KEY chased just off the inside until tucked inside placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and proved
no factor. ALPHA BABE tracked along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered. There
was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of EXOTIC WEST alleging interference by GAMBLING CAT as well as a Stewards' Inquiry into the matter which was
reviewed and dismissed prior to the result standing and the race being declared official.

Footnotes
G MUNNING was bumped at the start, then rushed up the inside to set the pace, shook clear on the turn, came off the rail leaving the turn, was headed
nearing the furlong marker, then turned back that bid in the furlong grounds to edge clear late under a drive. BOLD JOURNEY chased the early pace five
wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and into the stretch, went on even terms by the furlong marker but hung late while clearly second best. SAFALOW'S
MISSION chased the early pace three wide, then shifted out and came five wide into the drive, but flattened out, stayed on to best the rest. BUILT TO LAST
stalked the early pace three wide, then dropped down to the inside in the stretch while weakening. DEVIL OR ANGEL was reserved early, advanced four
wide on the turn but offered no late rally. ASAP RESTORATION was reserved early, then was shuffled back to trail on the turn, angled out widest in the
stretch, then improved her position late. ON THE HILL hesitated at the start, then raced near the back and was three wide by the quarter pole and never
threatened. SALTY HEIR stumbled at the start, then raced on the inside on the turn and was not a factor. SALUTE TO AMERICA broke inward at the start
bumping G MUNNING, chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
L'IMPERATOR (FR) three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under light coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth pole, edged away to the finish to prevail. TEMPLE showed the way in hand along the
inside, tipped to the two path through the far turn before taking the inside route into upper stretch roused, dug in under a drive under lone threat and was
collared nearing the sixteenth marker, then held on for the place honors over a blanket of rivals at the finish. DOSWELL tracked the pace along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in behind foes lacking optimal clearance to the sixteenth pole, then
got clear late and was up for the show honors in the last jumps. BAKERS BAY three wide through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outfinished in the final strides. HIERARCHY just off the inside near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. COLD HARD CASH
just off the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages.
PERJURY TRAP chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no response.
HIEROGLYPHICS chased just off the inside, came under coaxing along the inside at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
MO GOTCHA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
CONTROL FUNCTION was off slowly, then reserved on the inside, advanced on the turn towards the inside, angled out for racing room nearing the furlong
marker, closed well to edge away late under a drive. MY SUNNY VALENTINE tracked the early pace three wide, angled in on the second turn, made a
inside bid in the stretch, but was outkicked by the winner late. WICKED HAPPY was allowed to settle early and made a four wide move by the quarter pole,
shook clear leaving the turn, but it proved to be not enough while staying on for the show award. PEACEBETHEJOURNEY was rated along the inside,
swung out five wide for the drive but had no kick, needed more. HIT THE NAIL was allowed to settle early, came seven wide into the stretch, belatedly.
FOXTROT SEVILLE was allowed to settle while four to five wide and had no rally. EXOTIC CAT was settled back early, advanced while four wide on the
turn and by the quarter pole, but lacked the needed stretch rally. THISMIGHTBETHEONE prompted the early pace in the two path and weakened. AFTER
THE WIRE lacked a solid rally. SYNONYMOUS failed to respond. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON was rated along early four wide, made a four wide bid to
take over and set the pace on the inside on the turn, then weakened. RAVING was sent to the front to set the pace for a half mile then stopped.
