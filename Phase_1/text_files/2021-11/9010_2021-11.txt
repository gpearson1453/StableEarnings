Footnotes
JAZZY EINSTEIN was checked at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear lead with a sixteenth to
run and held sway to the wire. MINI MAGS sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing
the half, vied into deep stretch and yielded to that rival. KANDI SPUN was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished
evenly late. WIN LIKE COACH P raced four-wide through both turns, showed no early speed, moved up for a contending position but failed to gain late.
FOUR SCORE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. REDHAWK showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
HEIR (FR) pressed the pace of CLUB MESQUITE while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off through the lane.
CLASSIC LUCK was off a step slow then reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a steady bid. CLUB
MESQUITE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. RANCHER was off slow, showed no
early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late. ATLATL was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. WHATISAY broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
LAUGHAROO sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. THECHAMPISFLORING chased the winner
while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but held well to hold the place. ARIES was off a step slow, lacked early speed, raced
seven-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. SWEET RYAN was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly
late. ORATORY GLORY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DIEM NOW was never far back, raced five-wide
through the turn and gradually weakened. TICO TIME showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. SLEIGH RIDE settled
off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TW SKIPPING STONES was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by GAGE HAS A GRAY nearing the
half, opened a clear lead soon after and drew off through the lane as the handiest of winners. SILENT MUSKETIER settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. TWILIGHT RIDER raced off the pacesetters early,
moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND showed no early speed,
raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. GAGE HAS A GRAY pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the half and weakened. MAJESTIC CAFE was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
LUCKENBACH was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and weakened. SWAGSATIONAL settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LIPSTICK LADY was away in good order to duel for the lead with RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL while racing three-wide, vied with that rival through a vigorous
drive and edged away through the closing yards. RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, vied through
a prolonged drive and gave way grudgingly to that foe grudgingly late. KEEPING TRADITION lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed
to gain in the drive. SEENEVA THE CAT was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. NIGHT
MIST lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MIST OONA B lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did
not threaten. MISCHIEVOUS KITTY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. SCAM LIKELY was void of
early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. TAZEETI lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MY EXPRESSION was away alertly to duel for the lead with DANCE FIGHTER from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off
through the lane. DANCE FIGHTER bobbled at the start, dueled with the winner for the opening quarter, chased that rival while racing three-wide and failed
to gain on that rival in the drive. GUARDING ELK CAMP was checked at the start, then raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn
and finished evenly. OUR LIZZY LOU settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late
run. BONITA RAPIDS lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. MY FUNNY GAL was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and weakened. WAVERLY WAY showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DAME
DANGEROUS was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
THE PUBLIC HALO settled off the leaders early, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, found room in mid-stretch, angled out late and was up in the
closing yards to be going away. DEWEY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a
clear margin but could not resist the winner late. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not
reach the top pair but finished with a steady bid. WRATH raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly.
TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. DYF was
bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. EMPEROR'S CHOICE was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the second turn, checked nearing the quarter and weakened. BUCKLEY BAY disputed the pace from the inside for three-quarters
and weakened. TRASK vied for the lead with BUCKLEY BAYH for six furlongs and weakened.
