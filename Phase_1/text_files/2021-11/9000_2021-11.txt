Footnotes
CHOCOLATE BUNNY broke readily, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin just off the inside, went well clear midway through the backstretch and was
kept to the task under right handed pressure through the last furlong. TOE THE LINE settled between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while being fanned five wide racing through the far turn, shifted inwards once gaining second racing into upper stretch but couldn't menace the
winner. LORD BOLSTON tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and improved position splitting rivals racing into the lane. OFF
TO THE BEACH tracked off the secondd flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position along the rail racing into the
far turn but lacked the needed late bid. KING ZION settled last racing to the first turn, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch but failed to mount a rally.
CALL ME DROSSEL broke inwards while getting away slowly, was urged between foes to make brief pursuit of the leaders in the two path, then the three
path racing into the backstretch but soon emptied out. CREAL ANGEL, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, emptied
out racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SON OF GRACE sped to the lead soon after the break while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, repelled a
rival's challenge racing through the far turn and came under firm encouragement to maintain a clear advantage to the end. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was rated
along the inside behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn, angled to the four path entering upper stretch and continued
with a steady late bid to edge rivals for the place honors late. LIGHTNING ROD CARL angled to the inside while prompted to a forward placing tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, tipped out three deep nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, disputed second between foes
into the stretch but was just outkicked for the place honors. BEHAVIN MYSELF, reserved outside foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing
the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position inside foes. FUTURE VISION, off a bit slowly, switched off the
inside while pulling his way between foes to gain a position outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was urged to prompt the
leader racing into the far turn but couldn't match terms with that one and gave out between foes racing into upper stretch. IMPERIAL TEMPLE tracked off
the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. POINT OF DIRECTION settled last racing to the backstretch and trailed the field
into the stretch. AN INCORRECT TIMING SPLIT WAS DISPLAYED DURING THE BROADCAST OF THE RACE.

Footnotes
LOOK AWAY was rated outside foes in the opening stages, then settled last after the opening three sixteenths, angled to the rail avoiding close quarters just
past the half mile marker, continued saving ground making steady progress to upper stretch, then rallied smartly to the lead inside foes in the closing stages
to go clear under right handed encouragement. INSIDE THE CIRCLE, bumped at the start, recovered quickly, then was urged just off the rail disputing the
pace inside a rival racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage racing in the two path racing into upper stretch, came under pressure to turn back a
challenge from DASH TO THE CASH racing past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner. DASH TO THE CASH broke outwards bumping INSIDE THE
CIRCLE, was righted to track just off the leaders along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out to the three path racing into upper stretch while being briskly
roused to challenge but was outkicked by the top pair. GOOD YEGG, carried inwards by DARREN'S LEGACY at the start, was righted to track off the
second flight in the three path racing to the turn, angled four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards under pressure
racing through the stretch and finished evenly. LUCKY POSITION, bumped at the start, was collected to track the leaders outside a rival in second flight
racing into the turn but gave way entering upper stretch. GREAT PLAINES broke out bumping LUCKY POSITION, was righted, then urged to dispute the
pace well outside a rival racing in the four path to the turn on a narrow advantage, but gave way after a half. DARREN'S LEGACY ducked inwards at the
start crowding a rival, angled inwards, then steadied a bit avoiding the eventual winner racing past the half mile marker and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
AZRAEL broke readily, dictated the pace between foes on a narrow advantage, then angled to the inside nearing the turn, edged away to a clear advantage
racing into upper stretch, then widened the margin late under firm handling and some right handed pressure. CHICKS FOR FREE, off slowly, was rated off
the second flight while angling to the rail racing through the backstretch to the turn, came around a tiring foe racing into upper stretch, then shifted to rail in
the last furlong to narrowly edge rivals for the place honors nearing the wire. VENETIAN DREAM tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening stages,
was prompted to advance three deep racing through the turn to gain striking position in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. MIND YOUR OWN
BIZ was urged prompting the pacesetter three deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards pursuing that rival between foes to upper stretch but faded in the
drive. UPHAM was rated off the leaders outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide leaving the midway point of the bend while being prompted to
advance racing into upper stretch but lacked a closing bid. EL MAS LOCO, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, continued
inside foes into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
ASHLEY ELIZABETH was urged along the inside disputing the pace racing a bit off the rail on a narrow advantage into the turn, drifted out racing into upper
stretch to race in the four path leaving the furlong marker but edged forward late following a prolonged drive to prevail under brisk right handed pressure.
DON'T HOLD QUEENS, settled avoiding close quarters at the break, saved ground through the turn gradually gathering momentum inside foes, tipped out
to the two path leaving the furlong marker and was going well late to gain the place honors inside the winner. RUBY Y'ALL shifted out at the start, was urged
prompting the eventual winner's pace racing into the bend, was carried to the five path racing past midstretch disputing the issue grudgingly to late stages
but was outkicked by the top pair. BIT MONEY tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, raced in the four path through the turn, was
fanned to the six path racing past midstretch, then shifted inwards late while lacking the needed final kick. LIL BIT TIPSEY angled to the rail in early stages
tracking just off the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch while being roused to advance inside foes but had no final kick. LADY EXPRESS ducked out a
bit at the start, was settled outside rivals racing four wide to the turn, was fanned to the seven path racing past midstretch but made no real impression.
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN settled between foes in the last flight early and continued evenly into the stretch. CONSTANCIA ,raced three deep between foes in
the last flight racing into the turn and dropped out racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PITAMAN broke readily, was urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch,
then responded to firm right handed pressure in the closing stages to hold NYOMAN safe to the end. The latter angled inwards while being urged to force
the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, lost some ground to that foe racing into upper stretch but produced a solid second effort in the
closing stages to challenge that rival again nearing the wire. GONEGHOST, reluctant to load in the starting gate, was urged between rivals pursuing the
leaders racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing through upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final response while edging a
rival for a share. EASTER MUSIC angled to the rail in early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground to the stretch while being
prompted to advance but lacked the needed bid while outkicked for a share. FLEETWAY hopped at the start, settled last racing to the turn and never gained
contention. CRANKSHAFT tracked the leaders three wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane and steadily
faded entering upper stretch.

YOU'RE KILLIN ME tracked off the first flight racing five wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn, shifted
inwards entering upper while moving to challenge for command, then wrested the advantage and kicked clear late under pressure. VALIANT VINNY
sprinted to the lead while angling inside in the opening stages, turned back a rival's challenge racing into the turn, held sway on a clear margin into upper
stretch, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's challenge leaving midstretch but proved no match. FIRST MASAMUNE tracked off the first flight
four wide between foes on the backstretch, shifted inwards a bit racing through the turn to split rivals three wide advancing in close quarters entering upper
stretch, but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. EL ASESINO tipped out racing through the backstretch while being urged to terms prompting
the pacesetter between foes racing into the turn, couldn't match that rival on the bend and gave way racing into upper stretch. TWO BIT KID, forwardly
placed three wide, was urged pursuing the pacesetter in that path racing into the turn, was shuffled out of close quarters to race four wide into upper stretch
and soon gave out. D' YANK settled last while angling inside racing through the backstretch, angled out six wide in upper stretch but offered no rally. W W
CANDY angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. ROCK N JUNE
BUG tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn and faded from contention early. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE RIDER OF TWO BIT KID LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTEREFERENCE AGAINST THE WINNER BUT THAT CLAIM WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
DIDDLEY broke inwards exchanging some light contact with CAMPAIGN SPY, sprinted clear of the field while angling to the inside racing to the first turn,
was pulling against light rating dictating the pace on a clear margin on the backstretch, held sway to the lane, then was roused leaving midstretch to widen
the advantage. COMFORT ME NOW tracked the pacesetter in the three path as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady
effort in that path to upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire. SUPER SILVER, urged to a forward placing tracking the pacesetter
from just out of striking distance a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to close the gap on that rival nearing upper stretch, but failed to
gain terms with that foe and weakened through the last furlong to lose second. THE LAST OPTION, reserved last near the inside to the backstretch, swung
out four wide racing into upper stretch and gained some position with a belated effort. ANTRIM'S GIANT tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly late. BEHIND ENEMY LINES settled off the second flight along the inside in the opening
half, came under pressure to advance racing along the rail into the far turn, tipped out racing through the stretch but made no real impression. CAMPAIGN
SPY broke awkwardly while exchanging light contact with the eventual winner at the start, settled outside a rival racing to the backstretch and offered no
rally. EDISON FIRE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing past the half mile marker and soon
retreated.
