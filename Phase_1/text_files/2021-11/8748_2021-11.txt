Footnotes
BABY CHOCOLATE sprinted clear soon after the start, increased her margin through the back-stretch and held safely to the wire. COASTAL SWEETIE
broke sharply to race closest the winner throughout from the inside, could not reach that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. MO
SUGAFOOT was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the first turn, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with
a steady bid. MISSY PARKER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the first turn, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not
menace. RHODYISAROCKSTAR broke awkwardly, showed brief speed and weakened. I'M TO BLAME hopped at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground
through the second turn and was not a factor. COMMACUTEZEE refused to break.

EL MAESTRO sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. STONUS MAXIMUS chased
the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. GENERAL THAYER hopped at the
start, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the first turn and failed to gain in the drive.

AZEE RULES was reserved just off the leaders early, forged to the front from the inside nearing the half and quickly drew off. THE METAL MAN disputed
the pace from the inside, dropped back nearing the half, angled out with a furlong to run and finished willingly in the drive. JADED TIGER lacked early
speed, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the half in tandem with the winner, could not stay with her stable-mate in the drive but finished well to hold
the show. STAY IN GRACE hopped at the start and was bumped, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to menace.
XTRAFINE XTINA vied for the early lead from between foes and weakened after going three furlongs. SKEESIX was bumped at at the break, dueled for the
lead while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half.

JACOMINA tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear. BLOODHORSE BUD chased
the pace of ANGEL OF THE CITY while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. LUKE'S
PLACE was fractious at the gate, veered in at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but
failed to sustain that rally. ANGEL OF THE CITY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going a half. MR MEMPHIS
was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and failed to menace.

GOOD JOB JACKIE pressed the pace of CHIQUITA for the opening quarter, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear
margin with a quarter to run and was ridden out through the lane to be kept to task. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was bumped at the break, then reserved just off
the leaders early, angled out with a furlong to run, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA lacked early
foot, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with some late run. KITTY CREED was bumped at the start,
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. CHIQUITA PIQUITA was away in good order to set a
pressured pace and weakened through the final furlong. FIREITUP was bumped at the break, lacked early speed, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and
did not offer a bid. MUCHO RUNNER lagged throughout.

MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY set a pressured pace early, checked nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin nearing the seven-sixteenths marker,
drew off and was ridden out to be kept to task. LOEGANBERRY chased the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly
second best. JAN'S BEST lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and gained the show. ZEELULA lagged far back and did not reach
contention. ASPEN AGAIN settled off the leaders early and gradually weakened.
