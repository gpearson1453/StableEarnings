Footnotes
MASTER OF WAR rated behind the pacesetter, took over at the quarter pole then edged away under steady urging. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT chased
between foes, moved inside on the final turn, loomed threat in the stretch but could not get by the winner. SCOOP DAWG dropped back inside, made a brief
bid on the final turn then flattened out. RICKIE'S MELODY rushed to the front, controlled the pace then proved empty. NO TOLERANCE dropped back
outside and failed to threaten. MARADONA trailed for three quarters, moved wide and continued to be outrun. WILLIE MAYS HAYS saved ground close up
then gave way after half a mile. PREFONTAINE raced within range three wide and faltered.

at the start, trailed early, moved extremely wide and just failed to get up in time. TWIRLING LIZ vied along the inside, edged to the front in midstretch but
was outfinished. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR dropped far behind then offered some late energy. MISS STAR LO hustled within range inside then flattened out in
the stretch. GYPSY JANIE was asked for run wide on the turn then faded in the stretch. MRS. CREWS stalked the dueling pacesetters outside then
weakened on the turn. ROCHELA raced inside off the leaders and lacked a rally. BRYCE'S PHILLY chased in midpack and gave way readily.

EDDIE'S CHARGE settled just outside the leaders, bid on the final turn and was up in the final yards. BIG CITY BOB stalked the pace, took over on the final
turn, continued gamely and just missed. NIMBLE BEAST rated inside, awaited room on the final turn, angled out but flattened through the stretch. IT'S
MANDATORY lagged far behind then advanced wide with a strong late rally. LAWLESSNESS lacked speed, moved briefly closer on the final turn then
faded. ONE TWO KID raced wide throughout and failed to respond. STRUM AND PLUCK moved to the front inside before half a mile then gave way in the
stretch. LOXODROME hustled to a clear lead inside then gave way readily.

NOON TIME GEM broke alertly and controlled the pace then widened driving. KINGS HIGHWAY stalked three wide early, moved inside on the final turn
and was up for the place. PIGGYBANK saved ground off the pace then continued well to just get up for the show. BOSTON LIGHT went after the winner on
the final turn then weakened in the stretch. YONDERING dropped back in the two path and lacked a rally. MARTIAL EAGLE fell back early and was always
outrun. EL BORRACHO trailed early racing wide and was never in contention. CAPE MAY STYLE angled inside early then gave way readily.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KAIRA prompted the pace outside, edged to the front at the quarter pole and moved clear driving. BEACH DAZE lacked speed, advanced wide
and finished with good energy. HOLY PINK moved close up between rivals and continued gamely. BROOKLYN MOJO raced outside between rivals and
flattened out in the stretch. LADY BERNADETTE saved ground off the leaders and lacked a solid rally. PRINCESS EMMA JO led narrowly to midway on the
turn and weakened. BALBOA'S SMILE moved closer very wide on the turn then faltered. HAD A NICE WEEKEND saved ground well back and never
menaced. RUBY DOOBY DOO raced far back throughout. ESCANDALO chased within striking range then faded steadily. TIME ALTERING forced the pace
briefly inside then stopped abruptly. TEXAS TART lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

SHERO vied outside to the stretch then drew away under moderate urging. STILL ALIVE alternated for the advantage inside then weakened in the stretch.
BLUE SHINE saved ground off the dueling leaders, angled wide into the stretch and closed well. LOVE ON FIRE was urged down the backstretch but
lacked a rally. LOVE IN HER EYES chased outside and flattened out through the stretch. SWEET MAGGIE MAE dropped far behind then finished well
along the rail. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST was well placed behind the dueling leaders then gave way. BELLA G broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.

BILLIEANNE rated close up three wide, bid to the front near the quarter pole and drew clear under moderate coaxing. ASSUME CONTROL settled off the
pace, rallied wide, loomed a stretch threat but weakened. LULA'S ROADRUNNER dropped far behind outside, advanced very wide and closed well. BUCKS
SOME hustled to the lead inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened. STAND BY YOU lacked speed, offered a brief bid into the far turn then
faltered in the stretch. MISS LOYALTY trailed inside for half a mile then passed fading rivals. OBSTINATE forced the pace outside for half a mile and gave
way. CONFIRMED GENIUS saved ground off the leaders and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
OUR MAN LUKE close up outside, went after the loose leader on the final turn and wore that one in the final sixteenth. LONGTAIL prompted the pace
outside, moved clear on the final turn then was caught in the final yards. DIGGERS DIAMOND lacked speed, advanced in the two path but was no match for
the top pair. JACOHARE saved ground throughout and lacked a solid rally. MITHRA dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. MONGOLIAN
HERO raced within range four wide and gave way readily. GRANDFIRE hustled to the front for half a mile and stopped abruptly.
