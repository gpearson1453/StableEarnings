Footnotes
BLUE SNOW stalked the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, rallied outside and was up late under
a drive. SUIGU STAR settled off the pace, closed along the rail along the fence o the far turn, was blocked late turn, angled out in the stretch and closed
gamely. NORTHERN CONQUEST was herded outward at the start, settled off the pace, closed four-wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch and edged
clear but was caught in deep stretch. LIL BIT GANGSTA, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn then finished under a
determined drive. GRAND GIZMO broke outward, stalked the pace, bid at the far turn, dueled two-wide, was headed upper stretch and chased to the end.
HULLABALOO broke outward, showed early speed, drifted out six-wide heading into the first turn, moved inward quickly, set a pressured pace, was
swarmed at the far turn and gave way grudgingly. SPIRAL STORM, fanned out eighth-wide entering the first turn, forced the pace, dueled on the far turn but
gave way near the top of the stretch. MR. MAGICAL was pinched back at the break, raced off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but

LAC MACAZA was away slowly and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, rallied outside, swept to the lead at the furlong
marker and widened under a light drive. KIDDIE HOLIDAY stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, was
headed but rebid a furlong out but was outkicked in the stretch. HUNT MASTER pressed the early pace then stalked on the backstretch, bid late on the far
turn then rebid a furlong out but was no match for the winner. CHAIRMAN BOB raced in mid pack, closed along the rail on the turn, bid late turn, led briefly
and was passed with a furlong to run. WHEN WE CONNECT led on the first turn, set the pace, was engaged late turn and gave way. INCENDIO settled off
the pace, trailed from the rail and two-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly but did not menace.

Footnotes
COMBATIVE rushed up inside rivals to make it three in a line for the front mid backstretch, got the lead into the turn and widened turning for home, kept to
vigorous handling down the lane to keep his distance from the rest. BOKERMIN sat in midpack early while widest behind a group of rivals vying for the early
lead, came four to five wide on the turn and out in the eight path turning for home, closed resolutely down the middle of the track to grab the place spot over
two foes in the final jumps. ITMAKESMEWONDER circled three wide on the turn and inside the eventual place finisher by the quarter pole, got the jump on
that one but was outkicked in the final sixteenth to miss the place spot. MISTER OAKLEY settled in midpack while two wide, was in behind the leaders
midturn, advanced to a clear second at the eighth pole but was outkicked by a pair of rivals in the run to the wire. QIAN B C missed the break and trailed the
field, began a long gradual close around the turn on the fence, drifted out to the six path turning for home before shifting in to the three path between rivals
near the eighth pole to best the rest, his rally stalling in the final stages. KEEN SAMURAI was in the mix early for the lead but dropped off to chase, three to
four wide midpack on the turn and out in the seven path turning for home, his rally stalling in the final furlong. YZERMAN was inside stalking the early
leader, between rivals when the winner came up his inside to make it three in a line into the turn, began to drop out midway on the bend and ran evenly
down the stretch. WE TAKE CHECKS in the mix early before dropping off to midpack on the rail, asked on the turn but could not get a rally going. SHAKOO
MAKOO drove to the front but stayed in the three path outside a couple of pace pals, remained in contention into the stretch but was out of gas by the
eighth pole. TORAH'S BLESSING hit the gate at the start and trailed with another runner, drifted out two to five wide on the turn but could not rally. TALL
WATER began sluggishly from the one hole, rushed up inside and rallied into range late on the turn but could not sustain his rally.
