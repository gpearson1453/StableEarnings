ELLE'S TOWN was chasing the pace while inside, saved ground on the turn then slipped through in mid stretch and was best in a game effort. MEDALLA
MATCH set a pressured pace while inside, was in a long drive but was out finished in the final stretch in a game effort. QUEEN OF THE LANE was
unhurried early then rallied and swung out to be five wide in upper stretch and made a late gain. QUICK QUICK QUICK pressed the pace while two wide,
was hard used then gave way. CHERISHED was settled and raced three wide on the turn and was no threat. IMA DISCREET LADY pressed the pace while
