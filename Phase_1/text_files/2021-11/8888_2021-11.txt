Footnotes
FRENCHMEN STREET second flight and outside, looped two and three wide through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals, then angled out
late for racing room and edged up. NEW YORK'S FINEST well placed and three wide, gained position through the turn, made a steady gain, shook clear
inside the furlong marker, then was no match late. COOP TRIES HARDER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. GRAN MALBEC allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
stretch, then evened while gaining a share. EARTH stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground through the turn on the two path, came three wide
into the stretch and weakened. ENCRYPTED (GB) fractious in the gate, broke sharply to set the pace, then faded late. NOTACATBUTACARD ran evenly.
UNMATCHABLE broke slowly, had a wide trip and was never involved.

Footnotes
TWICE TOO MANY broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear before the first turn, stalked the leader outside, regained a short lead through the turn,
then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. MEETMEINKINGSTON set the pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, angled out in
the stretch and held place. SILVER SPUR tracked the pace, angled three wide into the stretch and flattened. JULIUS THE GREAT broke out at the start,
rush up outside to be well placed, lost ground three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. TINKER TAILER held
position, outside. REDJACK improved position, widest. SIR TERRE steadily lost ground inside. ROGER THAT B broke sharply from the gate, dropped back
quickly and was outrun.

STRATEGY QUEEN mid pack and inside, angled out through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, dueled with SEQUIN LANDY and edged ahead of
that one in the final strides. SEQUIN LADY well placed and inside, tracked through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, having the advantage over the
winner, dueled with that one and was outfinished. RAPTUROUS well placed and between, gained position on the two path through the turn, then gained a
short lead in the lane, dueled, shook clear of that one and weakened late. JACKKNIFE well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn,
dueled with the leader and weakened the final furlong. RUNAWAY BREEZE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest in the stretch
and passed tiring rivals. EASY COME EASY GO was no factor. BOO BOO KITTY broke sharply and sprinted clear, then faded into the stretch.

MADAME CLAUDE set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then lasted, under steady pressure. RENEESDREAMGIRL chased the pace
inside, angled three wide into the stretch, drifted in, straightened and lacked the needed late kick. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN well placed and outside, looped
three and four wide, through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, closed willingly and flattened out late. BELLA ROMANCE broke out at the start,
angled back in and was allowed to settle, saved some ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and gained a share. BLUSHING KEYLEN
vied for the early lead on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then weakened in the stretch. SCARLETT'S FLOWER showed
little. MILL LAKE LADY was no factor. ALA TURKA mid pack, lost ground three wide through the turn, angled widest in the stretch and faded.

MORNING COLORS broke outward and checked back, rated inside in early traffic, angled three wide through the second turn, came four or five wide into
the stretch, made a steady gain and was up late. BRODY'S HONOR stalked the pace on the outside, inherited the lead on the two path through the second
turn, held off a foe, drove clear, then was no match late. LADY JAE angled out and moved to position three wide through the second turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. STARSHIP MISHKA allowed to settle, gained position three and four wide
through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. DIVINE EXCHANGE tracked the pace, lacked room through the far turn inside,
angled to the two path and faded into the stretch. COPPER set the pace inside and faded into the stretch. GYPSY WIFE broke slowest and was no factor.
