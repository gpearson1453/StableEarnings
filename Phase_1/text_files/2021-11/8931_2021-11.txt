allowed to settle early, advanced nine wide through the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. SLICK IT UP was up close early, raced six wide into
the turn and weakened late. AWESOME K P was unhurried early, raced between rivals and finished belatedly. DISPUTED raced in mid pack early, went
three wide into the turn and finished evenly. A CEE DOO CEE was taken back early, went seven wide and never fired. JEN'S BIG O was void of any speed
from the inside and had no rally. BECOME AN INSIDER was outrun early and was never a factor. BEAN AND THE BUG set a pressured early pace from
the inside, drifted out and faded.
