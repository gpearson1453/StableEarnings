made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. HAIL TO HELEN raced along the mid-pack from the inside, was in the two path into the lane and
improved position late in the stretch run. EPICUREAN set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and gave way late in the stretch drive.
CUZZYWUZZY was never a threat. PALM COURT was through after a half. CHERISH THE DAY was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. STACY
ATTACK stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. MISS SOVELIA was done early. AMARI S. was through
early. PER RULING #22-0027 FROM THE KENTUCY HORSE RACING COMMISSION, EPICUREAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 6th TO UNPLACED
DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

FARMINGTON ROAD raced in the three path along the first turn, chased the early pace, made a bid three wide into the lane, was up for place in the final
stages while no match for the winner. GOALIE raced in the three path along the first turn, tracked the pace early on, made a bid from between horses into
the lane, drifted in and out down the lane and lost place in the final stages. ALLEGE stalked the pace early from the inside, waited from the five sixteenths
pole to the quarter pole, attempted a bid down the lane but the rider shied from foe a bit and had no final gain. IRONSTONE ROAD raced in the four path
along the first turn and trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. JUNGLE WARFARE was tightly held
into the first turn and no factor thereafter. TWENTY TWICE was a bit slow at the start and done early. PATAGONIA was through after three quarters.
