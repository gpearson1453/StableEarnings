Footnotes
ADENS DREAM sped clear and crossed over to the inside, showed the way through the turn while easing off the inside and led three wide into the stretch,
put to right-handed urging in the drive and held on at the wire. DEFENSE WINS tracked on the inside then angled off the rail past the half-mile pole, went
between rivals then got bumped and crowded into the turn, angled to the inside around the bend, rallied up the fence and missed. P R RADIO STAR stalked
off the rail, two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the stretch, stayed within striking distance through the lane but lacked the needed late
kick. ITSTHATTIME chased off the pace, went three deep into the turn, two wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. BLACK STORM unhurried
in the early going, chased four deep into the turn, remained four wide to the stretch and lacked a rally. BUTTERED NOODLES broke from outside then was
rated off the pacesetter and moved inside, was getting out from inside and bumped rival entering the turn, continued to try to get out around the bend then
drifted out to the three path once the outside rival past and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
MIKES TIZNOW sped clear and crossed over to the two path, moved to the inside around the bend, remained unchallenged to the stretch, inched away in
upper stretch and remained clear to the wire. CUCINA dropped back and raced between foes early, went three deep into the turn, chased between runners
around the bend, tipped out in the lane, finished willingly and edged ULTIMATE BANGO for the place honors. ULTIMATE BANGO chased along the inside
then steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, had to steady again while in tight at the three-eighths marker, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane, angled out in
the stretch and missed the place. TILTED TOWERS broke slow to begin, chased between then moved inside and lacked a serious bid. THANKS MR.
EIDSON forwardly placed in the early stages outside a pair of rivals, chased outside a foe and two wide into the drive, then flattened out in the lane.
KNEEDEEPINSNOW off slow to start, raced three deep at the back, went four wide into the turn, steered down to the two path, moved out in the drive and
failed to menace. COMRADERY (IRE) off slow to begin, moved closer and went between rivals leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn and
weakened. TEXAS WEDGE chased four deep early, lost ground into the turn, went three deep around the bend, tired and eased in the stretch and walked
off.

Footnotes
TEZZARAY (GB) got bumped from inside at the start, settled on the inside, angled out into the stretch, surged late and overhauled the runner-up in the final
sixteenth. VERY SCARY cleared early and moved down the inside, gained pressure in the middle stages, cleared again into the stretch and got run down
late. LET FREEDOM REIN bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace on the inside, angled out into the lane and upper stretch, closed well and gained the
show. SHE'S GOT A WAY got brushed on the inside at the start, bumped with inner rival on the first turn, stalked in the two path then moved up to apply
pressure to the pacesetter, lost contact entering the lane, continued to give chase but lacked the needed late kick. HEMMERLE broke out, pulled early,
tracked off the rail, three wide into the lane and went evenly late. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS bumped both sides and got shuffled at the start, trailed through
the early stages, angled five wide into the lane and improved position. A CROWN FOR KITTEN stumbled leaving the gate, settled on the inside, tipped out
but lacked room late on the far turn, steered back to the inside, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. ICE MAIDEN broke out and bumped rival at the
start, raced between then two wide, came three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. GIMME MO BABY broke well then ceded the lead to the
pacesetter, bumped with rival early on the first turn, stalked the speed from inside, cut the corner into the lane and faded. GHOSTEM was off slow to begin,
pulled early, went two to three wide around the first turn, dropped back on the second bend and came up empty.

GERLACH'S pressed the pace from between rivals, bumped outside rival into the turn, kept the pressure on the lead through the bend, took over at the top
of the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely under urging. MR VERRACITY raced in midpack early on, took the turn two then three wide, rallied
to close the gap on the winner but had to settle for second best. FENESTRA jumped out to the early lead, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, maintained a
short lead through the turn, lost command at the top of the stretch, weakened down the lane but was able to save third. FINDING SILVER bumped leaving
the gate, raced off the pace early on, saved ground through the turn and passed tired rivals. SAFE COMBINATION attended the pace three deep up the
backstretch, got bumped from inside into the turn, lost ground to the top pair around the bend, came four wide into the stretch and faded. HUMBOLDT broke
slow then got bumped and squeezed between rivals, took the two path around the turn and was not a factor. EL DURANGO traveled in midpack off the rail,
exited the turn four to five wide and weakened. DIVINIUM raced off the pace outside a rival, took the turn three then four wide and could not rally.

Footnotes
TEAM MERCHANTS vied three deep and bumped into the first turn, dropped back to stalk outside a rival, bid three wide around the far turn, cleared at the
top of the stretch and held safely. NERVES OF STEEL stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the lane, tipped out in upper stretch, finished well in
deep stretch but could not threaten the winner. COULTHARD (IRE) tracked the top pair in the two path, angled four wide leaving the far turn, kept on
through the lane and held the show. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) unhurried in the beginning at the back, raced along the inside then moved to the two path,
raced three wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally. CREW DRAGON got shuffled back early, settled on the inside, tipped
three wide into the lane and could not rally. SONIC BREES vied for the lead from inside early then took control around the clubhouse turn, set the pace
under pressure from outside, lost command into the lane and weakened through the furlong grounds. MAN FRIDAY got a bit fractious in the gate, was
crowded between runners and altered to the inside shortly after the start, went between rivals on the first turn, steadied between foes past the
nine-sixteenths pole, traveled three deep into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. PETRUCHIO bobbled at the start,
went three deep around the first turn, four deep in the middle stages, got fanned six wide into the lane and made no impact. COASTAL KID vied between
runners and bumped early on the first turn, prompted the pace from outside, could not keep pace with a quarter of a mile remaining and retreated through
the lane.

Footnotes
ELGOFRANCO away quickly to taken control, crossed over to the inside, pressured into the turn, cleared at the three-eighths pole, drew away in upper
stretch and held safely in the final sixteenth. BIG STRETCH tracked the pace between foes then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, paused briefly at the
quarter pole, tipped to the three path then bumped rival at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied and got up for the place honors. ROYAL BLEND raced up close
outside the leader, pressed the pace into the turn, lost contact at the three-eighths pole, chased two to three wide on the turn and finished evenly late while
getting outkicked for the place. RUTHIES RACER chased along the inside through the turn and lacked a late bid. SECRET MANEUVER raced outside rivals
off the pace, took the turn four to five wide, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten. BARBARIUS sat off the pace off the inside, went two wide into the
turn, three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LISTEN TO BLUE was crowded a bit and steadied along the inside early, steered off the rail and went
four then five wide around the turn and failed to menace. CHROME OF OUR OWN raced outside a rival then moved to the inside, saved ground through the
turn and failed to threaten. BRIO IS AWESOME raced up close then lost her path and checked early, navigated the turn three wide and was not a factor.
PRUDENT chased widest early, went four wide through the turn, got bumped at the three-sixteenths pole, was eased in the lane and walked into the van
following the race. LADY BEYONCE was forwardly placed four then three deep up the backstretch, dropped back around the turn, entered the stretch five
wide and weakened.
