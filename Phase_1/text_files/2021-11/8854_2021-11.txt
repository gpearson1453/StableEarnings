MEDAL OF FACT broke well, set all the pace and finished full of run under a brisk hand ride to win going away. MUTUAL CONFIDENCE chased the winner
three wide and finished clear for second. SHARKS COVE never far back, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid.
CHACO SPIRIT chased the winner through the turn then faded. SEMI CHARMED DAY was no factor. IMA BELIEVER was outrun and swerved in mid
stretch. SKYLIME was no threat.

PINCH MINE chased the pace into the stretch, gave up some ground then came on again late three wide. TUFFIAN went evenly. WROTE'S GIFT failed to
menace. POST CODE ENVY was outrun. PRECISION PRADO had brief speed. ROCKET ON BOARD trailed.
