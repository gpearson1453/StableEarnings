FLYING TO THE LINE sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the
wire. LADY LANA was away alertly then was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not reach the winner but
finished with a steady bid. MS SALLY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. JUST GRACE was off a step
slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. IN THE WIND was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
second turn and did not menace. JACOMINA chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
MY INDY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and held off the closing
AUDACE to prevail. AUDACE settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. DOODLE TIME pressed
the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way through the
final furlong. CAPTAIN RED lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. BODEGA
raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly. MY GOLDEN BOY was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. SIR DEPUTY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a
half. QUE SERA SIR RALPH lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. AMERICAN BUDDHA showed no early
speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JUAN BRAVO pressed the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. TRAPALIS was reserved
just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. THIRSTY KISS was never far back, moved up three-wide to
offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole and gave way in the drive. TENGO SED settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
failed to gain in the drive. PRETTY LOUD bobbled at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. STORMY
SUMMIT lugged out through the first turn, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. MINNESOTA RED was carried out nearing the
five-eighths pole, showed brief speed and weakened. HUJOOD pressed the pace from between foes, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half and
weakened. BLAME THE DEVIL lugged out nearing the five-eighths marker, showed brief speed and weakened. ATTORNEY LOUIS lugged out through the
first turn, lagged and did not reach contention.
