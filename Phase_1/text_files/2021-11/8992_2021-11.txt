Footnotes
BOITANO came away in good order, controlled the tempo along the inside, dug in to meet the challenge of TAP THE GAVEL nearing the quarter pole,
turned that one away inside the furlong marker and edged clear. TAP THE GAVEL shadowed the leader outside, moved up to engage midway through the
second turn, loomed large entering the stretch but was unable to best the determined winner. OVERLANDER broke a step slow, moved up three wide, was
forwardly placed to the second turn and weakened. ROYAL COURT was rank to place between rivals early, leveled into stride on the backstretch, was
within reach for six furlongs and tired. GRABBING THE MONEY trailed.

Footnotes
INDY RIDE was wrangled back early, settled toward the inside, mounted his bid three wide midway through the turn, took dead aim once straightened for
the drive, wore down the leaders and was up in the final yards. ROCKYSBUCKAROO was away alertly, set the pressured pace outside, fought on through a
prolonged drive but was unable to resist the winner. I KICKN rushed up at once along the inside, prompted the pace through the turn, drew even entering
the stretch, but weakened during the drive and settled for the minor award. RESIDENT settled saving ground, got through and finished with a mild advance.
SUNSHINE CHARLIE was allowed to settle, circled four wide and made a belated improvement. MINEYEROWNMALONE was never a factor. DOHKO
contended three wide for a half and retreated.

THATS JUST HEARSAY sprinted clear to dictate terms, remained unchallenged and safely led throughout. CAJUN SPICE settled in hand, came under a
ride entering the turn, advanced circling four wide, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but failed to seriously menace the winner. MARIMBA was allowed
to settle, wheeled out five wide leaving the turn and was making up ground late. TETON THAI contended three wide through the turn, but weakened
between rivals entering the lane and faded. MA COCO attended the pace along the inside through the turn and tired. AWILDAS TREASURE settled off of
the inside, moved up some between foes entering the lane, but had the rider lose the whip near the furlong marker and flattened. PROMINENT HENNY
contended between horses for a half and dropped out. ELLIE B broke slow and never recovered.

Footnotes
CLEMSON TIGER was unhurried into stride, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, moved up swiftly through the second turn, reeled in the leaders
nearing the furlong marker and proved narrowly best. ESTILO VARONIL prompted the pace between rivals, fought on through a prolonged drive, but was
denied in the final yards. JO JO KATZ stalked the pace, bid between horses leaving the second turn, was blocked and altered course out with a furlong to
run, kicked on once clear but was unable to reach. BRIDGEKEEPER pulled between foes and was rank to place, leveled into stride after a half, shifted out
and circled five wide and was making up ground. FEISTY KITTEN settled in hand, moved up between horses, angled in entering the stretch and was
making up ground late. IN HONOR OF ARTIE was close up three wide, but weakened between horses entering the stretch and gave way. OUR STUIE
saved ground to little avail. QUINTO SOL passed only the tiring ones. BIG TREASURE was forwardly placed along the inside for six furlong and tired. STAR
DEPUTY set the pressured pace along the inside, disputed the issue through the second turn and dropped out. G FRIDAY broke through the gate,
contended three wide for six furlongs and retreated.

Footnotes
BEN COPENHAGEN disputed the pace outside, battled through a prolonged drive and gamely kicked away late. CATCH ON EMOTIONAL set the
pressured pace toward the inside, fought hard through a long drive but was unable to go on with the winner in the final yards. JOYA DEL SUR was allowed
to settle, came three wide out of the turn, got through to the inside of LORD BERRIER and was all out to just earn the minor award. LORD BERRIER
chased the dueling leaders four wide, weakened during the drive and just failed to hold the show spot. JUMP BACK JACK saved ground to no avail.
WEAREINITTOWINIT trailed.

STRONG EMBRACE was taken in hand at once and reserved near the back of the pack, came under a ride entering the second turn, ranged out readily,
came five wide into the lane, came in and bumped CURRENT CAUSE near the three-sixteenths pole, was straightened away and kicked on to narrowly
prevail. MISS Z was unhurried into stride, advanced between runners through the second turn, worked through traffic in the drive, split rivals nearing the
sixteenth pole and kept on well. I'M BUZZY was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch five wide, finished full of run but was unable to bridge the gap.
WASSER attended the pace along the inside, got through to make a bold bid entering the stretch, but flattened in the final yards and gave way. CURRENT
CAUSE contended three deep, came four wide to make her bid, was bumped and steadied when STRONG EMBRACE came in near the three-sixteenths
pole, altered out and kicked on once clear. DIAMOND ROCK opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the second turn, disputed the issue to the final
furlong and succumbed. CAPETOWN CANDY tracked three wide, moved up to engage the leader midway through the second turn, but faltered between
foes in the drive and faded. TEA'S DREAM contended off of the inside for six furlongs and retreated. LIVINHERBESTLIFE was forwardly placed off of the
inside, but came up empty on the second turn and dropped out. DERBYSHIRE showed little. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN INVOLVING STRONG EMBRACE AND CURRENT CAUSE, AND FOLLOWING THE REVIEW STRONG EMBRACE WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FIRST AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
PINK SHOELACES was away in good order, set the pressured pace toward the inside, was headed entering the turn, fought back doggedly into the stretch,
met the bid of FAN FAN a furlong out, disposed of that one and stubbornly kicked clear. FAN FAN rushed up along the inside, settled off of the dueling
leaders into the turn, angled out and loomed large entering the stretch, but was unable to best the determined winner. MISS LIANA disputed the pace
outside, but faltered between horses in the final furlong and settled for the minor award. CONGRATSROSY was allowed to settle, came four wide but failed
to make headway. MASTERING BELA was unhurried, came three wide but lacked a response when called upon. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL showed little.
U KNOW I B LION broke slow, rushed up on the outside, but was used up before going a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
WHY NOT TONIGHT tugged to contention four wide, took over at will on the second turn, quickly opened clear and scored with something left. MAP THE
MOMENT pulled along the inside, took closer order through the second turn, split rivals entering the stretch and finished willingly to prove the best of the
rest. LADY DOMINANCE broke through the gate, settled saving ground, moved up on the second turn, shifted out and continued on fairly well. CAIRA was
unhurried into stride, closed the gap on the second turn, angled out entering the stretch and improved position. SIMONELA was keen to go on from the
outset, jammed up between horses to vie for the lead, but weakened leaving the second turn and gave way. TAPIT'S GIRL was hustled along three wide but
lacked a response when called upon. PLATINUMCENTS was away alertly, set the pressured pace along the inside, relinquished the lead on the second
turn and gave way readily. KITTEN WITH A WHIP was hung wide in midpack, but came up empty after six furlongs and dropped out. QUALITY TOO
SPARE pressed the pace three wide to the second turn and stopped.

RACE DAY SPEED stalked three deep, launched a bold bid four wide, came to level terms on the turn, forged command in upperstretch and kicked away.
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT settled saving ground, came under a ride into the turn, moved up steadily, weaved through traffic in the lane and was just up for the
place. BION MAGIC attended the pace along the inside, angled out leaving the turn, came four wide and continued on well. SHALL RETURN stalked the
pace, bid three wide between horses, but weakened during the drive and gave way. HUSH Y'ALL was allowed to settle, came four wide but found her best
stride too late. SHACKADELIC was away alertly, set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed entering the stretch and retreated. DR. ANN went
wide and was never a factor. MIZZEN AIR failed to respond. GLOVANNA was outrun. SUSIKIN advanced between horses, prompted the pace outside for a
half and dropped out.

Footnotes
HOLD THE SPICE settled saving ground, shifted out and advanced four wide through the second turn, quickened once straitened for the drive, wore down
the leaders and was up in the final yards. REINER tucked in to save ground, took closer order through the second turn, tipped out and split horses entering
the stretch, drifted out a bit in the drive and kicked on well. JAMA DILLON was allowed to settle, commenced his advance four wide, continued on willingly
between runners but settled for the minor award. VAN was unhurried, wheeled to the outside leaving the final turn and was making up ground. WHISKEY
PLANK prompted the pace outside, stayed on to the final furlong and grudgingly gave in. HUSBAND IN LAW was forwardly placed along the inside, got
through entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. GOLD CZAR was unhurried, came four wide and finished with a belated improvement
between foes. BIG POLO set the pressured pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong and succumbed. FIGHTING HEART was hustled
along three wide, loomed a danger entering the stretch, checked hard near the furlong marker when REINER came out and retreated. CUZ was allowed to
settle, moved up between horses, was caught in tight entering the stretch, checked near the furlong marker and dropped out. BODIE CODY contended
between horses for six furlongs and stopped.
