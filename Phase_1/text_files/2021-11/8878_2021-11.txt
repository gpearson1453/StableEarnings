Footnotes
PHANTOM SHOT was unhurried in the early stages to race towards the back of the pack early on, moved up four to five wide near the quarter pole and
finished well in the drive to edge clear late under strong handling. PRETTY EDGY stalked the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn,
continued with a rail bid in the drive and finished second best. DANCER'S MELODY settled off the early going, moved up four wide into the upper stretch
but had not enough for the top pair. DECOUPAGE chased Sick Pack Sara down the backstretch and hung in the stretch run while racing between foes.
SICK PACK SARA stumbled at the break, was sent along to set a clear lead down the backstretch and faded the final eighth of a mile.

Footnotes
SKYLAR'S LADY chased the top pair down the backstretch, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to get up under strong handling.
SAPPHIRE BEAUTY was off slowly, raced near the inside at the three eighths pole, swung four wide and finished willingly to the wire. MAGIC IN ME
showed good early speed from the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. LOTTACLASS LILSASS was unhurried early on, raced near the rail at the
quarter pole, angled four deep and had not enough in the drive. KOBE'S GIRL pressed the early leader down the backstretch and weakened in the stretch
run while racing two to three wide. MARTHARITA was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no
response. DIAL ME MAYBE stumbled to her nose at the break, made a inside move on the turn and weakened in the final stages. LA REINA SUSAN settled
off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and tired. ICY REPLY stumbled at the break and unseated her rider. A stewards inquiry
was filed for the break and no action was taken.

Footnotes
BENANDJOE showed good early speed to cross over to set the early pace, dug in midstretch and prevailed while racing the rail under all out pressure.
FRIENDLY FELLA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced three to two deep in the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. ROYAL
NUMBER settled to the middle of the pack, raced four wide into the upper stretch, came out a bit nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
SEA GHOST stalked the early going, was forced to check near the five eighths pole, raced in tight midstretch and kept on to the wire. Jockey of Sea Ghost
claimed objection against Friendly Fella for interference near the five eighths marker and claimed foul against Royal Number midstretch and stewards ruled
no change. DEMO DOCTOR tracked the leader from the inside down the backstretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. UP AGAINST IT dropped
back early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. EVENT PARTY settled off the pace and failed to respond. SUBJECT
TO CHANGE stalked the pace from the inside, steadied near the five eighths pole and had no late response. SASSY KING was slow early, raced six wide
into the upper stretch and never was a factor.. WAR LANCE raced far back and never threatened.

LA FAMILIA was sent to a clear early lead along the inside and held a clear margin through the stretch run under a steady hand ride. MOUNTAIN LILLY
was bumped at the break, was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced in the three path through the lane and was no match for the winner.
BIRTHDAY WISH was bumped at the break, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. SUMMER ODDS settled off the early
pace, moved up four to five wide in the drive but had no final winning bid. ISLAND PHILO was slow early on, raced towards the inside and had not enough
in the stretch run. HEY BABE bobbled at the break, swung three to four wide and had no late rally. I LOVE MAGEL chased the top pair from the inside and
weakened. SOME IS NINE stumbled at the break, dropped back in the early stages, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole and never threatened. MADE
MY WISH broke awkwardly, dropped to the back of the pack early, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and never was a serious threat. ZOLA B
settled to the middle of the pack, raced four wide through the upper lane and failed to respond. DOWN UNDER THUNDER raced far back and never
threatened.
