YES DARLIN broke sharply clearing the field moving in alert fashion holding a firm lead through the turn opening to a commanding margin at the head of the
lane being ridden out. SELLING OUT stalked the pace giving chase through the turn emerging off a loose leader in upper stretch responding willingly as
second best. MACHINIST raced evenly saving ground to upper stretch outbidding the others in the two path. TALE OF KANTHAROS hustled along pursued
through the turn then weakened in upper stretch. NOBODY MOVE slow early lost ground racing seven wide into upper stretch. RUM ON THE ROCKS
offered little. PEQUENO GRANDE was always outrun. PER RULING FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, YES DARLIN WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
