Footnotes
NARMER rated close up while three wide and outside a rival, moved to engage the leader leaving the three eighths pole, responded to rousing and secured
command near the three sixteenths, kicked clear under right handed asking in mid stretch then steadily widened while kept alert. SPRITZER drew clear
early, set a rated pace two wide, dug in when confronted past the five sixteenths, dueled briefly in upper stretch then continued on with decent energy while
clearly second best. SURFING tracked inside, angled out under asking nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on with the top pair then faded through the
final furlong. SUPER SCOOBY saved ground under some early rating, was under pressure leaving the far turn but failed to make an impact. CIOPPINO , off
slowly when breaking awkwardly, regrouped and edged up some around the first turn, came under a ride three wide leaving the far turn, lacked a response
and weakened through the drive. OSA broke slowly and was outrun. ITS MR POPPI TO U , four wide into the first turn, raced in range to the far turn then
faltered.

Footnotes
BIG TALL DAWG came out at the break and bumped with STAY IN, corrected and was urged up to stalk the dueling leaders, shifted out three wide into the
lane, closed in under left handed rousing, took command soon past the eighth pole, spurted clear then drifted in and held sway under a drive. STAY IN ,
jostled and pinched back at the break, raced off the early pace while saving ground, angled four wide advancing into the lane, straightened and finished with
good energy to gain. PEPE AND HEYWOOD disputed the pace outside BELMULLET while under some rating, moved to a slim lead in upper stretch,
battled on after being collared by the winner then faded in the final yards. AMAZING CAT , off the pace three wide, angled out in the drive but failed to
menace. BELMULLET , bumped at the break, got engaged in a duel soon after while towards the rail, fought on to about mid stretch then gave way. KING
SHAWN , off last after breaking poorly, raced wide and dropped back.

MARVELLA NASTY rated inside while within range, edged up leaving the three eighths, eased out soon after then went on the attack into the lane, brushed
with STAY OUT IN upper stretch then drew off emphatically while under steady hand encouragement. STAY OUT sped clear early, set the pace in about the
two path, exchanged a brush in upper stretch, battled on to mid stretch then faded and saved the place. LADY MAGICA chased the pace two to three wide
but lacked a solid response. NELLYSFORD , three to our wide, pursued into the lane then gave way. PRINCESS KILLMAIN , off the pace, raced three wide
into the lane but failed to respond. SOMETHING MAGICAL stumbled in behind and was off last, settled off the pace three to four wide, was eased from the
quarter pole and walked off.

Footnotes
SHE IS WISKY showed speed down the backstretch, gained the lead in the two path between horses leaving the turn then drew out in the drive while kept
to her business. MISS FOXANN , three deep chasing the pace around the turn and flattened out. UNRESOLVED ISSUES , close up early, raced in the
three path between horses leaving the turn and weakened. MISS CASEY lunged at the break, worked between horses through the stretch and finished
willingly. GOOD STORY , checked in traffic leaving the backstretch, was not a factor. DATE NIGHT KISSES stumbled leaving the starting gate, hugged the
inner rail on the turn and failed to rally. AMERICAN BARB , four wide leaving the turn, gave way. GAMESTONKS , outrun, passed tired rivals late.
STORMIN' COUGAR was not a factor. FASHIONISTA , very wide on the turn, weakened. PANDORAS CHARM , wide on the turn, was outrun. LOVE SAGA

Footnotes
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA cleared early, set a rated pace in about the two path, edged away without much asking past the five sixteenths, responded
when roused in upper stretch and drew away under a left handed drive. BUNTING tracked inside, was coaxed along past the five sixteenths, eased and
kept on willingly to be second best. QUIET COMPANY stumbled at the break, recovered and stalked between rivals mid turn but came up empty through the
final furlong. PAISLEY SINGING , three to four wide, ranged up mid turn, chased but lacked a serious finish. TOO MUCH TIP , fractious in the gate, was off
slow when rank, edged up a bit leaving the far turn, angled out and faded.

path around the turn, showed a mild gain inside the top pair. INSANE SISTER lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn and passed tired rivals.
HELIACAL RISING , three deep on the turn, lacked a rally. BANTAM ROOSTER , outrun, hugged the inner rail around the turn.
