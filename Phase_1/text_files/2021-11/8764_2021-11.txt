GOLDEN ESSENCE settled three wide just off the pace then wore down the leader in the final yards after a long drive. JUSTHAPPY prompted the leader
outside, led at the quarter pole but was nailed nearing the wire. BIENVENUE saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch and yielded late. SCHNUER
WILL hustled to a narrow advantage inside, vied through the final turn and tired. HUQOOQ dropped back inside and weakened steadily. DECISIVE CAUSE
broke slowly and to the right, chased wide and stopped. BLUEBERRY QUEEN close up inside briefly, stopped and lost contact with her field.

Footnotes
SOUR MASH forced the pace outside, took over into the far turn, rallied clear and lasted. FLAT OUT PHOEBE settled outside, advanced very wide into the
stretch rallying too late. PRETTY SPECTACULAR saved ground close up, angled out on the turn but flattened late. LIAM'S LADY was urged to the front
inside then began fading on the final turn. THRILLING BABY broke a step slowly, chased wide and lacked a rally. OUI MADAME lagged far behind then
moved inside through the stretch. YOURINDENIAL dropped back outside and was never a factor. LA ALTENITA bobbled slightly at the break, raced ins9de
and faltered.

Footnotes
ALMOST EVIL hustled close inside, angled out into the stretch then wore down the leader in the final stages. CAPE COD SALLY controlled the npace
inside, moved clear to the final furlong and tired. CRICK dropped well behind, came out in the stretch and closed well. LADY MISTRESS chased in midpack
and continued well while no threat. GET HER READYEDDIE saved ground off the pace, was bumped in the stretch and flattened. ROO LA LA prompted the
leader for half a mile and gave way. DRIVER'S LICENSE flashed brief speed and faded on the turn. GUNFIGHTER'S GIRL trailed for half a mile and was
never a factor. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS lacked speed and gave way readily. MISS ALEX raced very wide and faded steadily.

late. KODAPENDENT stalked the pace outside, was asked for run on the final turn but tired. NICKY DA FOX chased inside and failed to menace. GO LIME

in the stretch in a tight finish. JAMMINWITHBRANDON forced the pace outside, faded briefly on the final turn then came again. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ raced
wide throughout and continued willingly. LUXURY SUITE trailed far behind then offered some late energy. CLASSIFIED INFO stalked outside, bid to the
front midway on the final turn then tired. LOAN ME YOUR EAR dropped back inside and was never a factor. FLATEXCEL settled behind the dueling leaders
then was finished by far turn. OUT OF LINE hustled to the front inside then stopped abruptly. PER RULING 21294PP FROM THE PENSYLVANNIA HORSE
