Footnotes
JAMESTOWN ROAD rated close inside on the opening turn, lacked room at the rail rounding the far turn but slipped through inside the drifting Bronze Diva
for the lead leaving the eighth pole and widened down the lane. HERETODAYGONMANANA rated close two deep the first turn, bid past the three eighths
pole and closed to even terms at the quarter, dueled clear of Bronze Diva past the sixteenth pole but had to settle for second best. ARROWWOOD stalked
two deep then gave chase from the three eighths pole, contested between horses on the far turn then dueled through the stretch and took third the final
yards. BRONZE DIVA angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted
into the stretch and was caught leaving the eighth pole then flattened toward mid-stretch. THELADYISTRUE rounded the opening turn about the three path
and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn then flattened. COMMCAT raced four wide on the
first turn, left the turn outside, though, showed little response.

Footnotes
IMMORAL settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and closed to even terms two deep approaching the head of the lane, dueled for the
nod toward mid-stretch then drew away later yards. DR. GRANT rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced with the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and remained a close factor to mid-stretch before relenting. GUNHAND drifted to the five
path into the opening turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and was along for a distant third midway
on the far turn. REGHITTO was pinched back at the start, rounded the first turn about the three path then settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and passed rivals. PALACE KING settled back off the rail and showed little response. THATZA
ALPHA broke outward to make contact with Reghitto then rated close toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole though
faded past the three eighths. BAYTOWN BACKSTABBR broke inward to make contact with Reghitto then stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but faded past the pole.

Footnotes
PLATINUM FROLIC broke outward to make light contact with Miss Wave then closed to the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead inside,
was pressured toward the three eighths pole and met at the pole, but recovered the edge at the five sixteenths, dueled clear at the rail into the far turn and
was steadily handled down the lane. MOONLIT SHADOW broke inward to make light contact with Miss Wave, rounded the opening turn in the four path and
left the turn outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and dueled through the stretch to take second late yards.
MADY ROSE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in through the
stretch while outfinished for second. MISS WAVE was jostled leaving the gate then stalked from the three path, challenged nearing the three eighths pole
and took a slim brief lead past the pole, gave chase leaving the five sixteenths but dropped back into the far turn and was outfinished for third late yards.
TAKE CHARGE TINA saved ground off the pace on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and challenged
at the three eighths, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage in the three path then flattened in the lane. DISTORTED SPLENDOR stalked inside the
first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded past the five sixteenths. OUR STRONG VOWS was never a factor. MY
EXPENSIVE GIFT raced well off the pace in the three and four paths on the first turn, entered the backstretch outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS JESSE cleared rivals and angled in to set the pace, rounded the turn well off the rail, bore out leaving the turn but dug in when straightened
away and held well with steady handling. GLORIOUS MAHOMES broke a step slow then gave chase leaving the chute, improved at the rail on the turn,
took second toward the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. JAIME JAMEL gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted extremely wide into the
lane and got up for third late. RUNNING ROY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened toward mid-stretch.
BOSEY chased and rounded the turn two deep, was eased outward into the lane and finished evenly. LIL CHITU chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn
then flattened. LOVER RODOLFO saved ground. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH was not a factor.
