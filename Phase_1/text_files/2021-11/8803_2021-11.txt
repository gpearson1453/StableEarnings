Footnotes
UNBRIDLED MARY brushed UNSOLVED MYSTERY early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled three wide midway on the turn, shifted back inward
in upper stretch, roused and rallied strongly along the fence and nailed rival on the wire. PAMMY'S READY tracked pace early from off the rail, moved up
three deep and got bumped at the quarter pole, came in slightly leaving the bend, reached front past the eighth marker, inched away but could not stave off
the winner. PHENOM broke alertly and sped to the front, set uncontested pace around the turn, remained bit off the rail, was overtaken past mid stretch and
outfinished by top pair. SHE'S SO SHINY stalked from along the rail, bumped with rival near the quarter pole, remained inside into the stretch and lacked
needed late response. UNSOLVED MYSTERY was brushed and put in a bit tight along the rail early and dropped back, chased from the inside, came out
some in the stretch but never menaced. PRESKITT broke alertly then settled off the pace, raced widest of all early, went three wide into turn, got intimidated
and shifted out near the quarter pole, came in slightly but never reached contention in the lane. LUCKY FIFTY FIVE was off tardily, trailed from the inside to
the turn, continued to save ground into the stretch and never menaced. SAI PHAR forced the early issue from outside pacesetter, dropped back bit on the
turn, between rivals nearly quarter marker, was getting out some, checked momentarily and faded through the lane.

upper stretch and coasted in late. SIGNOFTHECROSS traveled three deep then three wide on the first turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied for the
place. MONGOLIAN LEGEND bobbled and got bumped from inside leaving the gate, went between foes then outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, traveled
three then two wide around the second bend, found the rail in the stretch and flattened to third. DIRECT LINE broke a bit slow then got hustled into a
stalking position on the inside, lost ground around the far turn and weakened. KERSHAW went four deep into the first turn, remained widest up the
backstretch, started to tire on the far turn, eased out of the race approaching the quarter pole, pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BALLY'S CHARM dueled for the lead outside a rival then cleared around the clubhouse turn, coaxed along through the second bend, remained clear into
the furlong grounds and inched away late. FORE FLAG broke out and bumped rival, settled on the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, tipped outside the
leader in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. AGADOR SPARTACUS moved down to the inside early, rushed up and steadied at the three-eighths,
bumped with outside rival on the far turn, then chased between leaving the bend, stayed within striking distance in the lane but flatted out late. EREBUS
bumped leaving the gate, was rank and drifted on the first turn, dropped back to trail the field, angled out in upper stretch and kept on to earn a minor award.
ARTHUR SPOONER dueled for the lead from inside then ceded control around the bend, chased between on the backstretch, got bumped on the far turn
outside rival, traveled three deep with a quarter mile to go and weakened. L L L COOL fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped rival, checked soon after,
raced off the pace, bumped at the five-sixteenths pole while four deep and weakened. SIPPIN N KISSIN got bumped on both sides at the start, steadied
between shortly after, floated out by EREBUS on the first turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL WAGER dueled for command outside TODAY'S FLAVOR to the stretch, battled through the final furlong with a narrow advantage and inched
ahead in the final sixteenth. TODAY'S FLAVOR dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn and into the stretch, battled gamely to the wire but
was bested by the winner. DISCO BALL attended the pace three deep, remained up close outside the top pair to the lane, could not keep up into the furlong
grounds, flattened late but held the show. WHO'S THE STAR was off slow to begin, trailed early and steered to the inside, angled out to the three path on
the turn, summoned a mild response and rounded out the superfecta. SOY TAPATIO off slow from outside, dropped back off the pace, entered the turn four
wide, angled down to the two path and could not rally. DESERVEDLY stalked the top trio up the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and weakened.
STING LIKE A BEE chased off the pace, angled to the rail on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH sped clear and crossed over to the inside, asked with a quarter mile remaining, led clear to the eight pole and drew away late.
COMEDIC broke in and bumped rival in the beginning, stalked the pace from inside, moved to the two path around the bend, took aim outside the leader
into the lane, faltered in the late stages but held the place. GRANOLA GIRL chased along the inside into the turn, tipped out a bit into the stretch, angled out
in the lane and showed a mild response to gain the show honors. SPUN BEAUTIFUL got knocked into outside rival at the start, raced near the back early
on, checked off heels near the five-sixteenths pole, went three wide into the stretch, angled in with an eighth of a mile remaining and improved position.
BEACHGRASS broke out and bumped rival, lacked early speed on the inside, saved ground into the lane but failed to threaten. LILAC STARLIGHT stalked
the pacesetter outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, eased out to the four path leaving the turn and weakened. PRETTY RENA settled off the inside,
checked off heels at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the lane and was not a factor. STARSHIP DIPLOMACY tracked in the two path to the stretch
and faded.

Footnotes
LAVA LANE off a step slow from inside, unhurried along the rail then two wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper, angled in then lacked room once more
in midstretch, angled outside the leader in the final sixteenth and surged clear. MAMBA QUEEN off alertly from outside, dueled for command alongside
KEEP YOUR COIL, pressed that rival through the turn, regained command in upper stretch but was run down by the winner late. KEEP YOUR COIL went
up to duel for the lead from inside, held a short lead around the bend, lost command in upper stretch, stayed on from inside to the final sixteenth and held
the show. SHYLOCK EDDIE trailed the field early on, traveled along the inside then two wide into the lane, angled in but lacked room in upper stretch,
angled out then back inward in midstretch and put in a mild late bid. ACAI stalked from inside through the turn, angled out at the top of the lane and needed
to find more in deep stretch. RIGHTEOUSLY stalked the dueling pair outside a rival, took aim three wide leaving the turn, moved out further in the lane but
failed to respond when called upon. HOT RAGEOUS tracked the pacesetters outside a rival, spun four wide into the drive and could not rally.

Footnotes
LA PULCINELA went four then two wide around the first turn, went up to prompt the pace from outside, headed rival on the far turn and dueled to the
stretch, took over at the top of the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and drew away. STARSHIP SKY broke in and bumped rival at the start, settled in
the two path, moved out in the stretch, finished willingly but was unable to threaten the winner late. ZAHRA stumbled leaving the gate, entered the first turn
five wide then angled down to the three path, raced in range into the far turn, traveled three then four wide around the second bend, moved out in upper
stretch, lacked a late bid and held the show. STARSHIP DEFIANT sprinted clear from outside and crossed over to the rail into and around the first turn, took
pressure up the backstretch, got headed with five-sixteenths remaining, dueled into the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong
grounds. HIGHTAILING got bumped from both sides and steadied at the start, chased four then five wide around the first turn, entered the second turn three
deep then went four to five wide around that bend and failed to threaten. BOSSY SOUL went five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, coaxed along
with four furlongs remaining, angled to the rail on the final turn and weakened. SOUL SWEET tracked the pacesetter from inside, dropped back when
crowded a bit on the far turn and came up empty. BIG ANDY stumbled and bumped with rival at the start, unhurried on the inside early, angled out on the
second turn, came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. BIG MOON was off a bit slow and bobbled shortly after the start, went three then two wide
around the first turn, traveled near the back early on, went three wide into the second bend, weakened around that turn and eased out six wide into the drive
and tired.
