Footnotes
TIGER BAIT was quick to begin, tracked the top pair along the inside, made a good rail bid in the stretch, dug in late and prevailed under strong handlling.
SHE'S FIRE AND ICE stalked the early going, moved up three wide into the upper lane and finished willingly to the wire. NEW YEARS LOVE broke in the
air, settled towards the back of the pack early on, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive.. DAAHERACHEL was
unhurried early on, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and and had no final winning bid. FETCHING FURY was off a step slow, saved ground and
never threatened. MISS CASEY BETH showed good early speed to set a pressured pace and gave way. KISS MY GRITS pressed the early leader and
tired readily.

Footnotes
HE'S A RANGER settled off the early pace, was patiently handled around the far turn, moved up four to three wide in the stretch and finished well to get up
under steady handling. RUXIN stalked the early going, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole to take command, led late but was wore down to
finish willingly to the wire. COLONEL TOM stalked the early pace, moved up three wide through the far turn into the upper lane while racing between rivals
and kept on to the wire. TROY OUNCE stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued to race along the inside in the stretch and was
forced to take up sharply near the eighth pole. INTERNET EXPRESS showed good early speed to set the early going and weakened while racing near the
inside. MALIBU MO was off slowly, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. MR NAVIGATOR chased the early leader while
racing three wide and gave way in the drive.

allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, moved up three to two wide into the upper stretch through the lane and finished second best. HUNTER'S
LEGACY was unhurried early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. FRIGERATOR was coaxed along early, raced two to three wide
in the lane and had not enough. SALT CREEK KID was unhurried early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. LOVE
MY RIDE showed good early speed from the inside and gave way the final eighth of a mile. RONALD DALE was hustled along while racing between rivals
early and tired. GO DRAG UP was slow early, raced three wide in the lane and had no response. THAT'S SOMETHING chased while racing wide down the
backstretch and gave way. MONSTER RIVER was slow early, saved ground and had no response.

PHILO BEDDOE showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. SPERLE was off slowly, settled
towards the back of the pack early on, made a steady advance through the far turn, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and got up for the
place position. COURAGEOUS TIMMY was unhurried in the early going, moved up three wide through the far turn into the lane and had not enough for the
top pair. RUNNINGINTHERAIN stalked the early pace, lacked room just past the three eighths pole, raced towards the inside and had not enough in the
drive. NABS coaxed along from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ELLIE THE NURSE settled off the pace, moved up four wide near the
quarter pole and raced evenly with no rally. KIRBY DERBY raced three to two wide around the far turn and failed to respond. STRAWMAN raced six wide
into the upper stretch and failed to sustain a bid. D J'S IMPERIO was off slowly, raced far back and never threatened.
