hand ride. DIAMONDBACK was away slowly, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. SPANISH MAJOR

in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. MANE SOCIETY, off a step slowly, trailed the field, closed
two to four-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. BIG TIME GIZMO raced in mid pack, chased along the rail on the far turn but lacked a closing
response. SAMUEL H stalked the pace, dropped back a bit on the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
STRONG ATTITUDE chased along the inside under a hard hold, was on heels and steadied behind the pacesetter into the turn, settled and angled out to
loom inside the quarter pole, drove to the front before the eighth pole and needed the wire desperately late. AFLEET EDDIE was bumped in a chain reaction
incident at the start and off the pace, rallied three to two wide on the turn and out into the five path in upper stretch, on his wrong lead before switching at the
sixteenth pole, accelerating his run from there but just failed, running out of real estate. MOJO JOJO trailed into the turn three wide, went inside rivals
midway on the bend and out to the two path turning for home, closed extremely well in the final sixteenth to grab the show spot in the shadow of the wire.
CHAIRMAN FOX stalked the two pacesetters, loomed outside that pair turning for home, but had to dip inside the winner near the sixteenth pole when that
one wandered a bit, losing the show spot late. SILENT FIRE was three wide down the backside and around the turn when chasing the three leaders, shifted
in down the lane when closing ground gradually without threatening. LOCCHE went to the front early, was stalked and pressed by the winner and passed
nearing the eighth pole, fading back from there. RED BARI was bumped by a rival at the start, in midpack and between rivals down the backside and on the
turn, rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch but levelled off in the final sixteenth. TOPPING THE CHARTS stumbled and broke out at the start, settled off the
pace and five to four wide on the turn, never reaching contention. C BY THE SEA off the pace early and trailed three to five wide on the turn, never entering
a bid. ACCORDING TO CODE broke out and bumped rivals at the start, rushed up and steadied behind the leaders, dropped back to chase on the rail and
retreated midturn to the wire.
