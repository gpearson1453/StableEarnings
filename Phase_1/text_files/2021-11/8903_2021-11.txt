SACRED BEAUTY was away in good order and was hustled to set moderate fractions through the turn, met the challenge of UPTOWN RHAPSODY on the
second turn, repelled that foe leaving the turn and was kept to task through the lane to hold in a drive. SMILING MELANIE stalked the pace through the
backstretch, improved position on the second turn while two wide and closed well in the stretch to claim the place. UPTOWN RHAPSODY prompted the
pace from SACRED BEAUTY, made a three wide bid on the second turn but was turned away heading into the lane and was outfinished in the late going,
just missing for second. GINGERDOODLE settled off of the pace while still close up through the second turn, was three wide on the second turn and gave
way in the stretch run. STYLIZED stalked the early pace through the backstretch, lost ground on the second turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
UNUSUAL CODE sat just off of the dueling pacesetters through the second turn while saving ground, angled out for the drive and made a late kick in the
final sixteenth to get by the runner-up to prevail. SUMMANUS was away well and set the pace while being pressed by OCTAVIUS PRIME through the
second turn, was able to gain a bit of ground on that foe leaving the second turn but was caught inside of the final sixteenth by the winner while holding for
second. OCTAVIUS PRIME dueled with SUMMANUS on the front end through the second turn, gave a bit of ground to that rival leaving the second turn and
was outfinished in the stretch run. TOMMY SPECIAL was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the second turn and was not a threat in the
drive. PRINCE CINDERELLA stalked the pace through the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. ALOIS settled off of the pace through the
backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn, was eased nearing the top of the stretch and walked off.

TIZ THE TALE settled off of the initial pace, was two wide on the turn, tipped out for the stretch run and made a late surge in the final sixteenth to prevail.
LEMON ZINGER was away fast and set the pace through the turn, had a clear lead into the stretch but was caught by the winner inside of the
sixteenth-marker while holding for the place. HEAT N REHEAT stalked the pace while four wide on the turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the stretch and
just held for the show. EAGLE IN THE SKY was forwardly placed in the early going, was two wide between horses on the turn and was outfinished in the
stretch run, just losing the nod for third. TIGER'S ARROW had no early speed, mounted a four to five wide bid on the turn but did not offer a late rally. SAL
MAGLIE tracked the early pace, was three wide between horses on the turn, was shuffled back while in tight quarters on the turn and gave way in the
stretch. PATH TO PARADISE chased the pace from the second flight while saving ground and faded in the drive.

UNREAL attended to the pace of MOB BOSS through the turn, mounted a two wide bid to collar that foe heading into the lane and pulled away in a good
debut. MOB BOSS was away well and set the pace while being prompted by the winner, was collared by UNREAL leaving the turn and could not hold him
off while besting the rest. FLOYD KNOWLES stalked the pace from the inside and was outkicked in the stretch run. RHODIUM RUNNER stalked the pace
while two wide on the turn and gave way in the late going. STORMY SAMURAI broke in a tangle and was away slowly, was three wide on the turn and did
not mount a late rally. THE CALABRESE KID was away a bit slowly and chased the leaders from the rear, was two wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
RAGER settled off of the early quick pace, mounted a three wide bid leaving the turn, closed fast in the stretch to collar the pacesetter inside of the furlong
marker and held over oncoming rivals to prevail. ITALIANO tracked the pace while saving ground on the turn, angled out for the drive and rallied in the
stretch to win the nod for place. ULTIMATE BANGO settled off of the early quick pace while saving ground and found his best stride late along the rail, just
missing for second. IN OUR A hopped at the start and was hustled to chase from the rear, was two to three wide on the turn, four to five wide in upper
stretch and rallied in the late going but could not reel in the top three. BORDER TOWN stalked the pace through the turn while two wide, lost a bit of ground
on the pacesetter leaving the turn, took up nearing the furlong marker when PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY drifted out and was outfinished in the late going.
PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY was away well and set fast fractions, had a clear lead into the lane, drifted several paths nearing the furlong marker under firm
left-handed urging and tired in the late going. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY chased the early leaders from toward the rear, was three to four wide on the turn,
swung out to five to six wide entering the stretch, was blocked in the late going and lacked a final kick. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED TWO INQUIRIES
INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT #1 IN OUR A HOPPED AT THE START AND WAS AFFORDED AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR A CLEAN BREAK AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER FROM THAT INCIDENT. ALSO, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT #5 PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY DID DRIFT INTO THE PATH OF #6 BORDER TOWN AT THE FURLONG MARKER BUT BORDER
TOWN FINISHED AHEAD OF PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY IN THE FINAL ORDER AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE
INCIDENT.

was up in time to prevail. CLEARLY GONE settled off of the pace through the second turn, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn, vied for the lead
heading into the lane, had the lead inside of the final sixteenth but was tagged in the final strides by the winner while clear of the rest. LA VIKINA set modest
fractions while being pressured through the second turn, was confronted by CLEARLY GONE leaving the second turn and was outkicked in the late going,
though held for third. SCHERZO (GB) was forwardly placed through the second turn, could not match strides with oncoming runners leaving the second turn
and was outfinished in the stretch run. LORETTA pressed the pace through the second turn while two wide and gave way in the stretch drive. NAVY
QUEEN was pinched at the start,stalked the pace from a two wide position on the second turn and weakened in the late going. MISTY CAT stalked the pace
through the second turn, gained ground on the second turn while along the inside, and tired in the stretch run. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT was rank in the early
going, settled toward the rear of the field on the backstretch, was four wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
QUICK TIME (GB) sat just off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid on the turn to confront LOVELY HUSSAR, found a game foe in that rival, dueled
to the final strides and dug in to prevail. LOVELY HUSSAR was away well and set the fractions while being pressured, was confronted by QUICK TIME on
the turn, battled back against the winner through the lane but was gamely bested in the final strides, just missing for the win while holding for second.
ARISTEIA hopped at the start and chased the leaders from the rear in the early going, saved ground on the turn and made a good late rally in the stretch
but could not quite reel in the top pair. GIRL CAN FLY stalked the pace from a three wide position and tired in the stretch run. ELLE VICTOIRE chased the
leaders from the rear, was four wide on the turn and weakened in the late stages. EVENING AMBITION pressed the pace through the turn while four wide
and faded in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START REGARDING #5 ARISTEIA AND DETERMINED THAT SHE
WAS AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A CLEAN START AND CAUSED HER OWN TROUBLE BY HOPPING AT THE BREAK AND THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.
