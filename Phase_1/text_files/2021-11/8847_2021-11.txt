RULER was allowed to settle early, had a mild bid mid stretch while no threat. GOD'S WILL BE DONE had good position early, rallied at the quarter pole
and drew close, then hung in the stretch. CAPE MARCO DRIVE was never a threat. NO TIME TO YAWN wide early, was outrun.

LAST DROP OF WINE was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was well handled on the front end, led throughout and remained clear late under steady
handling. GIZMO JONES was allowed to settle early on the inside, rallied in the stretch and angled out three wide, finished well and was gaining late. FAT
DADDY chased the winner throughout and went evenly late. MAKE THE RULES allowed to settle, failed to menace. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX never far
back early, lacked a late response. KLAATU raced wide early and tired on the far turn.

CUT RATES was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch on the rail, finished strongly and was along in time. SISTER'S CREED broke alertly and set the pace
until deep stretch and was caught late. FORTUNATE GINA pressed the pace throughout and finished willingly in a good effort. MY BELLE MICHELLE was
unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch and closed a gap. DREAMINOFJUSTICE allowed to settle, failed to menace. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE was well
placed throughout, lacked a late kick. CIRCLE WILL RUN raced mid pack and was no threat. GIFT FROM MOM was off slowly, saved ground and needed a
late bid. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE contended early and was through after a half.
