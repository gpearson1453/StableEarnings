Footnotes
DREAM KEEPER was placed on the lead, set a sensible and uncontested pace, kept on at the front in the two path on the far turn, began to open up on the
field from the five sixteenths, was hand ridden in upper stretch and began to draw off in earnest, increased his advantage while driven near the eighth pole,
was taken back to a hand ride approaching the sixteenth pole and wrapped up late. PRINCE OF MAYHEM raced three wide into the clubhouse turn,
continued two wide past the seven eighths after BRAVO BRAVO took back, inched forward into the backstretch to track outside of DREAM KEEPER down
the backstretch and in the three path around the far turn, proved no match for that foe from the five sixteenths, and chased on second best. POLITO settled
in second last around the first turn, was keen to join outside of BRAVO BRAVO midfield past the three quarters, continued outside that foe down the back
straight and in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven two to three wide into the lane and proved best of the rest. TOWN AGENDA settled at the
rear of the field, continued patiently in the three path on the far turn, was driven three to four wide in upper stretch and passed tiring foes.
CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN tracked the leader between horses into the clubhouse turn, raced at the inside of the tracking flight into the backstretch, tracked the
leading pair in the pocket down the back straight, continued to pursue the leading pair in the four path on the far turn, was driven in the six path in upper
stretch and flattened out. BRAVO BRAVO was extremely fractious in the gate, raced keenly at the inside of the tracking flight into the first turn, took up near
the seven eighths and was taken back to midfield, chased inside of POLITO down the backstretch and while saving ground around the far turn, and came
up empty inside in the lane.

Footnotes
MEMORY BANK, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, angled to the rail in the opening stages while being reserved inside foes in the last flight, saved
ground into the far turn gradually gathering momentum, came through along the inside to split rivals just off the inside nearing the sixteenth marker, shifted
inwards once challenging for command and prevailed under steady handling. ANDREAS was rated just out of striking distance while angling to the rail
racing into the first turn, was prompted to challenge while shifting out to bid three wide between foes entering upper stretch, gained a brief advantage
between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. HALF OF MANHATTAN was caught four wide racing into the first turn dropping off the second flight,
shifted inwards to race between foes on the backstretch, steadily advanced splitting rivals racing into upper stretch, angled five wide in late stages and
continued with interest to close the gap on the top pair while prevailing for a share. CONVICT PIKE, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, made steady progress outside foes racing into the far turn gaining position, swung out to bid four wide between foes racing into upper stretch
but was outkicked. PACKED HOUSE, urged to the lead while angling inside, set the on a clear margin to the far turn, held grudgingly to midstretch, was
headed nearing the sixteenth pole, then was taken in hand momentarily when losing his path to the winner late. REMEMBER THE MAINE, reserved
between foes near the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned seven wide by a drifting rival
racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. DOLLAR BLUE switched off the inside racing into the first turn to track the leaders
between foes in second flight, was prompted to advance while caught five wide nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. FRONTANA, urged to a
forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid three wide between foes nearing upper stretch
but emptied out racing past the furlong marker. GRAND HIDEAWAY tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch but never gained
contention. IRISH MAJOR switched out three, then four wide racing as part of the second flight in the opening half, was fanned six wide nearing upper
stretch and had no closing response. JUSTENUFFTUFF, caught five wide racing into the first turn, settled outside rivals on the backstretch, angled out
nearing upper stretch, then drifted to the six path entering the lane carrying out REMEMBER THE NAME and had no rally.

Footnotes
W W TRAFALGAR was sent to the lead, set the pace while clear down the back straight, took some pressure from CRANKSHAFT around the turn while
saving ground, shook that foe off into upper stretch, and held his advantage stalwartly under a drive. SMILING SILAS tracked the leading pair inside early,
chased the leading pair in the two path on the turn, rallied inside into the lane, was driven past the quarter pole, could not get to W W TRAFALGAR but kept
on willingly to hold the place. ABUELO NUNO settled toward the rear inside, was pushed along on the turn and improved between horses continued his rally
three wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked for the place. CHANGE DIRECTION settled at the inside of the rear pair, saved ground around the turn while
improving position, came two wide into upper stretch, angled out, kept on mildly but ultimately did not have enough to reach the leading trio. MAJESTIC
JOHN'S settled two wide in the rear pair early, trailed in the four path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses late. JIMMIE T
settled toward the rear outside of ABUELO NUNO early, chased in the five to six path on the turn, continued six wide into upper stretch, and lacked the
needed finishing kick. W W RUSSIAN GOLD bumped with CRANKSHAFT in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair between horses early, settled
back to midpack past the eleven sixteenths, chased toward the rear in the four path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, bumped with CHARLES T in
upper stretch, and proved empty. CRANKSHAFT bumped with W W RUSSIAN GOLD in the opening strides, tracked the leader early, prompted outside the
pacesetter in the three path on the turn, loomed approaching the quarter, but was no match from upper stretch and emptied out. CHARLES T tracked the
leading pair three wide early, chased three wide around the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, and bumped with W W RUSSIAN GOLD in upper stretch
and ultimately proved empty.

Footnotes
VALERIE VALESKI broke sharply, sped clear of the field racing a bit off the rail to the turn, held sway on a commanding margin into upper stretch and was
kept to the task. AH LEAH, reserved from out of striking distance between foes racing to the turn, swung out nearing upper stretch gathering momentum,
split foes midstretch and prevailed for second late. MEMORIES OF YOU, off slowly while ducking inwards at the start, settled outside foes racing to the turn,
angled out five wide racing through upper stretch and found her best stride in late stages to gain a share. CARMEN O'ELECTRA tracked the leaders outside
rivals behind the second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting to the four path nearing midstretch but had no late kick.
RULER DAENERYS tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, steadied out of close quarters nearing the turn and continued evenly
between rivals to late stages. RENDLAKE angled inwards to track the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the turn, shifted inside nearing upper
stretch and faded in the drive. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY, urged along pursuing the pacesetter between foes from the outset into the turn, gave way after a
half. TIKA TOY settled well off the leaders along the inside in early stages and failed to menace. LAURA N LUKAS settled outside foes in the last flight, then
raced wide into the stretch while proving no threat. PIPPITY DO DA urged inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, steadily faded
nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BE AUTHENTIC broke inward, tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, continued to track the leader in the two path
on the far turn, was urged inside into the lane, took the lead approaching the three sixteenths, and held sway driving. KIMBERLY FRANCES was herded
inward in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear pair, rallied between horses two and then three wide in tandem with BIG LUCK around the far
turn, sustained her rally inside of horses down the lane and proved second best. A FAST BROAD raced between horses in the chasing flight around the first
turn, continued to chase two wide down the back straight, improved to track the leading pair in the three path on the far turn, angled four wide in upper
stretch, proved no match for the top two but kept on three wide late for the show. LION LOVE settled near the rear, continued two wide near the rear on the
backstretch, improved to chase in the four path around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, and chased on mildly. HER GOLD MINE advanced into the
first turn to track the leader, put pressure outside her into the backstretch, headed TEMRIK past the half mile mark, led clear in the three path on the far turn,
was driven two wide in upper stretch, was headed by BE AUTHENTIC to his inside approaching the three sixteenths, and flattened out late. DARING
DAMSEL raced at the inside of the chasing flight, was taken off the inside near the three eighths to allow the weakening TEMRIK past, returned to the inside
into the lane, angled out under a drive near the three sixteenths, but lacked the needed kick. BIG LUCK raced two wide in the rear pair, rallied three and
then four wide around the far turn in tandem with KIMBERLY FRANCES, was driven five wide in upper stretch and failed to sustain her bid. FOOT RUB
LOVE broke outward, settled toward the rear, raced near the rear inside of LION LOVE down the back straight, trailed in the two to three path around the far
turn, and lacked the needed rally three to four wide in the lane. PRESENT OF HERO raced three wide in the chasing flight through the clubhouse turn,
inched forward into the backstretch to track the leading trio, chased in the four path around the far turn, and came up empty six wide in the lane. TEMRIK
was in tight in the opening strides, nonetheless cleared into the clubhouse turn, took pressure from HER GOLD MINE into the backstretch, continued on a
narrow lead until just past the half, was headed by HER GOLD MINE, and stopped inside.

Footnotes
GITA'S LAD switched out of close quarters just after the start, tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance, gradually drew on terms with the leaders leaving midstretch and just edged
RICHIESGOTSWAGGER in time under firm right handed pressure. The latter, shifted in sharply just after the start, was prompted to a position just off the
leaders racing to the turn, advanced three wide on the bend to press the issue leaving the midway point of the turn, wrested the advantage between calls
leaving the furlong marker and just failed to contain the winner. MKAR THE FAST angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight
racing into the turn, tipped out racing through the stretch and split rivals in the closing stages to gain position while prevailing for a share. RIDE RICHIE
RIDE hopped at the start while breaking slowly, was urged to regain contention while shifting out to race between foes in the opening furlong, was pulling
against restraint racing in close quarters into the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out five wide in the closing stages but had no
final response. Z U SOON was roused from the break to dispute the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command through the
turn into upper stretch and gave out in late stages. BULLDOG OF BERGEN was rated off the second flight inside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out
racing through the stretch but made no real impression. BABA LOU was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn and offered no rally.
LAKE MILLS was urged pressing the pace outside a rival, then between foes racing into the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE attended the pace outside of RED FLAG ALERT approaching the first turn, settled back to track the pace around the bend, was keen to
attend the pace outside RED FLAG ALERT again into the backstretch, continued to attend two wide around the far turn, headed the leader near the quarter
pole, vied with him through midstretch, and proved narrowly best late. RED FLAG ALERT set the pace inside, was pressed by GO FOR SHERRIE into the
backstretch, continued to take pressure from that foe around the far turn, was headed near the quarter pole, stayed on to duel through upper and
midstretch, but was narrowly outfinished in a game try. POLICY OPTION settled toward the rear inside of DANVILLE, continued near the rear in the two
path around the far turn, was taken to the inside in upper stretch, and rallied to prove best of the rest. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE hopped at the start, tracked
the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the leading flight down the back straight and in the two path on the far turn, proved no match
for the leading pair, chased on but lost the show past the furlong mark. DANVILLE settled toward the rear outside of POLICY OPTION, continued to chase
toward the rear down the back straight, was pushed along in the five path on the far turn and driven five wide in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to
prove a threat in the lane. CURLINGTON settled at the rear, continued at the back of the field in the three path on the far turn, was taken out six wide in
upper stretch, and made belated outside improvement past tiring horses under a drive. NIGHT THINGS chased three wide around the first turn, advanced
outside to briefly attend the pace three wide into the backstretch, settled back to track past the five eighths, continued to track two wide around the far turn,
was driven three wide in upper stretch and flattened out. RIVER CACTUS chased between horses through the clubhouse turn, continued two wide in the
tracking flight down the back straight, flattened out to midpack past the five eighths, was pushed along while chasing in the four path on the far turn, came
three wide into the lane under a drive, angled inward in upper stretch and proved empty.

Footnotes
LONG STATION, roused to gain a contending position along the inside in the opening stages, switched off the inside tracking the leaders three wide into the
bend, steadily drew into striking distance in that path racing to midstretch, then altered course five wide in the final sixteenth to wrest the advantage in time.
ROLLS ROYCE DEAL shifted inwards to track just off the leaders racing under light rating to the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid four wide
entering the lane, drifted inwards under right handed pressure crossing over the path of TALE OF THE NILE while gaining the advantage between calls
leaving midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while just lasting for second. BEL BIMBO settled off the second flight along the inside in early stages,
switched out racing through the turn, angled six wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride in the final sixteenth to close the gap while prevailing
narrowly for a share. OFFLEE FUN angled inwards racing through the backstretch tracking the leaders between foes in second flight, advanced in tandem
just inside the eventual winner in upper stretch, split foes just off the inside in the final sixteenth and was just outkicked. TALE OF THE NILE, forwardly
placed three deep attending the pace on the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path on the turn to upper stretch, was carried inwards leaving midstretch
but had no final response. BORA BORA broke in bumping YOUNG CORBETT at the start, was held up in close quarters between foes in the opening
stages, dropped out last racing into the turn, then shifted five wide in the closing stages to gain some position between foes. HIGH HERO sped to the lead
from the break, was headed in the second furlong, pressed the pace between foes into the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and gave out leaving
the furlong marker. POWER CRY pulled his way between foes, then angled to the inside in the second furlong to duel for command inside foes into the turn,
pressed the issue into upper stretch and faltered late. YOUNG CORBETT, bumped at the start, settled outside foes racing to the turn, continued wide into
the stretch and proved no threat. MAXIMUS IMAGE bobbled at the start breaking a bit slowly, angled to the rail tracking off the second flight, was caught in
tight quarters racing through the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then was taken in hand avoiding traffic in the closing stages. FOLLOWING THE RACE,
THE RIDER OF TALE OF THE NILE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BY THE RIDER OF ROLLS ROYCE
DEAL BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
