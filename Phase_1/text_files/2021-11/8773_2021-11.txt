THE BOSS OF YOU stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then slowly edged clear in the drive to prove best
under a drive. BALI dueled for the lead two wide early, made a bid on the turn to lead by the five sixteenths pole, then was headed nearing the quarter pole,
fought gamely to the wire but was outfinished. DANCE LIGHTLY chased the early pace three wide, then moved to the inside on the turn, made a inside bid
leaving the turn and hung late. MITTENSANDMUKLUKS was outrun early, swung out four wide for the drive and closed well late. DOCS WAY was fractious
in the gate, dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. GOLD TIME VIXEN was rated along early and made a four wide move on the turn but came up
empty in the drive.

Footnotes
R RAJUN BULL was rated along early, then advanced in hand three wide on the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole and came three wide into the drive,
angled in by the three sixteenths pole and closed up the inside to get up late under a drive. POWERFULLY BUILT dueled for the early lead two wide, then
made a bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, then was caught late to just miss in a game effort. JEBOLOGIST prompted the pace and made a
three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole but flattened out, bested rest. MARTINKELLY was allowed to settle early, made a four
wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. HARD BELLE was allowed to settle early, then raced on the inside on the turn, swung out six wide for
the drive and had no rally. ANANROAD dueled for the early lead on the inside, then fell back on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive and weakened.

PROMISE OF JOY was away alertly and soon clear to set the early pace while clear, then drew out leaving the turn and was kept to pressure to prove best.
MICK'SBESTBETYET stalked the winner early three wide then continued willingly to be clearly second best. FRED'S SHEILA was allowed to settle early on
the inside and offered a mild late rally on the inside to best the rest. MISCHIEF MANAGED chased the early pace and was three to four wide on the turn,
came three wide into the drive and had no rally. BRIDGE TO BROOKLYN was settled back early, swung out six wide for the drive and passed the tiring
rivals. TONIGHT MAYBE was bumped at the start, then chased the early pace five wide and made a mild bid four wide on the turn, but came up empty in
the drive. KEFALIANI chased the early pace from between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
SILVER LOCKS was off slowly, then advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the driver and closed well to get up in time under a drive.
CAPRICHOSA pressed the early pace and then dueled for the lead three wide on the turn, made a bid to shake clear by the furlong marker, but was caught
in deep stretch. EMILIA STRONG was seven wide early then shifted in entering the far turn to be four wide on the turn, swung out eight wide for the drive
and rallied well late. NIKKIS KITTEN chased the early pace, then was shuffled on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive and had no rally. MIA CALIA
chased the early pace and made a bid on the inside leaving the turn but flattened out. SINFUL BEAUTY set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.
ZORRITA failed to menace. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE was allowed to settle early while five to six wide and had no rally. FALSE RULING pressed the early
pace and then went up to duel four wide on the turn then stopped in the lane. GREEDY LIKE JEANE showed little.
