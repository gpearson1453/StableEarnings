Footnotes
GONNA BE EPIC sent from the gate, rated in a tracking position, angled three and four wide through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader,
gained a short lead into the stretch, then drifted in under left hand urging and drew off. BYE BYE DAVID mid pack, moved up two and three wide through
the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. FORTY FLASH broke sharply from the gate to sprint clear,
held sway to the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. NEVERENOUGHCOCO mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. MONETIZED four wide through the first turn pulling, held position three wide through the second turn, then
drifted in into the lane and faded. LINGUIST allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, then passed tiring one in the lane.
SETTE STELLE improved position, inside. PONGO LOUIE showed little. SUPER TRIPLE stalked the pace outside and faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
HERO TIGER never far back, moved up inside through the turn, angled out three wide into the stretch, shook clear while lugging in slightly, then drew off
under left hand urging. TRAPPEZOID angled out in the early going, gained a short lead through the turn and moved inward, then stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, angled out after being passed by the winner and held second. BRASSTOWN set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn,
then faded into the stretch and held the show. ITALIAN CHARM allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals, inside. MY POINT EXACTLY well placed and outside,
lost some ground through the turn, then faded in the lane. POCO CHARLIE was never involved. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF TRAPPEZOID
AGAINST THE WINNER WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

Footnotes
CHASING HAPPINESS set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, shook clear, turned back a bid into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the
task. UP IN THE AIR mid pack, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, was no match for that one and
held the place. GINGER SPARKLE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up for the show. TYRONA well placed and inside, steadied into the turn, held position inside through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch
and flattened. CREME CARAMEL alowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals.
NOVEL IDEA hard ridden inside, ran evenly to the stretch, angled three wide and weakened. SURREAL FANTASY broke sharply from the gate, stalked the
pace outside and stopped. XCARET never far back, moved up into the turn, then faded on the two path through the turn.

off and was kept to the task. PHILO allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for
the place. UHTRED rated back in the early going, moved up three wide into the second turn, gained position through the turn, bid on that path and flattened
out. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT well placed and inside, held position on the two path through the second turn, angled out in the stretch and weakened. BANDY'S
MAP allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DOVER CLIFFS well
placed and between, lost some ground two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. KRAMDEN
sprinted to a clear lead early, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, then faded through the second turn. FARLEY four wide pulling through the
first turn, stalked the pace, gained a short lead down the backstretch, shook clear through the second turn, then faded in the stretch. CANDY CRUSHEM
was no factor, inside. IL FARAONE was always outrun.

Footnotes
KING OF DREAMS stalked the pace in the early going, stayed on to track that one to the second turn, gained position on the two path, bid outside gaining
the lead into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. FIGHTING FORCE mid pack and outside, looped up three and four wide through the
second turn, came five wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. SIGILOSO well placed, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid
three wide, exchanging bumps with HERCULES, then flattened in the lane. TWELVE VOLT MAN allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through
the turn, bid three wide into the lane, drifted in and weakened. GO MIKE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned
widest into the stretch bumping a rival and evened out. ARZAK rated inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled widest into the
stretch, was bumped and weakened. TORETTO tracked the pace well back, angled out through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and faded
the final furlong. HERCULES well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, exchanged bumps into the stretch,
then came through and faded. RABDAN mid pack and off the rail, steadily lost ground. OFFICIATING four wide through the first turn, gained a striking
position three wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. MOONLITE STRIKE rated on the lead pulling, sprinted away down the backstretch,
then was pressured from outside approaching the stretch, took up sharply on the rail and dropped back. IRISH HONOR was no factor. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE INCIDENT NEARING THE TOP OF THE STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
