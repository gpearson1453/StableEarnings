Footnotes
FLEETERTHAN vied between rivals early then edged away after a long duel min a steady drive. SIZZLING ROMA dueled along the inside and continued
gamely to finish. STORMBEAM lacked speed, swung very wide into the stretch rallying. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT raced within range outside and lacked a
rally. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE moved closer wide on the turn then flattened out.
ENIGMATICA prompted the pace three wide and began fading on the turn.

AMBITIOUSLY PLACED raced four wide early, vied outside for the lead, dueled with SWEET SAMURAI on the far turn, battled with that rival to midstretch
and then drew clear late under urging. SWEET SAMURAI raced two wide early, vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in
gamely inside in the stretch drive and came up second best. B B'S ROCKET stalked two wide, then chased the leaders on the far turn and rallied mildly
outside for third. BEAUTIFUL STAR raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and gained mildly inside in the lane. SUPERHELPFUL raced off
the rail, off the pace, chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. RISQUE'S JEWEL raced off the pace inside, went two wide on the far turn and failed to
threaten. LET'S CELEBRATE raced off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. TALE OF KITTEN was outrun early, went three wide on
the far turn and did not factor. PRETTY SPECTACULAR tracked close up on the inside, then chased and gave way.

DISTRACTANDATTACK cleared off entering the first turn, set the pace, pulled away from the field on the far turn, responded when roused turning for home,
drew off to a lengthy lead and was ridden out. RICKIE'S MELODY tracked on the inside, chased the winner on the far turn and was clearly second best. NO
TOLERANCE was bumped at the start, stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the far turn, dug in and held on for third. MARADONA raced off the pace
inside, chased inside on the far turn and rode the rail in the stretch. CROSSOVER raced off the rail, chased the leaders on the far turn and failed to
threaten. SLAM BANG was bumped at the start, raced far back early, rode the rail into the lane and did not factor. CRUISE CONTROL was outrun early,
saved ground on the far turn and did not factor. CHARLY'S ASSASSIN raced three wide early, stalked three wide and gave way.
