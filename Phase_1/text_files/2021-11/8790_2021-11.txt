Footnotes
SARAH ADRIANA unhurried in the beginning, racing near the back, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied and was
going away at the end. KLEINMEISTER void of early speed, made a late rail bid and was a clear second at the wire. C C CROWN'S CHOICE vied for the
early lead, forwardly placed throughout and weakened. SMACKFIRE lacked early speed and passed tired ones late. PRAYERS SAVED dueled on the front
end, saved ground around the turn and faded. SOCIAL GALAXY raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and faded. PERFECT
PEACH pressed the early pace and dropped back.

BLUE RIDGE QUEEN vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, was challenged by MEAN AMERICAN down the stretch and pulled away
late. MEAN AMERICAN unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, made a bid for the lead, but proved no match late for the winner.
RACELYNN raced in the middle of the field, moved up and finished evenly behind the top two. AUDACIOUS GIRL raced near the middle of the pack, eased
back, made a mild bid late, but was no factor. ENOUGH HEART pressed the early pace, saved ground and faded. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK always raced
near the back and showed little. SASSY SUE'S BAND raced near the back in the beginning, had an outside trip, made a bid and was finished early.
ROCKETT MAGIC dueled on the front end and stopped.
