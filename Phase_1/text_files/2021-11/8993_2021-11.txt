Footnotes
HIT AND RUN broke slowly but stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied, led mid stretch and drove clear. SYSTEMIC
RISK showed brief speed then forced the pace, took a clear lead upper stretch, was passed mid stretch and held place. TAKOTA showed brief speed then
pressed the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn then finished gamely between foes. SPEEDY LYNN raced in mid pack, closed up to press the
pace on the turn, chased four-wide and was game through the stretch. IMA BEAST settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, was
blocked upper stretch, moved to the rail when a path opened and finished gamely in vain. ASHA IRONBORN settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail
on the turn but never reached contention. CLASSY N' SILENT was off slowly but was quick to find the lead, set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch
and gave way.

Footnotes
TALK TO YA LATER broke in and bumped a rival at the start, settled in midpack and advanced three to four wide on the turn, into range turning for home
and got by at the forty yard marker despite not changing leads and lugging in down the lane. SACRED DANCER broke out herding two rivals at the start,
pressed the pace three wide and was in front well off the rail mid backstretch, powered ahead to open up a clear lead on the fence into the turn, a very fast
pace taking its toll in the late stages when the winner went by. PLEASURE'S GOLD hesitated at the start and was far back, moved up to have two beat on
the backstretch, came three to five wide on the turn and out in the six path turning for home, continued to close good ground despite lugging in down the
lane while outside. RETAIL THERAPIST trailed early, stayed on the fence through the turn before angling out in upper stretch, closing doggedly down the
lane to best the balance. WELL ACTUALLY was between runners vying for the front early, took back to chase the runaway leader, stayed in contention until
upper stretch when her run meter went to empty. LOAD ABROAD sat along the rail in midpack, stayed glued to the fence throughout but could only run
evenly down the lane, neither gaining or losing ground when seemingly intimidated by a rival in the two path the final furlong. LADY FORTUNE was two
wide and chasing early, between rivals and inside the eventual winner at the quarter pole, out in the five path into the stretch but had no punch down the
lane. MAJESTIC HORIZON sat inside midpack early, came two to three wide at the quarter pole to rally but stalled in upper stretch. DAZZLING DIVA had
one rival beat early, stayed near the back and three wide on the turn, never entering contention. SHE AINT NO JOKE was inside two rivals vying for the
early lead, began to fade midway on the turn and retreated down the lane. PHIL IN ECHO was bumped by a rival at the start and near the rear of the field,
put in a mild rally by mid turn but fell back down the stretch.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA had one rival beaten early, circle three to four wide into range on the turn and loomed outside the leading pair turning for home, drove by at the
eighth pole, widened and was taken in hand late. SIR SEAMUS sprinted clear early, was challenged by a rival late on the turn and into the stretch, got the
better of that foe but the winner went by at the eighth pole, no match for that one's run but holding the place spot late. SHANGASSAH trailed, was three to
four wide at the back on the turn and was out in the five path turning for home, closing determinedly down the stretch to gain on the place finisher with a
solid run. SUNSPEAR chased inside early, came out to bid on the turn and was head and head for the front turning for home, between the top pair in upper
stretch but faded in the final sixteenth. KITTEN'S SOLUTION was between rivals in midpack early, in tight a tad turning for home but had no kick down the
lane to put in any type of a bid. BRASS COMPASS chased outside early, was three wide through the turn and just running up and down in place down the
stretch. TOLD IT ALL sat along the rail in midpack, stayed glued to the fence throughout and never entered the fray.

PINK LLOYD settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, lost a bit of ground at the top of the stretch, dug in when asked and was up at the 70
yard pole and was not going to be turned away. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE forced the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive, but
missed. CLAYTON set a pressured pace, moved clear through the turn, held bravely to deep stretch and was caught. TAP IT TO WIN stalked the pace, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then chased to the end. RED RIVER REBEL was off a step slowly, raced from off the pace, was hustled
two-wide on the turn, was blocked a furlong out then chased when he got loose. SOUPER STONEHENGE, in range early, was hustled four and five-wide on
the turn then rallied from the outside. LENNY K, away slowly and off the pace, rode the rail on the turn but evened out along the fence in the final stages.
SMOKIN' JAY briefly pressed the leader, stalked three and four-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th.

MARAIS pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader late backstretch and through the turn, challenged near the top of the stretch, was headed briefly but she
quickly drew even and edged ahead then held under a drive. COOL SOCIETY was away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to two-wide
on the turn, rallied between foes and just missed. MOPOLKA set a pressured pace, was joined at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out and gave
way grudgingly. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD stalked the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn, rallied outside but evened out in deep stretch. ANTIGONE
settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide on the turn but leveled out in the stretch. A LITTLE VOODOO was off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled
on the turn and chased through the stretch. LEON AZUL settled in mid pack, was hustled rail and two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. A BROKEN
BREEZE was away slowly and settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response.
