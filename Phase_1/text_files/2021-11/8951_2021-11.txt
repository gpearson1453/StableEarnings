Footnotes
TOTHEMOONANDBACK was away in good order to duel for the lead with OYE COMO VA from off the rail, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive
and gamely prevailed. OYE COMO VA broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied into deep stretch but could not get by
that rival in the drive. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. BIG CALI GIRL
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. WAR MAIDEN was void of early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn, angled in nearing the quarter and was not a factor. BODE'S BEST broke through the gate prior to the start, raced four-wide through the turn and
was far back throughout.

PINTXOS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was up late. COASTAL KID was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin and yielded to the winner late.
KOWBOYKABIN chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, drifted in slightly and stayed on well in
the drive to finish willingly. I'M LEAVING YOU showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position approaching
the stretch and weakened through the final furlong. WHATSITTOYA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, steadied then clipped heels
nearing the three-eighths marker and was eased through the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF WHATSITTOYA
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST KOWBOYKABIN CONCERING THE STEADYING AND CLIPPING HEELS OF HIS MOUNT AT THE THREE-EIGHTS

Footnotes
MISSED THE BOAT dueled for the lead from the inside with MY COWBOY, drifted out nearing the quarter, was straightened away and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. THE BEAT lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a
steady bid. MY COWBOY disputed the pace while racing three-wide, was carried by the winner into the stretch and gave way in the drive. HOUSE LIMIT
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. JOHNNY was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PRESS BRIEFING settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
weakened.

WITH THATBEINGSAID stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear. HOLY
TUTTA BELLA was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner late but finished well to
re-gain the place. COMPLETE CONTROL was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished
with good energy. SUNSHINE BEACH pressed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. FABULOUS FORUM settled off the leaders
throughout and finished evenly in the drive. SECOND GRACE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MS
MICHELLE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

SPARKLING LUTE dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held sway to the wire. GOLDEN TIGER
was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout, reached a striking position into the stretch and failed to gain late. BRETT was forwardly placed
early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. CLUB CHAMP lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. TIGER'S SONG disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. ROLL OUT was void of early
speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PREMIER LEAGUE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into
the stretch and did not offer a bid. THE KOHEN was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SHINNY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the lane and drew off with little need of
urging. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM pressed the pace while racing three-wide,, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin nearing
the quarter and yielded to the winner through the final sixteenth. WE'RE JUST SAYIN lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out
nearing the quarter and finished with a steady bid. PASSED BY PAUL sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going
three-quarters. LITTLE JOHN lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. NORTHERN QUEST was void of early foot,
raced off the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. PURELY POLITICAL showed brief speed and weakened.
