Footnotes
NORTHERN SPY set a pressured pace while two wide, then was headed by the quarter pole, was sent down and shook clear by the furlong marker, then
held sway late to prove best under a drive. RISEN SAVIOR was bumped at the start, then was rated between rivals, then was in traffic nearing the three
sixteenths pole, angled in for racing room and closed well on the inside. DEEP FAITH pressed the early pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the
turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, but hung in the drive. AMIGOS GUITAR stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but
flattened out. WISH FOR PEACE chased the early pace and came four wide into the drive and had no kick. FULL OF MISCHIEF was well placed on the
inside and came up empty in the drive. NEGLIGENCE was allowed to settle early, swung out five wide for the drive and had no rally.

Footnotes
GALLINIPPER broke outwardly at the start, then was rated along three to four wide, made a four to five wide bid leaving the turn, then slowly got up late to
prevail under a drive. ASHRAQ vied for the lead three wide, made a bid leaving the turn but was outfinished. ROYAL'S INVASION vied for the lead on the
inside and gave way grudgingly. MASTERFUL TOUCH was rated along between rivals, then encountered some traffic in the drive, finished willingly but
needed more. EYES OF ZEUS was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally. KINZEA STONE was well placed on the inside
and tired. The jockey on MASTERFUL TOUCH claimed foul against the rider of ASHRAQ for alleged interference in the stretch, after the stewards reviewed
the replays the race was left as is.

nearing the furlong marker and finished well, second best. BOYS OF QUEENS was settled back early, advanced four to five wide on the turn, came six wide
into the drive and was up for the show award. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally to just miss

KILIMANJARA set the early pace while racing in the three path, then shook clear by the quarter pole and widened the margin by the furlong marker, raced a
bid greenly in the furlong grounds then remained clear to prove best. CHARM ALARM stalked the early pace after breaking not so sharp, then went up to
press the winner on the inside leaving the three eighths, then fell back on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second

PUBILIUS SYRUS was reserved early on the inside, then circled the field five wide leaving the quarter pole, hit the front leaving the furlong marker and
edged away in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. SOUPER CATCH set the early pace and was well handled, was headed by the furlong marker
and could not match strides with the winner in the final furlong while saving the place award. COPPERHEAD CREEK checked into the first turn, then settled
on the backstretch, came four wide into the drive and finished with late interest to gain the show award. P JS SILVER DUKE was well placed on the inside,
made a inside move entering the drive but flattened out late. YES SIR COLONEL stalked the pace three wide and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
CUCKOO FORCONONUTS chased the early pace and made a inside bid in the stretch, drew off in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. MORGANS
MELODY stalked the early pace four wide, proved to be no match for the winner while getting up for the place award. CHECOTAH set the pace while racing
off the rail, faded the final furlong while staying on for the show award. CHIT CHAT GIRL was settled back early, came nine wide into the drive and had a
belated rally. KNOCK OUT KID was allowed to settle early while five wide, came six wide into the drive and had no rally. TIZ PROMISING RVF failed to
menace. HEADED FOR HEAVEN was not a threat. FIRST LADY MAGGIE chased the early pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened.
