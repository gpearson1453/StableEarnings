Footnotes
CANTRELL HILL got bumped at the start by DREAM BIGGER who broke inwards and in turn bumped the hindquarters of GRAN CASIQUE knocking that
rival askew, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
tipped out to swing seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then inched away to
the finish before being pulled up after the finish in the gallop out and was subsequently vanned off. GRAN CASIQUE bumped in the hindquarters at the start
by CANTRELL HILL due to pressure from DREAM BIGGER, vied loosely between foes from the three path among a quartet down the backstretch and
through the turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide into upper stretch, dueled with SUMMER BOURBON to the eighth pole
taking command narrowly inside that station, got collared a sixteenth from home and ran on to safely secure the place honors. SUMMER BOURBON vied
inside a quartet down the backstretch and through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front
just inside the eighth pole and kept on to preserve the show honors. DREAM BIGGER broke in at the start bumping CANTRELL HILL into GRAN CASIQUE,
vied four wide outside a trio coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off near the quarter pole and went five wide for home, then weakened in
the late stages. BINKSTER four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered
up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late going. JERSEY JOE B vied between foes from the two path among a quarter latched on to one another
down the backstretch and through the turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
RALLY SQUIRREL went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, drew off under a
solid hand ride into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead into the final sixteenth then was given one reminder with a right-handed crop and
proved much the best under steady urging. BLESS BLESS bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, moved off the rail under urging on the final
turn, shifted three wide late on that bend and finished willingly for the place. ARROWHEART settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, shifted three
wide at the quarter-pole, altered out from behind horses in upper stretch, shifted further out nearing the furlong marker and improved to just miss the place
while able to get the show. BOHEMIAN RUBY was last to commence then quickly angled in, was reserved at the back while saving ground, raced inside
under urging on the far turn and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. BEAU BROWN bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the opening
bend in the two path, tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, had the rider stand up some in the saddle and take a peek to the outside with about five
furlongs to run, chased in the two path on the far turn and weakened. SEANAN was hustled from the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then carried out outside the furlong marker
and lacked the needed response. BRENNAN'S WAR went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far
turn and came up empty. GHOSTMON went three to four wide on the first turn, bumped with foes on both sides late on that bend, settled on the outside,
went two to three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out nearing the furlong marker and failed to rally. WICKED KARMA went four
wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, went three wide under urging on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated.
ALITE went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten. LUCKY BRODY went two to three wide around the opening bend, bumped with a rival late
on that turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. TUESDAY'S CHILD went four to five wide on the first turn,
bumped with a foe late on that bend, settled towards the back on the outside, went three then four wide on the far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
ROSEY'S PEACH just off the duel perched three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong, got bumped seventy yards from home as BASTET came outwards and was up in the last jumps
to prevail. BASTET coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of BABA from the get go, knocked heads through the turn, spun three wide for home, inched away
straightened away under a drive, drifted out inside the eighth pole despite a right handed crop albeit with left rein encouragement and forced BABA to
steady and alter inwards from a seam loosely between foes near the sixteenth marker before bumping ROSEY'S PEACH and was caught in the last strides
to the finish. BABA coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with BASTET to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
for home, got shaken off a bit straightened away, dug in under a drive right off the hind end of the top pair but unable to latch on with a seam directly in front,
had BASTET come outwards inside the eighth pole and steadied and altered in a sixteenth from home when weakening in the very late stages.
MAGNETIQUE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for home and weakened in the late going. TIZ
HER WAY chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. TAPPANZEE away to an awkward
start, chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run
as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of BABA alleging interference against BASTET in the stretch. After review, the result was allowed the stand prior
to the race being declared official.

wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under a
drive under threat to the inside and held gamely to prevail. IMMORTALIZATION dueled five then four paths off the inside with MISTER J T to his inside,
tucked three wide briefly before taking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide straightened
away into upper stretch, dug in between foes before knocking heads through the final sixteenth with the aforementioned rival and was denied at the end.
MISTER J T dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in clinging to the lead until headed at the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages and just held
on to preserve the show honors. ROMANTIC MAN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to just miss for the show honors. RAISING SAND coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
six wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot while unable to make headway to the finish. BLAME IT ON BRUTUS coaxed from the gate, chased three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide for home and weakened. NAPOLEON COMPLEX coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. WILL TAKE CONTROL broke out at the start bumping
RICKYS REVENGE and forced himself to steady conceding four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,

Footnotes
CHANCEUX was hustled to the lead, showed the way under some pressure to the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, shook clear in the three path under a hand ride into upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead when given a pop of a right-handed crop at
the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. CARPE'S DREAM tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the
three path on the turn, was carried four wide into the stretch then lost touch with the winner, pursued that foe to the wire and finished with good courage to
hold the place. URBAN FOREST came outward at the start then bumped with a foe, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. EMPIRE RIDGE broke in and hit the gate hard, was well placed
just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue with five-sixteenths to run, chased into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. PIPITO
broke out then was bumped in the hindquarters, settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, moved out in
upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. SNOW CANDY was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths,
settled on the outside under some coaxing, came under stronger encouragement in the three to four path on the turn and failed to rally. KOBE'S LEGACY
moved up then was rated just off the pace under a tight hold while tugging hard at the bit, was let out two to three wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch
and came up empty. KISSES FOR DELCITA was reluctant to load, broke slow then ducked in while spotting the front many lengths, ducked in sharply early
and had the rider do an impressive job to stay in the irons, dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn and trailed. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
AWILLAWAY lunged slightly at the break and was away last, raced nine paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn
coming under coaxing near the three-eighths and advanced tipping three then four wide while making ground before going six wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive closing steadily outside and was up in the final jumps to score. BREAKFASTATBONNIES coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand
from the four path under pressure from RUVIES IN TIME to the outside, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
spun three wide for home, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. HONEY
MONEY coaxed from the start, chased three wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick. HAPPY SOPHIA four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. RUVIES IN TIME hustled from the gate,
pressed the leader from the outside five to six wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BIG Q seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BEAUTIFUL KAREN eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, went
four to five wide through the turn under a ride from three furlongs out, swung seven wide at the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HAPPY MEDIUM broke out and brushed the outside of the gate, moved up to press the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the
three path on the turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch, drew away under a drive into the final
sixteenth then was eased up in the final forty yards while much the best. RISK PROFILE moved out while urged along off the pace, chased in the four path
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and earned the place while no match for the winner. AMERICAN MONARCH was well placed just off the
pace, chased inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, pursued the winner into upper stretch, moved out some into the final furlong and
weakened but was clear for the show. FIRST HOMESTEAD broke very fast, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost
the lead approaching the quarter-pole and tired. CREA'S BKLYN LAW angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
REJECTED AGAIN settled off the early pace then came under urging before the half-mile pole, raced in the two path early on the turn then shifted four wide,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ALICIA'S WAY was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, rallied under the crop into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid near the
furlong marker, disposed of ENDLESS CRUSADE into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. BEAUTIFUL BANKS was urged along near the back
on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy for the place. ENDLESS CRUSADE
broke out and bumped with a foe, set the pace under pressure to her outside, shook clear in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then
came under the crop in upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken while just able to save the show. HALF BIRTHDAY chased the pace on the
outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the leader while still on her inside lead to the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point and
just missed the show. MISS EMPIRE STATE broke a step slow, was ridden along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
UNBRIDLED'S REIGN was ridden along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. KEEN
DANCER broke a bit slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the stretch and showed little. TAP THE HEART
was bumped at the start then forced into another opponent, chased the pace, raced inside on the turn and tired. LOST ANCHOR bumped with a foe at the
start, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn and capitulated.
