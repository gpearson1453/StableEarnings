Footnotes
BETCHA BY GOLLY showed good early speed from the outside to set the early pace, raced near the rail and held well through the stretch run to be clear
under steady handling. HOT CHOICE stalked the early going from the inside, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire.
MAGICAL CHARM tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. PASS IT ON was allowed to
settle to the middle of the pack early on, moved up two to three wide in the lane and made a late gain. HAPPYLIFE was unhurried in the early stages, raced
four deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. LOVE MY CAT was off a step slow, settled towards the back of the pack early on,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. LA LIMONADA was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced two to three wide around
the far turn through the upper lane and had not enough in the drive. ENTHRONED was squeezed back at the break, raced four wide into the upper lane and
had no response. ALONG THE WAY stalked the top pair and faded while racing near the inside. SMART ENTRY was steadied early, raced near the back
early, saved ground and never threatened.

RUN ON THE TRAIL was sent along to set the early pace and held well through the stretch run to be clear under strong handling. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY
stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out five wide through the upper lane and got up for the place
position. RIDICULOUS was slow early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. PRINCE OF PORTLAND raced four wide
around the first turn, was up close down the backstretch and weakened a bit in the drive. ALL FOR LOVE stalked the pace from the outside, raced along the
inside near the quarter pole and had no late rally. BETTHEOVER settled to the middle of the pack early, raced towards the inside and had no response.
CAIRO BOOGIE dropped back in the early stages, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. OVER AND THUNDER stumbled at
the break, was coaxed along while racing four deep near the quarter pole and tired.

with the winner in the drive to finish second best. VIRGINIA FULLA was slow early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch but had not enough for the top
pair. DONTFORGETTOBLINK stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late response. MAJESTIC FRONTIER was off a
step slow, angled four wide and had no late rally. I'M NOT SLOW broke to the outside, was hustled along early and tired. UNIQUE TIME was head strong
early, showed good speed and faded. AMICALOLA FALLS was squeezed and bumped at the break, settled to back of the pack and never threatened.

MONYINTHEBANKSEY was bumped at the break, took command through the far turn, dug in inside the eighth pole, drifted a bit late and prevailed under all
out pressure. STRIKING IT LUCKY bore out break, took off the early duel, moved up gamely in the final stages but couldn't get by the winner late. Jockey of
Striking It Lucky claimed interference against the winner near the sixteenth pole and stewards ruled no change. ROCKIN RON settled off the early duel,
angled four to five wide near the three sixteenths pole and slowly closed in on the top pair. AMAZING CAT stalked the pace, raced near the inside and had
no final winning bid. EL EQUALIZER dueled for the early lead while racing between and tired. ARTILLERY raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no
late rally. COSA MAS LINDA raced four wide around the first turn, dueled while racing three wide and tired. STAND MY GROUND dropped back early, was
fanned seven wide into the upper lane and never was a serious threat.

AXXERATOR stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn and finished well to get up under strong handling. UNCLE GARY G
showed good early speed to set the early pace and couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to finish second best. AUCTION KINGDOM stalked
the early pace, raced along the inside nearing the quarter pole and had not enough for the top pair. NO MONEY DOWN was forwardly placed to lay up
close early on, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. DR RAGS was coaxed while racing two wide and tired in the drive.
BISCOTTO D'ORO was slow early on and failed to respond. SEA KETCH stumbled at the break and never threatened.
