AMERICAN NIGHTMARE challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and proved the best late. WHEREVER
HE IS vied for the early advantage, saved ground, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. MY BOY SAM unhurried
in the beginning, saved ground around the second turn, gained ground, but proved no match for the top two. WILTON raced near the back in the early part,
moved up, within contention and hung down the home stretch. HILLBILLY dueled on the front end and was finished early. SAUL GOOD MAN broke out,
raced near the back and was never close.

Footnotes
FOREVAMO vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the stretch and was kept to the task. FAMILIAR RHYTHM void of early
speed, moved up, four wide around the second turn, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. EPIC (ARG) dueled for the early
lead, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. WITCH DOCTOR raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. ONE
KING CAT raced in the middle of the pack, was never a factor, while racing evenly. GOBLER lacked early speed and was never close. MR. UNUSUAL
always raced near the back and showed little. WAR VETERAN vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CHEERS TO BERTI
dueled on the front end, dropped back, was eased to the wire and walked off.

VISIONOFWILDTIMES pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage at the head of the home stretch, pulled away and finished well.
OAK HILL SENIORITA was an early factor, racing outside around the first turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for place. CITIZENS REWARD
unhurried in the beginning, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. HERE COMES LOVIE raced within contention, eased back, made a mild bid,
but was no factor. AKIANE'S SOLDIER void of early speed, saved ground around the second turn, moved up, but was no factor. LOCO POCO went to the
front, drove clear and faded. FUHR MEO void of early speed, raced five wide around the final turn, finished wide and was outrun. STERLING MEMORY
always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
MALARTACH lacked early speed, moved up, racing wide around the final turn, made an outside bid and was just up. CYBER SNEAKER pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, made a late rail bid and missed. COLD HEARTED WENCH raced within contention, eased back, came again, proved no match
for the top two, but got up for show. EBONY BAY raced evenly in the middle of the pack, made a late bid and missed third. DAIGLE dueled on the front end,
took command and weakened. ECLECTIC SOUL challenged for the early advantage and faded. TWO WITH A TEN void of early speed, saved ground
around the final turn and was never a threat. DARK SARCASM raced in the middle of the field, finished wide and faded. ALL IN BRONSON always raced
near the back and showed little. BIRDCATMOUSE lacked early speed and was never a factor.

MEDITATE unhurried in the beginning, raced outside around the first turn, moved up, took the advantage and pulled away down the home stretch. TENSAS

raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn and was outfinished for second. DONNA'S COURT went to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and weakened. MY CALL lacked early speed, improved position, finished wide and was no factor. PURIM KING raced in the back of the pack, saved
ground around the final turn and passed tired ones. NOW YOU RULES raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and faded. THAT'S
D 'CAT pressed the early pace, raced three wide around the second turn and retreated. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE showed early speed, was finished early

TRACK SMART vied for the early lead, drove clear around the turn, while racing on the rail and won under steady urging. STEPH'S SPIRIT raced near the
back in the beginning, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. BRAVE CITY GIRL pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn and got caught for second. PAISLEY CROSS lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. MY KIKI raced within striking
distance, eased back and finished evenly. MY LOVELY CHARLIE lacked early speed, raced wide around the turn, moved up, but was no factor. SLIDE void
of early speed, finished wide and passed tired ones. HARRIET'S DREAM dueled on the front end and dropped back. RACIN PRAYER challenged for the
early lead and dropped back. NOON'S BABYGIRL raced near the middle of the field, faded and was outrun.

Footnotes
POWERSHOT bumped at the break, raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, angled in down the stretch, dueled with GREY
ROGUE and prevailed for the win. GREY ROGUE raced within striking distance, made a late rail bid and was outfinished. FELLER raced within contention,
finished wide and was outfinished for second. HE HAD A SECRET bumped at the start, raced near the back in the beginning, showed late interest, finished
wide and was no factor. DESIARD went to the front, drove clear and weakened. HOT APRIORITY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat.
FLASH ME BACK void of early speed and was never a threat. LAST APPEAL pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. TEXAS CROSSBOW
always raced near the back and was outrun. ROCKIN ROG showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.
