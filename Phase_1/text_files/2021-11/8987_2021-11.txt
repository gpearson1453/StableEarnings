Footnotes
MENDING stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch and drew away while kept to her business. WHO KNOWS
WHAT hugged the inner rail down the backstretch and around the turn, drifted out approaching the eighth pole and passed tired ones. LA FAMILIA sped to
the early lead, angled in mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the inner rail and gradually weakened in the drive. CLOSERTOTHEHEART
lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and passed tried ones. SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS circled rivals on the turn, was four deep
approaching the stretch and failed to rally. CASTILLEJA , four deep leaving the backstretch, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. TAPDANCING
GIRL raced inside horses around the turn and weakened. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL trailed.

Footnotes
BALTIMORE BUD sped clear early and dictated the pace, moved away mid turn, came two wide into the stretch and dug in under a drive. ALBERTANO , in
close at the break, moved up four wide into the lane, drifted in towards the rail advancing past mid stretch, came out a bit late and finished gamely. HAIR OF
THE DOG broke towards the front despite a bobble, tracked four wide past the half mile marker, chased three wide outside a rival nearing the lane and kept
on willingly. DON CICCIO , off the pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled four wide in upper stretch and came on late. LET US MAKE GOLD ,
well back early, circled five wide into the lane and closed steadily. DIVINE PROPORTION stalked the pace two wide, was under pressure between foes
leaving the three eighths and weakened. R TAP , bumped at the break and off slowly, rushed up soon after, stalked towards the rail, chased to the inside of
a rival mid turn and gave way near mid stretch. GOLD FELLOW bobbled at the break, lagged far back, angled out in upper stretch and failed to menace.
CREATIVE STORM , four wide, gave way. FULGURANT , between foes early, faded. GAMBLING MAN lost ground four wide and was not a factor. LOOKIN
FOR JUSTICE came out at the break and bumped a foe, saved ground and weakened.

Footnotes
WICKED JANE edged up between rivals nearing the half mile marker, dropped in and advanced towards the rail around the turn, came back out in upper
stretch, reeled in the leader leaving the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. FUDGE CAKE stalked the pace off the inside, came four wide into the
lane, pursued between rivals past the sixteenth pole and kept on willingly to save the place. MY WAY OR ELSE , off the pace and two wide nearing the
quarter pole, swung out to about the five path in upper stretch and closed steadily. NETTI GIRL sped to the front, handled inside pressure into the turn,
moved back clear past the five sixteenths, failed to contain the winner leaving the eighth pole and faded. LOVE IS STRONG , soundly bumped at the break,
settled off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, shifted out some and had a late kick. WIN THEN GRIN came out some at the break and caused some
bumping, steadied inside early on, eased out and had belated action. SUPREME BLESSING bid outside the leader nearing the half mile pole, pressed to
the quarter pole then weakened near mid stretch. M. J.'S LADY , off the pace, angled very wide in upper stretch and was not a factor. CAPTIVATING GAL ,
three to six wide, was not a threat. CORAL SUMMER gave early chase inside and weakened. ELLIE BE DANCING was jostled and steadied at the break.

Footnotes
GETOFFMYBACK worked between horses around the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. HARD
FOUGHT hugged the inner rail around the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and rallied between horses. MR. PETE , steadied leaving the
backstretch, worked between horses leaving the turn, moved up to mid stretch and flattened out. FEDERALE bore in leaving the starting gate, sped to the
early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened. AMEN CORNER lacked speed, swung outside in upper stretch and passed tired foes. BAHAMA
CHANNEL , swung very wide leaving the turn, failed to menace. CHRISATUDE , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a factor.
INTERESTING LEGACY chased the pace and gave way. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) prompted the pace outside FEDERALE and weakened. YABBA
DABBA DUDE , wide on the turn, gave way. MICE AND MEN was taken up in tight quarters soon after the break. An objection by the rider of HARD
FOUGHT against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch drive was not allowed.

Footnotes
PICKIN' TIME tracked the leaders three wide under a light hold, was put to some coaxing and edged closer past the three eighths, responded to right
handed stick work and went on the attack four wide outside THREE TWO ZONE entering the lane, wrested command past the three sixteenths, kicked clear
then held sway under a solid drive. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER was steadied along in the three path from the five eighths to about the half mile marker,
chased between foes past the three eighths, angled in a bit and worked through a seam towards the inside heading into the stretch, shifted out for a clear
run in the final furlong and finished strong to gain. THREE TWO ZONE was hustled up to a brief early lead then was headed from his inside, prompted the
issue before going to command around the far turn, handled pressure from both sides leaving the three eighths, gave in to the winner leaving the three
sixteenths, stayed willing to the sixteenth marker then faded. AWESOME GERRY was hustled up after breaking a step slow and took command leaving the
three quarter pole, took pressure into the turn, stayed on after being headed and attended the pace to the quarter pole, gave chase past mid stretch and
finished with effort. EVERETT'S SONG bobbled at the break, regrouped and moved to within range while saving ground past the five eighths, was under
asking past the three eighths, steadied briefly nearing the quarter pole but came up empty. RIDIN WITH BIDEN bobbled at the break, raced between
runners early on, dropped back mid turn and failed to make a significant comeback. PLAMEN , four wide outside rivals, dropped in a bit and pursued three
wide in the clear mid turn, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and faded. DEPOSITORY , four wide, edged up some leaving the far turn turn, lacked a
response past the five sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
BELLE OF THE NORTH lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses
and took the lead approaching the finish. FRAUDULENT CHARGE stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, took the lead turning
for home, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. STREET LUTE saved ground around the turn, was taken to the three path in upper
stretch then had a slight rally between foes. JUROR NUMBER FOUR , unhurried down the backstretch, moved up four deep on the turn, was well
positioned entering the stretch and weakened the final furlong. HAPPY CONSTITUTION , carried out by MALIBU BEAUTY leaving the starting gate, lacked
speed and passed tired horses. MALIBU BEAUTY bore out leaving the starting gate bumping HAPPY CONSTITUTION, raced in the two path on the turn
and failed to rally. PRODIGY DOLL hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and tired. BE SNEAKY bobbled slightly at the break, chased the
pace and gave way.

Footnotes
CORDMAKER settled in a forward position three wide, took closer order as a duel developed past the three eighths, responded to firm encouragement and
moved up four wide to engage the leaders entering the lane, took control heading to the furlong grounds, edged away under a stout drive then was geared
down in the final jumps. WORKIN ON A DREAM quickly went clear, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted heading to the half mile marker,
sparred with SHACKQUEENKING from the three eighths to the three sixteenths, failed to contain the winner but stayed on gamely and was clear for the
place. SHACKQUEENKING prompted the pace two wide under rating, moved alongside WORKIN ON A DREAM entering the far turn, sparred past the
three sixteenths then faded late. FOREWARNED lacked speed, picked up some momentum off the rail leaving the three eighths, advanced between foes
near the quarter pole, eased out and churned on with some interest. INFORMATIVE came out entering the first turn and bumped with MCELMORE
AVENUE, saved some ground past the three quarter pole, eased out and edged up between runners around the final turn, chased into the stretch but came
up empty. TAPPIN CAT , taken to rate while saving ground, moved up some past the five eighths but failed to seriously kick on when put to asking leaving
the three furlong pole. MISCHIEF AFOOT broke a step slow, lagged back, swung out in upper stretch and had belated interest. TREASURE TROVE saved
ground early and failed to menace. BUSTOFF , in range early while off the rail, came under a ride leaving the far turn, lacked a kick and dropped back.
MCELMORE AVENUE , soundly bumped entering the first turn, came under pressure nearing the half mile marker but failed to respond.

Footnotes
NATTY BEAU , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside DISTANT THUNDER in mid stretch then drew off. DISTANT THUNDER
sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the advantage in mid stretch and held the place. GATOR FIFTY TWO saved ground around the
turn, was taken to the three path in upper stretch and flattened out. NEW YORK ONE , steadied in close quarters entering the turn, raced inside horses in
the stretch and passed tired foes. MY CANDY BIZ lacked speed, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally. JOSEF IS REAL , checked
approaching the turn, was four wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally. DEJOHN chased the pace, hugged the inner rail leaving the turn and gave wayq.
LITTLE BAY , wide on the turn, was outrun. ISABELLA'S MAGIC , inside horses down the backstretch, was done approaching the turn.
