EASY ON THE SUGAR was hustled along with the lead the opening furlong then pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole, recovered the edge
past the five sixteenths, drew clear two deep midway on the turn and held well under steady handling. MIDNIGHT FLING gave chase then angled to the
outside leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the six path, closed steadily to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and briefly occupied second mid-stretch, but relented that position in
later yards. DIGGIN FOR DOUGH chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly through the lane. CHESAPEAKE STORM bobbled outward to
make contact with DEW DAT leaving the gate then angled to the outside to give chase, ran in the five path of the turn and raced evenly in the lane. The
latter bobbled inward to make contact with the former leaving the gate then angled in and took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the five
sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and gave way the final furlong.

take third the final yards. OUT OF ROMANCE settled off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn then flattened the final furlong. TAPTAP broke awkwardly then saved ground, picked up the chase toward the seven sixeenths pole, though, faded in
the three path of the far turn. MAGNOLIA MADAME was shuffled back at the break then rated off the pace inside on the opening turn, gave chase leaving

WAIST DEEP stalked two deep then took aim at the three eighths pole, moved to the lead toward the five sixteenths and pulled himself clear approaching
the quarter, widened at the rail on the far turn and finished under his own initiative. HAPPY CHARLIE exchanged contact with Roof Top Bar leaving the
gate, was bumped outward and into ELVIRUS then checked shortly afterward, bid nearing the three eighths pole, closed for second two deep nearing the
head of the lane but had to settle for second best. The latter was bumped early then angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the
three eighths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths and relented second at the rail nearing the head of the lane. ROOF TOP BAR exchanged contact
with Happy Charlie leaving the gate and settled back toward the inside the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little further. DASHING CIRCLES raced in the three path the first turn and settled off
the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. NATIVE COURAGE rated off
the pace inside the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. RUN RABBIT rounded the opening turn about the four path, entered the
backstretch outside and showed little response.

MAKE IT A DOUBLE chased inside then took the lead in the three path nearing the top of the lane, drew clear inside the eighth pole and was kept alert.
SASSY BABE set a pressured early pace, was met at the three eighths pole and contested the edge off the rail on the turn, gave up the lead nearing the
eighth pole and dropped back past the pole, but dug in through the lane to hold second. THAT KENNEY KID pressured the pace and dueled at even terms
leaving the three eighths pole, gave up a head advantage into the turn, dropped back at the rail midway through the turn but angled to the three path
entering the stretch and was gaining late on the runner-up. LUNAR PRAYER chased inside leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was hemmed in off the rail
most of the turn, though, ran evenly in the lane. LOOKIN BACK was bumped off stride leaving the gate and gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the
five path and ran evenly through the lane. THISLILLIMEOFMINE was bumped outward and into Lookin Back leaving the gate then chased outside, rounded
the turn about the five path and finished evenly. FLYING SOFIA broke outward and was forced in early, picked up the chase toward mid track then flattened
off the rail on the turn. MISS GRANDSTANDER broke through the gate prior the start, was forced outward and into Thislillimeofmine then gave chase, raced
off the rail into the turn, angled to the seven path toward the head of the lane and showed little further. BETTER BOAT saved ground. LETTS GO TO
DIXIES broke through the gate prior the start, chased through the backstretch then weakened at the rail on the turn and steadied into the lane.
