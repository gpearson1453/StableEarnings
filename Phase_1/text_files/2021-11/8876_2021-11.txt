Footnotes
I'LL FINISH broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear, was never challenged, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. MISCHIEVOUS GUY
bumped at the start, was well placed inside, angled out through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and held the place. HEY HOMBRE well placed
and outside, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had a mild gain. INNER WAVE broke in, bumping at the start, saved
ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path and improved position. FISHING FOR FUN hopped at the start, exchanged bumps and
steadied down the backstretch, lost some ground through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and ran evenly. HECTOR B broke sharply from the gate
and was well placed inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, then drifted in in the stretch and weakened. COMMANDING showed little.
UNIFIED CONQUEST broke slowly from the gate, angled in and was no factor. AWESOME ED hard to rate, veered out, bumping FISHING FOR FUN down
the backstretch, angled in and faded inside through the turn.

Footnotes
LEVIOSA well placed and outside, gained a striking position through the turn on the two path, bid outside the leader, gaining a short lead into the stretch,
then drew off inside the furlong marker and was kept to the task. R GIRL'S WERTH IT set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the
turn, then could not threaten the winner in the lane, while clearly best of the rest. AWESOME APEAL well placed and inside, held position on the two path
through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and flattened out. SCHOOL DANCE broke in, brushing the gate at the start, angled in and moved up
through the turn, then angled four wide into the stretch and weakened. ARETE'S CHALICE moved up quickly into the turn, lost some ground three wide
through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and weakened. ROUGH ENOUGH moved up into the turn, looped four wide through the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, drifted in and faded. NADINE'S GIRL was never involved.

CASTAGNO never far back, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in the
final yards. MO HAWK sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held the advantage unchallenged to the final yards, then was no match and held the place.
OUTSHINE well placed and off the rail, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and evened out. PAPA HONOR rated
out side, raced three wide pulling through the first turn, moved up four wide through the second turn, then ran evenly in the lane. MISTER LEONARDO rated
inside, held position through the second turn and faded into the stretch. THENORTHREMEMBERS broke a step slowly from the gate, was well placed
inside, angled to the two path through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS BUSINESS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge and was kept to the task. UNSOCIABLE broke sharply
from the gate and was well placed outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and evened out. SPANISH
NOBLE mid pack, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had a mild gain, holding the show. IT'S NOT
EASY drifted in after the start, bumped DR CHROME, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and missed
the show. WILLY THE SHOE stumbled at the start, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and weakened.
EMIGRANTEDESILLUSO broke out at the start and ran evenly. DR CHROME bumped and steadied after the start, improved position, inside. NEVER
SATISFIED mid pack and inside, faded through the turn. SIR SAMUEL was no factor.

Footnotes
QUINOA TIFAH set the pace on the inside, dueled through the lane, holding the advantage and prevailed at the finish. MUSIC CITY STAR stalked the pace
on the outside, bid outside of that one, dueled through the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. LORILOUPIES rated tracking, raced boxed through the
turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and closed for the show. STARSHIP NALA second flight and between, raced boxed through the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and weakened final furlong. MERSEYSIDE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded in
the stretch. BERNIE'S MISTRESS hit gate at the start, having the rider loose his iron, then passed a tiring rival in the stretch. COMPENSATE well placed,
dropped back four wide through the turn and faded in the stretch.

final strides. ETHOS set the pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then dueled with the winner late, gaining the place. SMILING
TEUFLES broke sharply from the gate to stalk the pace, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, gained a short lead three wide into the
stretch, shook clear, then weakened late and held show. CONVERTER well laced and off the rail, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and weakened. HIERRO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and missed a share. BOLDNESS well placed
and outside, angled in into the turn and faded. KHOZANDO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. LORD
