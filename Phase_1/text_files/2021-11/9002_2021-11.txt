Footnotes
VASTLY DEEP dueled for lead two wide on the backstretch, assumed command on the turn, entered stretch clear and drew off well. TOMASINO tracked
leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, bid two wide in the stretch and got up for second while never threatening the winner.
FANCY TERRACE chased dueling leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, in range of leader entering the stretch, failed to
match strides with clear winner and managed to save show after being overtaken at the sixteenth. BOUNTY HUNTER stalked pace along the rail on the
backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, launched bid along the rail and failed to improve, but kept on well. NATHANSMIMSY dueled along the
inside on the backstretch, attempted to hold the rail going into the turn and had to steady sharply, costing all momentum and dropped back to fifth, token
ride rest of the way after losing all chance after the trouble. CANNES saved ground throughout and failed to launch a threatening bid. STEWARDS
INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW IT WAS RULED THAT NATHANMIMSY CAUSED OWN TROUBLE ENTERING THE TURN AND THUS NO CHANGE WAS
MADE TO ORDER OF FINISH
