Footnotes
BARDOLINO chased the pace while three deep around the turn, secured command in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and held sway
under brisk urging. ARTISTIC REASON prompted the pace two wide between horses, dropped back a bit leaving the turn, moved over to the three path in
upper stretch and rallied outside the winner. FLANK SPEED sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and finished
willingly. POWER BACK saved ground on the turn, floated to the two path turning for home and lacked the needed late effort. MONSTER MASON , three
wide between horses on the turn, failed to be a factor. MAGICAL JAIME , along the inner rail throughout, failed to be a factor. GALLANT GEORGE , four
deep on the turn, was no factor. SUPER E trailed. PER RULING #22-003 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, BARDOLINO WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ARBUTUS came out a bit at the break and brushed with SIERRA LEONA, straightened and went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, dug in when
collared leaving the three eighths, dueled two wide into the lane, lost command soon after, kept on gamely under left handed encouragement and reclaimed
the lead inside the sixteenth pole then dug in tenaciously to narrowly prove best. FAIRY WISH , four wide to contention, dropped in a bit and prompted
outside the winner, moved to apply more pressure after six furlongs, dueled on a slim lead past the three sixteenths, lost the advantage inside the sixteenth
pole and hung late. CONGRESS HALL broke a step slow, quickly recovered and reached a tracking spot inside, had ample room to edge up in upper
stretch, altered out in mid stretch, gave hard pursuit but came up empty late. SIERRA LEONA , rank and brushed at the break, steadied soon after, was
taken wide and settled within range, lost ground four wide from the far turn, was under pressure into the lane but lacked a solid kick. POSTINO'S
CHAMPION stalked between runners, shifted in under asking in mid stretch but came up empty. LIFE IN FLASH dropped off the early pace, came three
wide for the drive but failed to respond.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GRANT set the pace near the rail down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, drifted out turning for home and was kept to her business in
the drive. POSITIVE POWER , always outside the winner, gamely chased that one around the oval. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL , three deep around the turn,
was well positioned entering the stretch then weakened. NOTION INTERRUPTUS hugged the inner rail around the turn while stalking the pace then
weakened in the drive. SHE'S ALL COURAGE drifted out and bumped SO WHO'S BACK leaving the starting gate then was outrun. MAYFIELD OF
DREAMS bumped SO WHO'S BACK when bearing in at the break, raced between horses down the backstretch, gave way in upper stretch and was eased.
SO WHO'S BACK , bumped both sides leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path on the turn while outrun.

Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST rated three wide outside rivals, responded when roused into the lane, moved to command nearing mid stretch and was edging away late
while under a drive. CORN OFF THE COB accelerated inside rivals soon after the break and took command, set the pace towards the inside and under
some coaxing, dug in when confronted soon into the lane, battled on past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. JOYFUL NOISE broke a
step slow, pulled her forward while inside, stalked under asking past the five sixteenths, shifted out near the three sixteenths and closed steadily. BOSSY
BRIDE , between rivals and under a hearty ride near the three eighths, angled out in mid stretch and offered a belated response. RAN CHAR pressed the
pace between rivals, failed to kick on while under asking into the lane and gave way. CAROLINA ICE , three to four wide outside rivals, was under a drive
mid turn and faded.

Footnotes
THREETHEHARDWAY hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, found ample room inside MANICOMIO to take command inside the three sixteenths pole
then drew clear. MANICOMIO , quickly clear, set the pace well off the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and twice switched his leads in the drive.
LUDICROUS MODE lacked speed, saved ground around the far turn, eased off the rail turning for home and had a mild rally between horses while racing
on his left lead. BAHAMA CHANNEL , five deep entering the first turn, raced six deep down the backstretch, circled horses on the far turn and showed a
mild, late move. FIND YOUR BOAZ raced along the inner rail around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. GOLAZO chased the
pace in the two path, raced along the inner rail through the stretch and weakened. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was always outrun. HAYNE'S FEVER , four wide
the first turn, gave way on the far turn and was eased late.

Footnotes
ROMINSKI , urged to the front, set a pressured pace towards the rail, emerged in a battle to the inside of ROYAL SPY leaving the five sixteenths, shook
clear of that one leaving the furlong grounds then held firm under a stout drive. ROYAL SPY leaned in and hit the gate, quickly recovered and edged up
three deep nearing the half mile marker, went after the winner mid turn, sparred to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in a sharp debut. HAND GESTURE
pressed the early pace two wide and between rivals into the turn, failed to keep pace with the leading pair past the five sixteenths, gave hard pursuit from
there and kept on with interest to the line. SCINTILLIO saved ground chasing the leaders, eased out in upper stretch and churned on willingly.
JASONTAKESLONG , off slowly after bobbling in behind, regrouped and saved ground, moved up under asking nearing the lane, eased out some in upper
stretch, drifted back in towards the rail and came up empty. HAMPDEN LANE veered out badly at the break, dropped off the early pace while wide, circled
four wide into the lane and had a mild kick. DR RAGS , off the pace, raced between rivals near the three eighths but lacked a rally. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE
gave early chase three wide and weakened. BLAMEITONTHEFUN was outrun.

Footnotes
BUSTOFF rated kindly two wide, bid to go after the leader into the far turn, poked a head in front past the five sixteenths, responded when roused entering
the lane, kicked away under a drive then held firm while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. GALERIO stalked three wide, came under pressure
leaving the three eighths, moved up to briefly threaten entering the stretch, could not match strides but held well to be second best. TORCH OF TRUTH ,
three wide and outside a rival early on, angled and ranged up four wide under pressure into the lane, chased then flattened out. CROUCHELLI broke a step
slow, steadied off heels early, settled towards the rail, swung out six wide in upper stretch and came on some late. MCCAIN rated two wide early on, edged
up past the five eighths, gave hard chase leaving the three eighths but came up empty. LORD WINSALOT sped clear early, set the pace toward the rail,
was joined into the far turn, fought on to the three sixteenths then gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FAST CASH lacked speed, checked in tight quarters near the three eighths pole, swung outside mid way on the turn, was four deep in upper stretch, closed
rapidly the final furlong and was up near the finish. NEW FRONTIER , two wide around the turn, chased the pace, gained a short lead outside BULL SHARK
near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. FIZBO , three wide around the turn, was well placed in upper stretch and flattened out. BULL SHARK
bobbled at the break, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened the final furlong. BAPTIZE THE BOY , near the inner rail
around the turn while stalking the pace, gave way in the drive. ROCKET BLAST , in the two path on the turn, failed to be a factor. MICE AND MEN ,
steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, raced along the inner rail on the turn and weakened. ACE NINE NINE trailed.
