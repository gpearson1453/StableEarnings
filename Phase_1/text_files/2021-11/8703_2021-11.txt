Footnotes
LONG DISTANCE LOVE stalked the pace while three deep around the turn, drifted in slightly when securing command in upper stretch and drew away
under urging. TORCH CARRIER prompted the pace outside SALAMINA finished gamely between horses and got a perfect bob to get the place.
CAPSTONE GIRL , near the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path turning for home and offered a mild gain outside foes. RAPIDAMENTE , two
wide around the turn, remained in the two path through the stretch and had a late rally between horses under mild hand urging. SALAMINA showed speed
along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. PASS IT ON hugged the inner rail around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and was not a factor.
SOME NIGHTS raced well off the inner rail around the turn and faltered.

JOVIS , hard sent to the front, dropped in and handled some pressure before going clear after a quarter mile, was guided off the inside and put to pressure
into the lane, drifted outward while widening past the three sixteenths, continued to drifted but held firm under repeated right handed encouragement. D'
RAPPER was rated between runners early, eased back off of rivals leaving the three eighths, moved up between runners into the stretch, swung out past
the three sixteenths, straightened away and made a bold run to bridge the gap. MONEY RIDE prompted the pace while saving ground, had aim under
asking in mid stretch but failed to kick on late. EASY DAY , under a firm hold outside foes early, moved up three wide around the turn, pursued the winner
into the lane then faded late. PEANUTS PERFECTION dropped in a couple paths early, forced the pace outside the winner, failed to keep up leaving the
five sixteenths and steadily gave way.

HE'S ORIENTATE broke a step slow, was sent up between foes soon after and took command, sprinted clear after a furlong, set the pace under some
coaxing and towards the inside, kept on under strong handling past the furlong grounds, wandered out a bit, dug in tenaciously and got the bob. GOING TO
THE LEAD dropped in early and was taken to rate, was guided out to about the five path in upper stretch, closed steadily under pressure, moved to near
even terms in the final jumps but lost the bob in a game effort. HE'S A SHOOTER was rated off the pace and off the inside, advanced four wide outside
rivals past the five sixteenths, took closer order with a run past mid stretch then lacked the needed finish. MAXIMUS MIDANI broke sluggishly, lagged off the
pace, saved some ground mid turn, worked outward in the drive but failed to generate a strong run. MACY'S BOY had speed and chased the winner in the
two path, raced inside inside rivals nearing the lane and faded. THE WOLFMAN broke awkwardly towards the inside, moved up three wide between runners
mid turn, pursued into the lane then gave way.

DAT DARES GOLD stalked between foes, bid to the inside of a drifting rival to take command nearing mid stretch, kicked clear and held firm under a drive.
COUGAR VISION chased inside, eased out for the drive, advanced between rivals in the final furlong and kept on willingly to gain the place late.
ELOQUENT LADY was sent up outside rivals to take to early lead, kicked clear and dropped in towards the rail, was attempting to get out around the turn,
wandered well wide soon into the lane, continued to drift and gave way grudgingly. MORTAL STORM forced the pace three wide outside the leader, was
under pressure into the lane but failed to kick on solidly in the last sixteenth. CLEM GEM , off the pace, circled six wide into the lane, angled out some late
and kept on with some interest. FAMILY FORTUNE , urged along off the pace, raced three wide into the, edged up a bit near mid stretch, eased out but
lacked the needed finish. SACRED LADY saved ground pursuing the pace and faded. STOP TALKING was angled out near the half mile pole, made a mild
mid move and gave way.

BENEATH THE STARS quickly sprinted clear after an alert break, angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was kept to her
business in the drive. LAOBAN'S LEGACY , two wide around the turn, chased the winner throughout in a game effort. DOTADA lacked speed, was in hand
waiting for room leaving the turn, raced in the two path turning for home and split horses near the sixteenth pole with a nice rally. SHE'S MO BETTER
hugged the inner rail around the turn, chased the winner and gave way in the drive. LANFRANKOPHILE lacked speed, saved ground around the turn,
remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. AMERICAN BOUND raced in mid pack between horses and came up empty in the drive.
CLICK TO CONFIRM bore out leaving the starting gate, was four wide on the turn and failed to be a factor. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , pinched back after
stumbling leaving the starting gate, raced between horses in the stretch and was no factor. I'M GITTIN THERE raced in the three path on the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
MR JEFFERSON , pinched back soon after the break, regrouped and edged up inside to rate forwardly, awaited room behind rivals nearing the lane, found
room past the three sixteenths, surged through along the rail under solid hand encouragement to take command inside the furlong grounds, kicked clear
and won with something left. BOLD LEADER stalked three wide between rivals, bid to challenge past the three eighths, forced the issue between runners
into the stretch, gained a short lead four wide outside horses in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. STREET HUSTLE prompted the pace outside MR.
MOX, was under asking leaving the far turn, battled on between runners from the five sixteenths to upper stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. MR.
MOX came out some at the break tightening the winner, moved clear early, set the pace towards the rail, met multiple bids past the three eighths, dueled
two wide into the lane allowing the winner a seam, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. THE MAN TO SEE , rank and steadied along early,
lost ground three to four wide, bid outside foes after six furlongs, forced the issue into the lane then gave way.
