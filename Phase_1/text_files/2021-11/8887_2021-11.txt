COOLCROSS stalked the pace from the two path along the turn, gained ground off of the turn, dug in through the stretch to catch ELUSIVE VIRTUE and
held over oncoming rivals in the final stages. FLICFLAC was unhurried through the early going while two wide on the turn, angled out for the drive and made
a good rally through the lane, just missing for the win while winning the nod for the place. BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) was a bit rank and pulled on the
jockey in the early stages, saved ground on the turn, closed well off of the turn and just missed for the place. ELUSIVE VIRTUE was away well and set the
fractions through the turn, had a clear lead into the stretch and was just caught by the winner inside of the final sixteenth, and outfinished for the minor
awards. GOLDENEYED tracked the pace while three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. I'M A COOL DUDE chased from the rear while
saving ground on the turn and lacked a final kick in the stretch drive.

clear in the end. SUNSET DRAGUNN tracked the pace from a three wide position on the turn, was outfinished in the stretch by the winner while holding for
second in a blanket finish. AWHITESPORTSCOAT pressed the pace from a two wide position on the turn, was outkicked by the winner while on the left lead
in the final furlong and just missed for the place. MY FRIEND TONY was away well and set the pace while being pressured, dueled in the final furlong with
AWHITESPORTSCOAT and was caught inside of the final sixteenth by the winner and just missed for third. ECOLOGIST chased the leaders from the rear

Footnotes
MISS SUPER SAINT attended to the pace through the second turn, closed the gap on TEN THE SMART WAY nearing the top of the lane, dueled with that
foe and wore her down in the final sixteenth and held in the final stages. TEN THE SMART WAY was hustled to clear the field leaving the break and set
moderate fractions through the second turn while being prompted by MISS SUPER SAINT, met the bid of that foe off of the second turn and dueled to inside
of the final sixteenth, reluctantly gave way and held for the place. STYLEDOME (IRE) sat off of the early pace, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn
and was outkicked in the stretch, just missing for second. BUYBACK took up while in tight quarters on the run into the first turn, settled in the second flight
through the backstretch, was boxed in along the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. REV REE settled at the rear of the field through the
second turn, saved ground throughout and closed willingly in the late stages. I'M A ROCKETTE was unhurried in the early stages, was two wide on the
second turn and lacked a late rally in the stretch. TAKE A LEAP had no speed in the early going, was three to four wide on the second turn and did not offer
a late bid in the stretch run. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) tracked the pace through the second turn while saving ground and faded in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI was away well and set the fractions through the second turn while being prompted, had a clear lead into the stretch but was heavily
pressured in the final sixteenth by CAPE POINT and held over that rival to prevail. CAPE POINT sat just off of the pace, saved ground throughout, closed
well leaving the second turn and pressured the winner in the final sixteenth but just missed for the win while holding for second. CHARMING VINTAGE
stalked the pace from the inside through the second turn, rallied leaving that turn and was gaining on the top pair in the final sixteenth but could not reel
them in. AMITY HARBOR settled near the rear of the field, improved position on the second turn while four wide and was outkicked in the stretch.
COLLUSION DELUSION was content to settle through the second turn, gained ground on the second turn while three wide but flattened out in the late
stages. PERSEVERANCE stalked the pace through the second turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch. LOOKIN FOR GOLD settled at the rear of the field
through the second turn, mounted a five wide bid on the second turn but did not rally in the stretch run. SEARCHING FOR GOLD stalked the pace from the
second flight, was two wide between foes on the second turn and gave way in the drive. AUTISM SAVANT prompted the fractions through the second turn
and faded in the stretch run.
