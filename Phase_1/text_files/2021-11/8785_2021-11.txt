FIVE STAR PHIL tracked the early pace and then ranged up three wide by the quarter pole, then made a bid in the stretch and got up late under right
handed crop urging to prove best. GIMME A JAMESON set a fast pace early while clear, then had a long drive in the stretch but could not hold off the
winner late while clearly second best. TOP HAT ARTIST was settled back early, came four wide into the drive and was not a threat while besting the rest.
HE CAME TRUE showed little. ZIPPER ZAPPER was away alertly and showed brief speed and stopped.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROMA set a pressured pace on the inside early, shook clear on the turn, then remained clear past the furlong marker, then held sway despite
being on the left lead the final furlong, driving. SPIN CYCLE stalked the early pace three wide, then was between rivals at the half mile marker, then was
sent down at the five sixteenths and was three wide by the quarter pole, continued to close in the furlong grounds but could not get to the winner in a game
effort. MAIN COOL CAT was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the turn and swung out four wide for the drive and failed to gain on the top two wide
besting the rest. CATTLE DRIVE chased the early pace and made a middle move on the inside and weakened. VISHNU prompted pace four wide and tired.
DETANGLER was four wide into the first turn then proved to be no factor. HEART OF A WARRIOR chased the early p[ace four wide and stopped and was
eased to the wire, walked off.

being ridden out. SPECIAL FREEDOM was settled early while five wide, then advanced four wide on the turn and proved to be no match for the winner
while clearly second best. TAK E LADY stalked the early pace three wide, then fell back on the turn, was in tight leaving the quarter pole and then was two
wide by the three sixteenths and bested the rest. RAINBOW TROUT chased the early pace four wide and then was three wide on the turn and faded.
PRIME COAT passed the tiring rivals. HAPPYWIFEHAPPYLIFE was allowed to settle while three wide and weakened. SAND IN MY SHOES tracked the
early pace on the inside and tired. MERRY MISCHIEF was through early. IVY was not a factor.

LEAKY CAULDRON was rated along the inside early, advanced leaving the five sixteenths, then shifted out four wide leaving the quarter pole, made a bid
on the outside in the drive and edged away late to prove best under strong handling. LITTLEBITALILY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on
the turn to vie for command at the quarter pole, then dueled for the lead past the furlong marker and could not go with the winner late while getting the nod
for the place award. ALWAYS TALKING set the early pace two wide, then was headed by the quarter pole, dug in gamely to the wire but lost the bob for the
place award. SPIRIT OR SPITE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and had no rally. GAMBIT'S GIRL stalked the early pace two wide
and weakened.

OUR WEST INDY set the early pace while racing off the rail, then drew clear on the turn, then was kept to pressure to maintain a safe margin to prove best.
SEEKING THE THRONE was steadied on the first turn on the inside, then advanced three wide on the turn, then finished willingly to be gaining late, second
best. JOY'S PRIDE was in tight and had to check into the first turn, then settled early, came four wide into the drive and offered a mild late rally.
ANGELSFOUR MICHELE came out into the first turn, then prompted the early pace and made a inside bid to press the pace by the half mile marker but
weakened. PRAYFORACURE was bumped on the first turn, then raced four wide and stopped, eased to wire, walked off. The jockey on JOY'S PRIDE
claimed foul against the rider of OUR WEST INDY for alleged interference into the first turn, after the stewards review the race was left as is.

the furlong marker, then was ridden out the final sixteenth to prove much the best. SILVER EXCESS stalked the winner three wide early, then was sent
down on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. GIZMO'S DESTINY was allowed to settle early, came four wide into
the drive and had a belated rally to gain the show award. LOLANITA was well placed along the inside and weakened. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER chased the
early pace two wide and then came four wide into the drive but came up empty. NEARLY MISSED was four wide on both turns and no threat. MAGALIE
tired. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT was five wide into the first turn and failed to respond.
