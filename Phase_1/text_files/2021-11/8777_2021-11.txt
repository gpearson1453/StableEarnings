Footnotes
MR. PAYCHECK vied for the early advantage, raced wide around the first turn, drove clear down the backside, pulled away down the home stretch and was
kept to the task. YANK CRIME dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner,
but was a clear second. HEATHER'S REQUEST void of early speed, raced wide around the first turn, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two.
SUGARLAND EXPRESS raced within striking distance and put forth an even effort. ROBTADI STORM lacked early speed, had a wide trip, made a mild bid,
but was no factor. LEYTON'S HIPPIE raced near the back in the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid and weakened down the stretch.
DOUBLE PRIORITY raced evenly near the back and showed little. PALACE WIND pressed the early pace and was finished early. BROOK IS GOLDEN

proved no match for the top two. R AND R STAR was an early factor, raced close throughout and was outfinished for show. MULETRAIN raced in the
middle of the field, had a wide trip and finished evenly. ARGYBARGY BUCK pressed the pace, faded and raced evenly late. TOO TUFF TO CRY void of
early speed, moved up, but was no factor. LIGHTNING HARBOUR had a tight start, raced in the back and was never close. PRIORITY POINTS lacked

on the outside and made a wide gain. THE BIG IRISHMAN void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. MY FORTUNATE SON raced in the
