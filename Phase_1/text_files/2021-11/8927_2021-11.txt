RIPINANDATEARIN lagged into the far turn angling out into upper stretch moving closer at mid track surging past four deep late to win clear. BLAME THE
KIDS tracked the pace moving evenly in the three path in upper stretch splitting horses late in the two path to get up for place. TINKER RING prompted the
pace dueling abreast rival into upper stretch angling out a bit to the three path late ceding in the final yards. HEYDON'S CASE away alertly worked the pace
racing inside of rival through the far turn then down the stretch digging deep on the rail to the end. WE WILL SHINE played no factor. THE PREZ was
always outrun. PEACE CONTROL was never involved.

WOODHAVEN KID pressed a short lead through the turn digging in to outside pressure down the lane ceding grudgingly at the end. EXCHANGE FEVER
chased the pace rallying to bid on the turn extending between horses down the lane coming up a bit short. TOWARDS THE LIGHT saved ground to upper
stretch outbidding the others in the two path. COWBOY RUSTY raced evenly lacking a contending move. BOW TIE AFFAIR played no factor. MUNTIJ
fractious in the gate pre start gave a dull effort. BI BI CARPE flashed early speed then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
LOW TIRE off slowly lagged on the turn emerging five wide in upper stretch surging up four deep to win clear. QUEEN OF CORONA slow early lagged to
upper stretch rallying between horses there vying willingly late. ART THIEF slow early was outrun through the turn responding inside the eighth pole to finish
well. THALIA'S SONG chased the turn bidding clear in upper stretch faltering late. SHIPMANS MAGIC raced evenly lacking late surge. BLONDE ATTITUDE
raced mid pack bidding in upper stretch leveling off late. SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS played no factor. LIGHT HEARTED hustled through the turn would tire in
upper stretch. FRECKLES KAN broke sharply setting a clear pace through the turn wilting abruptly in upper stretch. MY TIME TO SHINE chased through
the turn giving way rapidly in upper stretch.
