Footnotes
ROMANTIC ATTACK pressed the pace outside of DREAMING OF PARIS while racing in the four to five path around the first turn, vied outside that foe
down the backstretch while still well off the inside, vied in the six path on the far turn, began to edge past that foe near the three eighths, came in sharply
past the three eighths, raced two wide into the lane and maintained a clear advantage down the lane while under a drive. BALLYBRACK LASS tracked the
leading pair, continued in the tracking flight inside of SEVEN SEVENTEEN down the back straight, saved ground around the far turn, was put in tight and
steadied slightly near the five sixteenths as a result of ROMANTIC ATTACK coming in, was urged inside into the lane, chased on while no match for
ROMANTIC ATTACK, lost second position to WINDY CITY GIRL past the furlong mark but ran on willingly to regain it in the final sixteenth. WINDY CITY
GIRL chased inside of SEVEN SEVENTEEN early, chased just behind the tracking flight down the back straight, continued at the inside of the rear flight in
the two path into the far turn, tipped out near the five sixteenths, raced six wide into the lane, rallied under a drive in upper stretch, sustained her bid past
midstretch but leveled out in the final sixteenth. WATCHIN THE WHEELS settled at the rear, began to improve slightly past the half mile mark, chased at the
outside of the rear pair in the three path on the far turn, angled out near the five sixteenths, came four wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. SEVEN
SEVENTEEN chased two wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair outside of BALLYBRACK LASSS down the backstretch and while still
two wide on the far turn, was put in tight near the five sixteenths after ROMANTIC ATTACK came in, was driven three wide into the lane and emptied out.
DREAMING OF PARIS was keen to the lead, set the early pace in the three to four path on the first turn while pressured by ROMANTIC ATTACK, vied
inside of that foe while still well off the rail down the back straight and while racing in the five path on the far turn, was pushed in by ROMANTIC ATTACK
past the three eighths, floated five wide into the lane, and weakened. THE RIDERS OF BALLYBRACK LASS AND SEVEN SEVENTEEN CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF ROMANTIC ATTACK ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FAR TURN. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO
CHANGE.

Footnotes
TORN JEANS broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the rail racing into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and was kept to firm
right handed encouragement. LONG TALL WOMAN was urged prompting the pacesetter into the turn, couldn't match that foe and weakened through the
stretch while prevailing for the place honors. MIDNIGHT FROST tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing into the turn, conceded some position
while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch, then was forced to alter course to the three path in the closing stages while being outkicked for second.
PECOS AUTUMN broke readily, was eased off the pace to track just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out to the three path racing
into upper stretch and had no final kick. UNION PARK GAL (IRE), crowded at the start, settled last while angling inside rivals in the last flight racing into the
turn, saved ground into the lane and continued to improve position. AND ISLES tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn, shifted
out four wide in upper stretch and steadily faded. ELIZABETH'S GHOST broke outwards bumping UNION PARK GAL (IRE), was collected, then drifted out
racing into the turn carrying out TAP N TWINE and proved no threat thereafter. TAP N TWINE broke inwards bumping UNION PARK GAL (IRE), was
righted to track off the second flight four wide, was carried wide entering the turn and never menaced thereafter. BOSSY SNOW PEA tracked off the first
flight in the four path racing to the turn, drifted wide racing through the bend and gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
CLOSE TO ME settled well behind the leading trio, raced two wide with the rear flight past the five eighths, kept on well behind the leading trio in the three to
four path on the far turn, raced four wide into upper stretch, drifted slightly further out while beginning to rally, found her best in the final furlong and got up in
the final strides. BOWS N LACE tracked the leader inside of CHAINMAIL through the first turn, stalked the pace between horses down the back straight, bid
between horses near the three eighths, vied between from the five sixteenths, continued to vie for the lead two wide down the lane, led narrowly from the
sixteenth mark, but was caught in the final strides. CHAINMAIL tracked the leader outside of BOWS N LACE around the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading
pair while positioned three wide down the back straight, began to rally three wide from near the three eighths, vied in the leading flight from the five
sixteenths, was narrowly outkicked by BOWS N LACE and SATIATE into the lane, and chased on willingly to the finish. SATIATE soon cleared to the lead
and set a sensible pace, saved ground around the far turn, was engaged from the outside by BOWS N LACE and CHAINMAIL near the five sixteenths, vied
inside of them, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, was vigorously hand ridden after her rider lost the crop at the quarter pole, continued to vie
inside of BOWS N LACE to the sixteenth mark and flattened late. HERO ALEXANDRA was a bit awkward into stride, settled at the rear, began to edge
forward slightly to join inside of CLOSE TO ME past the five eighths, was outpaced from the seven sixteenths while racing in the two to three path, and had
no more in the lane.

Footnotes
RAPID TRANSIT was urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear entering the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the far
turn while maintaining a narrow advantage, turned back a challenge from SMACK leaving midstretch and grudgingly held EMBARRASSING nearing the
wire under firm handling. The latter angled to the rail in the opening stages while being rated behind the second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained
position inside foes racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside nearing upper stretch to race three wide into the lane and continued with a steady late
response to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire. SMACK tracked just off the leaders inside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped
outside the pacesetter to challenge that foe nearing upper stretch, pressed that rival to midstretch but flattened out late. NORTHERN ALLIANCE broke
inwards, was settled last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum shifting out racing through the far turn, split foes three
deep racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position to the end. SCARLETT LACE, forwardly placed three wide in the opening
stages, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders while shifting to the inside nearing the lane but
lacked the needed late response. WHITE LIES tracked the leaders between foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, lost some ground to the
leaders nearing the second bend, angled to the rail racing through the far turn and lacked a further response. LAUNCH AWAY settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance four wide racing into the far turn, was forced wide avoiding a fallen rival nearing upper stretch and
had no further response. ENGLISH, urged prompting the pace inside the eventual winner racing into the first turn, shifted off the inside while conceding
some position to the leader racing through the backstretch and gave way between foes racing into upper stretch. CITY FUN settled inside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn and quickly emptied out. GET N TIPSY tracked off the second flight three wide
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path entering the far turn, then fell after appearing to clip heels nearing upper stretch but walked
off the course following the race under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
LEAVING THE FAR TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
COUGER chased toward the rear six wide early, began to improve into the turn, rallied four wide around the bend, was driven five wide in upper stretch,
found his best in the final sixteenth and got up in the final jumps. COOKIN ROSES was sent for speed, saved ground while clear on the turn, floated out a
couple paths into upper stretch and was engaged by THAT'S ALL RIGHT to her inside, turned her back midstretch, kept on with interest but was nailed in
the final jumps. I LOVE TO RACE chased toward the rear inside of COUGER early, raced toward the rear of the main group two wide between horses on
the turn, drifted out markedly in upper stretch, found her best near the sixteenth pole and gained belatedly. THAT'S ALL RIGHT tracked the pace inside
early, continued to track the leader while saving ground around the turn, was driven for a bid inside of COOKIN ROSES in upper stretch, could not reel her
in, and flattened out in the final sixteenth. KHOZYS CROWN tracked the pace outside of THAT'S ALL RIGHT early, tracked well behind the leading pair
around the turn while racing two wide, came into the lane three wide, proved no match for the leading pair, and flattened out between horses in the final
furlong. PRINCESS CONSUELA settled at the rear, continued in second last in the three to four path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, and
passed tiring horses under a drive. TWO MORE TIMES settled near the rear early, trailed while saving ground on the turn, improved inside into the lane, but
lacked the needed late kick. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS chased just behind the tracking flight early, was urged inside around the turn, continued in range
inside to midstretch, and weakened in the final furlong. SOUTHERN ATTACK chased outside of LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS early, settled back behind that foe
into the turn, raced three wide around the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch and mustered no rally. TOUCH BY FELICTY chased outside of
SOUTHERN ATTACK early, settled back in tandem with that foe into the turn, bid three wide on the bend, came four wide into the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
SYMBOLIST, bumped at the start, was urged to the lead along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, met several rival's
challenges racing through the far turn, then kicked away leaving midstretch to prove best under hand urging. RENEGADE BOB was rated off the first flight
near the inside, then between foes racing through the backstretch, came around a tiring foe entering the second bend, angled to the inside racing through
the far turn, came through inside foes racing into upper stretch, then tipped out in the closing stages to edge rivals for the place honors. RULE FOLLOWER,
off a bit slowly, was settled along the inside to the backstretch, switched out nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, swung out five wide
nearing upper stretch and continued with interest in that path in the lane to gain position to the end while earning a share. Z U AT THE RACES joined the
pace three wide racing to the first turn, continued pulling against rating while shifting inwards prompting the pacesetter nearing the far turn, pressed the
issue into upper stretch but weakened in late stages. DRAW THE LINE settled off the second flight racing three wide to the backstretch, shifted out four
wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance but flattened out leaving midstretch. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, shuffled back avoiding tight
quarters at the start, settled outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught widest into the far turn, was fanned six wide nearing
upper stretch and lacked a closing response. MISTER CHARMING tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance three deep nearing the second bend, bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive.
YALIKEANYTHING, in touch with the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out after a half.

Footnotes
TIZ SUSAN ANN was placed on the lead, set the pace while clear in the two to three path on the turn, kept on in the lane and held sway under a mild drive.
MAYSTART tracked the pace three wide early, came slightly in near the seven sixteenths, tracked in the four path on the turn, came three wide into the
lane, chased on while proving no match for TIZ SUSAN ANN in upper stretch, kept on willingly, gained late but was ultimately held at bay. DANCIN AT
MIDNIGHT raced at the inside of the tracking line early, settled back to midpack past the five eighths, chased two wide on the turn while well behind the
leading pair, was pushed along between horses into the stretch, dropped to the inside past the quarter pole, bid inside of MAYSTART, but was ultimately
outfinished by that foe for the place. WAR COLORS raced two wide with the rear flight early, continued three deep in the rear group into the turn, was
pushed along and began to improve in the four to five path past the three eighths, turned five wide into upper stretch, and kept on mildly. SHE'S
WANDAFUL raced at the inside of the rear flight early, saved ground around the turn and into the lane, took up past the quarter when DANCIN AT
MIDNIGHT came in, altered out four wide, and ultimately lacked the needed kick. LOUIE P settled toward the rear, continued between horses in the rear
flight in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally under a drive. PALAGO tracked the pace between horses early,
tracked the pace into the turn inside of MAYSTART, took up abruptly near the seven sixteenths when MAYSTART came in, dropped sharply back in the
three path, and offered no response when driven in the lane.

Footnotes
SIRCORRI broke readily to gain a forward placing between foes, tracked just off the leaders inside a rival racing into the bend, shifted out nearing upper
stretch to advance four wide between foes in upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage from COLOMBARD in time under
firm handling. The latter tracked just off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing through the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with the leaders
three deep on the bend, went clear racing into upper stretch but just failed to contain the winner. COOL AMBITION, held up avoiding close quarters in the
opening stages, was prompted to advance between foes racing into the turn, shifted out six wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close
the gap on the top pair. PRESIDENT ELECT, reserved out of striking distance along the inside in early stages, responded when prompted to advance while
shifting a bit off the inside entering the turn, steadily gained position between foes, then angled inside the pacesetter in upper stretch to lodge a bid but was
outkicked in the closing stages. GIANT'S FORREST tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch
and flattened out in late stages. MR. LUV MAKER settled into stride between foes, then outside rivals while dropping well back in the opening half, was
fanned five wide racing into upper stretch and displayed some late interest while gaining position. ALLEGIANCE tracked off the second flight along the
inside in the opening quarter, saved ground through the bend, steadied off a stricken rival racing into upper stretch and had no further response.
RICHIESONARAMPAGE was rated off the second flight while angling inwards to race between foes into the turn but offered no rally. DANCIN NICKY was
outpaced early and proved no factor. PEACOCK MAN, urged pressing the pace outside a rival racing to the turn and gave way after a half. CADET
CAPTAIN, urged along the inside from the outset disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage after a half,
suffered an apparent catastrophic injury while his rider pulled up her mount abruptly in upper stretch, then was vanned off the course following the race.
