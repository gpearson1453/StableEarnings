Footnotes
MARKSMAN ON TARGET pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, assumed command in upper stretch, battled gamely
to the wire repelling bid from LUCKY LUPE to prevail. LUCKY LUPE tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn,
advanced through the turn to range up to the leaders into the stretch, loomed large in the stretch and ultimately repelled my game rival in deep stretch.
LILI'S BOY led quickly on the backstretch, continued to lead entering the turn and into the stretch, gamely stayed on and dueled in the lane until yielding late
to save show. CHARMING DANZA stalked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, entered stretch in the three
path, eased out into the four path to put in a belated rally. MAUI ROAD chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, swung
widest entering the stretch in the six path, and made mild progress under a drive. ANOTHER CHAPTER chased leader along the inside on the backstretch,
continued along the inside on the turn, took advantage of the rail opening up and launched bid in upper stretch, quickly flattened and failed to improve. SIR
WILLIAMS DREAM off slow and settled well of the pace on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and proved no factor in the lane.
