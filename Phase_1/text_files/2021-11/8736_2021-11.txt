Footnotes
Z U IN MY DREAMS matched stride for the lead two wide for a half, drifted in a bit brushing the runner up entering the stretch and shook clear in the four
path late to win under a strong hand ride. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS dueled with the winner along the inside, was brushed entering the stretch and gamely
held on for second. QUALITY CHROME stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, kept pressure the balance of the trip but
was outfinished. MY PHAROAH LADY stalked the pace four wide and lacked the needed response. NELL'S BELLS trailed, swung wide and went evenly.
ESTILO DE MUJER was a sharp threat three wide into the turn then stopped. THE RIDER OF POOLSIDE COCKTAILS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

marker and drew off under left handed urging to win as much the best. WAPAKONETA PHIL bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead soon thereafter, set
the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. RAVEN MOON settled inside, angled out to the five path entering the stretch then rallied
belatedly. HIPSTER bumped at the start and failed to menace. RECKLESS L J close up, failed to respond. CHIP CHOP bumped at the start and was

Footnotes
HARDLY SWAYED sprinted to the front soon after the start, set all the pace, drew off on the turn and won under a brisk hand ride. FRITTONS GOLD trailed
into the turn, swung wide, closed fast and got up for second. JAILBREAKER had speed from the start, offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then was
outfinished. UNCLE KEVIN had a mild late rally on the seven path. FLAMING HOT failed to menace. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR settle mid pack, advanced
three and four wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. PASION AZTECA was no factor. HURRICANE NATION chased the winner from the inside
for a half then gave way. LONESOME PHIL chased the pace two wide through the turn then faltered.
