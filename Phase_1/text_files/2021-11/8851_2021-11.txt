MOJAVE moved up to challenge WHATSITTOYA for the lead approaching the quarter pole, shook free at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid under
right handed pressure and just lasted over late gaining MOUNTAIN SPIRIT. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT raced outside in range around the turn, was ridden along
four wide into the lane, kicked in gamely in the final furlong, surged to the wire and just missed. PAITASKA rated off the early speed, launched a five wide
bid heading into the lane, came in a couple paths under pressure and stayed on to clear show. SAND WALKER chased neat the inside around the turn,
tipped two wide for the drive and failed to move into close contention. WHATSITTOYA sped to the lead at the start, held on top then came under attack from
the winner approaching the quarter pole, fought back turning for home then came up empty. JUGGLES raced up close in early stages then began to
weaken near the midway point on the turn. PER RULING FROM THE ARIZONA RACING COMMISSION, MOJAVE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE
TEST.
