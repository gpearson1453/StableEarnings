Footnotes
CABRA CHICA , showing improved speed, vied two wide on a short lead outside CHICA RABIOSA, edged clear past the three eighths, spurted away
nearing the lane, shifted in towards the rail and widened under a drive. NO MORE MASK prompted the pace three wide outside the dueling leaders, edged
up a bit and had aim after a half mile, chased the winner into the stretch, drifted in then had enough left to save the place. HOLIDAY CONNECTION chased
in the clear, came three wide for the drive but lacked a solid run through the final furlong. CHICA RABIOSA was hustled up to the inside of the winner and
contested the early pace, checked out of a tight spot near the three eighths, regrouped to pursue into the lane then faded. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT , off
the pace, raced four wide leaving the far turn and failed to respond. TINAS SHINING STAR , sluggish from the gate, edged up nearing the five eighths,
chased three wide past the three furlong maker then weakened. An objection by the rider of CHICA RABIOSA against the winner for alleged interference
around the turn was not allowed

HAPPYLIFE hugged the inner rail around the turn while stalking the pace, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside DUART
CASTLE and took the lead in deep stretch. DUART CASTLE , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch, opened a
clear advantage in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LOVE DUST lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and offered a mild rally.
AMARETTO SOUR lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. EL MILAGRA sped to
the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. LOOK WHAT I FOUND , four wide on the turn, weakened. NINE MAST
veered in leaving the starting gate then was four wide on the turn. KAREN'S CATITA bobbled at the break and was outrun. MISSAWLET prompted the pace
two wide and faltered.

Footnotes
CITIZEN'S FIRE stalked the pace under rating, bid two wide to take over nearing the five sixteenths, sparred into the lane, shook clear in mid stretch,
remained on his left lead and edged away while fully extended. GREYLOVER cleared early on, set the early pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving
the far turn, battled inside the winner from the five sixteenths to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. KEEN ON YOU saved ground early, eased out
around the final turn and had belated action. TERP TOWN , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and had a mild response. JUMP FREE lacked speed,
circled three wide around the final turn, moved up nearing mid stretch then flattened out. MADE TO BE LUCKY chased off the rail and faded. HIGH ROCK
dwelt at the break spotting several lengths, raced four wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace.

KINGSTON PIKE , lightly steadied behind horses near the five sixteenths pole, worked between rivals in mid stretch, closed inside BATTLEBUS and was up
at the wire. BATTLEBUS prompted the pace outside BLAME IT ON HONEY, gained the lead while drifting to the three path in upper stretch, drifted to the
four path in mid stretch and gave way stubbornly. AMEN CORNER hugged the inner rail around the turn and rallied mildly. EXTRA MEDIUM circled the turn,
was four deep entering the stretch and flattened out. SKY MAGICIAN stumbled at the break, raced well off the rail and finished wilingly. BLAME IT ON
HONEY set the pace along the inner rail and weakened in mid stretch. GONE INZANE stumbled at the break and was outrun.

Footnotes
RIPPOLINO rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out entering the lane, closed four wide outside the dueling leaders, moved to command with a
sixteenth to go, briefly kicked clear in deep stretch then was under a drive to prevail. ERIC'S EMPIRE , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back to mid turn
while under pressure, swung out very wide in upper stretch and closed gamely to gain. ANTIPOISON bobbled at the break, sped to and early lead when
was joined from his inside, vied three deep into the turn, emerged in a battle outside ASSEMBLY (BRZ) leaving the half mile pole, dueled and gained a slim
lead in mid stretch, could not contain the winner then gave way grudgingly in the final fifty yards. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) broke a step slow, accelerated
inside foes and joined the pace fray, dueled on a slim lead inside rivals past the half mile marker, kept up the scrum past the eighth pole then gave way
stubbornly. JACK GAVE BACK , off the pace while saving ground, was under pressure past the half mile marker, edged up then clipped the heels of the
winner near mid turn, angled out in the drive and came on late. MACHO SMOKE , between runners leaving the far turn, was not a factor. KING ALAN edged
up between runners early, chased outside a rival and weakened. THE DON OF SQUAN , three deep leaving the far turn, gave way. PRIVATE NETWORK
vied between runners through the opening half mile, chased around the turn then tired in upper stretch. TRIPLE AMERICANO ,wide, was outrun. An
objection by the rider of JACK GAVE BACK against the winner alleging interference around the turn was not allowed

JUROR NUMBER FOUR stalked the pace while outside rivals down the backstretch, floated to the four path when taking the lead in upper stretch and drew
off while kept to her business. FACTORINTHEHEAT , well placed between horses around the turn, rallied between foes. HUFFLEPUFF set the pace along
the inner rail and faded late. MOONSAFE , four deep on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. ITALIAN DRESSING , no factor,
raced in the two path around the turn. UNREQUITED LOVE prompted the pace outside HUFFLEPUFF and gave way. MAGICAL LUNA stumbled at the
break and retreated after three furlongs.

soon after, kicked clear while drifting a bit then eagerly widened under a drive. JUDI BLUE EYES was rated along three wide while in range, took closer
order approaching the stretch then churned on willingly to earn the place. MISTY TASTE , bumped between foes early, dropped in and stalked, dropped
back some the final turn then found some more late. FOGGY DREAMS cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was collared approaching the quarter
pole and faded in the final furlong. INSIDE THE BOX , three wide, raced between rivals near the five sixteenths and lacked a bid. DANCE WARRIOR
bobbled at the break, was a bit keen early and pulled her way forward inside, exchanged a bump nearing the first turn, rated back off the pace then failed to
respond. B B'S BUSTED stumbled at the break, raced wide leaving the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
COOKE BROTHERS rated behind horses around the turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch, advanced outside horses to secure command
approaching the eighth pole, drifted in when clear and lasted under brisk urging. FRANKEE MERCH , never far back, hugged the inner rail on the turn and
through the stretch and rallied gamely. DISTANT THUNDER set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and weakened in the drive. EDICT
, three deep stalking the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. SING A VERSE raced in the two path around the turn and lacked a rally. WARM
SUNNY BREEZE bobbled at the break, prompted the pace and gave way. SAM AND SY raced along the inner rail and was done on the turn.
