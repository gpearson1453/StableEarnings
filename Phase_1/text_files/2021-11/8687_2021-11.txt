Footnotes
AUTS REVOLUTION took the lead soon after the start and rated the pace inside, was urged away into the far turn, kept alert to deep stretch then taken in
hand late yards. LONG GRAY LINE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in from the head
of the lane and took second inside the sixteenth pole. NOVA BOY rounded the first two turns in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, started
a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. TIZ AUCTION TIME rated close to the early
pace inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. ROSAS WAY settled off the rail, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. KADESH stalked from the three path the opening half mile then
faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
HAPPY YEARS settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway on
the far turn then dug in, in a determined effort, to edge clear later yards. AIR MEDAL saved ground well off the early pace, bid past the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then steadily gained to take second the final strides. ROLL DEM BONES tapered to the inside to rate a slim lead and
dueled at even terms leaving the half mile pole, contested the edge nearest the rail but was caught midway on the far turn, yielded to the winner in later
yards and was nipped from second the final strides. WHAT AN OX rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, lost ground on the far turn and entered the stretch about the six path, then weakened. CHANGE YOUR LUCK angled in to race with the pace two
deep, challenged past the half mile pole and dueled at mostly even terms to the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, dropped back nearing the
furlong marker and weakened. SUGAR LIPS saved ground then faded from the half mile pole. MACHEN'S RIDGE steadied at the start and raced well back.

WICKED JANE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, altered course to come around the runner-up mid-stretch, dug in for the
lead later yards and drew clear near the wire. THAT KENNEY KID accelerated to the lead inside nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressrued pace,
raced at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught later yards. AT THE HALF gave chase outside, rounded the turn
about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. MISS GRANDSTANDER set a pressured early pace then pressured the runner-up from the three eighths
pole, raced close off the rail on the turn, though, flattened stride mid-stretch. DAMISELA gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the
three path then weakened. CITY PRINCESS bobbled at the break and was not a factor.

PENGUIN PARADE closed toward contention while angling in and stalked into the first turn, challenged past the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving
the three eighths, rounded the far turn just off the rail then lugged inward through the upper stretch, dug in under steady handling and just lasted. MY BOY
CLYDE rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of
the far turn, dug in for second mid-stretch and was gaining well on the winner. FELICIAS CASTLE angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the three eighths but remained close at the rail on the far turn, steadied off the inside flank of Penguin Parade
toward mid-stretch and altered course from that point, but flattened stride. MOVED BY JUBA settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, dropped back past the quarter and ran evenly in the lane. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. STORMIN ROCKET steadied at the rail into the first turn and raced
boxed in through the turn, settled close from the half mile pole, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths but weakened while losing ground on the far
turn and ran wide into the lane. OWEN'S MAGIC saved ground on the first turn then eased to the outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, though, faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL WARRIOR drifted and rounded the first turn in the four path and settled just off the pace, bid past the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage three wide on the far turn, drew to near even terms two deep into the lane, exchanged repeated contact with TOWERING CHANCE through
the lane and inched ahead through the final yards, while the latter took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside into the first turn to
rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met leaving the turn and
exchanged repeated contact with Nautical Warrior through the stretch, and relented the final yards. HENRY STANDINGBEAR settled back toward the inside
on the first turn and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and
four paths and dueled for third inside the sixteenth pole. IN THE GOSPEL steadied apprehensively nearest the rail through the front stretch then angled to
the two path into the first turn, challenged near the seven sixteenths pole and engaged in close chase through the backstretch, but dropped back from
between horses past the quarter pole and flattened the final furlong. NAZCA MYSTERY settled back off the rail the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. DEPUTY BEN was carried out
into the first turn then corrected course back to the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but showed no response. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Towering Chance nearing the first turn, lodged by the rider of In The Gospel, though, found no cause
for change.

GREAT BIG NOTION gave chase about the three path through the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn, dug in through the final furlong to take over
later yards and raced clear under the wire. BAYTOWN JAKESTER set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled through the
stretch, but was caught flattening stride later yards. DUDE AND JUMPER chased through the backstretch but was blocked off the rail nearing the top of the
stretch, angled to the outside at the eighth pole, finished well to take third the final yards and was gaining on the runner-up. CASH FLOWING pressured the
pace and raced close off the rail on the turn, but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride. SMELLSLIKEMONEY engaged in close early chase inside,
raced near the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. FOREVER YOURS veered out leaving the gate then chased outside and rounded
the turn in the four path. CLASSIC TUXEDO dropped well back and angled to the outside early, saved ground on the turn then angled back to the outside

HAPPY CHARLIE settled just off the early pace in the two and three paths, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn,
squeezed through inside ARE YOU HAPPY entering the stretch, took the lead past the eighth pole and edged clear later yards, while the latter took over two
deep midway on the opening turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on
the far turn, was headed past the eighth pole, but remained close to mid-stretch before relenting. MOMZA stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, drifted into the stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth. CARSON AND
I came away a bit rank then saved ground, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. RAGING
WHIRLWIND saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded approaching the far turn. MY BOY STRYKER stalked in the
three path early on, gave chase from the second turn, though, faded through the backstretch. MOON OF ROYALTY was never a factor.
