SKYLIME pressed on lead edging to daylight on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch widening under a drive along the inside down the lane. ISAIAS
DREAM went evenly through the turn emerging in the three path upper stretch responding as a clear second best. ADD ON pressed then chased on the
turn weakening in upper stretch mustering enough in the three path to hold off the others. TRINNI VALANTINE was bumped bobbling at the break, moved
up on the turn then leveled off in upper stretch finishing evenly. GALLIPOLIS broke slowly lagging through the turn responding down the lane showing some
late interest. MR. SLATE pressed then chased on the turn wearing out in upper stretch fading in the six path. DUNN DEAL was checked between horses
near the seven sixteenths pole staying back after. PERFECT SPLIT pressed the pace wilting abruptly on the inside in upper stretch.
