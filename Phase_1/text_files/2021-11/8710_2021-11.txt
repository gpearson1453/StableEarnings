Footnotes
UN OJO lacked early speed, moved up, racing wide around the final turn, rallied and was going away at the end. GOLDUSTER pressed the pace, raced
wide around the first turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. ZULTAN was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout, came around
the second turn wide and was outfinished for place. COTTONWOOD raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn, made a bid
and was outfinished for show. ESCROW STYLE raced in the back in the beginning, moved up, but was no factor. RUSSET MOON went to the front, drove
clear, saved ground around the final turn and faded. LUCK OF THE STARS always raced near the back and showed little. GUITARTUITION PLZZ raced
within contention and dropped back.

WARRIOR'S MAP unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane and drove clear before the wire.
LEMNISCATE went to the front, dueled on the front end throughout, but couldn't hold off the winner late. YODEL E. A. WHO pressed the pace, challenged
throughout, was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. EXTIRPATOR lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was
never a factor. PERFECT STAR always raced near the back and showed little. BRITTS A CLOSER raced within contention, dropped back and was outrun.

around the turn wide, rallied and was outfinished for second. FRANK THE MAYOR raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, made a steady gain, but
was no factor. DUST EM raced within contention, weakened and was no threat late. DRIED PEPPER lacked early, raced wide around the turn and passed
tired ones. PAY DIRT showed early speed and dropped back. PULL MY CHAIN void of early speed, moved up to the middle of the field and retreated. BIG
