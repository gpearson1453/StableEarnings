Footnotes
SWEETENER dueled inside of rival on the backstretch, continued to duel along the inside on the turn, shook clear late in the turn, responded to urging in
upper stretch and rider coasted final sixteenth to win in hand. MY BELLA CHICK chased dueling leaders on the backstretch, continued along the inside on
the turn, bid along the inside entering the stretch, and proved second best under steady urging. BALLET ROYALTY tracked duo two wide on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide, advanced midway through the turn, three wide, entered stretch widest and in the five path, kept to task and grinded up to
earn third. BIG AWARD dueled two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch within range, failed to threaten the winner and
kept to task in the lane. GODDESS APHRODITE stalked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, launched a mild
bid along the inside making some progress, but not enough to improve placing. EXCESS COIL stalked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two
wide on the turn, entered stretch two wide and failed to launch a rally in the lane.
