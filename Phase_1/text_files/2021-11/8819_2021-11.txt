Footnotes
ROSES R BLUE pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the turn, kicked clear into the stretch, widened through the lane under hand urging and was
ridden out to the wire. SUPERSONIC FLYER away quickest to take control, led up the backstretch while pressured from outside, dueled into and around the
turn, could not keep up with the winner into the stretch and stayed on to hold the place. SHEILA'S CHARLIE gave chase while widest up the backstretch,
went three deep into the turn, exited the bend three wide and never produced a bid. BIG STRIKE was off slow from inside, chased along the rail then two
wide on the turn, urged left-handed in the lane and failed to respond. SHANGHAI DAZZLER broke a step slow, chased outside a rival in the two path into
the turn, raced between foes around the bend then two wide into the stretch and weakened. FIVE CIRCLES tracked the top pair off the inside, dropped back
while three wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
WIPE THE SLATE broke alertly and came in early, set the pace into and around the bend, remained unchallenged entering the drive, urged right-handed in
midstretch and held safely under steady handling. CHERUBIC FACTOR got bumped leaving the gate, went two then three wide around the turn, closed well
but could not reach the winner. INGEST got bumped from outside in the beginning, was bothered a bit by WIPE THE SLATE soon after, lost his path and
checked behind that rival early, was driven two wide into the lane and finished evenly in deep stretch. JOE DON LOONEY dropped back off the pace,
moved down to the two path for the turn, steered out in the drive and closed the gap late. SURPLUS broke in and bumped rival at the start, was closest in
pursuit in the two path around the turn, chased a bit off the rail into the drive and weakened near the inside. LOVE MY JIMMY stumbled and bumped with
rival at the start, stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane and weakened. LOVESICK BLUES was eased out of the race
leaving the backstretch, coasted through the turn and pulled up near the eighth pole and walked off.

PRIMER DIMER went five then four wide around the first turn, traveled in mid-pack in the middle stages, remained four to five wide on the far turn, rallied
widest and bested the runner-up in the final sixteenth. FUNKENSTEIN stumbled leaving the gate, angled to the inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch,
angled four wide around the far turn, rallied in the drive but was outclosed by the winner. INESPERADO off slow to begin then rushed up between rivals,
was forwardly placed outside the top pair, vied three deep leaving the second bend, took over in upper stretch but yielded to the top pair in the late stages.
STRAUS'S PLACE chased off the inside, came three wide into the lane and missed the show.2. TRY TO CAPTURE sped to the front and crossed to the
inside, got pressured up the backstretch, dueled then vied from inside on the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened along the inside. EIGHT
MAKAR lost his footing at the start, tucked inside early, angled three wide on the final turn, altered around easing rider at the eighth pole and failed to
menace. STORM THE GATE took the first turn four wide, trailed into the far turn, went two to three wide into the lane and was not a factor. BIG WELL raced
a bit off the rail through the clubhouse turn, started to weaken in the two path on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch run. DA KINE raced up close
to the pacesetter early then applied pressure from outside in the middle stages, challenged around the far turn then vied between runners into the lane, tired
badly in upper stretch and was eased approaching the eighth pole, pulled up in midstretch and walked into the van under his own power.

Footnotes
ARHAM raced up close in the early going, bid alongside on the far turn, kept the pressure on through the lane, took a short lead with a sixteenth to go and
held the runner-up at bay. PHANTOM DANCE went four then three wide on the first turn, chased outside a rival into the far turn, driven three wide into the
stretch, put in a late bid four deep but could not get by the winner. IMPOSSIBLE TASK established the front early and angled to the rail around the first turn,
met the bid from ARHAM on the far turn, held a short lead into the furlong grounds relinquished command with a sixteenth to go and got edged for the place.
GO ON stalked from inside then moved to the two path on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch and angled to the inside approaching the eight pole,
had the rider lose his whip in midstretch and could not summon the needed late kick. DIVINE ARMOR moved to the two path for the first turn, angled in and
saved ground on the second bend, steered out at the top of the lane and kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more to make an impact.
WILLY THE COBBLER went four wide around both turns and lacked the needed response when called upon.

Footnotes
ISSA COURT shifted in and bumped rival at the start, raced between speed foes then took back and angled to the inside, steadied off heels on the first turn,
went up to press the pace on the backstretch, dueled on the second bend, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. KITTEN'S KID got knocked into inner
rival at the start, showed early speed then cleared on the first turn, got pressured in the middle stages, dueled on the far turn, lost the lead approaching the
eighth pole and stayed on to hold the place. AUSTIN JAMES got shuffled into the first turn along the inside, pulled a bit around that bend, stalked inside
then tipped out in upper stretch and whittle the gap late. SPANISH CHANNEL was put in tight soon after the start, went two to three wide around the first
turn, had to check at the five-eighths marker, driven two wide into the lane, then angled out and showed a mild rally. RENEGADE PRINCESS got bumped at
the start then bumped hard again shortly after, sat off the pace in the two path on the turns, angled widest in the drive and improved position. PIAZZETTA
had early speed three deep then moved back to a stalking position in the two path, lost some ground to the leader up the backstretch, chased two wide into
the lane and weakened. FINNLEY'S KITTEN was rank in the early going and angled in nearing dove to the inside at the three-quarter pole, tracked inside
out of range up the backstretch, asked through the far turn and could not rally. CHAO MAR saved ground along the inside and made no impact. BIG BELL
got bumped leaving the gate, traveled at the back outside a rival and was never a factor.

Footnotes
KID CORLEONE sped to the front and set the pace in the early stages, met the bid from SIR LONDON on the turn, held a short lead in upper stretch and
inched clear to prove best. SIR LONDON brushed with rival at the start, applied light pressure early on, challenged from outside into and down the stretch
but could not find the needed late kick to get by the winner. BRON AND BROW raced off the pace early, navigated the turn five then four wide, steered out
further in the stretch and got up for the show. WAR AT SEA chased two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend, moved out in the lane and got
edged for the show. AIR COMBAT broke a bit slow and inward, angled out and went between foes at the nine-sixteenths pole, took the turn three to four
wide and weakened. PEC TACULAR came away slow from inside, saved ground and never got involved. WESLEYAN brushed with inner rival at the start,
tracked off the rail then three deep, went four wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch and faded. BRADY BOY broke well then settled off the pace, raced
outside a rival while wide up the backstretch, went six wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and failed to respond.

SEE THROUGH IT tracked the pace on the inside, was crowded a bit at the three-eighths, angled out and exited the turn three wide, rallied outside RIDING
WITH DINO and closed well to be up in time. RIDING WITH DINO dueled for the lead from outside, lost contact at the three-eighths pole, chased the leader
around the turn, re-bid entering the stretch, took over in upper stretch, led through the lane and got nailed on the line. ALIGATO was crowded between foes
at the start, raced near the back off the inside, went three wide into the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, finished well and proved a game third.
CROSSWORD dueled on the inside, cleared rival at the three-eighths pole, showed the way two wide into the drive, lost the lead approaching the furlong
marker and flattened late. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE dropped back early, angled to the inside, steered out on on the turn and came four wide into the stretch
and improved position. TOO LATE broke well, chased widest up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved to the three path then came four wide
into the stretch and weakened. BOUND TO BET forwardly placed in the beginning outside the top pair, traveled two to three wide around the turn and
weakened. AUSTIN'S BOY chased the speed outside a rival then got shuffled from between foes entering the turn, moved to the rail around the bend and
weakened.

Footnotes
EDA prompted the pace from outside, took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, urged a few times right-handed past the eighth pole, drew
away under strong hand urging and coasted in late. TONITO'S stalked the top pair early on, bid three deep around the turn, could not kick on with the
winner in upper stretch but stayed on to hold second. UNDER THE STARS set the pace under pressure to the turn, lost command with a quarter of a mile
remaining, then weakened along the inside in the stretch. LADY T came away well then ducked in shortly after the start, steered out then drifted out up the
backstretch, navigated the turn four wide and could not rally. ENDLESS THIRST broke a step slow, tracked the pace off the inside, angled to the rail around
the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) broke a step slow to start, tracked two to three wide around the first turn, bid three deep at the four furlong mark, kept the pressure on
through the far turn and into the stretch, gained command with a furlong remaining and inched ahead late. OX BRIDGE came away alertly to take control,
steered to the inside, got headed at the half-mile pole and dueled briefly before inching ahead again, maintained a short advantage to the stretch, lost
command at the eighth pole and stayed on gamely to the wire. COSMO settled in the two path, exited the far turn three wide, moved out in the lane and
finished willingly for the show honors. MUAY THAI (IRE) rated by the rider along the inside, asked for run with a quarter mile left, lacked room and paused
momentarily at the three-sixteenths pole, gained a clear path and was urged gain but could not summon the needed late kick. BOLD VOYAGER was off
slow from outside, rushed up outside the leader early, raced between foes at the half-mile pole then got shuffled back soon after, chased the leaders two
wide to the lane and finished evenly late. COOL YOUR JETS reserved in the early going and moved down to the rail, shifted two wide on the far turn, got
blocked behind a rival while between foes near the quarter pole, shifted three wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and kept on through the late
stages. BUD KNIGHT steadied off heels early, steadied once more off heels on the clubhouse turn, angled four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
GOOD BYE PUTIN came away slow, went three deep into the first turn then got floated five wide around the bend, raced outside a rival near the back on
the backstretch, traveled two wide to the stretch and made no impact. ROCKS AND SALT raced between foes into the first turn, got floated out and steadied
around the bend, steered inside rival leaving the turn, angled to the inside and trailed in the middle stages, saved ground to the stretch and lacked late
response. INCH stumbled a bit leaving the gate but recovered well, got shuffled back between runners then steadied soon after that, traveled along the
inside then angled out around the clubhouse turn, took the second turn three wide and could not rally.
