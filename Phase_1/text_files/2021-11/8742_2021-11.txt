Footnotes
MS VANCOUGAR, off a step slowly, moved up quickly and took a narrow lead, set a pressured pace and held though the turn and stretch and was
beginning to draw off in the late stages under a drive. HARD EDGE drifted out leaving the gate, forced the pace, was lapped onto the leader through the
turn and stretch but hung late. SECRETS TOLD broke alertly but to the outside, raced in range, chased from the rail on the turn and finished under a
determined drive. AWESOME TREAT hopped leaving the gate, was close to the leader early on the backstretch, chased three-wide on the turn and was
game to the end. TWISTER ALERT ducked out at the break and settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely. USING
COCONUTS bumped with SHAN'S TIGER at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn and chased through the stretch. SHAN'S
TIGER, bumped at the outset, pressed the pace, dropped back two and three-wide through the turn and failed to menace in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ MY RIGHT stalked the early leader three to two wide on the first turn, turned up the pressure late backstretch and into the far turn, dueled to upper
stretch before clearing off, holding safe down the lane while kept to her task. TEXT ME UP went to the lead, was hounded by the winner throughout, dueled
hard on the far turn but relinquished the front by the stretch, came off the inside to take another shot but was no match for the winner, a clear second best.
UNDER THE EYE chased inside the top pair, angled out at the quarter pole and looked dangerous but lay in a bit in upper stretch and could not gain any
significant ground late. BIONDETTI'S CHOICE bumped with a rival a few jumps out of the gate, moved up between rivals late on the backside and came
into range at the quarter pole when three wide, only able to run in place down the lane after shifting in nearing the eighth pole. CALAIS COVE bumped with
a rival after the start, settled off the pace along the rail, came inside to three wide rallying at the quarter pole and out in the five path in upper stretch,
levelling off at the eighth pole. SAMURAI FIGHTER chased four to three wide on the first turn, dropped back three wide out of range on the second turn and
could not sustain her bid. NAKED ILLUSION sat along the rail in midpack, behind the eventual show finisher into the far turn but dropped back from the
quarter pole home. MAMITA'S CHICA was three wide on the first turn in midpack, drifted out two to four wide on the second turn and could make no
headway down the lane. VINYASA off the pace and three to two wide on the first turn, still far back and two to three wide on the second turn, never a
menace. PASTEL EMILY was four wide in midpack on the first turn and dropped back down the backside, never in contention.

HYPERFOCUS raced in mid pack, closed two-wide late turn, had the lead mid stretch and held under a drive. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS broke inward and
settled off the pace, closed three-wide on the turn, rallied between foes upper stretch, moved to the rail a 16th out and run gained steadily to the wire. SOUL
FREEDOM led onto the main track, set a pressured pace briefly and drew clear, quickened on the turn but was passed mid stretch and gave way.
ICOMEFROMDOWNTOWN stumbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly and closed to mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the turn then rallied mildly.
GIANT CRITIC stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn but leveled out in the final 16th. CANADIAN SECRET settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, chased from the top of the stretch but failed to menace. GOLDMINE CAT raced from off the pace, came two-wide through the turn but
flattened out in the final furlong. SOUPER SMART led early, was headed entering the main track, forced the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn
but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
HITTERS PARK stalked the leader from the inside, drove up the rail into the turn and had his head in front at the quarter pole, shook off his pace buddy by
the eighth pole and had a clear advantage, kept under a drive to the wire. HURRICANE DANCER dropped in behind a mad scramble for the early lead mid
backstretch, was on heels and steadied late backside, on hold for the entire turn awaiting room, finally got a seam in upper stretch and closed strongly late
but just had been left too much to do. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST had the early lead, was challenged inside and out into the turn, battled the winner to the eighth
pole but tired from there to the wire, passed for place late but easily holding third. VICTOR'S DESTINY was four wide stalking early, dropped back three to
four wide on the turn into midpack, in the five path in upper stretch, putting in a mild rally to grab a minor award in the final stages. PINK LEMONADE
bumped with a rival in the early going, recovered to three wide press the front down the backside and around the turn, dropping off in upper stretch when
tiring. NEVAEH'S VALENTINE was off the pace early, three to five wide around the turn and out in the seven path turning for home, lugged in at the eighth
pole and in hand the final sixteenth. BE THE CHANGE four wide and off the pace, still four wide on the turn and out in the eight path turning for home, able
only to pass a few stragglers late. NOW WE ARE NINE bumped with a rival in the early going, chased on the turn but had nothing left for the stretch drive.
HESATHRILLER trailed throughout along the rail. BRADY O'BRADY began sluggishly and was pulled up on the backstretch.

Footnotes
COCOTARA set a pressured pace, shook clear early on the far turn and left her presser behind then held sway under a hand ride. IF SIX WAS NINE
stalked the pace, chased from the rail to three-wide on the far turn and was game to the end. CHERUBIC settled in mid pack, angled two to four-wide late
on the far turn then finished gamely. BLUEYED PRINCESS settled off the pace, closed three then two-wide on the far turn and rallied late outside. JADE
DELTA was off slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled angling out from the rail to three-wide on the far turn and showed some interest through the stretch.
JOY'S SOLUTION broke slowly, settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch. TOP PRIZE GIRL had early speed
then forced the issue, chased when her target got away from her leaving the backstretch and tired a furlong out. TWOCANKEEPASECRET, bumped at the
start, raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MUSKOKA LADY, bumped at the outset,
settled off the pace then soon closed to mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
WICKED MIAH bumped with SHUDDAUDDAWUDDA leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied and
was up just in time, driving. BAHIA GIRL stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn, launched a determined stretch drive but was outkicked.
STENCIL had speed, entertained a challenge from NO WHAMMIE on the backstretch, dueled through the turn, drove clear a 16th out but was caught in
deep stretch. GIANT ILLUSION stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. NO WHAMMIE hopped
at the break but showed speed, engaged STENCIL in a battle which took the pair through the turn and to the final 16th but was no match at that point and
gave way. HIDDEN IDENTITY was checked behind a rival early on the backstretch, closed two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but
evened out mid stretch. KENTUCKY FAN raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide through the turn but never reached contention. REIGN BY
REIN raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA bumped with WICKED MIAH leaving
the gate and was pinched back between rivals a few strides later, dropped well off the pace and was never in contention.
