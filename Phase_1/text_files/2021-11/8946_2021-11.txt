GOOSE DOWN GREY well placed, closed steadily three wide on the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead past the furlong maker and finished full of
run in the four path to win going away. BAHAMIAN PARK chased the pace into the far turn, inched closer two wide nearing the quarter pole, altered course
outside to the five path and finished second best. ADIOS BOBBY was fractious in the gate, broke in front, quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace until
deep stretch then was outfinished. POMPEY'S RULE failed to menace. LEND AMERICA was no factor. PASION AZTECA trailed.

SHE'S PURE SILVER settled just off the leaders, moved up steadily three wide through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch then drew off in the
final furlong to win as much the best while being ridden out. ROSE KNOWS sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a pressured
pace into the turn, was headed, fought back to regain command before a half then was no match for the winner. BOURBON BUNS trailed into the stretch
and had a mild late rally inside. LADY OF LIBERTY had speed along the inside for a half then faded. STORMY BELLA broke sharply, prompted the pace
two wide into the turn, made the lead, had speed to the top of the stretch then was used up. LEWD failed to menace.

PECKS NOT BAD made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and drew off under confident handling to win as much the best. KETTLE KING
pressed the pace four wide into the stretch, drifted out late and held on for second. THE GOSPEL OF MARK never far back, swung wide and closed a gap
late. SOMETHING SACRED went evenly and steadied between rivals at the wire. KNIGHTOFMICHAEL was no threat. JOHNNY C had good early speed
along the inside, drifted out in upper stretch then faded. TIDE RISING was no factor. PINKY'S POINT stalked the early pace, pulled up entering the turn and
was vanned off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
L C ZERO sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drew off and prevailed under brisk handling. MOBIL CHIC stalked
the early pace, advanced three wide into the stretch, swerved outward when struck with a left handed whip at the furlong maker and was steadily gaining on
the winner late. GOOSEISONTHELOOSE pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then faded. TV TIZ GORGEOUS failed to menace. TIDAL
ROCKET bore out badly at the start and was no factor. GIMME CLEARANCE broke slowly and was never involved. BEACH AND WINE close up early
outside, faded. OPHA MAY had brief speed. HOLLY'S PERFECTION raced wide early and was outrun. SAMEOLSONGNDANCE was no threat.
CONSECUTIVE RUN pulled up on the turn and was walked off.
