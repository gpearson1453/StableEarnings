Footnotes
VALHALLA AIR BASE was away alertly then settled in mid pack, circled three and four-wide late turn, had the lead upper stretch and drove clear. EXPO
ducked out at the break and was steadied, stalked the pace, raced two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished with a determined drive. MAD
DOG N JOE forced the pace, dueled from the rail on the turn, gained a short but brief lead at the top of the stretch, was passed and chased to the end.
ARQUEBUS settled in mid pack, dueled two-wide on the turn, was headed upper stretch and chased gamely. SPIRAL STORM settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was gaining in the stretch but did not menace. ABSOLUTIST settled off the pace, trailed early, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn
then rallied belatedly. RED MAVRIK closed on the backstretch, stalked briefly, chased hard from the rail on the turn but was not a threat. HULLABALOO
showed early speed, dueled, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally. LAUGARICIO had speed in hand, dueled, dropped back on the turn and trailed
home.

Footnotes
TYCOON was on hold in midpack, two to four wide and behind a wall of chasers at the top of the stretch, got a seam in upper stretch and drove past the
leader at the seventy yard marker, inching away late. ORPHAN HALLIE won a scramble for the front, cleared off before the turn, drifted off the fence at the
quarter pole and in the four path down the lane, run down by the winner at the seventy yard pole but game to the wire. PARTY OF NO sat off the pace,
closed into range four to five wide on the turn and out in the seven path turning for home, rallying best of all late while outside. LIVERPOOL MAN along the
rail and on hold early turn, in the two path closing in to upper stretch but seemed to stall, then got his second wind and kicked it in again in the final
sixteenth. QUANTUM VELOCITY off the pace and trailed into the stretch, came running in the three path down the lane but was outgamed late for fourth
place. FRAC ATTACK chased three to four wide and loomed outside the leaders turning for home, bid in upper stretch but hung outside late. WINGS OF
VICTORY trailed into the turn, circled the field three to six wide on the turn and out in the eight path into the stretch but stalled while widest in the final
sixteenth. BIRCHMOUNT RD chased the leader three wide on the backstretch and around the turn, bid at the top of the lane but flattened out in the final
furlong. GENDRAGON off the pace, circled two to five wide on the turn and out in the seven path in upper stretch, was inching up late when he lost his path
in the final seventy yards. BEYOND MY DREAMS settled in midpack, was three wide outside the winner midturn into the stretch, began to drift in the late
stages and was snatched up while doing so. ADELAIDE COURT up inside the leader early on, took back to stalk that one on the turn, dropped back
between at the quarter pole and lost his path, stayed game to the eighth pole and faded. ARTIE MY BOY rode the rail chasing the leaders, in behind that
group late on the turn but had no run down the lane. COPINSAY was two to three wide off the pace, near the rear late on the turn when angling out to the
five path but couldn't put in a run. EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY broke out at the start, got over to the rail when off the pace but a mild rally stalled in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DUKE OF LOVE stalked the pace, chased into the stretch, led quickly and held sway under light handling. UNCLE JOE broke outward, forced the pace, was
hustled three-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. MENTORING held a narrow early lead, set a pressured pace, was engaged upper
stretch, was headed, and chased to the end. HILARIOUS AFFAIR ducked in at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn and
was all out in the stretch. LIGHT THE LAMP, in range, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then finished evenly still on the wood. INVISIBLE
FRIEND dropped back early, closed four and five-wide on the turn then closed a gap in the stretch. FACTOTUM raced from off the pace, came two to
four-wide through the turn but never reached contention. SHAMBO bobbled leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
but failed to menace in the stretch. SEA TO AIR forced the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn, was checked late turn then finished evenly. BIG
BAD BEAST, steadied at the start, settled in mid pack, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT
INVOLVING SEA TO AIR AND POSSIBLY UNCLE JOE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO INFRACTION AND LET THE
RESULTS STAND.

SEVENTYSEVEN STONE settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the far turn, rallied outside and swept to the lead in the late stages.
REDOUTE'S LIGHT raced in mid pack, chased four-wide on the far turn, rallied, led briefly mid stretch but was passed. D'S BEN set a reserved pace,
dueled on the final turn, was passed in the final furlong and chased to the end. TALLESTOFTHETALL settled off the pace, closed five-wide on the far turn
and finished gamely in vain. FIRST SPRING was always contentious, dueled on the far turn, was passed in the final furlong and gave way. SELF
INFLICTED, steadied at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then evened out in mid stretch. THE MIGHTY JUDGE settled in
mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely. SOLAR stalked the pace, chased on the far turn then flattened out in the
final 16th. ICE CHALLENGE, in range, stalked the pace, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally.

WAR BOMBER (IRE) chased the leader through fast fractions, rallied into striking range in upper stretch and drove by the tiring pacesetter at the seventy
yard pole, needed the wire late to hold off a phalanx of closers. SIR SAHIB off the pace, still near the rear into the far turn, came two to four wide and out in
the six path turning for home, closed relentlessly outside to grab a multi-horse photo for the place spot, all of who were inching up on the winner late.
LAPOCHKA on hold in midpack early, closed two to three wide on the turn and out in the five path turning for home, closed strongly but was outnodded for
the place spot late. BURNING MAN trailed, had one rival beat entering the far turn, rode the rail into range and closed fat up the inside down the lane to
grab a minor award. TIDAL FORCES dropped back early to chase the speeding top pair, advanced two to three wide on the far turn and moved into third
place at the eighth pole, but was outkicked by three rivals late while continuing to inch up late. ENGLISH CONQUEROR off the pace and had only one rival
beat midway on the far turn while three wide, lugged in when moving up in midstretch, was gathered up and taken to the outside and closed best of all late
while widest. VANBRUGH sped off to a clear advantage, shook off a challenger early on the far turn and held safe inside the sixteenth pole, headed by the
winner and tiring in the final seventy yards. TIESTO sat in midpack while two wide, rallied into range gradually on the turn and down the lane but was outrun
by numerous rivals. THEREGOESJOJO off the pace three to two wide on the turns and trailed into the stretch, was closing with a group of rivals when
forced to take up sharply when a foe drifted into his lane, a definite rally stopper. COLEYVILLE rode the rail from off the pace and was in range into the
stretch but his rally stalled in the final furlong. TIMESKIP sat in midpack along the rail but his mild rally could only get him by one tiring straggler late.
ROGUE AFFAIR chased the speedy leader throughout, bid on the far turn but threw in the towel at the quarter pole and backed away down the stretch.
TAOS (FR) sat in midpack three to two wide on the first turn, dropped back three to four wide on the far turn.

Footnotes
SANDY BAY settled off the pace, was hustled on the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied fast and was up late under a strong hand ride. ELEKTRONIC led
early, dueled on the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, came in 70 yards out and bumped LAKE SHORE DRIVE and was passed by a closing
winner. AIM FOR THE SKY stalked the pace, dueled briefly, forced the pace late turn and finished under a determined drive. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR
forced the issue, bid into the turn, dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch and chased to the end. LAKE SHORE DRIVE settled in mid pack, chased
from the rail to three-wide on the turn, moved to the rail mid stretch, was bumped 70 yards from the finish and evened out. GALVASTON settled off the
pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, closed in the stretch but ran into traffic and showed a mild late run. IGNITED, in range, chased late turn,
lugged in several times in the stretch but still showed a mild rally. DANFUSI stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch
but failed to menace. THREEFIFTYSEVEN stalked the pace, was hustled three to two-wide on the turn but evened out in mid stretch.

Footnotes
UNDEFILED brushed with a rival at the start, in the two path midpack, moved up to nestle in behind the leaders at the quarter pole, dove to the rail when the
pace survivor drifted off it turning for home, got the front from that one at the eighth pole and held him safe to the wire. AMMUNITION brushed with a rival at
the start, pressed three to two wide on the first turn, took the front midway on the backstretch and repelled a challenger on the far turn before drifting off the
rail turning for home, the winner came up his inside to pass him at the eighth pole, gave way grudgingly to the wire. STOP THE HUMBUG lost footing start,
two wide in midpack early, was three wide outside the winner at the quarter pole and tipped out to the seven path while the winner got the fence, closing
doggedly for the show spot while wide. GRAZELY had a four wide trip throughout, rallied from midpack to loom dangerously turning for home but could only
hang on late for a minor award. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN sat in midpack three wide on the first turn, moved into range three to five wide on the far turn and
out in the seven path turning for home, coming on the outside the best the balance without threatening. ANTE UP ALEX three wide at the back into the first
turn, closed between rivals on the far turn and inched up down the lane, no menace to the top finishers. DOWNLOAD along the rail and off the pace, angled
out to the three path into the stretch but his rally ran out of steam in the final forty yards. FIFTH SEASON was two to three wide off the pace on the first turn,
circled rivals four wide on the far turn and into the six path into the stretch, his rally levelling off at the sixteenth pole. DAWSON SILVER off the pace and
four to two wide on the first turn, four wide and near the back on the far turn before passing a few tired foes fown the lane. JUST START ME UP chased
along the inside and had good position, but gradually dropped back down the backside and stretch. KOSMONAVT four to three wide chasing on the first
turn, up to bid three wide turning into the stretch but was repulsed and retreated. NORTH BATTLEFORD vied for the early lead, settled in behind the
leaders but backed up on the far turn.

Footnotes
STEEL WOOL settled early, closed three to five-wide through the turn, rallied outside and was up late under a drive. BLUE SNOW dueled two and
three-wide, led upper stretch but was passed in deep stretch. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS showed brief speed then stalked the pace, bid late turn, dueled into
the stretch, was passed but chased to the end. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then closed willingly along
the fence through the stretch. BEST AND FINAL stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide through the turn, dueled into the stretch but was passed by
the winner. VATICAN MOON settled in mid pack, closed three to five-wide through the turn and finished under a mild rally. FOUR BOUNCE raced in mid
pack, came three and four-wide through the turn and mustered a mild rally. MR. DYNAMIC hopped leaving the gate, settled in range, chased two-wide late
turn and evened out in deep stretch. IN ALL ALONE dueled from the rail, was headed upper stretch and gave way. HONOR COLLECTION broke poorly and
settled off the pace, raced four-wide through the turn but never reached contention. CALMING INFLUENCE dueled, dropped back early turn, was hustled
two and three-wide but lacked a rally. MIGHTY PELE settled off the pace, was always well back and lacked a rally. WHERE'S NED dwelt at the break, was
hustled through the backstretch and turn but could not sustain the effort.
