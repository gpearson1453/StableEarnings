PENICILLIN SUCCESS advanced to pressure on the backside wresting a clear lead on the far turn drawing off along the inside in upper stretch. UNION
SOLDIER gained on the backside chasing close up through the far turn, proved no match for the winner down the lane extending in the two path to save
place. HALO'S DANCE went evenly through the backside rallying to bid on the far turn, extending in the three path down the lane lacked a closing punch.
SKY ENERGY stalked the pace checking between horses near the three eighths pole. POINT OF GRACE in tight early played no factor. ALPHA DOG
gained on the backside then checked when in tight near the three eighths pole. WINWITHJIMMY set the pace being hooked at the half ceding on the far
turn giving way into upper stretch. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SKY ENERGY AGAINST THE RIDER OF HALO'S DANCE FOR
