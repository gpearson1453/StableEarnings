Footnotes
VANDALIA rated close up inside, raced boxed through the second turn, waited, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drew off and was
ridden out. CHESS NOT CHECKERS four wide through the first turn, pulled to contention, stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the
stretch, then made a steady gain, was no match for the winner and edged up for the place. MOON PARTY rated on the lead inside, weakened late and held
the show. BARRETT broke slowly from the gate, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and had an even final
furlong. VINTAGE GIRL five wide through the first turn, looped four wide through the second holding position, then weakened in the stretch. KIT CAN RUN
passed tiring inside. QUEEN CUPID fractious in the gate, broke a step slowly, then faded thru the second turn. DIAMOND ROCK steadied repeatedly into
the first turn, was well placed, saved ground through turn, then faded into the stretch.

BOSS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and ran evenly. UNTWISTED broke slowly from the gate and
passed tiring rivals inside. DARA'S BOY stalked the pace on the outside, could not match strides with that one and chased through the turn, then weakened
in the lane. MASTERSHIP broke sharply from the gate and was well placed outside, then faded three wide through the turn.

Footnotes
NUMERIC set the pace inside, shook clear, then turned back a bid through the turn, drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. LADY WOOD stalked the
pace on the outside, dropped back slightly through the turn on the two path, angled three and four wide into the stretch dueling, then edged ahead for the
place. FULL OF ATTITUDE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch dueling, then was outfinished
for the place. STARE IF YOU MUST passed tiring rivals. FLOR DE PLATA well placed, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, bid
outside the leader, then weakened in the stretch. INDYZAN was a brief factor, outside. DOMORE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside and faded.

Footnotes
DAHLONEGA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. RAIN broke slowly from the gate, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and edged up for the place. DOMINEER stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the
turn, came through inside, angled out, dueled with DISTINCTLY BLUE, shook clear of that one and was outfinished for the place. DISTINCTLY BLUE well
placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path, dueled, then flattened. SALSA RITA tracked the pace back, saved ground
through the turn, angled out in the stretch and weakened. KOZY DREAMS well placed and between, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn,
then faded four wide in the stretch. MISS MIAMI was never involved. MS BIG SPRING was no factor.
