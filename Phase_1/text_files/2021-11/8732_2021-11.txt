Footnotes
HOLLY'S PERSUASION broke a step slow and rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, roughed off the
inside flank of Stacias Ruby nearing the quarter pole, recovered stride past the pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane
to take over late yards and raced clear toward the wire. JACKIE THE JOKER took the lead two deep leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace,
came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and widened at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in late yards.
KEEN MACHINE saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. UPTOWN BELLE
became anxious in the gate then settled off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn about the four path and raced evenly
in the stretch. STACIAS RUBY stalked inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. JACK'S RUCA
settled just off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, showed no response, pulled up sore, was unsaddled
on the clubhouse turn then vanned off.

Footnotes
ALGODONAL rounded the opening turn about the four path and stalked into the backstretch, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the nod two
deep midway on the far turn, drifted into the stretch, ducked in past the eighth pole but drew clear mid-stretch when straightened away and was taken in
hand late. CATHERINES WARRIOR moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail
midway on the far turn, steadied at the inside flank of Algodonal past the eighth pole then faded the final sixteenth. BOCA BIRDIE saved ground well off the
pace on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, improved in the five path of the far turn, dueled for third
inside the eighth pole and was gaining on the waning runner-up. ENDUROS TIGRESS stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, drifted into the stretch then flattened stride. FONDA ROMANA rounded the opening turn about the three path then
eased outward into the backstretch, made a mild bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little further. DAH
PHILLY rated just off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase at the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. GIRL
POWDER raced close early then faded steadily past the opening quarter. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Algodonal for
interference past the eighth pole, lodged by the rider of Catherines Warrior, though, found the claim warranted no change.

dug in under steady stretch handling and just lasted. CLUBIN TILL DAWN chased the early pace toward mid track, rounded the turn about the three path,
dug in from the head of the lane, was closing steadily and just missed. HOLLYWOOD BROWN gave chase through the backstretch, eased to the four path

CATCH MY CABOOSE stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took over two deep at the quarter, was steadily
encouraged leaving the far turn and held on well. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced two deep on
the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. WHAT A STORY raced well off the early pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled four wide into the stretch and dueled for third while gaining on the runner-up. CRAZY
IDEA saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid past the three eighths pole, eased five wide through the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel
for third. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled close into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
continued close in the three path of the far turn then flattened the final furlong. SKY GAZER R V F drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail at the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened.

turn.

Footnotes
MUAD'DIB stood with calm demeanor as Northern Ridge became fractious in the gate, was taken back and settled about the three path the first three
quarters of a mile then bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily closed for the lead nearing the quarter, was urged clear midway on the turn, came under
pressure into the stretch and held on well with steady handling. MARTIN MAN saved ground racing well off the pace, bid with the winner from the three
eighths pole and drew close to that one three wide midway on the far turn, then couldn't improve in the stretch and had to settle for second best. WILLIAM
AND MARY raced well off the early pace inside, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled clear for third
past the eighth pole. BOASTER raced well off the pace in the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the four path of the far turn,
but showed little further in the lane. HERO'S MAN rated a slim lead inside then drew clear past the three quarter pole, came under pressure into the
backstretch to put Brother Corbin away, but was caught at the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened. NORTHERN
RIDGE became fractious in the gate and raced well off the pace in the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. THORN OF
ROSE HILL dropped well back and saved ground. BROTHER CORBIN raced with the early pace inside then stalked from the three quarter pole, gave
chase into the backstretch but weakened past the five sixteenths.

AWESOME ALANA raced well reserved at the rail early on, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and progressed steadily to take the lead three wide
approaching the top of the lane, then dug in under steady handling to hold on well. THUNDERTURTLE saved ground through the opening turn and settled
off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced close through the turn, was in tight at the rail nearing the head of the
lane then dueled for second while outfinished for the win. MARY'S JEWEL dropped well back at the rail early, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
improved in the five path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. JUST A BIT SASSY rounded the opening turn in the four path and
settled off the pace leaving the turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, steadied briefly in the five path midway on the far turn then finished evenly to pass
rivals. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG dropped well back early, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly through the
lane. SKI BUNNY closed to a clear lead at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but gave up the lead toward the head of the lane, dropped back between horses at the eighth pole and
gave way. LIKE ME OR NOT saved early ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. BIRD
TRAFFIC raced just off the early pace off the rail on the opening turn then faded through the backstretch.
