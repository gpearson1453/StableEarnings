Footnotes
MANY ROSES was away in good order, was under a strong hold along the backstretch run, was given a reminder nearing the sixteenth-marker and held in
a drive. ANTARCTIC settled just off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, improved position into the lane and was outkicked by the winner
while holding for second. MEGAMEISTER settled off of the pace while saving ground and closed well in the stretch to claim the show. DESERT DUDE
stalked MANY ROSES through the second turn and was outfinished in the drive. CANYON CREST settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on
the second turn and did not mount a late rally in the stretch. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT was unhurried while saving ground through the second turn and was not
a factor.

Footnotes
J AND K EXPRESS was away well and set the fractions from a two wide position on the turn, was kept to task leaving the bend and was pressured in the
final sixteenth by the runner-up but dug in and held to prevail in a good debut. TWILIGHT EMPIRE stalked the pace through the turn from a four wide path,
closed well in the stretch and pressured the winner in the final sixteenth but could not reel her in while besting the rest. SHEZARUNAWAY tracked J AND K
EXPRESS from a three wide position on the turn and was outfinished in the late stages. THE PHARAOH'S GIRL took back in the first quarter to sit just off of
the pace while saving ground, swung out to five wide for the drive and was outkicked in the stretch run. NORTH DAWN had no early speed and was not a
factor.

TORREY'S GIRL stalked TRAFFIC STOPPER through the turn from a two wide path, closed the gap on that foe leaving the turn, wore that one down inside
of the final furlong and edged clear in the end. TRAFFIC STOPPER showed speed through the turn while being prompted by TORREY'S GIRL, was
confronted leaving the turn and could not hold off the winner in the drive, while besting the rest. CAMEO SHORES sat off of the pace, was four wide on the
turn and five wide in upper stretch and closed well to claim the show. AUSTRIAN NAVY stalked the pace while two wide between rivals on the turn and was
outkicked in the stretch run. SAKE chased the pace from the inside, steadied entering the turn while in tight quarters and weakened in the late going.
SWEET KAELA tracked the pace from a three wide path on the turn and tired in the drive.

THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) was away well and cleared the field to set the pace into the first turn, rated nicely into the second turn while being prompted by
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH, turned away that foe leaving the second turn and edged clear in the end. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH prompted the pace through the
second turn, mounted a three wide bid leaving the turn to challenge THANKS MAGGIO but could not close the margin and was outfinished in the stretch
run, while besting the rest. BARHOPSKY settled at the rear of the field while saving ground and closed well in the stretch to claim the show. EL TENAMPA
saved ground through the second turn while tracking the pace and weakened in the stretch run. KOKO'S MOM settled off of the pace and lacked a late rally
in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ARCH PRINCE settled just off of the early pace while saving ground throughout, rallied along the inside to confront BRONZE WARRIOR inside of the
furlong marker, dueled with that foe and dug in in the final stages to prevail. BRONZE WARRIOR attended the pace through the second turn, mounted a
three wide bid to take the lead into the lane, was confronted by ARCH PRINCE inside of the furlong marker, dueled with that one but grudgingly gave in in
the late going while holding for second. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) tracked the pace from a four wide path, gained ground leaving the second turn but was
outfinished in deep stretch. ROCKY TOUGH was away slowly and settled toward the rear of the field, gained ground while two wide on the second turn but
finished evenly in the stretch drive. MAHI MAHI was away well and set the pace through the second turn, was confronted nearing the quarter-marker and
was in tight heading into the lane and weakened in the stretch. ENGRAM was unhurried through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FREEPORT JOE bumped with BIG FISH on the first turn then settled off of the early pace while saving ground, was in tight quarters nearing the head of the
lane, tipped out for the stretch run, was under firm encouragement in the final sixteenth and surged in the final sixteenth to prevail. CAMINO DEL PARAISO
stalked the early pace, mounted a two wide bid leaving the second turn to confront SASH, led into the final sixteenth but was caught and outfinished by the
winner while besting the rest. SASH (GB) was away well and set the fractions into the second turn, was caught leaving the turn and was outfinished in the
late going, while holding for the show. BIG FISH bumped with FREEPORT JOE and steadied on the first turn, was unhurried in the early stages, mounted a
three to four wide bid on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the drive but was unable to reel in the top three. JUNGLE CRY tracked the pace into
the second turn, made a mild bid leaving the bend and weakened in the late going. EXTRA HOPE attended to the pace from a two wide position into the
second turn, was asked for run at the head of the lane and tired in the stretch. WINE AND WHISKY was five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace through
the backstretch, gave ground on the second turn while five wide and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SCRATCHY APACHE sat just off of the early fractions, steadied along the turn when trying to drift out, was steered to the three path for the drive, was urged
under right-handed encouragement and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. CORSICAN set the pressured pace from a two wide position, led into the final
sixteenth but was tagged by SCRATCHY APACHE in the final strides while besting the rest. TIZ VICIOUS was unhurried in the early stages and closed well
off of the turn to claim the show. BY MOONLIGHT was three wide on the turn while sitting off of the pace, swung to seven wide in upper stretch and finished
evenly in the drive. CAMZUL was shuffled soon after the start and chased from the rear, saved ground on the turn and finished willingly in the late going.
BOURBONWITHATWIST pressed the pace from a three wide position on the turn, was still in contention leaving the turn but was outfinished in the drive.
GORDY'S BOY stalked the pace from a four wide path on the turn, was six wide leaving the bend and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run.
