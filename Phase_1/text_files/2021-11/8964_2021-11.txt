finished well. PERFECT MISTAKE was unhurried early then made a four wide rally. SOURNOIS tracked the leaders from the inside made a mild bid on the
turn and faltered in the drive. MORE THAN BLESSED was well placed just on the leaders in the three path but gave way in the stretch. PAYNT BATTLE
raced in the middle of the pace and advanced three wide on the backstretch but failed to sustain bid. CARRIES MAN bobbled after the start but had no

Footnotes
SI ES GOYA set a pressured pace from the two path and inched clear in the stretch under a steady drive. HATTIES JEWEL tracked the leaders from the
two path for three quarters then went between horses at the head of the stretch and battled to the wire but was able to hold the place. BIG MONEY
MACHINE was allowed to settle just off the leaders then made a three wide middle move on the backstretch, made another bid going into the stretch while
racing four wide but didn't have enough late and just missed the place. FAST VERDICT pressed the pace from the inside, led briefly, and weakened.
THETRASHMANSCOMING stalked the pace from the three path for a half then dropped back and galloped across the wire.

FAZIO chased the dueling trio of leaders then made a three wide rally to prevail. FRIENDOFTHECOURT dueled from between foes and cleared at the head
of the stretch but was caught in the last sixteen to be second best. PAY DIRT was just off the pace of the the dueling trio and had his best strides late.
THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER was unhurried early and skimmed the rail to improve position. HOLY SUNRISE raced near the back while racing four wide and
made a late mild bid. HOT APRIORITY raced in the middle of the pack from the two path but failed to menace. TEXAS CROSSBOW dueled from the three
path and weakened late. G DON'T KNOW didn't have an impact. MALASONG dueled from the inside and gave way. FELLER tracked the leaders from the
inside and fell on the turn, lost rider and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF RACE AND AFTER REVIEW NO CHANGES
WERE MADE.

Footnotes
HARLONS COMMISION was placed just off the pace in the three path when asked she drew off. BLUE DARTER sprinted to the lead but was no match for
winner late. HURRICANE TIZWAY vied for the lead from the inside to prove best of the rest. JENNIFER'S ARCH was allowed to settle then made a four
wide bid on the turn and was kept to the task. COUNTRY DREAM lost contact early and made a rail rally. UNTETHERED SOUL stalked the pace from the
inside and faded. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE was allowed to settle while racing three wide and failed to menace. EZEE ENOUGH bobbled at the start and
broke out slightly but was never a threat. SHACKLELACKALACKA was close up early but was not a factor.

leaders on the inside and made a late four wide rally for the plaace. LANDWOMAN'S GIFT was unhurried early then angled out in the stretch to have her
best strides late. HAIRTRIGGER HEART stalked the pace from the three path and weakened. KAITLYN'S COURT raced in the middle of the pack made a
four wide mild bid going into the turn then faded. REMI'S ROSE was hustled to the lead to set the early pace and gave way. HOLY PEARLS was not a
factor. CLASSIC SCALE failed to menace.
