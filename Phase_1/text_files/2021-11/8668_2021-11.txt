MUSIC TO MY EARS trailed the field from the four path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path and rallied from mid-track to be up in time.
SOUIXPER CHARGER cleared on the lead early on, widened through the turn and into the lane, had his biggest lead with an eighth to go then was just
caught at the wire. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the
leader, could not gain further and settled for best of the rest. VENETIAN DREAM was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or
five path and never was a threat. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER raced between rivals through the turn while in the three path then weakened in the drive.
RUSHED chased the pace from the two path into the turn then faded.
