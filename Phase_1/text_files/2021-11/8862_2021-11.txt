Footnotes
POSEIDON'S MAGIC set a pressured pace throughout from the inside, cleared at the eighth pole and was able to hold on under steady urging. VELVET
NIGHT saved ground on the rail near the back of the pack then made a late two wide bid in the mid stretch but didn't have enough late and just missed.
MISSGREELEY'SSONG was forwardly placed while racing three wide, made a mild bid on the second turn but flattened out and was best of the rest. MAVE
RUNNER pressed the pace from the two path and gave way in mid stretch. DIVIDED raced near the back and was never a factor. BEAR TOOTH PASS was
allowed to settle while racing three wide and was never a threat.

BUILDING HOME was forwardly place in the three path, made a bid in the turn and drew off in the final furlong. I'M ALL MIXED UP was hustled along to
take the lead from the inside but was caught in the final furlong to be second best. TIME FOR A SONG was slightly fractious in the gate then tracked the
leaders from the two path, made a four wide bid in the stretch to be up for the show. BIND ON EARTH was rushed to the lead to lead briefly from the two
path but steadily faded. MISS HIGH HEELS raced in the middle of the pack from the inside but was empty in the drive. ANGEL ARKIE trailed the field early
and improved position late. FRENCH CHARM raced near the back from the three path but had no impact.

pressed the pace for a half then took the lead briefly and lacked a late response. GOTTATAKEHIMTO slipped through on the rail but didn't have enough
late. UNBRIDLED PULPIT raced near the back from the inside then went three wide in the stretch to pass tiring rivals. JR'S SAUVAGE saved ground on the
inside then made a bid on the turn and flattened out. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE tracked the leaders from the three path and tired. BIG BOSS MAN broke to
the outside then set a pressured pace for a half and dropped back to be eased and walked off. REPOSADO was allowed to settle from the two path and

SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE vied for the lead from the two path then drew clear at the eighth pole under a steady drive. VENN stalked the pace from the inside
then made a three wide bid on the final turn to be second best. FREDONIAN was reluctant to load then raced in the middle of the pack and closed willingly
in the three path. KING OF THE COURT set the pace from the inside for a half but lacked a late response. DINAR pressed the pace from the two path for
the first quarter then steadily faded. DREWCITABLE saved ground and improved position late. LIKEN IT chased the leaders from the four path and tired.
LEMON KICK trailed the field early and was never a threat. METROPOL raced near the back and faded but was never a factor.

Footnotes
MACHO RAPIDO stalked the pace from the inside then made a two wide bid on the final turn and drew clear late under a drive. RELAX TOWN set an
uncontested pace from the inside and was caught in the last sixteen to be second best. TROPHY DADDY was in tight and was checked right after the break
and raced near the back for three quarters then made a bid to have strong strides late. U COMPLETE ME raced in the middle of the pace from the two path
then made a rail bid on the turn but flattened out. HE'S A LUCKY MAN tracked the leaders from the two path and made a bid on the turn and weakened.
PRE HEAT hopped at the start and broke to the inside then settled near the back and made a rally but faltered. CALLTHEWOLFE hopped at the start and
trailed early then made a mild bid on the final turn. ANSWER IN THE WIND was forwardly place while racing three wide and gave way. MISTER STRANGE
stalked the pace from the two path and tired. BRAVURA CREEK was not a factor then was eased and walked off.
