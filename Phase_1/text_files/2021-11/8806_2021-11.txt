Footnotes
RED HOT CAT sat just off of the early pace, mounted a rally along the turn while three then four wide, kept on in the stretch and was up just in time to hold
the runner-up at bay. EMPIRE ROCKET tracked the early pace from a four wide position, closed well off of the turn but could not hold off RED HOT CAT in
the final strides, while besting the rest. SEVERIN contested the early pace, vied for the lead leaving the turn but was outfinished in the late going.
MONSTRODAMOUS stalked the pace while saving ground through the turn, was blocked in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally in the final sixteenth.
TIME TO ZOOM chased the early pace, gained ground along the turn while on the inside and was outkicked in the stretch drive. HULA KING contested the
early pace while three wide between horses and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIST was away well and was hustled to clear the field and set the pace through the second turn, saved ground throughout, felt late pressure
from QUICK TIME but dug in and held for the win. QUICK TIME (GB) settled in the midflight through the second turn while saving ground, was steered out
for the stretch drive and closed well but was denied for the win while just holding for the place. STEIN'S GIRL was allowed to settle near the rear though the
early going, saved ground through the second turn and rallied along the rail in the stretch but missed for the win and for second. CLASS CODE tracked the
pace through the second turn, gained ground leaving the turn but was outfinished in deep stretch. SHE'S EXPENSIVE stalked the pace through the second
turn from an inside position and weakened in the drive. LIL TINKER was away a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field and did not mount a late rally in the
stretch. HASTA LUEGO settled off of the pace and did not offer a late bid. HOT AND A MESS tracked the pace through the second turn and faded in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
RED DAHLIA sat just off of the early pace, collared PULPIT SINGER on the second turn, was met by FANTASTIC SECRET nearing the top of the lane,
briefly lost the lead to that foe, dueled inside of the furlong marker and came back on to prevail in the late stages. FANTASTIC SECRET tracked the early
leaders, mounted a bid leaving the three-eighths marker while four wide to contest RED DAHLIA on the lead, led leaving the second turn, dueled the winner
inside of the final furlong but was outfinished in the final stages while besting the rest. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was away slowly and settled at the rear of the
field, mounted a six wide bid on the second turn and kept on with that run to be an easy third. FIRE DIAMONDS was forwardly placed through the second
turn, was five wide on the second turn, and weakened in the stretch run. PULPIT SINGER was sent to set the early fractions while being prompted by RED
DAHLIA, relinquished the lead on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. SAYITALL stalked the pace through the backstretch and was done after
a half-mile.

IMPERIAL CREED sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, swung out entering the stretch, confronted MYBLUEBELL inside of the final
sixteenth and had a late push to get by that rival to prevail. MYBLUEBELL (FR) tracked the early pace, mounted a bid from three deep on the turn to collar
SAY IT WITH ROSES nearing the top of the lane, led into the final sixteenth but was caught by IMPERIAL CREED and outfinished while clear of the rest.
SHE'S SO PRETTY stalked the pace while three to four wide and did not have a late bid in the stretch. MISS INDEFATIGABLE tracked the pace through
the second turn while saving ground and weakened in the stretch run. SAY IT WITH ROSES set the fractions through the second turn while saving ground,
was collared by MYBLUEBELL along the second turn and faded in the late going.

MCGEORGE was allowed to settle in the early stages, mounted a rally from five wide on the turn, improved position inside of the final furlong and surged in
the late going to prevail. MAGIC TIGER stalked the pace through the turn from the three path, vied for the lead leaving the bend, drifted out inside of the
final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides by MCGEORGE while besting the rest. GOVERNOR ARTHUR had no early speed, made a sustained bid
along the turn while three wide and into the stretch, was in tight quarters in the final sixteenth and kept on to secure the show. WINK AND A DREAM sat off
of the early pace while in midpack, gained ground leaving the turn while three wide, took up sharply inside of the final sixteenth when MAGIC TIGER drifted,
and was outkicked in the final strides. BOURBONWITHATWIST stalked the pace from the second flight while saving ground and was outfinished in the
stretch run. COLONEL MIKE tracked the early pace while saving ground and gave way in the stretch. EL BEAUTIFUL was away well and set contested
fractions through the turn, was confronted by MAGIC TIGER at the head of the stretch and tired in the late going. MINSKY (IRE) pressed the pace from the
inside and faded in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING #8 MAGIC TIGER AND #7 WINK
AND A DREAM IN MID-STRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT MAGIC TIGER DRIFTED OUT CAUSING WINK AND A DREAM TO
TAKE UP SHARPLY AND IN DOING SO COST WINK AND A DREAM THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED MAGIC
TIGER FROM SECOND TO FOURTH. IN ADDITION, AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED FROM THE RIDER OF WINK AND A DREAM AGAINST THE
RIDER OF MAGIC TIGER.
