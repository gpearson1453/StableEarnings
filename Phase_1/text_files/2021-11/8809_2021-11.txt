CHARGING LION stalked off the rail, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep from the mid point of the far
turn turn and dug in under determined handling to eke out the nod over PROTA who rated a short lead inside and came under pressure nearing the three
eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail to the mid point of the far turn where he was met at even terms, and dug in gamely to the finish.
CANTAKEITANYMORE settled off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail then dueled through the
stretch for third. TIVANO settled back in the two and three paths, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GAMING JACK stalked three wide, challenged approaching the three eighths pole but dropped back toward the five
sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. GLAD MOON (GER) was never in contention while saving ground.

HIGH PRINT settled back in the four and five paths the first turn then saved ground into the second turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole,
steadily closed and raced in the four path of the far turn, then dug in under steady handling and dueled for the nod later yards. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME
stalked from the seven eighths pole and took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, rounded the rail at
the far turn, was met late stretch and gave up the nod the final yards. TAMAQUA settled off the pace in the four and five paths, drew close into the
backstretch and challenged toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back into the far turn and flattened the final furlong. LUCKY PENGUIN settled off the
pace about the three path, bid into the backstretch, raced in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly through the lane. YOUREASCOLDASICE saved
ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. TOMMY PIES stalked three wide from the seven eighths pole, gave chase nearing
the seven sixteenths but faded through the backstretch. BRILLIANT IDEAS took over at the rail nearing the seven eighths pole and rated a slim lead, was
met leaving the nine sixteenths then faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
THUNDER PUNCH was bumped early then set a pressured pace, dueled clear into the turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on well. CHEROKEE
CASTLE chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, entered the stretch about the three path and finished well while taking second
mid-stretch. SLEWING chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn then angled to the four path leaving the turn and finished well to take third
later yards. TUESDAY TOO pressured the pace inside, checked from tight quarters at the rail past the quarter pole, quickly recovered stride but flattened
out inside the eighth pole. NINETY PROOF gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly down the lane.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased and rounded the turn about the four path, lost some ground leaving the turn, though, finished evenly. DRIVEN TO
SUCCEED chased toward mid track, raced in the six path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE was bumped at the break, picked
up the chase leaving the chute then faded past the quarter pole. JUST ASK ME broke inward to make contact with Warriorinthehouse and was jostled
between that one and Thunder Punch on the chute, chased from the outside then flattened in the five path of the turn. MICKEY'SINTHEHOUSE saved
ground. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Thunder Punch for alleged interference past the quarter pole, lodged by the rider of
Tuesday Too, though found no action necessary.

Footnotes
EARNED THE SHOT settled close in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, dueled
to the lead near mid-stretch then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. LIFE IN FLASH saved ground into the first turn and raced well off the pace
leaving the turn, started a bid past the three eighths pole, steadily improved in the four path of the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take second
the final yards and was gaining on the winner. LONGSTORYLUCY saved ground racing well back on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch,
bid toward the three eighths pole, improved five wide on the far turn and closed through the lane to take third the final yards. WICKED SOLUTION angled in
to stalk the early pace two deep and took the lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole, dueled with the edge through the backstretch, raced clear of Bustin
Hearts, who was being pulled up at the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught toward mid-stretch and weakened later yards. PUT
POSITION saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn then weakened. COURTLY KITTY settled off the
pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded through the far turn. ADIOS HILLARY saved ground.
BUSTIN HEARTS angled to the rail and set the early pace, was caught leaving the nine sixteenths pole, engaged in close chase from that point but pulled
up sore at the quarter pole and walked off.
