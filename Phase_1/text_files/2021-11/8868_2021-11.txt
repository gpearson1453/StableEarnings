Footnotes
HEATED BATTLE saved ground throughout then wore down the pacesetter in the final yards. DREAM OF WARRIOR quickly sprinted clear then weakened
in the final eighth. BIZZY GILLESPIE chased near the inside early, angled out on the turn with a mild bid. SUNSHINE TOMMY prompted the pace outside
then faltered in the stretch. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE chased wide throughout and lacked a rally. CALLMETHEBREEZE dropped back early and was never a
factor. E T'S SUPER STAR raced wide off the leaders and was never in contention. VENCIL trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

TAINO settled along rail, advanced near the inside and edged away through the final furlong. AMERICAN FLEET hustled to the front inside, lost the lead but
continued willingly. SLEW TANG CLAN raced wide throughout and rallied mildly for the show. WICK trailed early, moved along the inside and gained late.
DEFIBRILLATOR stalked the pacesetter, loomed a stretch threat then flattrened out. CATCH MY VIBE made a brief bid outside on the final turn then
weakened. REPEATED PROMISE dropped back outside and was always far back. YEI YEI was urged close up for five furlongs then stopped abruptly.

COBH settled close up, split rivals moving on the turn and pulled away under moderate urging. MONTE NE sent to the lead inside, faded into the stretch
then came again for the place. COLOUR GUARD broke slowest, rushed up inside then weakened late. STRAWBERRY RED was hustled close up between
rivals and finished willingly. MASS APPEAL made a menacing inside move on the turn then flattened out. THOMAS KNIGHT chased wide and was never in
contention. DUBROVSKY lagged far behind, moved very wide on the turn and faded. HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS prompted the pace wide between rivals
and gave way. OFF DUTY prompted the pace wide down the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
KRISTI'S COPILOT saved ground within range, angled out in the stretch and was up in the final stages. HERE WEGO close from the outset, moved clear in
midstretch but could not withstand the winner. THOUSAND PERCENT led in the two path, lost the advantage into the stretch and weakened slightly.
DEVINE DENTAL raced just off the leaders and continued willingly. WILD HAVEN moved inside on the turn and lacked a solid rally. PHARAOH'S CITY
dropped back outside and was never a factor. CATCH FIRE chased in midpack and weakened steadily. ROCKIN COWBOY broke sluggishly, rushed up in
the ooening quarter and gave way. KOWBOY KARMA dropped back after the start and was never in contention. GILDED WARRIOR bore out badly on turn
and proved difficult to handle. KID MAC COOL lacked speed and was always outrun.

Footnotes
CORBALLY controlled the pace, widened on the final turn then lasted while tiring late. SHES EUPHORIC dropped far behind inside, moved wide inthe
stretch rallying. YOURINDENIAL went after the leader on the final turn then came up empty. PASATIME was fanned very wide into the first turn and failed to
menace. MIZSHIPMAN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and gave way. ALLEGRETTO chased very wide, bore out into the stretch and was no
factor. GUNFIGHTER'S GIRL dropped back early and gave way readily.

COBBLE ROAD set a pressured pace off the inside then gamely held rival safe through the entire stretch. ROAD TO SUCCESS forced the winner
throughout but could not get by with a gradual late gain. SECRET PATH prompted the top pair three wide and weakened but held the show. THIS ILL
DEFEND broke sluggishly, advanced wide then flattened out. STRIKING A POSE lacked speed inside, angled out on the final turn with a mild bid. FIFTY
SHEAS OFGREY urged close up just off the inside and faded in the stretch. MEAN MACHINE lacked speed, moved very wide on the final turn fading.
PRINCE CHAMP lagged far behind then caught a fading rival. DIABLO D ORO saved ground within range then gave way readily.

moved clear in midstretch but weakened. FINE ONE WON stalked the pacesetters wide throughout and lacked a solid kick. MINESHAFT MAGIC rated
close up outside then went evenly through the stretch. I'M THIRSTY pressed the pace outside and faded after three quarters. SPECIAL RISK angled inside
early, raced close up then proved empty late. MAGICGIRL dropped back early and was never in contention. SAME MOON broke slowest and raced far

FLAT OUT FLYING stumbled at the start, advanced outside on the final turn, surged and pulled away in the stretch. FLAT OUT FLASHY prompted the pace
three wide and continued well for the place. OTHER THINGS EQUAL moved closer in the two path on the final turn then flattened out. ICY DUDE lagged far
behind then split foes with late energy. MOON GATE WARRIOR saved ground well behind and was never a factor. CHARLIE THE GREEK dropped well
behind, moved inside and was outrun. HONORABLE SERVICE was prominent outside to the quarter pole and gave way. MARCO ISLAND alternated for
the lead inside and stopped in the stretch. D T GOODIE raced within range briefly then gave way readily.

Footnotes
CREATIVE LOVE outrun early, angled out advancing near the quarter pole then wore down the leaders and bid clear. REITERATE stalked the pace three
wide, bid to the front in the stretch then was caught late. WISHES AND DREAMS moved extremely wide into the stretch and closed well. J J LOVES BILLY
raced near the inside throughout and finished willingly. WOMAN FLYER settled close up in the two path and flattened out late. BRAZILIAN BAY dueled
outside with narrow lead then proved empty in the stretch. BEST SECRETS KEPT trailed early then offered late run while no threat. SUNDAY INN dropped
back outside and lacked a rally. TUFF BIRD chased within range then weakened steadily. BANGLE GAL saved ground and raced far behind throughout.
MON CHERIE raced well behind throughout. KARABESSA forced the pace along the inside for half a mile and stopped.
