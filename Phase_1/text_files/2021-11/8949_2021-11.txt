Footnotes
STEFANIE ON FLEEK was with the pace early three wide and between rivals, made a two wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then was
given one right handed pop with the riding crop shortly after the furlong marker, then widened the advantage and was just shown the crop late to prove best.
INTROSPECTION was four wide into the first turn, then pressed the pace four wide and proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place. RAG
TOP was allowed to settle early towards the inside, shifted out leaving the three eighths, then came five wide into the drive and offered a belated rally to
grab the minor rewards. PENANCE was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, eased out to be three wide by the three sixteenths and had no kick.
SHATTER ME set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. FLOATING BY steadied shortly after the start, then was settled three wide, came four
wide into the lane but had no rally.

inside, then dueled for command by the quarter pole, shifted out four wide leaving the turn and weakened. MISCHIEF MANAGED chased the early pace
three wide, made a mild four wide bid on the turn, then was bumped by the three sixteenths pole then was pulled up shortly before the furlong marker and

HESASMOKIN was well rated early, made a bid while two to three wide on the turn, was blocked and had to check by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the
turn for racing room, made a inside bid in the drive and drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. FOUR OF SWORDS set a pressured
pace in the two path, was headed and dueled for command by the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn, but was headed then by the winner by the
furlong marker, kept on willingly but could not go with that rival while clearly second best. J WASS was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move to
loom boldly by the quarter pole, but flattened out while gaining the show award. EQUAL JUSTICE prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on
the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, but came up empty in the drive. MARKET was bumped at the start, then was three wide by the quarter
pole, but offered no rally. FIGHTIN PHIL was allowed to settle early, then was on the inside on the turn and by the quarter pole but offered no rally.
COMFORTABLY COOL stumbled at the start, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole but lacked a late response. LORD OF HOPE pressed the pace
on the inside and stopped.

HASHTAG WINNING stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to duel for command on the turn, then slowly edged clear in the furlong
grounds and then held off IYWAAN late to prove best, driving. IYWAAN was well placed early on the inside, then moved off the inside leaving the seven
sixteenths, then came three wide into the lane and rallied well late. COLONEL MOORHEAD set the early pace on the inside while clear, then was
challenged on the turn, dueled for command to the furlong marker, then gave way grudgingly. MOTI was off slowly, then was reserved on the inside, swung
out three wide for the drive and offered no significant rally. ECLIPSED MOON was allowed to settle early and offered no response.

SEEKING THE THRONE was well rated early on the inside, then moved out leaving the five eighths pole, made a four wide bid leaving the five sixteenths,
took over leaving the turn, then kicked clear to prove best under a drive. OH SO JAZZY was off a step slow, then was void of early speed, advanced on the
inside on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn on the inside, finished willingly but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. SHOW
MAID was allowed to settle early three to four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn and made a two to three wide bid leaving the
turn but flattened out, bested rest. JUST A DREAM set the early pace while clear, then began to drift out mid way on the turn, came three to four wide into
the lane and weakened. HONEY BEEST stalked the early pace three wide, then dropped down to the inside by the half mile marker and stopped.

Footnotes
OUR SWEET GIRL was well placed early from between rivals, then made a three to four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front nearing the furlong
marker, then dug in gamely in the furlong grounds to score. SEEKING THE DREAM was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the turn, ran on
with the winner but was out gamed in a good effort. LEAKY CAULDRON chased the pace five wide, then moved down to be three wide by the five
sixteenths, then finished evenly late while clearly besting the rest. SPIRIT OR SPITE was reserved early, was on the inside by the quarter pole and passed
the tiring rivals. MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE set the pace while racing off the rail, then was headed shortly after the quarter pole and weakened. ECLIPTICALS
SARAH stalked the pace four wide and weakened.
