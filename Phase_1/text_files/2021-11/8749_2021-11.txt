Footnotes
MENELIK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then drew off at each call and was kept to the task in the stretch. TRIPLE JEOPARDY moved up
outside, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and closed for the place. MYSTERY MO never far back, gained
position three wide through the turn, bid on that path and flattened out. DIMENNA pulled to position inside, lost some ground through the turn, then came
through inside and weakened. THE RED MAN well placed and three wide, angled to the two path through the turn, then faded and angled out into the
stretch. GIVE ME TWO STEPS well placed and inside, held position in the two path, steadied mid way of the turn unable to keep pace, and was eased up
into the stretch. TIZ A PRINCE bobbled and steadied at the start, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

the task. TWILIGHT never far back, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the place. ELUSIVE
MOLLY well placed and outside, looped three wide through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for the show. RESTOFTHESTORY stalked the pace on the inside, angled out to gain a striking position on the two path, bid outside the leader into
the stretch and weakened late, holding a share. COREY set the pace off the rail and weakened in the stretch. NACHO MAMA was a brief factor, outside.
