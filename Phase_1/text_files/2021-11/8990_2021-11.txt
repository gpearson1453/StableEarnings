Footnotes
MA MOO POWER unhurried early, closed fast five wide in the six path through the stretch and got up in the final strides. BEARPATH never far back, closed
fast four wide, made the led in upper stretch, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. FUNNY BACHELOR was a forward factor along the
inside from the start, offered a mild bid two wide into the stretch and finished with good courage. MOBIL MAGIC broke in front, stopped inside, set the pace
into the stretch, drifted out and was outfinished. KID RUSSELL pressed the early pace three wide, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch then faded.
TALE OF LACEY failed to menace. HEIDI'S SINATRA was no factor. CAT HEAT was no threat. JIMTOWN was hustled along to press the pace along the
rail into the stretch and weakened late. IT'S A MANS WORLD was through after a half.
