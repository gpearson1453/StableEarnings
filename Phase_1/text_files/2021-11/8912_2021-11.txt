Footnotes
RON'S GIZMO began sluggishly and trailed at the start, gradually improved up the inside to tuck in behind the leading group, angled out to follow the leader
into the stretch and got a split at the sixteenth pole, getting the front forty yards out and inching away late. HIGH HEAT led early with pace pals to his inside
and out down the backside and around the turn, finally repelled those challengers by the sixteenth pole but the winner got through and ran by in the final
stages, game to hold the place spot. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE settled in midpack along the rail, angled out to three wide at the quarter pole and was in behind
runners in midstretch before tipping out at the sixteenth marker, closing best of all late while widest to grab the show. OCELOT chased two wide early,
loomed three wide at the quarter pole and bid in the four path in upper stretch but couldn't seal the deal and was outkicked for show late. FLYING CURLIN
was three wide stalking the leader throughout, bid at the top of the lane but was repulsed and lost positions late. BROWNING ISLAND sat on the rail in
midpack, dropped back to off the pace early on the turn but regrouped and mildly rallied inside down the stretch to best the rest. SPEED WAY off the pace
early, hustled three to four wide on the turn into range but was laying in down the lane and levelled off in the final seventy yards. SOUPER RIVER rushed up
inside the early leader to stalk that one, stayed lapped on until turning for home and tired from his early efforts. CANADIAN PHAROAH off the pace and
along the rail, was closing inside down the stretch but was stymied in the final sixteenth when no clear path developed. LIARS CLUB sat in midpack and
rallied three to four wide on the turn, was inching up in midstretch when the eventual third place finisher angled out into his neighborhood, forcing him to
check and lose interest. UNILATERAL was pinched back between runners at the start and off the pace, putting in a mild rally when far back in the stretch
when losing his path in behind rivals. HELL BENT off the pace, hustled three wide on the turn but never in contention when widest into the stretch.
DANCING DRAGON sat between foes in midpack on the turn but backed up down the lane.

Footnotes
MAGIC RIDE settled in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn, rallied gamely and got up late, driving. DANCE WITH DESTINY pressed the pace,
chased four then three-wide on the turn, bid a 16th out, led briefly but was caught late. AWESOME TREAT broke outward and settled in range, led early
turn, angled in from the third path to the rail, ducked in upper stretch and was headed but chased to the end. TWISTER ALERT settled in mid pack, angled
from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed gamely through the stretch. ENGLISH SHIRL forced the pace, bid into the turn,
was headed quickly, chased to the stretch and evened out. YOUENS settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed with
good energy. FASCINATION pressed the early pace, stalked on the turn, chased into the stretch but hit the wall with a furlong to run. SHEZ A SEALY, in
mid pack early, dropped back on the backstretch, was hustled four to six-wide on the turn but failed to threaten. VIVID VIXEN was herded at the start, raced
in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but flattened out in the stretch. IMAGINARY SKY held a short early lead, dropped back on the turn
and lacked a closing response. PROTECT stalked early, chased three to five-wide from mid pack on the turn but tired at the top of the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MASON'S GAMBLE was four wide between rivals in a scramble for the early lead, up to stalk the pace leader into the turn, took over turning for home and
was immediately tackled by a rival but repelled the challenge of that one down to the wire in a gutsy effort. BREAKING ALONE was five wide in the mix for
the early lead, loomed three wide outside the pace survivors on the turn and bid against the winner in upper stretch but that one was stubborn and wouldn't
let him by down the lane. DOWNY BOY trailed early, came up the inside at the back of the pack and steadied hard when drifting off the fence a tad into the
turn, continued to hug the fence into the stretch and got a seam at the eighth pole, closing well when clear late. EXECUTIVE SEARCH was fractious in the
gate before the start, had a short lead between early, sucked back to midpack and three wide on the turn but re-rallied down the lane to best the balance in
the midst of a line of rivals. SACRED OATH off the pace early, circled four wide into range on the turn but hung in the final stages on the outside of rivals.
TAKE A CHANCE two wide in the early scramble for the front, fell back to midpack on the turn and mildly closed down the lane between foes. SOUPER
WATSON was at the back of the pack before steadying in tight quarters into the turn, moved in behind a wall of horses in midstretch before getting a seam
late and passing a few rivals. JUST LIKE LARRY was under a heavy hold in behind a phalanx of runners for the early lead, lost his hood after a quarter mile,
stayed along the fence into the stretch still in range but was out of run at the sixteenth pole. TALE OF MINESHAFT off the pace early, came into range three
to four wide on the turn but ran out of rally in the five path in upper stretch. WAVE BABY rushed up the rail to get the lead inside a group of rivals, was
pressed by the winner and headed by that one late on the turn and retreated down the stretch.

BRASS COMPASS pressed the pace, edged closer through the stretch and was up late, driving. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST set the pace, gave way grudgingly
through the stretch and was caught on the wire. EXECUTIVE SIGHT broke outward and settled off the pace, circled four and five-wide on the turn then
rallied widest. ROCKET PLAN settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. DANI'S VICTORY raced in mid
pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, was blocked in the stretch and closed gamely in the late stages. BOKERMIN stalked the pace, was
hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. ROBUSTO settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, was
blocked in the final furlong and failed to menace. DOT'S VISION settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn and was still gaining in the stretch
but left too much to do. ENTRY TO HEAVEN was off slowly, moved up to force the pace, chased on the turn but flattened out in the final 16th. WHERE'S
ANTHONY settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
D'S SOUL stalked the leader throughout, turned up the pressure midstretch and led at the sixteenth pole, inching away late in a race dominated by front
runners. CHERUBIC broke slow from her inside post, rushed up the inside to take command, held her open length advantage until midstretch when the
winner closed in, headed by that one at the sixteenth pole but easily holding the place. BEARTHESTORM sat in midpack and three wide early, moved into
range between runners on the turn but could only inch up late for the show spot without threatening the top pair. LOWER FOR LONGER (IRE) stalked the
top pair while three wide, loomed outside that pair into the stretch but didn't change leads down the stretch and lost the show spot late. MUSKOKA LADY
was far back early, closed up into midpack on the turn along the rail and continued to willingly put in a run down the lane to get past half the field. IF SIX
WAS NINE sat in midpack outside early, rallied three to four wide on the turn but could not sustain her bid when stalling by the sixteenth pole.
ALTERNATIVE VIEW chased along the inside, hustled by her rider to rally on the turn but that run was done by midstretch. KENTUCKY FAN was steadied
in behind rivals for a long time on the backstretch, came between foes into the turn but could never enter the fray. TOP PRIZE GIRL off the pace and three
wide on the turn, fanned out into the six path turning for home and never a threat. LATER GATOR in midpack early but began to drop back midway on the
turn and called it a day.

HOPING FOR A RING stalked the pace, loomed up three-wide late turn, led upper stretch and held sway under a drive. ROYAL CITY REIGN, in range, was
hustled two and three-wide on the turn then closed gamely through the stretch. MELROSE STAR raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the
turn and finished under a determined drive. RELENTLESS RUBY settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn and chased through the
stretch. NICE COMPANY sprinted to a comfortable lead, set a reserved pace, was passed upper stretch and chased to the end. PAPA'S SILVER raced in
mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. QUIET ASCOT settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn but never reached
contention. SILENT BUT VIOLENT raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. TREASURE QUEST broke
inward, settled in mid pack, chased from the rail to three-wide on the turn but leveled out in the final 16th. HONEY GIRL was steadied at the outset and
settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response. LA BESTIA broke outward and filled the void left by late scratch
LIME SQUASH, settled off the pace, closed four to six-wide on the turn but never reached contention. HOLLYWOOD RING raced off the pace, rode the rail
on the turn but never reached contention. ELFIN FOREST, in mid pack early, dropped back late backstretch, was at the rear late turn and lacked no rally.
