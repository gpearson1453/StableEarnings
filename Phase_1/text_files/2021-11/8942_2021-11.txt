Footnotes
FAMOUS YANKEE set a pressured pace then inched clear in stretch drive and drew off. ZOEY'S HIPPIE pressed the pace from the inside but was no
match in the drive. PAPA JR bobbled at the start then dueled with rival in the second flight and proved pest of the rest. COURTOFGULCH was unhurried
early then made a bid on the turn to pass tiring rival late. YOUNG TUSCAN had and awkward start, veered into the gap going onto the main track then
stalked the pace and weakened. GRAY DANE raced in the middle of the pace while racing three wide and failed to menace. CORN SOUP was fractious in
the gate and had no impact.

Footnotes
FOREVAMO vied for the lead from the three path and inched clear under a drive. TAPALIST raced in the middle of the pack from the inside then angled out
in the stretch and finished stong. LADDIE BOY pressed the pace from the inside and led briefly after a half but was outfinished in the drive. CHAOSMOS set
the pace for a half and weakened. FULL OF RUN was unhurried early and passed tiring rivals. MY CALL was allowed to settle and made a bid on the turn
but came up empty. GIANT INFLUENCE raced near the back early the advanced while racing two wide but failed to sustain the bid. OCTOBER SURPRISE
had a wide trip but was not a factor. TURN ON THE MAGIC tracked the leaders from the two path then steadily faded.

Footnotes
COOL INDIVIDUAL was allowed to settle in the early stages then advanced up the rail on the backstretch angled out in the stretch and had a late kick to
prevail. FROM NOW ON raced in the middle of the pack from the inside then slipped thru on the turn but was outfinished in the drive. ZIPZAPTIME was
rushed to the lead to set an unchallenged lead but had no response in the drive. GETTININTOMISCHIEF stumbled at the start then was rushed to
contention and weakened in the drive. APPLEWOOD tracked the leaders from the four path but raced one paced. CHARMING BULLET chased the leaders
from the three path and failed to menace. TAKEN BACK was bumped at the start and was never a factor. BUCK DYNASTY broke to the outside and
bumped foe then stalked the pace early and retreated.

her best strides late. BOURN dueled for the lead and weakened in the stretch. JULESFORYOU was placed close up in the two path and faded late.
AMERICAN REALITY raced near the back from the two path and improved position late. SISTER SIS stumbled badly at the start then made a middle move
and faltered. IMMACULATE GLORY stalked the pace from the inside and gave way. HEY SISSY was never a factor. LAWLESS TIMES failed to menace.

RUSTY CAGE sprinted clear and was kept to task under steady urging. FREUDIAN SIP tracked the leaders from the two path and made a late three wide
rally. DARE FELIX was placed close up off pace then advanced up the rail and faded in the drive. NATE'S WAY vied for the lead from the two path but was
empty in the drive. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT chased the leaders from the two path but gave an even effort. D'ROCK vied for the lead from the three path, was in
tight and checked going into the turn causing him to lose action. KING COOKIE race one paced and was not a threat. BUCKETS was fractious in the gate
and failed to menace. BETTERCALLJOHN was fractious in the gate and was not a factor.
