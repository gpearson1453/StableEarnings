Footnotes
OUR SWEET GIRL was well placed early to press the pace on the inside, then rated kindly on the turn, eased out two wide to go past the tiring early pace
setter, then shifted back to the inside leaving the quarter pole to make a inside move leaving the turn, drew out in the furlong grounds to prove much the
best under mild right handed crop urging. HARA lunged at the start, then was sent three wide to press the early pace by the half mile marker, made a bid on
the turn to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, but could not sustain that bid while coming back in the final furlong to be clearly second best.
DETERMINED LOVE was well rated early three to four wide, made a four wide move on the turn and loomed boldly by the quarter pole but was empty in the
final furlong. LIL TATER passed the tiring rivals while saving ground. SHATTER ME chased the early pace five wide and weakened. SNOW FORECAST
was fractious in the gate, then broke alertly and set a pressured pace and gave way.

Footnotes
COLONEL MOORHEAD was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, then eased out to make a three wide bid leaving the turn, then slowly edged clear
in the late stages to prove best under a drive. HERE'S WALDO was away alertly to set a fast pace, then was headed nearing the furlong marker, dug in
gamely but outkicked late. MIDNIGHT HAULER broke in a tangle, then was settled early, made a menacing four wide move nearing the quarter pole but
flattened out, bested rest. FIRE'S FINALE stalked the pace three wide and was asked around the five sixteenths marker and then weakened in the drive.
JAYJAYDEE was off slowly, then settled in the back early on the inside, was three wide by the quarter pole but offered no late rally. FOLE'S NOTION
settled early while four wide, came five wide into the drive and tired.

Footnotes
COAST TO COAST was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the turn, drew clear by the furlong marker and then maintained a safe margin late
under mild urging. PETTINBERG chased the early pace in between rivals, swung out seven wide for the drive and rallied well late. SMIRK was allowed to
settle early towards the inside, then improved position but lacked the needed punch in the drive while besting the rest. FIGHTIN PHIL pressed the early
pace three wide and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. PECOS BILL settled early while five wide, then was three wide by
the quarter pole and lacked a rally. TWICEASLUCKY set a pressured pace towards the inside, then was between rivals leaving the turn and weakened.
STONE SCULPTOR failed to menace. LOVE THAT JAZZ chased the early pace four wide and made a five wide bid by the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
DRINK MORE BOURBON was rated early while three to four wide, advanced on the turn and came into the drive four wide, wore down the front runner to
edge clear late under a drive. DREAM OF WARRIOR set the early pace while clear, remained clear past the furlong marker but it was not enough late while
staying on to be clearly second best. METHODTOTHEMADNESS was slow into stride, then advanced on the inside on the turn, then offered a belated rally
on the inside to gain the show award late. DOUBLE KATZ was allowed to settle early and advanced three wide on the turn but lacked the needed stretch
bid. NOTORIOUS REY was reserved early and came six wide into the drive and offered no rally. KATZ ME KNOCKIN lacked a rally. TASTY'S BULLSEYE
chased the early pace five wide and weakened. MR. SHENANIGANS stalked the pace three wide and tired. WAR LANCER showed little.
