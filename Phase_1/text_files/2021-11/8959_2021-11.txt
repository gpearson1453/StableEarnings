Footnotes
ALLURING MEG assumed the lead, set a reserved pace although under pressure, shook clear into the far turn then held sway under a drive. SMARTY
ILLUSION settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, launched a determined stretch drive and was up late for the place. TRANQUIL
SKY settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn, was blocked briefly at the top of the stretch and was bumped then rallied late. SKY OF
DREAMS raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. CHELICHNA stalked the pace, was hustled
two-wide on the far turn, bumped TRANQUIL SKY at the top of the stretch and evened out late. FANCYSOUL stalked four then three-wide on the first turn,
was hustled four-wide through the far turn but tired a furlong out. YOU THRILL ME settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the far turn but never
reached contention. THATNIGHTINTORONTO pressed the pace in hand, dropped back early on the far turn but had no closing response in the stretch.

Footnotes
CORA broke in and bumped a rival at the start and had a brief lead, was allowed to settle in the two path chasing the early leaders, tipped out to three wide
at the quarter pole and came back inside the drifting pace survivor in upper stretch, shifted in herself before taking the lead at the eighth pole, holding the
inconvenienced second place finisher safe down to the wire. BELLASPINA chased the early duelers along the rail and inside the eventual winner, stayed
glued to the fence in upper stretch and was steadied momentarily when the winner shifted in upper stretch, regrouped and was closing in on that one late
but ran out of real estate. SEA FRET sat along the rail in midpack, angled out into the four path on the flank of the eventual winner at the quarter pole,
loomed outside the leaders in the six path at the furlong marker but was outkicked down to the wire. KATY AND EMMA rushed around to press the early
leader, pushed to the front at the quarter pole, drifted out turning for home then shifted in upper stretch, headed at the furlong pole and levelled off the final
sixteenth. LA PRINCESSA POLLY lost her path early along the inside when rivals drifted in, trailed the field on the turn before angling out inside to three
wide at the quarter pole and out in the seven path in upper stretch, closed past a number of foes while widest in the final sixteenth. MS. P'S BELLA was
bumped by a rival at the start, sat three wide in midpack and rallied into the six path at the quarter pole, fell back in upper stretch but re-rallied late between
foes mildly. FOREST VIXEN off the pace early, had two beat on the turn and angled out in upper stretch looking for a seam, got one but her mild rally stalled
in the final furlong. CRUMLIN BIRD was two wide in midpack, came two to five wide at the quarter pole but her mild rally stalled in the final furlong after she
found a seam in upper stretch. SWEET EDITION off the pace early, had one beaten on the turn while three wide, came into the two path in upper stretch but
could not sustain her rally. COSMIC SHOT rushed up to the front and got the rail after a sixteenth of a mile, was pressed and passed by a rival at the
quarter pole and retreated down the lane. THE RIDER OF THE BELLASPINA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER AT THE EIGHTH POLE. THE
CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED. THE OWNER OF LA PRINCESSA POLLY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SEA FRET SHORTLY AFTER THE START.
THIS CLAIM OF FOUL WAS ALSO DISALLOWED.
