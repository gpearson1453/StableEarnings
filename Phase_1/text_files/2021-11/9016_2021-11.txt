SWAN POINT was reserved early, advanced two wide nearing the three eighths marker, then advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out five wide for
the drive, closed well, came in causing DISCREETLY TOUGH to check by the furlong marker, then was corrected with the left handed crop and drew clear
to prove best. GLOWING STAR tracked the early pace and made a bid to take a short lead around the seven sixteenths marker, then dueled for the lead on
the inside on the turn, then proved to be no match for the winner while stating on gamely for the place award. MALDIVES MODEL was allowed to settle
early, made a middle move four wide and dueled for command three wide midway on the far turn, then faded the final furlong while staying on for the show
award. DISCREETLY TOUGH was rated early, eased out and came into the drive four wide while making a bid, had to check by the furlong marker and then
finished willingly. RISQUE'S JEWEL chased the early pace on the inside, then shuffled out to trail entering the far turn and had no rally. COLOR FORCE set
the pace on the inside and was through after a half. The stewards posted an INQUIRY and the jockey on DISCREETLY TOUGH claimed foul against SWAN

Footnotes
KATY THE CAT was well rated early on the inside, eased out leaving the quarter pole to make a four wide bid leaving the turn, hit the front nearing the
furlong
marker,
then
edged
clear
by
the
sixteenth
pole
and
then
held
MITTENSANDMUKLUKS
safe
late
to
prove
best
under
a
drive.
MITTENSANDMUKLUKS was reserved early on the inside, angled out while advancing in the stretch, closed well despite being on left lead to the sixteenths
pole, then switched over to the right lead and was too late. MISS MORENO was four wide into the first turn, then prompted the pace and made a three wide
bid to take over on the turn and was clear by the quarter pole, but it proved to be not enough while staying on to best the rest. SWITCHRATTLENROLL
lacked a rally. QUEEN'S DREAM set the pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and weakened. FAVORITE DOLL tracked the pace three wide,
came five wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
GOOGLE IT was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the inside on the turn, eased off the inside by the five sixteenths, then made a three
wide bid leaving the turn, then brushed when the pace setter came out, drew clear to prove best under a drive. LOXODROME set an unchallenged pace,
then came out leaving the turn and brushed the winner, proved to be no match for that rival while stating on to be second best. LONG TOM was reserved
early on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive and offered a late rally. READY REWARD stalked the pace two to three wide, was between rivals
leaving the quarter pole and weakened. BOCK was rated along three wide early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and offered no rally. VISHNU was
allowed to settle early and lacked a rally. STORM ALFEET had no response. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, LONG

Footnotes
BESS was rated along in the five path down the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly, then slowly wore down the front runner late
to prove best under a drive. MINDING MILLIE stalked the early pace and then vied for the lead between rivals and three wide on the backstretch, then
gained a short advantage on the turn three wide and leaving the turn, came in twice through the lane under right handed crop urging putting
NINETYPERCENTBRYNN in tight, then was caught in deep stretch by the winner. NINETYPERCENTBRYNN was well placed on the inside, then shifted
out to the two path on the turn to go by the tiring early pace setter, then made a inside bid leaving the turn, but was put in tight by the three sixteenths, then
was put in tight again by the furlong marker and had to check, lost all chance, bested rest. OFF TOPIC chased the pace from between horses and three
wide, but lacked the needed stretch bid, while racing evenly. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and offered
no significant rally. LOVELY LYDIA stalked the early pace and then went up to vie for command four wide and weakened. BONITA LASSIE set the early
pace and then vied for the lead on the inside then stopped. The jockey on NINETYPERCENTBRYNN claimed foul against the rider on MINDING MILLIE for
interference in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the stewards disqualified MINDING MILLIE from second and placed her third for interference around
the eighth pole.

Footnotes
KAYLASAURUS was settled early, then made a four wide move by the quarter pole, continued that bid and closed well in the stretch, drew clear the final
sixteenth to prove best going away. FLATTERING RUBY set a pressured pace early in the three path, then dueled for a bit on the turn, then shook clear
leaving the five sixteenths, remained clear by the furlong marker, but was headed nearing the sixteenth pole and could not go with the winner, second best.
TARA'S TALENT chased the early pace two wide, swung out four wide for the drive and was up late for the show award. S W BRIAR ROSE pressed the
early pace four wide, steadied by the nine sixteenths, then faded losing the show award late. BACI pressed the pace inside then dueled for the lead on the
inside and weakened. MS TEEK steadied shortly after the start, then was no threat. AVA O stalked the pace five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
WONDER IN set the early pace while racing removed from the rail, drew clear leaving the turn, then widened the margin while being ridden out.
BLUEGRASS POSSE was reserved early, advanced on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, rallied well late to gain the place award. COAST
TO COAST was well placed early while in the two path, then eased out and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, but flattened out the final furlong,
lost place award late. START CASHIN was allowed to settle early, then was five wide by the quarter pole, swung out seven wide for the drive and had no
rally. THURMAN MERMAN prompted the winner four wide early, came five wide into the drive and was empty. CHIEF EXCHANGER had no response on
the inside.
