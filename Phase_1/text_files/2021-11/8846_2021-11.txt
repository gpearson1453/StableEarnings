RINGGOOD Close up in hand along the rail, eased out into the lane, gained, challenged and bested NUTSIE for the score. NUTSIE Away best, showed the
way along the two path around the turns, remained clear and then was caught late. BEACH FRONT Tracked along the three path, four wide into the last
bend, three path out of it, lodged a bid outside and hung. VON ALDENBRUCK Unhurried along the two path, took the rail on the final bend, angled out and
weakened. STORM ALFEET Unhurried two path on the turns and tired. HONOR THY SECRET Broke slow, checked after that, saved ground on the turns
and tired.
