Footnotes
MELTDOWN raced on a clear pace while near the rail, extended into the lane while in hand, remained in reserve until inside the eighth pole then offered
intermittent urging to last. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY was unhurried while in the three path into the far turn, came three wide in late turn into the lane, was in
the four path with an eighth to go and rallied to the wire, missed and settled for second best. FIFTYFIVE STRONG tracked the pace from along the inside
into the lane then lacked the needed response. BEAUMONT BEAUX saved ground into the lane then lacked a bid. MR. SARCASTIC in the four path near
the quarter pole, came into the lane from the six path and never was a factor. PRINCESS LENNY raced in contending position through the turn and into the
lane and was empty. STONECASTLE was outrun while in the three path through the turns.

after the winner when straightened and was slowly gaining to the end while settling for second best. ARTEGON was brushed from both sides early, vied for
the lead while two wide through the turn, dropped to the inside into the lane and yielded to the top two. WARRIOR'S REMARK was in the two path through
the turn when trailing, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a threat. NOT AGAIN JACKIE raced in the four path through the turn and
never factored. CUSTERS LAST STAND never menaced while saving ground. BRAVO EXPRESS vied for the lead along the inside through mid-turn then

Footnotes
BODOCK chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the two or three path, dueled with the leader inside the eighth pole and
edged up late. ROOSTER RUN set the pace along the inside into the lane, was joined by the winner outside the eighth pole, dueled with that one until late,
gave ground and settled for second best. GO EMI hit the gate and trailed early, raced into the turn from the four path, continued well off the inside through
late turn, was in the five path into the lane and finished with good energy. STREET SAVOY pressed then chased the pace from the two path through the
turn then weakened. SEE SPOT RUN tracked the pace along the inside through the turn then faded through the final eighth. GOLD SMOKE settled back
into the turn, raced in the three path and was never a factor. MUNDO MIX raced in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the three
path, was urged right-handed near the eighth pole, lugged in sharply to the rail, steadied and was done.

OXBOW'S IMAGE stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, vied outside in the stretch and was clear at the wire under mild urging.
TIZWAY FOREVER was clear early inside, then couldn't hold off the winner. PRINCESS CONSUELA was unrushed while racing five wide, then rallied
belatedly. JUSTA DOLL pressed the pace in the two path, then yielded late. AMERICA RULES stalked the pace inside but had no late bid. SWEET SKY
raced evenly in the three path. ZIGGY'S STORM stalked the pace in the two path, then gave way in the stretch. SPRING WAGER and EQUALLY EVEN
were not factors. ROSY GLOW stalked the pace for a half mile before fading.
