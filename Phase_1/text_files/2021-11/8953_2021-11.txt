Footnotes
ENVOUTANTE dueled early on from the inside, was in the two path into the lane, lost the lead for a short time but reclaimed it with authority and shot away
down the lane while geared down in the final stages. BONNY SOUTH was unhurried early on, began to rally along the far turn, was in the four path into the
lane, made a bid in the upper stretch but was no match for the winner the rest of the way. AUDREY'S TIME raced in the three path along the first turn,
tracked the early pace setters, made a three wide bid nearing the lane, took over and led briefly but was quickly overtaken and caved in the final stages.
ARMY WIFE dueled early on whole two wide, was in the three path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. HIGH REGARD trailed the field early on,
was in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. CRYSTAL BALL raced in the two path along the first turn, chased the pace early on,
was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane.
