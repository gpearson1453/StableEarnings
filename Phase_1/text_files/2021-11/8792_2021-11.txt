Footnotes
HOPE I CAN Well placed along the three path to the top of the lane, responded when asked, gained, collared the leader late and edged clear. FAST FRAN
Set the pace along the rail, remained clear a furlong out, was caught and finished clearly best of the rest. MS PENELOPEPITSTOP Tracked along the two
path, lodged a bid into the lane and weakened. MODERN STEEL Lagged back, took the rail into the turn, three path out of it, angled wide and failed to
threaten. TRACI'S GIRL Two path on the turn and weakened. TOP HAT INVASION Saved ground and tired.
