Footnotes
CONQUER THE WORLD brushed at the start by ACTION JACKSON, chased three wide from near the rear early on, advanced down the backstretch and
continued three wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command a sixteenth out and
edged clear to the finish kept to task. NORTH CAROLINA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside widening away through the far
turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat and was caught a sixteenth out while clear for the place honors. PLEASE THE
PHAROAH chased just off the inside, came under coaxing three to four wide at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to secure the show honors. SUMMER SILENCE broke out at the start bumping ACTION JACKSON into CONQUER THE WORLD, chased along
the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish.
CONGLOMERATE chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and weakened. BALTHUS (IRE) chased two then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. ACTION
JACKSON got bumped at the start by SUMMER SILENCE and in turn brushed CONQUER THE WORLD, raced three wide through the first turn and chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. CONNAGH'S QUAY coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. ESOR tracked the pace along the inside in closest aim of the leader, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. Please note the splits were omitted pending review and the final
time was hand timed.

Footnotes
OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT was reserved early on the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, was boxed by the quarter pole, angled out five wide leaving
the turn for racing room, closed well to duel for command by the sixteenth pole, then got up late to prevail under a drive. YOUR MISSION hesitated and was
bumped at the start, settled back early, made a four wide move on the turn, then dueled for command by the sixteenth pole and was outfinished to just miss.
CURLIN'S WISDOM set the pace from the inside, then remained in front by the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly late. HARD TRAVELER was well
placed throughout on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn to loom boldly by the furlong marker then was taken hold off inside the sixteenth pole when
CURLIN'S WISDOM came in slightly, flattened out. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE was reserved early towards the inside, angled out near the furlong marker,
then offered a belated rally. THE BIG SALAD was reserved early, came six wide into the drive and passed the tiring rivals. WICKED BOBBY chased the
pace from between rivals and weakened. BARREL OF QUESTS stalked the pace three wide and weakened. CAGNEY chased the pace four wide and tired.
DEPTFORD DANCER lacked a rally. POLKA PRINCE was reserved early, then was six wide on the backstretch and was not a threat. VIBE SETTER
prompted the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
KAZ'S BEACH chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining to
take narrow command seventy yards from home and prevailed on the wire kept to task. THORNY TALE bumped at the start by DURKIN'S CALL, who broke
inwards, ranged up to duel inside of PRINCE OF PHAROAHS, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive displaced from the front, came again inside the final sixteenth to secure the place honors. DURKIN'S CALL broke in at the start bumping THORNY
TALE, saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and offered up late foot to
procure the show honors. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS led early on before being displaced narrowly from command by THRONY TALE, dueled to the outside
of that rival in the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, took over command straightened away, dug in
under threat and was caught inside the sixteenth marker backing away in the very late stages. MICROSCOPE brushed the near side stall at the start,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD
chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. NICKY THE VEST broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TROUBLESHOOTER chased three wide growing detached at the tail of the field down the
backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

the backstretch, made a bid between rivals leaving the quarter pole, took over by the three sixteenths, then led by the furlong marker but it was not enough
late, held show award. SUPER WICKED CHARM was reserved early, came eight wide into the stretch and closed well. HALPERT was allowed to settle
early, then was on the inside by the quarter pole made a bid to loom boldly by the furlong marker but hung late. BAR FOURTEEN vied for the early lead

solid rally. WESTERN ADVANTAGE failed to respond. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace five wide down the

Footnotes
SARATOGA BEAUTY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid in hand, then drew clear leaving the turn, then was given two left handed pops in
the furlong grounds while drawing off to prove much the best. ANNIKA GOLD was reserved early, then advanced on the turn and was three wide by the
quarter pole, shifted out five wide by the three sixteenth and rallied well for the place. AWESOME INDRA set a pressured pace on the inside, then was
headed nearing the quarter pole, could not go with the winner and lost the place award late, bested rest. STARSHIP REINA was rated along the inside and
weakened. COVER PHOTO was allowed to settle early and raced three to four wide on the turn and weakened. GENTLE ANNIE lost footing at the start,
then raced five wide and had no response.

Footnotes
DANCING BUCK dueled inside of VALMONT from the get go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under
threat through the length of the drive being directed out late to look PHANTOM SMOKE in the eye and gamely held on to prevail. PHANTOM SMOKE
chased along the inside remaining patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped to the three path with
three-sixteenths to go and rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong to just miss at the end. SWASHBUCKLE coaxed from the gate, chased along
the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. VALMONT dueled from the two path with
DANCING BUCK to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
weakened in the late stages. SHIRAZ chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the
late going. OUTRAGEOUS BET coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. STEELERSFANFORLIFE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. ON THE COUCH bumped at the start by GANDY DANCING, chased five wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn,
went three to four wide for home and made no impact. GANDY DANCING broke in at the start bumping ON THE COUCH, chased three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired.

VISION BOARD coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing on the leader in
tandem with JUGGLER, took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch and inched away under a drive kept to task. JUGGLER coaxed from the
gate, raced three then two wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to
secure the place honors. WORKINGMAN'S DUDE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
kicked on belatedly for the show honors. BOINTHEBACK hustled from the gate, raced four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on for the last major share. KONG LOVES A FIGHT
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. COOL GIANT six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
improved position. EL VEINTICUATRO broke in at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. ALMOND CIDER five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. PHOEBE'S FROSTY chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired.
SENSIBLECONCLUSION coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and tired. HEADS OR TAILS chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and
tired. PURSUIT OF JUSTICE coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand from the two path, tucked inside into the turn coming under pressure from a
