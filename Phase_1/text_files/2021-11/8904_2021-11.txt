Footnotes
FOR EVER OURS tracked the pace, angled around a tiring rival through the turn, angled back in and came through inside, then made a steady gain and
edged up in the final strides. RAIN OF BLESSING stalked the pace, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, holding off SENORITA SALSA,
continued with a short advantage over that one and was outfinished in the final strides. SENORITA SALSA well placed and outside, gained a striking
position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then flattened late and held the show. STREAKING GREY well placed and between,
gained position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. DRIVING WIND allowed to settle, moved up three
and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW allowed to settle, improved position.
SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring. DRILLZILLA
was no factor, inside. SANGFROID set the pace inside and faded through the turn.

gaining position, angled out in the stretch and faded. MARICOPA improved position, widest. V K PRINCESS broke sharply on the inside, dropped back
quickly and continued to loose ground. DE PURA SANGRE mid pack, faded three wide through the turn.

wide and held position through the turn, then weakened late. MOUNT SINAI steadied early, moved up four wide through the turn and ran evenly in the
stretch. ADIOS CHICAS pushed in and forced to steadied early, improved position. SOCIAL ELIZABETH allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path

Footnotes
ASTROTURF allowed to settle, angled out while moving up through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear
late. CONGRATS AGAIN four wide through the first turn, was well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path
into the lane, gained a short lead late and was no match for the winner. EL PECADO broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear, stayed on when
challenged through the second turn, inherited the lead in the stretch, then weakened late and held show. MIGHTY TOUGH rated pulling between rivals,
gained position two and three wide through the second turn, then ran evenly in the stretch. SPORTINI tracked the pace, held position and was blocked into
the stretch, came through, then angled out and flattened out. HONESTO ran evenly, inside. KANITHAPPEN well placed and between, faded through the
second turn. MUTARAAFEQ steadied shortly after the start, and passed a tiring rival. PANENKA pulled to position in the early going, bid outside the leader
three wide and gained a short lead into the stretch, then faded. BRIAN'S MISSION was rank and steadied approaching the first turn, and made no impact..
