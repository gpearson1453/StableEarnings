Footnotes
SUSANS NOVELA tracked inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside gaining a short lead and held under steady
pressure. LA BOKAINA well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late
kick. Z FIRST rated back early inside, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. OUR HUMBLE
HEART mid pack and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. MIAMI SOUVENIRS
allowed to settle, angled four wide through the turn, angled widest in the stretch and improved position. LINN PIER allowed to settle, moved up three and
four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. FORGE AHEAD broke in at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, inherited
the lead from that one through the turn, then faded in the stretch. CUPID AUSTIN pushed in at the start, moved up on the two path through the turn, came
through on that path and had no rally. GRAN MAMIBELLA broke in at the start, pushing a rival in, moved up quickly, gained position on the two path through
the turn, came through on that path and faded. INTERESTING GEM well placed and inside, steadily lost ground. ALBA MIA broke slowly from the gate and
was no factor. FOXY AUSTIN set the pace inside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
MISS BETH'EL mid pack and inside, angled out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off inside the furlong
marker. TITANIC ROSE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out late for racing room and
could not gain. SHE IS ROYALTY allowed to settle, inside, angled three wide through the turn, came into the stretch and on that path, drifted in and edged
up for the show. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then weakened late and held a share.
ONLY GIRL mid pack between, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. DOLCISIMA ran
evenly, outside. LA CUMPARSITA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and faded. STARE IF YOU MUST allowed to
settle, moved up three wide through the turn and had no stretch rally. OUR ELECTRA GUITAR well placed and between, faded on the two path through the
turn. ENOUGH RAIN was never involved. PURE AMBITION lost contact with the field, was eased and walked off. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE

GIROLAMO'S ATTACK set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, and shook clear late while drifting out. FEARLESS tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turn, angled out three wide to bid outside the leader into the stretch, drifted out and was clearly best of the rest. EYE OF A JEDI
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and closed for the show. WITH VERVE steadied slightly midway up the backstretch,
gained position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. COWBOY DIPLOMACY broke sharply and led before the
first call, was rated nicely outside and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
ON JET HEIR broke sharply from the gate and led early, stalked to the turn, edged ahead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch and drew off under
brisk handling. CRAFTY CRUSADER well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, evened
and held the place, then was vanned off. SUMMER FIVE broke in, pushing a rival in at the start, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into
the stretch and had a mild late gain, missed the place. DAVID'S CUPID exchanged bumps and was pushed in at the start, looped four wide through the turn,
came into the stretch on that path and had a mild gain. GREAT JUNIOR broke sharply from the gate, dropped back quickly, saved ground on the two path
through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. DARA'S BOY broke in and was pushed in at the start, moved up quickly to set the
pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. DANLEY broke out, exchanged bumps at the start, was pushed in,
losing a path, looped four wide through the turn, then angled widest in the stretch and passed tiring rivals. LOZANO well placed and three wide, faded
through the turn. TESTED METTLE well placed, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path and faded in the stretch.
TIME OF PEACE bumped with DANLEY at the break, steadied soon after, and was outrun. AREVALO was no factor.

Footnotes
PLAYERA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, made a steady gain shifting to the two-path, angled back to the rail past the furlong marker and
drove clear. DEM A WONDER tracked the pace well back, moved up to position through the turn, angled out three wide into the stretch and closed for the
place. BATTLE CRY well placed and outside, lost ground three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and had a mild gain. FREAK bumped
with TIZ ENOUGH at the start, was well placed and between, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran
evenly. CAFFEINE RUSH broke sharply from the gate to stalk the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, lost some ground into the stretch,
then came again, was blocked, bumped and faded. FRU FRU ZAN sprinted up to set the pace inside, shook clear into the stretch, the weakened late and
faded. TIZ ENOUGH bumped with FREAK at the start, and was never involved. LUANN dropped back quick and was no factor.

Footnotes
FROSTED ARMOUR well placed and outside, looped two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew
off late. LIVING WATER broke sharp from the gate to set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, shook clear in the lane, then was no match for the
winner. PACO'S PICO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well for the show. FIRST
TEAM veered in at the start impeding rivals, was mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and edged up for a
share. AWESOME CRUSADER well placed and inside, angled out and moved up into the turn, held position on the two path through the turn, lost some
ground into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. FROLIC MAN was forced in at the start, moved up inside and had no stretch rally. LAURI'S WISH
ran evenly for a half and faded three wide. I'M OVER U was impeded at the start, and showed little. PEMBERTON allowed to settle, had a four and five wide
mild middle move and was empty. MAILBOX MONEY had a wide trip and was no factor.

Footnotes
MR RUM RUNNER vied for the early lead on the outside, gained a short lead through the turn, lost that advantage into the stretch, came again, dueled with
URANIUM, edged ahead of that one and held. URANIUM well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the stretch, gained a short lead, then dueled with the winner and lacked the needed late kick. DOMINICAN ICE set a pressured pace on the inside,
stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened late and held the show. POSEIDON'S SON allowed to settle, looped three and four wide
through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and got up for a share. COMPLETE AGENDA was reluctant to load, allowed to settle, looped three and four
wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. LABAN M MO allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came
through on that path into the stretch and had no rally. GLORY AND VICTORY steadied at the start, tracked the pace and faded into the stretch. PATH TO
SUCCESS moved up quickly off the rail, lost the path inside, steadied along on heels into the turn, then faded. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM was no factor,
inside.
