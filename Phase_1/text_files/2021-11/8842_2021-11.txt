Footnotes
MAGICALCHIC vied for the lead three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, continued two wide past the three sixteenths, shook clear in upper
stretch, and held sway in deep stretch. SOME ROYALTY away well and chose not to contest the pace and settled into a nice tracking position along the rail,
entered turn along the inside, angled two wide on the turn and had to angle three wide when inside rival began to lug out, took aim four wide at the top of
the stretch, and rallied up for second. LAKER JET stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, advanced quickly on the turn and had to
steady off heels at the three sixteenths, angled five wide into the stretch and rallied to get up for third. TIGER MOM vied in between rivals in a contested
pace on the backstretch, continued to duel in between on the turn, earned the rail late on the turn and in range entering the stretch, kept on well until late in
the lane where she finally faltered and passed by a pair of closers. CHARMING ALEXIS tracked trio of leaders well of the rail on the backstretch, entered
turn three wide, launched bid four wide and outkicked in the lane under steady urging. VIDALIA stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued
along the inside on the turn, launched a brief bid in upper stretch and flattened out past the sixteenth. SWEET HONOR vied inside of two rivals in a
contested pace on the backstretch, continued to vie for lead along the rail on the turn, shuffled approaching the three sixteenths and had to steady which
caused her to lug out and all but eliminated and chance for a good placing, token ride to the finish.
