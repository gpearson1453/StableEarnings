Footnotes
NOT THAT SERIOUS set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pressing DOX BIZ around the turn while well in hand, drew away from that rival
when let out passing the quarter pole, widened under mild urging through midstretch, and was geared down late. MADELYNS HEAT appeared to be put in
tight quarters between horses at the start, lied off of the pace three wide, rallied turning for home to gain place passing the three sixteenths pole with many
lengths to find on the leader, and was cutting into that foe's margin through the final stages, but was only second best. KISSALOT chased the leading pair
from the two path around the turn, bid for place between horses in upper stretch as MADELYNS HEAT rallied along side, but was outkicked for that position
passing the furlong pole, then kept on to secure show. NASHCHETTA broke a step slowly, lied off of the pace two wide, then passed tired foes without
producing a bid. DOX BIZ pressed the eventual winner two wide into and around the turn, chased that foe entering the lane while failing to keep pace, then
further weakened passing the quarter pole. BLACKSMITH STRONG pressed the pace three wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole, drifted out to the
six path entering the lane, and was done early.

Footnotes
JAZZY LADY trailed the field while relaxing well off of the fast pace, gained in the five path around the turn, took aim on the leading pair entering the lane,
ranged up to bid at the furlong pole, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. QUEEN LOUISE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, dueled outside
of ESPECIALLY YOU around the turn after her outer counterpart gave way, forged an advantage from that foe at the three sixteenths pole as JAZZY LADY
loomed large, fought on after being headed at the furlong grounds, but was bested a sixteenth from home. CELESTIAL SPIN bobbled a bit at the start
without consequence, settled off of the embattled trio, gained in the four path around the turn while inside of JAZZY LADY, but was outkicked by that foe in
upper stretch, then kept on to reach a tiring foe for show on the wire. ESPECIALLY YOU dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but yielded in upper
stretch. SEVEN KINGDOMS dueled three wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
COUSTEAU minorly bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in hand from a pressing SPRINKLEHEAD around the turn, met CHARGER's bid
entering the lane, but swiftly repelled that rival when set down passing the quarter pole, and willingly drew off under driving pressure. CHARGER stalked
three wide, bid turning for home outside of a well-traveling COUSTEAU, but failed to match strides with that rival in upper stretch, and kept on to prove
second best. CENTURION lied off of the pace four wide, and stayed on mildly to prevail over an inner foe for show. RIVER REDEMPTION trailed, came into
the lane three wide, stayed on inside of CENTURION to vie for show, but was outfinished by that foe late. POLSAR bumped with an outer foe at the start,
tracked along the inside, came under coaxing leaving the three furlong pole, saved ground before slipping inside of a tiring SPRINKLEHEAD in upper
stretch, and failed to make an impact. SPRINKLEHEAD bobbled at the start, pressed the eventual winner from the outside, but weakened passing the five
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
EARLY WAGER set the pace, inched clear down the backstretch, maintained a loose advantage around the far turn, then drew off under driving pressure in
upper stretch before being put to a comfortable hand ride in the final furlong. DOVER STRAIT stalked along the inside, gained place at the three furlong
pole while tipping outside of the loose leader, but only managed to chase that foe thereafter, and was second best. REBOPPER stalked two wide, got
outmoved for place by an inner foe around the far turn, chased turning for home, and faded in upper stretch. DECEIVER lied off of the pace in the two path,
and never got involved. COOL RUNNINGS staggered a step at the start and broke slowly, shifted out and tugged forward while well in the bit, pulled three
wide to a tracking position around the first turn, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S CLARA set the pace inside of a pressing NOVEMBER ROSE, stayed a path off of the inner railing around the turn, drew off when roused passing
the quarter pole, and widened under driving pressure. EPICUREAN was unable to achieve forward positioning before checking inside of a inwardly-shifting
THE GIRLS passing the eleven sixteenths pole, tugged in the bit while off of the pace into the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and sustained a rally
outside of foes to claim place at the sixteenth pole, and cut the margin on the winner in the late stages. NOVEMBER ROSE broke inwardly, bumped and
pinched a rival in the process, pressed the pace setter from the outside while kept in the three path around the turn by that rival, but failed to keep pace with
that foe in upper stretch, then lost place to an outer foe at the sixteenth pole. MOONCHILD was bumped by an outer foe before being pinched back in tight
quarters at the start, lied off of the pace, gained three wide around the turn, but flattened out before contending. VILLAREGGIA trailed around the turn, and
never got involved. MAPLELINE broke outwardly and pinched a rival at the start, chased the leader two wide, but faded turning for home. THE GIRLS
chased along the inside around the turn, then faded.

Footnotes
CANDY TYCOON prompted the pace three wide, dueled outside of EBBEN around the turn while kept in the three path by that rival, disposed of that foe
entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch with RAM in pursuit, but safely held sway through the final furlong. RAM trailed down the backstretch, gained
three wide around the turn, split foes turning for home while tipping four wide, sustained his rally to reach place and take aim on the clear leader
approaching the furlong pole, but was kept at bay by that foe thereafter, and proved second best. EBBEN dueled for the lead two wide and between horses
leaving the chute, then only inside of CANDY TYCOON while staying in the two path around the turn, but gave way to that foe entering the lane, then held
show from SHORTLIST through the final furlong. SHORTLIST tracked along the inside, shifted two wide into the turn to intently stalk the leading pair,
ranged up three wide turning for home, but flattened out and failed to keep pace in upper stretch, chased EBBEN through the final furlong in pursuit of show,
but hung and failed to reach that position. VULCAN dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but yielded to them into the turn, chased around the bend,
but faded through the lane. SERMONONTHEMOUNT never got involved. COLONEL BOWMAN lied off of the pace four wide, got floated five wide entering
the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
SARAH HARPER pressed the pace three to two wide into the turn, bid entering the lane, was a bit awkward to change leads in upper stretch, but swiftly
took over after doing so under very light urging, and was ridden out to the wire. CODE NAME KATE broke a bit outwardly and brushed a rival at the start,
tracked from midpack, gained three to four wide around the turn to bid for place in upper stretch after the leader assumed command, and proved second
best. FIRE ON TIME broke in and mildly forced inner rivals inwardly, vied inside of BEFORE YOU early on, but checked when uncomfortable inside of that
rival into the turn, faltered to a chasing position, sustained the chase while shifting two to three wide turning for home, bid for place in upper stretch inside of
CODE NAME KATE, but was outkicked by that foe, then kept on for a minor share. BEFORE YOU showed the way outside of FIRE ON TIME, cleared that
foe into the turn, but was headed by SARAH HARPER entering the lane, quickly proved no match passing the quarter pole, and gave way on her left lead.
SUPER WONDER GIRL lied far off of the pace two wide and between horses, then stayed on through the lane without threatening. TOUCH OF CLASS
stalked four wide, but faded after getting floated five wide turning for home. FLASH MAGIC took the turn while well of the pace in the five to four paths,
shifted six wide entering the lane, and lacked a rally. MY SWEET KAT settled far off of the pace three wide, and never got involved. LIVE IT UP saved
ground off of the pace, and faded. LATTE DOLCE trailed, came into the lane four wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SUPER QUICK established a clear margin around the first turn, maintained that loose advantage from chasing foes while well in hand around the far turn,
then responded willingly when let out a notch in upper stretch, readily drew off, and was ridden out under light hand urging. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) trailed
into the far turn, picked up stride four wide around that bend, took aim on WILLFUL WOMAN for place in upper stretch, then surpassed that foe at the
sixteenth pole, and secured place while not threatening the winner. WILLFUL WOMAN stalked along the inside, tipped three wide into the far turn to chase
the clear leader, but failed to keep pace with that foe while claiming place passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked for that position a sixteenth from
home. TOWN AVENGER lied off of the pace two wide, came into the lane three wide, then stayed on mildly for a very minor share while not threatening the
leaders, then greenly lugged inwards after flopping back to her left lead in the final sixteenth. WINNING ROMANCE saved ground off of the pace, shifted
two wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. COPPELIA stalked two wide without pressing the clear leader, chased that foe while under urging around the
far turn, then weakened entering the lane. SHESA MYSTERY lied off of the pace three wide, but weakened into the far turn, was done early, then eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT PATRIOT stalked three wide, bid entering the lane, assumed command at the three sixteenths pole, drew off, and held sway while hanging on
his left lead. THIRSTY BETRAYAL tracked from the three path around the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, stayed on to claim place approaching
midstretch, and was second best. SKYSCANNER trailed around the turn, split foes three wide entering the lane, and rallied well to reach show approaching
the wire. DON'T FORGET was hustled early on to vie inside of MALPAIS, but failed to keep pace with that foe into the turn, chased thereafter, shifted three
wide in upper stretch, and kept on. MALPAIS bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace two wide, cleared into the turn, but was overhauled passing
the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. VOLUBILE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. NIETZSCHE was bumped at the start and failed to factor.
DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER broke a step slowly at the start and never got involved. SUBDUED broke a step slowly and got outrun. ARTIE'S LADY was never
involved. CAPTURE THE GLORY tracked along the inside, and faded through the lane.
