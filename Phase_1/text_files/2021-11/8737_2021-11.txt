Footnotes
YANKEE DOODLE BOY was settled towards the back early, then moved up on the second lap and took command down the hill to launch his winning bid,
drawing clear in the stretch. DON'T SHOUT (IRE) stalked the pace in 2nd position, but never kicked on to do more. EMBRACE THE GRIND was the front
runner making all the pace uncontested, traveled well, then tired in the final stages to be third. SHAKA settled mid-pack always close, made his move which
was not enough to make any impact on leaders. ARGENTIC (FR) struggled to be in a position closer to pace, was hard ridden in the final furlongs to
achieve little. BE SOMEBODY was never in contention.

to close. WIND RIDGE never made a competitive impression throughout. JACKSON S struggled to keep near the pace and was distanced. SWIM was
pulled up two fences out. BRAVE DEACON was pulled up two fences out. MR. HAIRE pulled up after one lap.

Footnotes
IRANISTAN went from being the back-marker to first place with confident handling, winning decisively. AMSCHEL (GB) was ridden just off the pace, always
in contention and gained late ground in the stretch but not enough. PRESENCE OF MIND (IRE) made a nice showing early on and didn't have the energy to
finish up as strong as he started. BRIANBAKESCOOKIES never really in contention and required urging to keep to task a few fences from home.
REDICEAN (GB) made a bid on the backside and was with the front runners, soon faded. CHOSEN MATE (IRE) took an awkward step after jumping on the
first lap, never got back into the race and eventually pulled up.
