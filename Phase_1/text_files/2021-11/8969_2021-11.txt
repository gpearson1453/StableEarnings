Footnotes
PRINCESS HALO set a pressured pace off the rail, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and held on under steady stretch handling. I SHALLBE
RELEASED chased through the backstretch and raced at the rail on the turn, altered course from the heels of Princess Halo mid-stretch and dug in to take
the nod from TENNIS TAP, who engaged in close chase and contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn, dug in gamely
to the finish, though, missed the nod for second under the wire. TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL broke in the air then angled to the outside to give chase, contested
at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn then flattened the final furlong. MY SISTER PAM became fractious in the gate
then chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. IHEARTRAINACOMN gave chase outside then flattened
in the four path of the turn. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
ALLEN CAN DO IT raced with the early pace inside then dropped back leaving the first turn, picked up the chase from the five sixteenths pole and took the
nod two deep approaching the top of the lane, gave up the lead when he drifted leaving the turn, but dug in to recover the advantage mid-stretch and inched
clear late yards. FREEDOM RIDER was bumped off stride leaving the gate then settled off the pace toward the inside, eased out into the backstretch and
bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in through the lane to take second under the wire. RIVER WARRIOR RVF raced
with the pace through the front stretch then took the lead and drew clear into the backstretch, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole, was caught at
the rail approaching the head of the lane, recovered the edge when Allen Can Do It drifted outward, but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. BRIGHT DAWN
saved ground well off the early pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, then finished evenly to pass rivals
widest. MINISTRY OF MAGIC rounded the first turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, continued in the four path of the far turn but flattened the final furlong. REATA'S CASTLE broke awkwardly and made contact with Freedom Rider,
settled off the rail on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. REMYS SHOWTIME stalked from the two and three paths, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GRANT took quick control and rated a slim lead inside, was met by Jamestown Road leaving the second turn and shrugged that one off through
the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled through the lane. SONG OF HONOR stalked inside, picked up the chase into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail and was gaining mildly in an even finish. ANNA ROCKS settled just off the pace about the three path, gave
chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path then dueled through the stretch for third. AWESOME ALANA was jostled and steadied a
bit leaving the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
TAYLER'S CHROME lunged and made contact with Awesome Alana at the break then settled off the rail, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole, though, flattened in the six path of the far turn. C V'S POWERPAK settled back about the three path and raced outside into the
backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the seven path and showed little more. JAMESTOWN ROAD broke
outward to make contact with Awesome Alana then stalked the early pace, moved to even terms into the backstretch and gave close chase from the half
mile pole, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded toward the head of the lane. SMOKIN CARAQUENA saved ground.

Footnotes
ISHIHARA rated a short lead inside, was met by MARTIN MAN at the seven sixteenths pole, kept that one at bay through the backstretch, edge clear at the
rail past the quarter pole then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. The latter stalked then challenged at the seven sixteenths pole, raced
close two deep on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. IRISH MEADOW settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted toward the head of the lane and finished evenly while gaining on the top two. CURLEE FOX settled
off the pace and off the rail, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, lugged inward past the
eighth pole and finished evenly. NORTHERN RIDGE rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail,
checked at the inside flank of Curlee Fox past the eighth pole and flattened stride. SPUNMAN settled off the pace in the three and four paths and raced
outside into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path, was carried out a bit into the lane and
showed little more. HIGH PRINT steadied early then saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. RIGHTEOUS MAN was shuffled
back early, settled off the rail and showed little response. MOONLIT NIGHT rounded the turns about the four path and never factored. STEP OUT
DANCING rounded the first turn about the five path and was not a factor while racing mostly wide. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Curlee Fox for interference past the eighth pole, lodged by the rider of Northern Ridge, and disqualified the former to fifth place as a result.

Footnotes
QUICK ENTRY rated close inside then challenged two deep nearing the three eighths pole, drew to even terms midway on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to inch clear of BRIAN'S AVENUE, who was hustled at the rail to maintain position then rated the pace into the first turn, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole, was met midway on the far turn and dueled gamely close to deep stretch before relenting. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR saved
ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. FEATURE ACT rounded the first
turn about the three path, raced outside into the backstretch and started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the six path
and finished evenly to pass rivals. SHAMCAT saved ground leaving the five eighths pole and settled off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little further. UNION GRACE was hustled along through the front stretch then
stalked from the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. PADRINO'S HEART
came away in the air then saved ground. SKY GAZER R V F was hustled two deep through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.
