Footnotes
ALMUAHED bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, was bumped again by that rival in the opening strides, settled at the back of the pack
while saving ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch and was flying in the final furlong to pull clear near the wire. RUSSIAN TANK saved ground
around the early, continued to show the way, well clear of the field, while racing up the backstretch, opened up by ten lengths while saving ground around
the far turn, led most of the way down the lane and was caught in the final strides. DRIVEN ONE raced in the two and three path around the first turn,
tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and gained ground steadily to
the wire. ANGEL'S MAGIC swerved in and bumped with the horse to his inside in the opening stages, recovered to race in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground in late stretch while never threatening
the top three. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH swerved in and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, was bumped again by ANGEL'S MAGIC
when that rival came over a few strides out of the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn, and weakened in the lane. TRIPLE CHROME hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn,
settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was empty from there. IOWA CLASS
was bumped and shut out leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. TIGER HUNTER raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. STAR ON THE MAP brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around
the far turn and continued to tire from there. HARD COMPANY ran out to the five path headed into the first turn, raced on the far outside near the back of
the pack up the backstretch, headed into the far turn still wide, was pulled up coming off the turn and walked off. DUE TO A TIMING ERROR, THERE IS NO
TIME RECORDED FOR THE SEVEN FURLONG MARK.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BIG STAR stalked the leader, was a bit hard to settle between horses into the turn, ranged up on the pacesetter three wide near the three eighths,
continued three wide in the leading flight into the lane, kept on under a drive to reel in LA GUERRERITA past the furlong mark, and cleared. LA
GUERRERITA tracked the leading pair early, stalked inside of SHE'S A BIG STAR into the turn, engaged inside of BOSSY SNOW PEA near the three
eighths, led inside into the lane under a drive, was headed by SHE'S A BIG STAR past the furlong mark but chased on second best. I LOVE TO RACE
chased between horses early, was shuffled back near the rear into the turn, chased four wide toward the rear around the bend, was urged approaching the
quarter, swung seven wide into the lane, and improved mildly for the show. HOODWINK raced at the inside of the chasing flight early, chased in the three
path on the turn inside of COOKIN ROSES, was driven inside in upper stretch, angled two wide midstretch, proved no match for the leading pair, flattened
out and lost the show late. CREAL DREAMER chased between horses early, settled to the rear into the turn, raced in the five path around the bend, was
driven six wide into the lane, drifted further out, and passed tiring horses. COOKIN ROSES chased four wide early, took closer order on the leading trio into
the turn, tracked four wide around the bend, and came up empty five wide into the lane. BOSSY SNOW PEA soon led, was engaged from both sides near
the three eighths, lost the lead into the stretch, and emptied out from the three sixteenths. JANE'S GOLD TOUR stumbled in the opening strides, unseated
her rider, finished the course without a rider, was apprehended by an outrider on the gallop out and walked off the course. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY INTO
THE START; UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION NO STRETCH TIME WAS AVAILABLE.

GET NONE chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, gained
ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear while drifting late. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still while beginning her bid entering the stretch, gained ground on the outside down the lane
and was the best of the rest. DRINKS ON ME raced at the back of the pack in the early going, came around the turn in the two path, began her bid with a
furlong to go and gained ground quickly between horses in late stretch. RANK AND FILE brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered
to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch, raced gamely in the lane
and was caught in the final furlong. LIPLINER dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path while racing
around the turn, drifted out mildly in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly late. MIDNIGHT FROST brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate,
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground mildly while drifting out in the stretch.
HEY HEY raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and
was outkicked. BAD PAY hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path
and faded in the final furlong. U. S. CURRENCY raced off the pace the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.
ROMANTIC ATTACK trailed the field throughout, and despite saving ground around the turn was never involved. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN dueled for the
lead between horses up the backstretch and around the turn, dropped back from the two path nearing the quarter pole and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
PURR SEA was asked for speed, took the lead over OEUVRE just past the eleven sixteenths, raced clear in the two path on the turn, was clear three wide
in upper stretch, increased her advantage under mostly hand urging, felt the crop once midstretch, and remained safely clear while hand-ridden and being
shown the crop. OEUVRE broke open the gate before the race but was adeptly held in place by the assistant starter, broke outward yet sharply, was
outsprinted by PURR SEA past the eleven sixteenths, tracked her down the rest of the back straight and while racing in the three path on the turn, was
driven four wide in upper stretch, proved no match for PURR SEA but chased her home as second best. GHAALEB'S RANGER chased four wide early,
settled back into the bend to race in the five path as part of the rear pair, was driven six wide in upper stretch, and improved position mildly. NIFF chased
between horses early, chased the leading pair in the two to three path on the turn, came into the lane in the two path, proved no match for the leading pair,
and flattened out. SASSY LIKE JULIA broke slowly, settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path with the rear flight on the turn, swung six wide into the
lane for the drive, and passed tiring horses. SHEZ RECKLESS chased three wide between horses early, continued to chase midpack in the four to five path
on the turn, came five wide into the lane, and emptied out. UPSIDE DOWN tracked the leading pair inside down the back straight, weakened along the rail
around the turn, and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
LEE'S LUCK broke inward, pressed the pace outside of PEACOCK MAN down the back straight and into the turn, engaged him in a duel near the five
sixteenths, continued to duel outside that foe despite drifting out in the lane, and got the bob on the line. PEACOCK MAN was sent for speed inside, set a
pressured pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, dueled inside of LEE'S LUCK when engaged by that foe past the five sixteenths,
kept battling under a drive down the lane, drifted out slightly, and lost the nod. PRESIDENT ELECT was awkward into stride, settled at the rear, began to
take closer order when driven past the three eighths, sustained his inside rally down the lane and gained to the finish. KILLEEN broke out and lightly
bumped BORA BORA in the opening strides, saved ground at the inside of the tracking flight, swung three wide into the lane, chased to midstretch and was
outfinished late. BORA BORA was lightly bumped by KILLEEN in the opening strides, raced between horses in the tracking flight down the back straight and
into the turn, settled back to chase two wide from near the three eighths, swung five wide into the lane, and kept on willingly. COME ON DOVER broke out
and bumped OFFLEE FUN in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair three wide, was driven four wide in upper stretch, and flattened out in the final
furlong. OFFLEE FUN was bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled in last, hugged the rail on the turn, went to a drive approaching the
quarter, took closer order in upper stretch but flattened out late.
