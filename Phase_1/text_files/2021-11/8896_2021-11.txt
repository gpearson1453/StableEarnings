Footnotes
LORENA led early, set a reserved pace, quickened under pressure from JILLI MARIE on the far turn and held sway under a hand ride. JOLENE JOLENE
was away slowly and settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely.
JILLI MARIE stalked the pace, dogged the leader on the backstretch, lapped onto the speedster on the far turn, chased into the stretch but leveled out in the
late stages. RED EQUINOX broke a step slowly, raced in mid pack, was roused at the top of the stretch but finished evenly. PRACTICAL GIZMO ducked
out a bit at the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then tired mid stretch.

PURE ELEGANCE, bumped by GANCHO leaving the gate, stalked the pace, led late backstretch, drew away on the turn then held under steady handling.
SAILOR'S PASSION stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied outside. GANCHO broke inward and bumped PURE
ELEGANCE, chased two-wide on the far turn and was game to the wire. HEY MICKEY steadied leaving the gate and lost his path, settled in mid pack, was
hustled three-wide on the far turn and finished determinedly. WHEN WE CONNECT, bumped with PERFECT PLAY at the start, settled in range but was in
tight on the first turn, was hustled from the rail to two-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. INCENDIO settled in mid pack, was hustled two to
four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. ZAFEATHER set a pressured pace, was headed late backstretch, dropped back early turn,
responded approaching the stretch and showed some interest. PERFECT PLAY bobbled leaving the gate and bumped a rival, settled off the pace, rode the
rail, closed on the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BEN LOMOND stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied gamely and was up in time under a drive. KNOPFLER set
a very pressured pace, was engaged upper stretch, battled, was caught late by the closing winner but saved the place. CHASING VINNY forced the pace,
bid upper stretch but could not get by the leader and missed the place award by a nod. KUDURO stalked from the rail, chased into the stretch and finished
gamely along the fence. R U WATCHINGBUD was off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn and closed through the stretch.
DOUBLE THE HEART, in range, closed four-wide late turn but leveled out in deep stretch. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL was rated off the pace, was hustled four
and five-wide on the turn but failed to menace. WE TAKE CHECKS forced the early pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch.
KITTEN'S BOY, rated off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn but never reached contention. SUMERIAN BELL settled in mid pack, was hustled
three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SOUP SPOON dueled with a stubborn rival throughout, traded the lead back and forth and looked beaten at the eighth pole but gutted it out inside that one
in the final sixteenth to regain the lead and hold on. MIA AND ME dueled outside the winner throughout, appeared to have that one put away at the eighth
pole but it was not over, that game foe re-rallied inside to get the lead in the final sixteenth. SPIGETINMTZABALLS sat a perfect trip just off the dueling
leaders, tipped out late on the turn into the three path a looked a winner but could only inch up down the lane without threatening that top pair. CANELITO
was herded in by a rival lugging in for a good number of strides soon after the start and dropped off the pace, advanced three wide into midpack on the turn
and out in the six path turning for home, besting the balance with a wide run. WHERESTHEPASSION was herded in a chain reaction for a few strides in the
early going, closed from off the pace along the inside on the turn and ran into the back of rivals in midstretch, forced to steady hard and closed once clear.
YANKEE JOE bore in and impeded rivals in the early going, was in midpack before dropping back three wide into last entering the stretch, then seemed to
figure the game out and re-rallied down the stretch while widest to pass a number of rivals. SILVER SIGNATURE off the pace and trailed into the turn,
rallied nicely into upper stretch but ran into a wall, having to steady hard before finding room and closing late. STRAPPING chased in the two path and
rallied into fourth place entering the stretch but was outkicked by numerous rivals in the final furlong. ICE DANCER in midpack early, came three wide into a
chasing position late on the turn but levelled off in the four path down the lane. CANDY MAGIC bumped a rival hard after breaking out at the start, rallied
along the rail into traffic and steadied by the eighth pole, losing interest after that. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR was left at the start before rushing up and having
to tap on the brakes in behind the front group, fading in the stretch on his wrong lead along the inside. TARASUS was bumped soundly by a rival at the
start, circled two to four wide from off the pace and out in the seven path turning for home but was out of gas in upper stretch.

rated off the pace, rode the rail, chased into the stretch and finished all out. AVOMAN settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the far turn

Footnotes
ONEZY'S DREAM raced in mid pack, closed hugging the rail through the turn, took command a furlong out and held sway under a hand ride. TUSCAN
DAMSEL settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn, launched a determined rally in the stretch and her gain was fast and steady to the end.
MISS SAVVY emerged with a clear lead mid backstretch, was hustled on the turn, drifted out from the rail late turn, lost a bit of ground and the lead but
finished gamely. SECRET ARCHANGEL forced the pace into the turn, chased 2-3w turn, was fanned out at the top of the stretch and evened out in the final
furlong. NAKED ILLUSION was away slowly and settled off the pace, was steadied in a tight spot along the rail early turn, chased to the stretch and finished
gamely in vain. TWOMANYSHOTS raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. SAVVY'S SISTER up close early,
was hustling four-wide but inching back on the turn then failed to menace in the stretch. BRING DA FUDGE was away alertly and showed brief speed,
stalked three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.
