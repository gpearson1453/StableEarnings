DANGNABBIT controlled the pace inside, widened in the stretch while geared down through the final furlong. BENCH PRESS settled well behind, advanced
outside to be easily second best. ECONOMIZER saved ground close up, moved out in the stretch to gain the show. ENFORCER pursued the winner three
wide, angled inside and faltered. DADASHEV was eased back on the first turn, raced between rivals and faded. LASCIATEMI CANTARE stopped abruptly,
lost contact with his field and was eased in the stretch.

LANA far back inside, split foes rallying into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her task. ABHAILE stumbled slightly at the start, led inside, faded on
the final turn then came again through the stretch. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL forced the pace three then two wide, led in the stretch then weakened slightly.
SUCCESSFUL LEGACY settled behind the dueling leaders, swung out into the stretch and came up empty. RISEN CHANGE trailed outside early and was
never in contention. DREAMINOFDASIES made a menacing wide bid on the final turn then weakened. OUR WEST INDY raced close up three wide and
stopped after three quarters.

BOURBON BON BAY vied outside in hand, took over near the quarter pole and, drew away while coasting home late. SUPER DUPER FLY firmly rated
inside, bid on the turn but was no match for the winner. XENATOWN stalked the dueling pacesetters outside and lacked a rally. NYSSA dueled inside
winner for half a mile and faltered. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS broke sluggishly, raced inside and was no factor. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE trailed early then passed
tiring rivals inside. EIGHT DANZAS dropped far behind and lacked a response. NO SYMPATHY raced within range briefly then stopped. BROOKLYN
HEIGHTS moved wide down the backstretch and gave way readily.

Footnotes
EXCITABLE LADY tracked on the inside, moved up midway on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, gained command past the furlong marker and
then dug in gamely between horses to prevail. SOLID GOLD DANCER chased between rivals early, saved ground entering the stretch, made a late run on
the rail and dug in gamely to the wire. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE was off a bit slow, raced three wide off the pace, made a four wide run on the turn, rallied
outside rivals in the stretch and dug in gamely to the finish. SWEET SAMURAI chased on the inside, rallied mildly outside in the stretch and was gaining
late. CLOUD SKIPPING stumbled at the start, vied two wide and tired. FIFTH RISK vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, dueled and weakened in
the final furlong. SAIL ABOVE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. GOD STILL LOVES ME chased outside and faded. SWIFT FACTOR raced off
the pace inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
MISS DILLINGHAM pursued the loose pacesetter then wore down that rival in the final yards in a long drive. FLASHING DIAMOND sprinted clear inside
then weakened slightly in the final stages. CARAMEL CREAM settled outside the leaders and proved no match for the top pair. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE
lagged far behind then offered some late energy. TOMARIE lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. ANGEL RAPHAEL dropped back early and
was never a factor. QUEEN BREEZY saved ground, struck the rail near the 5/16 pole and faded. ORIGINALY FROM DOT raced wide off the pace and was
never in contention. FLEETERTHAN prompted the pace outside and stopped on the turn. MADAME ROUGE was urged close up briefly then gave way
readily.

Footnotes
TRAPPED N MY MIND trailed the field, made a four wide run into contention on the turn, came wide into the stretch, closed willingly outside, collared the
leader and edged away under confident handling late. NURTURING set the pace on the inside, shook free, responded when set down nearing the furlong
marker, dug in gamely and was no match for the winner. SOLEMN OATH chased two wide, raced between rivals on the turn, dug in through the lane,
finished evenly for third. HIGHTIME VALENTINE chased on the inside, raced inside on the turn, finished evenly and was outkicked for the show spot.
ABSOLUTE ANNA raced off the rail, off the pace and closed belatedly outside. FROSTY FRIEND raced off the pace inside, two wide on the turn and lacked
a rally. ANGINETTI chased four wide, raced three wide on the turn and tired. GINGERS WISH raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. LULINDA'S
HEART chased five wide early, chased on the turn and faded. CONNOISSEUR chased three wide, gave way, was distanced in the lane and walked off.
