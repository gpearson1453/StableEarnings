WAR WOUNDS set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. DISCREET TIGER was up close early, raced between
rivals into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. CHAMPITO raced in mid pack early, went four wide into the turn and was along for third.
THIRSTY JUNIOR tracked the early pace, loomed six wide through the turn and was empty. WILLY TELL HIM was allowed to settle early, went seven wide
and never fired. MEGA SOURCE was void of speed, raced between rivals and offered no rally. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC chased the early pace from the
inside and faded. NO DOUBT was taken back and was no factor. WHITE WALLS was reserved early, advanced eight wide and flattened out. THE RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.
