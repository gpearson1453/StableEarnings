the pace dueling through the turn wresting a narrow lead in upper stretch digging in to outside pressure ceding grudgingly late. KUMANDRA pressed a
narrow lead through the turn extending on the rail in upper stretch wearing out late. ARISTA THE CAT in close at the break was rushed to pressure the pace
through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. VIMONT was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF ARISTA THE CAT AGAINST THE
