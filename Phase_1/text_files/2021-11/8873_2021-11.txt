Footnotes
LEA RO bumped WILLYOUBEMINE into the first turn while achieving an inside tracking position, was scrubbed upon to gain at the three furlong pole,
inched closer while tipping three wide turning for home, drove past the leading pair in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. MISS COMMISH
set the pace, showed the way inside of a vying DOUBLE DOWN around the far turn, bumped with that foe passing the quarter pole while getting outkicked
by LEA RO, then secured place in midstretch. WILLYOUBEMINE took a bump from an inner foe into the first turn, laid off of the pace two wide, gained four
wide and between horses turning for home, but failed to match rallying strides with an inner foe passing the quarter pole, then kept on to claim show in the
final furlong. DOUBLE DAWN stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, but bumped with her inner counterpart passing the quarter pole while offering little
resistance to a bidding LEA RO, and tired thereafter. MALIBU MARLEE trailed three wide, gained four wide and outside of foes down the backstretch to a
stalking position, tracked the leading pair from the four path into that turn, but faded while getting floated five wide at the five sixteenths pole. SOCIAL
CIRCLE tracked three wide, but faded between horses at the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
ZAWISH set the pace along the inside of a pressing MRS. NUSHI, shrugged that foe off entering the lane, shook clear in upper stretch, but flopped back to
her left lead while anticipating left handed encouragement passing the sixteenth pole, and safely held. MY FRIEND AMY trailed along the inside, saved
ground turning for home while improving inside of rivals entering the lane, shifted three wide approaching midstretch, bumped an outer LANDED GENTRY
while splitting rivals at the furlong pole, then stayed on to attempt a late bid, but ran out of ground to catch the leader. MRS. NUSHI prompted the pace two
wide and from between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, then lost place at the sixteenth pole.
LANDED GENTRY broke a step slowly, stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but drifted further outwards rather than
bidding in upper stretch, then got bumped and outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds. MISS MATCHMAKER pressed the pace three wide, but
faded turning for home. STILL CARRYING ON lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, chased into the turn, then tired turning for home.
BOURBONWITHGINGER hopped at the start and broke slowly, took the turn four wide while off of the pace, and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
THOMAS SHELBY set the pace, established a loose advantage into the backstretch, added onto that margin turning for home and through upper stretch,
then held sway under all out urging through the final furlong while drifting outwardly late. MY BARILEY hopped slightly before taking a few nudges from an
inner foe at the start, laid at the rear of the field two wide, commenced a four wide advance around the far turn, sustained that rally to bid for place outside of
foes in midstretch, flopped back to his left lead a sixteenth out, and determinedly claimed that position at the wire. INTREPID HEART tracked from midpack
four wide around the first turn, tucked into the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend before bidding for place inside of rivals approaching
midstretch, claimed that position inside the final furlong, but was nailed on the wire by an outer rival. LEADER OF MEN lunged outwardly and bumped a
rival at the start, tracked three wide, chased the loose leader around the far turn, then kept on late. MR. TIP stalked two wide, hung on his left lead through
upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the clear leader, then tired between horses at the furlong grounds. CANCELLARA brushed the inner part of the
gate before being solidly bumped by an inner foe at the start, brushed an outer rival multiple times soon after, then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
OSCARETTE rushed after a flat footed beginning to set the pace inside of a vying FIRST KITTEN, glided away from that foe in upper stretch while not
asked for her best run, remained clear into the final sixteenth under very confident handling as the rider searched for competition, saw an oncharging
GRACE'S SECRET in the process, but remained self-assured, and was saved by the wire. GRACE'S SECRET took the turn in the three to four path while
off of the pace, but rallied outside of foes through the lane, quickened after flopping back to her left lead inside of the furlong pole, lunged to attempt to reach
the clear leader late, but missed reaching that foe on the wire. SALUTE THE FLAG stalked along the inside, then chased well through the lane to be gaining
on the leader, but was outkicked for place in the late stages. ESPERER (FR) stalked three wide, chased the leading pair into the lane, but leveled off
thereafter. FIRST KITTEN vied for the lead outside of OSCARETTE, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. HIGH CON broke a
step slowly, got caught in the four to five path around the turn while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. OUR WONSAPONATIME was off a step slowly,
and got outrun. APRIL IN PARIS saved ground off of the pace, but was pulled up in upper stretch, was dismounted and untacked in the vicinity of the
sixteenth pole, and walked off.

Footnotes
OPUS EQUUS set the pace inside of a vying THIRSTY OWL while under steady urging around the turn, drifted to the three path passing the quarter pole,
forced his counterpart outwards before inching clear of that rival in upper stretch, but met DESTINED FOR HONOR's outside bid approaching the final
sixteenth, flopped back to his left lead leaving that marker while continuing to drift outwardly, and held. DESTINED FOR HONOR stalked along the inside,
tipped outside of the embattled leading pair entering the lane, got floated to the five path to stay outside of those foes in upper stretch, grinded away in
pursuit of OPUS EQUUS in midstretch while hanging on his left lead, ranged up to produce a late bid in the final sixteenth, but missed. REBOPPER settled
off of the pace two wide and between horses, cut the corner turning for home after an inner foe faltered, then sustained a grinding rally along the rail through
the lane to attempt a late bid inside of the tiring and drifting leader, but did not have enough to catch him. COMMODORE PERRY laid off of the pace four
wide, gained outside of foes turning for home, but darted inwards at the three sixteenths pole to counter the outer drifting leader, grinded away through the
final furlong outside of REBOPPER with an attempt to bid inside of the leaders in the late stages, but failed to reach them. THIRSTY OWL vied for the lead
two wide, but was herded outwardly in upper stretch by his inner counterpart, and yielded. SONIC BURN stalked three wide, but came under a drive into the
turn, then tired between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole. TIZ THE JOURNEY broke a step slowly, trailed early on, and never got involved. HEX
hopped a bit at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, but was outkicked by an inner rival entering the lane, and weakened. INDIANA RED was
brushed between horses soon after the start, settled off of the pace along the inside but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
LITTLE MENACE set a leisurely pace along the inside into the first turn, met AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG)'s challenge around that bend, but reengaged to
reclaim an advantage down the backstretch, showed the way into the far turn before shaking clear of that foe passing the three furlong pole, then finished
stoutly through the lane under strong hand urging to seal the deal. KNIGHT'S CROSS stalked two wide, allowed AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) to hook the
leader into the backstretch, shifted outside of those foes into the backstretch, but only managed to chase LITTLE MENACE around the far turn, failed to
keep pace in upper stretch, then held place. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) gained intently outside of foes around the first turn after sensing a slow pace to vie
for the lead passing the seven furlong pole, pressed LITTLE MENACE from the outside down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace around the far turn,
lost place turning for home to KNIGHT'S CROSS, but kept on, shifted outside of that foe in midstretch to attempt to rebid for place, but did not have enough
to catch him. GIGGING settled at the rear of the field two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, but leveled off before contending. JOHN'S ROCK tracked
from midpack along the inside, but faded turning for home. ARTEMUS EAGLE was outrun along the inside.

lane under a motionless rider. GUS PIAZZA broke slowly, rated off of the pace, gained five wide around the turn to bid for place entering the lane, claimed
that position in upper stretch before being confronted by an inner bidding RIVER SHANNON at the furlong grounds, then dueled with that foe through the
late stages, but held. RIVER SHANNON stalked from the two path, advanced between horses turning for home, bid for place inside of GUS PIAZZA in
midstretch, dueled with that foe through the final furlong, but was denied that position. GOOD LUCK CHARM chased from off of the pace four wide around
the turn, then stayed on through the final furlong for a minor share. HABITUS trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, and
improved late. ELEVATOR PITCH stalked three wide, but weakened between horses in midstretch. STORM'S REFLECTION vied for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, but proved no match for that foe into the turn, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
SUKI set the pace, inched a clear margin into the far turn, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway from a pursuing FROST POINT through the final furlong.
FROST POINT stalked along the inside, backed off a few lengths down the backstretch, but picked up stride turning for home, split foes three wide at the
quarter pole to take aim on a clearing SUKI in upper stretch, but only managed to chase that foe home, and proved second best. MISTY VEIL bobbled at
the start, laid at the rear of the field two to three wide around the turns, shifted inwards to the rail in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show from an outer
foe in the late stages. TELLMEONASUNDAY pressed the pace setter three to two wide around the first turn, but chased that foe around the far turn, failed
to keep pace in upper stretch, then faded and lost show in the late stages. GUANA CAY was bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack four
wide around the first turn, advanced to a stalking position in the early part of the backstretch, but came under driving pressure into the far turn, chased the
leader three wide around that bend, then weakened after being floated four wide entering the lane. FOOLERY bumped an outer foe at the start, then saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SUPER CHIANTI broke slowly, pulled on the rider into the first turn to achieve close up stalking position two wide and
between horses, but got keen among those rivals at the thirteen sixteenths pole, settled into the backstretch, but fought rider restraint while being between
horses passing the nine sixteenths pole, faltered shortly after, and was done early.

Footnotes
DOCTOR NASH set the pace along the inside, repelled GROUP EIGHTEEN's bid entering the lane, drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch before
being ridden out through the final furlong. STAVANGER settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before swinging five wide
entering the lane, rallied while shifting inwardly in midstretch, and reached place at the sixteenth pole. GROUP EIGHTEEN stalked three wide, ranged up to
the leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, then lost place at the sixteenth pole. PINCH HITTER pressed the pace two wide, but
faded at the five sixteenths pole. REQUISITION stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn, but lacked a kick to split foes two wide in upper stretch,
switched outside of foes in the final furlnog, and stayed on. NAPA VALLEY laid off of the pace two to three wide and between horses around the turns, and
chased through upper stretch before fading. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF laid off of the pace three wide, saved ground around the far turn before attempting to
rally four wide and between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and failed to factor. TIZABIGMICK was brushed by
an inner foe at the start, got caught five to four wide around the first turn while off of the pace, and never got involved. YASUKE tracked while shifting six to
four wide around the first turn, but was through after a half mile. BEARTOE was last away and showed little.
