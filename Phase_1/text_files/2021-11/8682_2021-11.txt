Footnotes
SWEET ANNABELLA stumbled at the start but was not costed position, showed the way early on before meeting POUT's outer challenge after a furlong,
dueled inside of that foe thereafter, gamely sustained the battle through the lane, brushed her outer counterpart while forging an advantage a sixteenth from
home, and prevailed. POUT shifted outside of foes after a flat footed beginning to rush to vie for the lead outside of SWEET ANNABELLA, sparred outside
of that foe around the turn, sustained the long duel through the lane, but was brushed at the sixteenth pole while getting outgamed. BACKYARD MONEY
came inwards soon after the start, stalked along the inside, chased around the turn, then stayed on for a minor share through the final furlong.
SCINTILLATING STAR chased the dueling leaders three wide around the turn, but only finished up evenly. EMITYAAZ bumped an outer rival before being
forced inwards by that foe, settled off of the pace two wide, drifted to the six path entering the lane, and failed to make an impact. ARNEIS trailed two wide
around the turn, and was outrun. LIZNOW hesitated significantly at the start, lied far off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. LADY
LIVERMORE tracked four wide, but faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KEWPIE DOLL stalked the leading pair from along the inside, tipped three wide at the five sixteenths pole to bid for the lead in upper stretch, readily drew
off passing the three sixteenths pole, took over approaching midstretch, and was ridden out under light hand urging. AFLEET DIVA set the pace along the
inside of a vying SHANIAH, but proved no match for an outer foe in upper stretch, and prevailed over her early vying counterpart for place. SHANIAH vied
for the lead two wide, but proved no match for an outer foe in upper stretch, then was turned away for place in the final furlong. DOUBLE DAWN trailed,
swung five wide entering the lane, but failed to menace. BREONNA tracked, ranged up to the leading trio four wide turning for home, but faded in upper
stretch. TOTAL MALICE got fractious in the gate, pressed the pace three wide, but faded approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BLAKE B. pressed the pace early two wide, took over command nearing the five sixteenths pole, was in the two path into the lane, drew clear in the stretch
while geared down in the final stages. ROYAL TRYST raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was up for place at
the wire. FRENCH TOAST was bumped at the start, raced in the four path along the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the three path into the lane,
made a bid down the lane but was outfinished in the place in the final stages. HELLORHIGHWATER raced in the three path along the first turn, tracked the
early pace, was in the five path into the lane and finished willingly in the late stages. SPEIGHTSTOWN AGAIN raced in the two path along the first turn, was
in the seven path into the lane and raced evenly throughout. GENERATOR raced in the four path along the first turn, stalked the early pace, was bumped
while between horses into the far turn, was in the six path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. SEASIDE BOY was bumped at the start, raced
in the five path into the lane and was never a threat. BOLD MINISTER was never a factor. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) was in tight and checked in the stretch.
WESTWARD LOOK set the pace for a half then folded up.
