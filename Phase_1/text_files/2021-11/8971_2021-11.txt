Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LINDA dueled early, shook clear on the turn, lasted late, driving. PERSEVERING HONOR was never far back early, rallied in the stretch
and finished well to be gaining late. CRIKEY was in hand early, swung six wide in the stretch and closed fast . HIGH CUPPER raced between horses, and
went evenly late. OHIO STORM raced mid pack and was no threat. DYNA'S HOLIDAY lost irons soon after start, quickly regained them and was no
menace. CHARDON was never far back and was no threat late. DANCING GRACE well placed early, lacked a late response. A FABULOUS KISS
contended early and was through after a half. AIKEN APPLE trailed.
