Footnotes
TIZAFEELIN pressed the pace two wide, but was scrubbed upon at the three furlong pole to sustain pressing position, failed to make headway on the
leader's margin through upper stretch while wandering a bit outwardly from left handed urging, but drifted back inwardly from right handed pressure at the
furlong pole, engaged the leader in the process, and edged past that passing the sixteenth pole. FLOWER MOON set the pace inside of a pressing
TIZAFEELIN, showed the way while comfortably in hand around the turn, was set down passing the quarter pole to maintain a margin from that bidding foe,
dug in at the furlong grounds as that rival inched closer, but gave in passing the sixteenth pole. TAP THE LINE trailed the field, came into the lane four wide,
and improved past tiring foes in midstretch. DALIDA laid off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. CHRISTMAS POEM broke a
half a step slowly at the start, lied close up along the inside into the turn, stalked around the bend from the pocket, but failed to keep pace with the leading
pair in upper stretch while chasing, and faded through the final furlong. NOTREALLYNOTREALLY chased from the two path while failing to keep pace
among rivals into the turn, then steadily faded around the bend, and was done early.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER set the pace, managed a clear advantage around the turn, drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch, and was ridden out late.
CYPRIANO tracked along the inside, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead to reach place approaching the furlong
pole, and was second best. ROAD BIBLE pressed the pace setter two wide and between horses early on, chased around the turn, and held show from his
outer chasing counterpart. PLETCHER brushed the gate, pressed the pace three wide, stalked the clear leader around the turn, but came under a drive to
range closer entering the lane, but lacked a response and faded. ILLBOOTENGOTTY never got involved.

Footnotes
FREUDIAN FATE stalked outside of a clear FEAST early on, ranged up while being floated to the four path into the turn, bid at the three furlong pole,
received brushing bumps from his inner counterpart while forging an advantage approaching the five sixteenths pole, returned the favor while shifting
inwardly through upper stretch, dueled with his game counterpart while maintaining that advantage through the lane, then inched away in the closing stages.
FEAST set a clear pace early on, shifted to the three path into the turn before meeting FREUDIAN FATE's bid at the three furlong pole, brushed that foe
while being headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, dug in while being forced inwards through upper stretch, fought on gamely into the final sixteenth,
but gave way late. YES SIR ROBERT tracked outside of the leading pair while in the five path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper
stretch, and was best of the rest. TOOBADSOSAD tracked along the inside around the turn, but failed to factor. GROVE DADDY lagged well behind the
field around the turn, and made no impact. ROB THE RICH never got involved.

RIDGEPOINTE bumped an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied among those rivals into the turn, dueled inside of
YOLO SANTIAGO turning for home after their inner counterpart faltered, doggedly battled while maintaining a narrow advantage, and tenaciously held.
YOLO SANTIAGO pressed the pace three wide, vied around the turn, dueled gamely outside of RIDGEPOINT through the lane, but was denied.
RUNNINSONOFAGUN was sandwiched between horses at the start, tugged inside of foes to reach midpack at the half mile pole while under strong
restraint, tipped four wide into the turn to range up outside of the leaders turning for home, menaced in midstretch, but leveled off. SUMMER IN MALIBU
tracked from off of the pace three wide, took the turn two wide, shifted five wide in midstretch, and produced a late kick for a minor share. WILD APPEAL
stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home while under urging, then chased evenly through the lane. LA FLECHA rated far off of the pace
three wide around the turn, and stayed on through the lane. BONEYARDHOLLER set the pace, but met a pair of bids into the turn, and gave way at the five
sixteenths pole. CLOUD CREEK broke well but outwardly and bothered a foe, but was unable to gain forward early positioning, settled far off of the pace
along the inside, saved ground around the turn, but to no avail. PAPA RED was wiped out at the start when severely hampered by an inner foe after
bumping an outer rival, lagged behind the field into the turn, and improved in the late. BEHIND THE CURTAIN got caught five wide while off of the pace
around the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the lane, and never got involved. OUTCOME stalked four wide, but failed to keep pace into the turn, then
weakened turning for home.

JACK'S ADVANTAGE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, ranged up in midstretch to forge an advantage at the
furlong pole, drew clear shortly after, and held from a bidding CREATIVE COURAGE late. CREATIVE COURAGE settled far off of the pace, took the turn in
the three path before shifting to the five path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but was denied.
IMPROBABLE STORY tracked from midpack two wide, then stayed on through midstretch while inching closer, shifted three wide inside the final furlong,
and improved late for a minor share. TAOS stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of SECRETARY AT WAR at the five sixteenths pole, forged a narrow
advantage in upper stretch, but failed to kick on, hung, got outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole, and yielded. SECRETARY AT WAR vied two wide,
led into the turn, dug in at the five sixteenths pole as TAOS menaced, fought on after being headed by that foe in upper stretch, but yielded to outer rivals
passing the furlong pole. WHEREWEGOIN broke outwardly at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MOGOWAN hopped and
bumped the inner part of the gate at the start, broke multiple lengths behind the field in the process, and got outrun. GOLDENPENCE vied for the lead along
the inside, was roused to keep pace into the turn, but weakened turning for home.

SANTA ELENA stalked the pace two wide and from between horses into the turn, searched for racing room behind the leaders in upper stretch, shifted
inwardly and split foes two wide passing the three sixteenths pole, bid at the furlong pole inside of RUNNIN HAPPY, then drove past that foe approaching
the wire. RUNNIN HAPPY was briefly fractious waiting for the gates to open, tracked the pace four wide, ranged up to the leading trio entering the lane,
forged an advantage at the furlong grounds as SANTA ELENA produced an inner bid, but was bested by that foe in the final sixteenth. DELIGHTFUL
BREEZE vied for the lead two wide, drifted outwardly while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, put GUAJIRA into tight quarters in the process before
being outkicked by foes on both sides at the furlong grounds, then safely held show thereafter. GUAJIRA bumped the gate and was off slowly, steadily
progressed to stalk to the pace three wide into the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe while put to tight quarters between horses by an inner rival at the
three sixteenths pole altered course outwardly shortly after, but faded. SOL DORADO failed to factor. ROCK ALONG vied along the inside, dug in as a outer
rivals made bids entering the lane and in upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds. SPANISH IDOL stalked along the inside, but faded.
HILLSTONE MARTINI trailed and never got involved. RESTLESS EYES saved ground off of the pace, but was done early.

Footnotes
ROCKET DAWG tracked from midpack, inched closer under his own power three wide into the turn, took aim on the clear leader turning for home, bid
entering the lane, assumed command passing the quarter pole, drew off under driving pressure, and was kept busy to the wire. GRANTHAM took bumps
from rivals on either side shortly after the start, stalked three wide, chased the clear leader into the turn while inside of ROCKET DAWG, but was outmoved
by that foe turning for home, shifted out in upper stretch, and kept on to claim place from the tiring early pace setter passing the furlong pole, dueled with an
inner bidding JEEPER for that position through the final sixteenth, and held. JEEPER bumped an inner foe soon after the start, rated at the rear of the field
two wide, commenced a four to five wide rally turning for home, but lugged inwardly in upper stretch while maintaining stride, stayed on to split foes
approaching the sixteenth pole to bid for place inside of GRANTHAM, but was denied reaching that rival late. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY vied three wide
early on, cleared inner foes approaching the half mile pole, showed the way along the inside around the turn, met ROCKET DAWG's bid entering the lane,
but offered little resistance to that foe passing the quarter pole, and weakened in midstretch. FAST LANE settled far off of the pace while caught in the five
to six path around the turn, and improved through the final furlong. MAMZOOJ stalked from midpack two wide and between horses, but faltered to midpack
into the turn, and failed to rerally. BET HE'S READY vied two wide early on, but failed to keep pace with an outer rival at the half mile pole, and steadily
faded around the turn. CIRCLE BACK JACK bumped an outer rival soon after the start, chased from midpack two wide, shifted four wide while still under
steady urging around the turn, but tired through the lane. GALACTIC EMPIRE shifted five wide into the turn while well off of the pace, and never got
involved. SOUTHERN SENSE settled at the rear along the inside, took the turn three wide, and failed to factor. ALL CHOKED UP lied close up along the
inside, but regressed to midpack at the half mile pole, and faltered around the turn.

Footnotes
RED LABEL hopped slightly at the start, stalked four wide, then three wide around the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, then drew off in upper stretch,
and widened while hanging on his left lead. FLORIDA GATOR laid off of the pace two wide, rallied four wide turning for to range up to the leading trio
entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with RED LABEL while producing a bid for place in upper stretch, dueled outside of LEDDY for that position
through the final furlong, and prevailed. LEDDY vied along the inside early on before easing back to stalk from the pocket into the turn, shifted to the two to
three path while searching for racing room behind the leaders entering the lane, but lacked a kick to split foes and bid inside of RED LABEL in upper stretch,
failed to keep pace with that foe approaching the furlong grounds while vying for place inside of FLORIDA GATOR, and was outfinished by that rival. MR.
HALFTIME took up between horses at the six furlong pole, tracked from off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four to five path in upper stretch, and
improved for a minor share. DEMOGORGON vied for the lead three to two wide around the turn, but yielded to outer foes in upper stretch, and weakened.
FORMAL ORDER was outrun. COME ALONE showed the way between horses early on before clearing an inner foe into the turn, but weakened inside of a
trio of rivals entering the lane.

GILDED AGE trailed, rallied three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead entering the lane, and drove clear at the furlong grounds. CHILENO set the
pace along the inside, dueled inside of SCATTERSHACK down the backstretch and around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch,
then held place from the aforementioned foe. SCATTERSHACK pressed the pace setter two wide, dueled for the lead down the backstretch, then sustained
the duel after getting outkicked by an outer foe approaching midstretch, but failed to reach his battling counterpart for place. ENCOURAGE bumped with an
outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack four wide around the first turn before saving ground off of the pace around the far turn, and stayed on without
menacing. VERBIER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MAGILLA bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid at the rear two wide, and never got
involved. HESTON stalked along the inside, but faded in upper stretch. TIGER MOON stalked three wide, but chased while losing ground around the far
turn, and weakened in upper stretch. BON BUENO stumbled at the start and lost his rider, then ran with the field throughout the race without hindering any
other rivals, was caught galloping out on the clubhouse turn, then walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
