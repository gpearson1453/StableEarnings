Footnotes
KING NEKIA saved ground close to the pace and challenged at the three eighths pole, contested the turn three wide then dug in under steady stretch
handling to get up the final yards. SUSPIROS settled off the pace about the three path on the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came
inside STRETCH THE TRUTH for the lead at the eighth pole and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught in the final yards, while the
latter drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the advantage just off the rail
on the far turn, gave up the nod a furlong out and relented second mid-stretch. SING A VERSE saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn and ran evenly through the lane. SWING YOUR SWORD settled off the earlier pace two deep then picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, drifted a bit into the lane, though finished evenly. PERUVIAN DANCER dropped well off the
pace about the three path on the first turn, showed mild response through the backstretch and could only close the gap in the lane.

caught past the eighth pole then flattened the final sixteenth. BACK CHARGE rated off the early pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase into
the backstretch and drew to even terms at the five sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. GOOFY BOY
saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. JACOB T broke a
step slow then saved ground. DESTINY'S CHARGE stalked off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch, dropped back toward the three eighths pole and
faded.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF KANTHAROS drew clear while angling in and drew off to a long early lead, came under pressure leaving the turn and was well handled to deep
stretch. UPTOWN BELLE gave distant early chase, rounded the turn at the rail, angled out from the heels of Noble Present past the eighth pole, took
second mid-stretch and was gaining steadily on the winner. AWESOME INCENTIVE chased, raced off the rail on the turn, eased to the four path into the
lane and dug in to take third late yards. NOBLE PRESENT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened the final furlong.
LOVE CALIFORNIA exchanged contact with Felons Only leaving the gate, gave distant chase and rounded the turn in the two and three paths and showed
little in the lane. DIG FOR TREASURE raced well back and saved ground. FELONS ONLY exchanged contact with Love California then never factored. ME
ME'S GALAXY became fractious and unseated her rider behind the gate, gave chase through the backstretch then faded in the four path of the turn.

Footnotes
CATCH MY CABOOSE angled in through the front stretch and stalked the early pace two deep, took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, came under
pressure toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail and was kept alert through the lane. CASTLE BOUND settled back off the rail the first turn,
bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. CARTER'S RUN saved
ground well off the pace the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path
and finished well to pass rivals outside. TRUE CROSSING rated a slim lead inside, was caught toward the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase nearing the
three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. SILVER CASTLE steadied lightly at the start and settled off the pace
inside, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. HARD BEING ME
was bumped at the break and raced well back in the two and three paths the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response through the
backstretch. TAMAQUA broke outward to make contact with Hard Being Me then settled off the pace about the three path, bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened.

Footnotes
CHEESE LOUISE engaged in close chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn, angled four wide to get around horses at the eighth pole and dug in from
that point to get up late yards while holding off LADY LICIOUS, who broke a step slow and angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the four
path, angled out an extra path into the lane and was outfinished in a stretch long duel while able to take second the final yards. HOLLYWOOD BROWN
chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the six path approaching the top of the lane and finished well to take third under the wire.
ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY pressured the pace three wide, contested at a close disadvantage through the turn and dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch, but
was outfinished later yards. MARY BOPPINS TOO broke a bit awkwardly then chased toward the inside, angled outward through the turn and entered the
stretch about the seven path and finished well outside. VINTAGE GIN set a pressured pace and was met leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at near
even terms at the rail on the turn, briefly recovered the edge at the eighth pole but weakened inside the sixteenth. U S FUNDS pressured the pace and
dueled at even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took a brief lead two deep at the quarter pole but was caught between horses leaving the turn and
weakened the final sixteenth.

sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. URKILLINGMEBETH chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then eased outward toward the
head of the lane, left the turn in the four path and was gaining well late. U R THE LUCKY ONE chased outside, raced at a close disadvantatge two deep on
the turn but flattened the final furlong. K K CAN pressured the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead toward the sixteenth
pole then flattened later yards. CREATE A STORY gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane.
