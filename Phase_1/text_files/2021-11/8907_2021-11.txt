Footnotes
TIPYOURHATTOTHAT sped to the lead at the start and held clear through the backstretch, widened advantage still unleashed around the far turn, came
two wide into the lane, remained well clear and stayed sharp under steady encouragement. EMPHASIZE raced near midpack through early stages, picked
up the pace two wide around the far turn, bid in that path into the lane and finished second best. MR. MOSLEY tracked the leader through the backstretch,
launched a three wide bid turning for home, sustained a steady bid and just lasted for show. SUPER HOUDINI raced off the early pace, was ridden along
three to four wide into the lane, sustained a steady effort and got nipped for show. REBEL VICTORY raced near midpack, coaxed three wide around the far
turn, bid four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. TRANSFER THE FUNDS was unhurried, hustled up five wide into the lane and lacked a
needed rally. ICHIGO tracked in contention through the backstretch, launched a rail bid through the far turn and gave way in the lane. BARRISTER trailed,
saved ground around the far turn and never reached contention. LEAVE 'EM LOADED came up empty after a half. IMAGINE NEVERLAND hit the rail
running through the backstretch and dropped back.

Footnotes
EXCALIBUR raced two wide around the first turn and remained unhurried through the backstretch, picked up the pace two wide around the far turn, bid in
that path into the lane, steadily closed along the outside and got up in final stride. ALPHA QUEUE sprinted to a clear lead around the first turn, continued to
hold a commanding lead through the backstretch, saved ground entering the lane, came under right handed pressure in the upper stretch, stayed clear on
top at the eighth pole then got caught in final stride. SHOULDA HAD IT rated off the clear pacesetter through early stages, headed in pursuit around the far
turn, came four wide into the lane, sustained a three wide bid through the stretch run and cleared the rest. PRINCE OF CAPS was the closest pursuer of the
clear leader through the backstretch, was ridden along two to three wide around the far turn, sustained bid in the upper stretch then flattened in the final
furlong. STRINGFELLA raced off the early pace, was ridden inside through the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, came off the inside and failed to
move on. TAPPIN FOR GLORY was unhurried through early stages and failed to respond under pressure around the far turn. MY CANDY BIZ raced three
to four wide heading into the first turn, rated off the clear pacesetter though the backstretch and had no response when called upon in the far turn.

Footnotes
MOODY WOMAN rated off the early pace, edged up closer four wide late on the turn, tipped a path wider and given cue at the head of the lane, cleared on
top and stayed sharp under a strong hand ride. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY was forced to race under a snug hold along the rail through early stages, tipped
out a path entering the turn, waited in traffic in the upper stretch, got clear near the eighth pole and produced a solid finish. I'M GITTIN THERE raced up
close just off the top pair entering the turn, loomed up three wide between rivals at the quarter pole, could not move on with the top pair past the eighth pole
and stayed on for a share. SWEET TALIA circled up four wide to race in striking distance at the quarter pole, sustained bid in the upper stretch and flattened
in the final furlong. QUEEN CASHMERE raced in the back, briefly raced in traffic then came out wider in the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. OUR
TINY DANCER dueled out of the gate, continued to battle into the upper stretch then gave way. VALUABLE BREIGH dueled out of the gate, battled on into
upper stretch then weakened. STILL DOING TIME vied between rivals in opening stages, chased through the turn then faded in the lane.

DONTCROSSFUZZY hustled up to the lead at the start, cleared on top and saved ground into the lane, remained clear a furlong from home then just lasted
in final stride. CRABS N BEER tracked through early stages, steadied two wide near the quarter pole, got clear at the head of the lane, steadily edged up
closer two wide, surged gamely between approaching the wire and just missed. HEAVENLY TRIP picked up the pace two to three wide around the turn, bid
three wide into the lane, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of the leader, inched up closer to the wire and just missed. GALLANT GOLD raced in the back,
launched a four wide bid in the upper stretch and improved. STRONGER THAN DEX was off a step slow at the start, hard hustled to race just off the leader
around the turn then weakened in the lane. ALWAYS DRINKING raced in tight along the rail, steadied near the quarter pole and faded.

a driving finish. NOBLE ENDEAVOR hopped at the start and hustled up to the lead, held a length advantage around the turn, set down driving three wide for
the drive, dug in gamely at the sixteenth pole then lacked a closing kick. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY was forwardly placed around the turn, hustled up four
wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and edged up closer to the end. BIG HAMBONE stumbled at the start and steadied heading near the turn,
produced a wide bid in the lane and needed more for serious impact. TAPPAHANNOCK race up close three wide through the turn, came out wider for the
drive and flattened out. PHANTOM RO steadied inside nearing the turn, remained in range on the inside in the upper stretch then gave way. SMART STEP
raced off the pace, got forced out wide mid-way around the turn and never menaced. PROUD ENOUGH was ridden along three to four wide around the turn
and had no response in late stages. IRISHTOWN lacked speed and got forced out wide mid-way around the turn. CLASSY SOLUTION steadied nearing the
turn, bore out mid-way around the turn, eased up with a quarter mile remaining and walked off.

through the turn then gave way. IRISH CHAOS raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SPEAK YOUR MIND showed
response in early stages then steadily weakened. RUBI DE LEON stumbled at the start, showed early interest then retreated.

came wide into the lane, reached MONEY RIDE in deep stretch, dug in under firm handling and got a head up in final stride. MONEY RIDE hustled up to
duel for the early lead, battled on with rivals around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, fought back gamely from the inside when challenged by
BOBBY G in deep stretch and got edged out in final stride. WENTZ vied for the lead in opening stages and battled on for the lead around the turn, stayed on
with game response in the lane, moved back up to race in striking distance and lacked a final kick. CLOSER LOOK raced off the top trio through early
stages, was ridden along four wide around the turn, sustained a steady outside bid through the lane and steadily inched up closer to the wire. THE POSER

Footnotes
GRAYWING took over the lead late on the backstretch, held firm two wide around the turn, responded willingly through the lane and pulled away. THE BIG
MOZZ stalked the leader through early stages, bid through the turn, stayed on three wide through the lane and cleared second best. KATIE'S NOTION
tracked the pace through early stages, launched a three wide bid around the turn, stayed on three to four wide through the lane and secured show. IMAGE
MAKER raced in tight at the break, advanced to race midpack, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and needed
more for late impact. CHAUFFEUR raced in the back, came three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GALWAY LAD angled inside in early
stages, saved ground around the turn and failed to kick on in the lane. RAHMER sped to the lead at the start, got collared by the winner leaving the
backstretch, remained in contention around the turn then retreated in the lane. CALLYOURIGHTBACK raced near then in the back and never reached close
contention.
