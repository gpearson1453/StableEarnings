Footnotes
BELLA'S BACK grabbed the lead soon after the start, briefly raced under pressure from COME ON KAT then shook free leaving the backstretch, hustled
along three to four wide into the lane, had plenty left in reserve and remained clear. TIZ DONNA BELLA tracked the pacesetter along the outside, launched
a bid for BELLA'S BACK around the turn, sustained a steady outside bid through the lane and finished second best. SHESAHEATWAVE veered in at the
start and bumped with MONGOLIAN WINDOW, raced in range through early stages, stayed on two wide through the lane and churned on for a share. JUST
GRACE hustled up around the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked the late needed kick for impact. DIEM NOW was ridden along three to four wide
around the turn and failed too rally in the lane. MONGOLIAN WINDOW got bumped by SHESAHEATWAVE at the start, remained in the back, saved ground
around the turn and had no response. COME ON KAT raced up close in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

SPENDAHOLIC sped to the lead and angled closer to the inside at the start, showed the way into the turn then came under attack from JAQUET at the
quarter pole, came out turning for home, shook free, dug in gamely under firm handling and remained clear. PARLEY STREET raced off the early pace,
responded three to four wide in the lane, closed willingly and gained second best. REELFOOT raced in range along the outside, angled in late on the turn,
moved up the inside to loom a threat at the furlong marker, chased on evenly in deep stretch and got edged for place. JAQUET was forwardly placed sitting
just off the early leader, moved up to challenge SPENDAHOLIC at the quarter pole, briefly matched strides then flattened in the final furlong. FREIBURG
was ridden along off the early pace, coaxed four wide turning for home, angled in a couple paths under pressure and had no late response. J SERINO raced
in early contention then faded midway around the turn. COUNTRY ROAD hopped awkwardly at the start and came away slowly, raced wide in the back and
never menaced. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TRIBAL BID raced up close along the rail, moved up the inside turning for home and dueled for the lead, battled on gamely through the lane, gained a slim
lead in deep stretch and held under a driving finish. OUR LITTLE TIGER tracked the top trio into the turn then launched a four wide bid at the head of the
lane, responded under steady pressure, steadily edged up closer and ran out of time. MULLIGAN raced up close then moved up three wide at the head of
the lane, dueled gamely three deep into into final stages then lacked a closing kick. J T'S LA NENA held a slim lead around the turn, dueled between foes at
the head of the lane, battled back into late stages then gave way. ELDORADO DREAM raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and never
threatened. LE TUB veered in awkwardly and came away slowly at the start, was ridden along the outside into the lane and failed to respond. RACE WAS
