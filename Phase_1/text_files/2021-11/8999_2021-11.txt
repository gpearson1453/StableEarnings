Footnotes
GOVERNOR ARTHUR settled just off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid on the turn, gained ground leaving the bend to confront the dueling
pacesetters inside of the sixteenth marker and drew clear in the late going. LASTBESTHOPE dueled for pace duties with HANDSOME ACCOUNT through
the turn from a two wide path, continued to be on terms with that rival into the final sixteenth but was caught and outfinished by the winner while holding for
second. HANDSOME ACCOUNT dueled with LASTBESTHOPE on the front end through the turn while along the inside, kept up that battle into the final
sixteenth but was caught by the winner and outkicked in the late stages. TEST DRIVE tracked the dueling pacesetters into the turn and weakened in the
stretch drive. LOOKIN FOR GOLD was away slowly and settled off of the early pace, was five wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HEY MATE tracked SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS in the early going from the two path, lost ground to that foe off of the bend but mounted a bold late kick in
the final sixteenth to prevail. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS was away well and set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead leaving the turn but was
caught while on the left lead inside of the sixteenth marker and was a clear second over the rest. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT chased the pace from a four wide
path on the turn and finished evenly in the drive to hold third. BRAZENLY saved ground while chasing the pace on the turn and did not mount a late rally.
JUST WATCH ME NOW was forwardly placed through the turn while stalked the pace from the three path and weakened in the stretch. SPEEDING STYLE
was away a bit slowly, chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
TICK TOCK stalked the early pace, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, closed fast in the final sixteenth and was up in time to tag DESERT FOG for
the win. DESERT FOG set the pace from a ground saving position, had a clear lead into the stretch, was tagged in the final strides by TICK TOCK and held
for second over and oncoming rival. JAN JAN CAN was unhurried in the early going, rallied three wide leaving the turn and was gaining on the top two in the
final sixteenth but just missed for the place while clear of the rest for the show. CLOCHARD STREET had no early speed while saving ground on the turn
and found her best stride in the late stages. AFTER SUNDOWN tracked DESERT FOG along the turn from the two path, gave ground leaving the turn and
was outfinished in the drive. KEEPINMYPROMISE was away slowly and was hustled to chase the pace, was four wide on the turn and did not have a late
kick in the stretch. BRASTIKA chased the pace from the inside and did not have a late rally in the drive.

Footnotes
STARRY SIERRA was off alertly and set the pace through the turn while being pressured by IKE BUTTE, was met by that rival leaving the turn, dueled for
the final furlong and dug in gamely in the final stages to prevail. IKE BUTTE tracked STARRY SIERRA through the turn from a three wide position, gained
on that foe leaving the turn, dueled through the lane while inching closer and was gamely bested while clear of the rest. WOLF MOON WILSON sat off of
the early pace on the turn while three wide, closed willingly in the stretch but could not reel in the top pair. ONE LAST THOUGHT steadied in tight quarters
along the backstretch, stalked the pace on the turn while two wide between foes and lacked a late response in the stretch run. ROISTER stalked the pace
from the inside, gained ground leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. SILENT BULLET was off slow and was a bit slow into stride, was two
wide on the turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch run. WIND IN HIS SAIL was forwardly placed to track the pace from a four wide path on the turn and
gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
TOLONISITO saved ground while settling off of the early pace, continued to save ground on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and surged in the final
sixteenth to prevail. NORTH SEA sat just off of the early pace while two wide, tipped out to challenge PRAYER OF JABEZ leaving the turn, took the lead
from that one inside of the furlong marker but was passed in the final strides by the winner, while besting the rest. PRAYER OF JABEZ broke through the
gate prior to the start, was away fast and set the pace while being pressured through the turn, was confronted by NORTH SEA inside of the furlong marker
and was outkicked in the late going. NUESTRO ENGREIDO pressed the pace from the inside through the turn, was asked for run inside of the furlong
marker and was outfinished in deep stretch. FLOYD KNOWLES settled just off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn and finished evenly in the drive.
ROYAL 'N RANDO chased the early pace, was two wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally in the stretch run. GALLANT OAK was forwardly placed
while stalking the pace through the turn from the three path, gave ground leaving the turn, took up off heels inside of the sixteenth marker and weakened in
the late going. TIZ A THRILL was a bit slow early and was outrun into the turn while three wide and did not rally in the stretch run. WILL IS CHILL had no
early speed, was four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

BOLD ARTICLE was away in good order and set the fractions while being prompted, was pressured by CIRCULODEGANADORAS leaving the second turn
but dug in a held to prevail in a drive. CIRCULODEGANADORAS prompted the pace through the second turn from a three wide position, gained ground
leaving the turn to challenge BOLD ARTICLE but was outkicked in the late stages while besting the rest. TOTALLY NORMAL stalked the pace through the
second turn, gained ground off of the turn and continued that run to close well for the show. A J ROCK was a bit slow leaving the start, settled toward the
rear in the early going, improved position along the second turn while four wide, continued that run through the stretch but was outfinished in the late going.
MANGOTANGO sat off of the pace through the second turn and lacked a late rally in the drive. NORTHERN ROSE was unhurried in the early stages, was
four wide on the second turn and did not offer a late kick in the stretch. MALIBU JEWEL was forwardly placed while stalking the early fractions through the
backstretch, gave ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MISS EVER READY was unhurried through the early going while saving ground, swung out to six wide for the drive, closed fast through the lane and was
up in time to nail SKY ON ICE for the win in the final strides. SKY ON ICE sat just off of the early pace, improved position on the second turn while three
wide, took the lead heading into the stretch, was kept to task under right handed urging through the lane but was nailed in the final strides by MISS EVER
READY, while clear of the rest. LA REINE'S LEGACY was away alertly and set pressured fractions through the second turn, was confronted by SKY ON
ICE leaving the second turn and tired in the drive, though held for the show. SUMMER APPARITION stalked the pace while saving ground through the turn
and did not offer a late rally in the stretch run. HALF HOPING settled off of the early pace, improved position on the second turn while two wide but lacked a
late response in the stretch run. TORQUAY attended to the pace through the second turn while two wide and weakened in the stretch run. OLIVE YOU
MORE stalked the pace through the backstretch, lost ground while three wide on the second turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
WORTHY OF MAGIC dueled with POWER SURGE through the opening fractions while two wide, continued to battle with that stubborn foe inside of the
furlong marker and wore that one down in the final sixteenth while holding over an oncoming runner-up. SQUARE FUN stalked the dueling pacesetters from
a three wide path on the turn and kept on in the stretch to win the nod for the place. POWER SURGE was away alertly and dueled on the front end with
WORTHY OF MAGIC through the turn, battled back against that rival through the final furlong and grudgingly gave in while tiring in the final stages, just
missing for the place. PRAY TO AN ANGEL chased the pace from the midflight while two wide on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch run. AVERY ON
POINTE saved ground while stalking the pace on the turn, lost position nearing the quarter-marker and finished evenly in the late going. GETAWAY
CHARM settled off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch run. TIME TO SMILE sat off of the early pace, was four wide
on the turn and did not have a late kick in the drive. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY had no speed in the early stages, was four wide on the turn and did not rally in
the stretch run. NIZHONI YEE had no early speed and was not a threat. ALISO BEACH was shuffled at the start, was outrun into the turn and was not a
factor.
