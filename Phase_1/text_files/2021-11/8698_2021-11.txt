Footnotes
DREAMIT vied for the early advantage, raced three wide around the final turn, rallied down the home stretch, drove clear and proved the best. LAST
DESTINY dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final turn, drove clear, couldn't match strides with the winner down the lane, but was best of
others. MISS MABELEE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn, made a bid and proved third best. CAJUN SHOTS lacked
early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. MIDNIGHT TRIP pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened late.
GOTTABEGOLDEN raced within contention, came around the final turn four wide, weakened and finished evenly. SAFE KEEPING void of early speed, had
a wide trip and raced evenly near the back. MISS MIRACLE GIRL pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. GRACE'S GAL bobbled at the start,
always raced near the back and was no threat. STORMY COLLISION lacked early speed, saved ground around the second turn and showed little.

Footnotes
THIRTYEIGHT dueled for the early lead, drove clear and won under steady urging. EL MIC TIESUN broke poorly, racing in the rear, made a late rally and
got up for second. ELISHER pressed the pace, raced three wide around the turn, was close throughout and got caught late for second. WAITIN' ON A
WOMAN raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LULLABY BANDIT raced near the middle of the pack, finished wide and put
forth an even effort. BOUJIE ONE hopped at the start, raced near the back and was never a threat. TIGARD BABES dueled on the front end, saved ground
around the turn and faded. RENE'S PRINCE raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and faded. BRUSH WITH CAUTION broke poorly and
was never close.
