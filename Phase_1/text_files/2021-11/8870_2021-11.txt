Footnotes
SHORT CUT raced off the embattled duo in the opening quarter, moved up three wide to engage the top pair for the lead near the quarter pole, held a slight
edge turning for home, was awkward in stride and drifted out at the head of the lane, lost command, quickly straightened out under pressure, moved back
up near the sixteenth pole, took a slim lead and held firm under a driving finish. LUCKY CHANCE raced off the clear trio through early stages, closed the
gap along the outside late on the turn, shifted in to race three wide in the upper stretch, raced in striking distance of the late lead but could not get by.
TAMARANDO'S MINE vied outside of GIVE A LITTLE into the turn, took on the added challenge of the eventual winner near the quarter pole, held clear on
top a furlong out then failed to hold off the top two finishers in the final sixteenth. GIVE A LITTLE vied inside of TAMARANDO'S MINE through early stages,
battled back around the turn, could not match strides in the upper stretch and gave way along the inside. TONOFSUMMERFUN was off a step slow at the
start, trailed in the last flight and had no response. RAISE THE STAKES was never in contention.

LARRY'S LEGEND raced up close just off the early leader, tipped out a path leaving the backstretch and remained forwardly placed around the turn, was
set down two wide for the drive, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of MAJESTIC STREET and got up late. MAJESTIC STREET was away quickly from the
outside, cleared on top and took the inside position, held firm around the turn, came under left then right handed pressure, dug in gamely, held off the bid
from determined LARRYS LEGEND and failed to hold off the challenge on deep stretch. MACCHIATO D'ORO settled in the opening quarter then hustled
three to four wide around the turn, sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and secured a share. EXTREMELY WICKED was ridden along two to
three wide around the turn, took the inside position in the lane and failed to kick on under pressure. CLASSIC LUCK raced in the back, hustled along three
wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.

CHILL HAZE sprinted to a clear lead and angled in soon after the start. held firm still unleashed around the turn, came two to three wide into the lane,
responded under pressure and finished clear. HERMANO raced near midpack in the early stages, saved ground into the lane, gained position, stayed near
the inside and just lasted for second best. A NEW TREND was off slow at the start, saved ground through early stages then angled out around the turn,
sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and just missed place. ROCKET POWER raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the
lane and lacked the needed kick for impact. TORO DE TORO raced up close and chased the leader around the turn then gave way in the final furlong.
COASTLINE SERMON lacked speed, saved ground entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. PURELY GIVEN was ridden along off the early pace,
came three wide into the lane and had no late response. OVER EZ chased in contention around the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MAYBEE A DIVA was forwardly placed in opening stages,, vied three wide around the turn, battled on with a slight edge over ADRIENNE'S PRODIGY
through the lane and drive clear late. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY held a slim lead in early stages, vied inside around the turn, battled on with MAYBEE A
DIVA in the lane and failed to kick on with rival late. PLUM WILD raced up close out of the gate, vied two wide between rivals around the turn, could not
move on with the top pair at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and cleared show. CLEVER LIL SIS raced up close four wide in early stages,
weakened off the top trio around the turn, came four wide into the lane and failed to move on. RANDOM PLEASURE lacked speed, raced four to five wide
into the lane and failed to move into contention. REDHAWK showed brief response up the inside in the opening quarter then weakened.
