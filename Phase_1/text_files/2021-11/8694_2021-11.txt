Footnotes
BEVERLY'S CHARGE chased the the two rival duel into the turn while in the three path, moved to challenge the leader in late turn while under minimal
urging, was asked briefly into the lane hand ridden to the sixteenth pole then wrapped up with a sixteenth to go. OFFALY FAST vied for the lead while two
wide through mid-turn, led and was put under pressure from the winner soon after, was no match for the top one through the lane but stayed on to finish
clear for the place spot. HILLSTONE MARTINI vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, gave way to the runner-up after mid-turn and was no match
for the top one into the lane then kept to the task to save the show spot. MY ANGELICA was in the three path through the turn and never a serious threat.
VERKLEMPT was never a menace while in the two path. BOURBON BUNS was always last while saving ground.

Footnotes
GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE pressed the pace from between rivals into the turn, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths pole, moved into the lane with a
clear lead while near the inside then drew away when asked for more. SUGAR DOG FOX was off awkwardly and settled to the back into the turn, raced in
the three path through the first turn, continued off the inside into the far turn when not far back, came into the lane from the two path with aim on the leader,
could not gain on that one but kept on to be clearly second best. UGO raced in the five to the three path through the first turn, continued off the inside into
the far turn, was asked for more in late turn, lost contact with the winner into the lane while in the four path and weakened through the final sixteenth. CAPE
MARCO DRIVE raced in the three to the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the four path and tired. WILSHIRE DIAMOND set the pace
from along the inside into the backstretch, was put under pressure from two others down the backstretch and into the far turn, could not keep up after
mid-turn and faded. CHARLES T steadily faded while in the two path.

Footnotes
DASH OF SIMPLICITY chased the pace from the three path into the turn, bid after mid-turn, quickly cleared into the late turn, widened into the lane while
under a drive, extended the lead inside the eighth pole then geared down late. RHAPSODY IN GREY set the pace while along the inside, had no answer for
the winner in late turn then kept on through the lane to be clear for the place spot. LUSH BE A LADY stalked the pace from the two path into the far turn,
began losing ground to the top two in late turn then finished well clear of others. QUITE WHIMSICAL raced in the four to the three path through the far turn
when in mid-pack and lacked a response. NOT A ROLE MODEL was bothered between rivals and checked sharply soon after the start, moved up along the
inside to chased the pace from the two path into the far turn then was empty. SHARP LIFE was bumped and forced out early, raced along the inside and
was never in it. GET STORM AWAY in tight and steadied early, raced in the wo path and was always outrun.

Footnotes
WE ALL SEE IT stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, gained the lead in mid-turn, cleared into the lane then drew off through the final
eighth. RONNIE'S VICE raced in the two path into the far turn, was behind a wall approaching mid-turn, shifted to the four path in late turn, came into the
lane from the four path and was up for the distant place spot. ROWLEY'S DREAM was in the two path through the turn, moved up to take aim on the winner
into the lane then weakened late to lose the place spot. CONSULATE was never a serious factor while in the two or three path through the far turn. ORDER
OF THE DAY vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn then gave way in mid-turn. FIRST COUNT was in tight at the start, hustled up through traffic
to vie for the lead through the first turn, continued between rivals nearing the eighth pole while still near the lead then was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
LIL EVIE stalked the pace in the two path, was blocked at the quarter pole, angled four wide at the eighth pole, rallied, dueled late and prevailed under
confident handling. CACTUS FLOWER led in the two path, went clear briefly in the stretch, dueled late and was out nodded. LASHES pressed the pace
outside of the leader, bid at the three-eighths pole, then gave way in the stretch. TORTE stalked in the two path, then had no bid. CHELSEA'S STRENGTH
stalked the pace in the three path, then faded. RE ANTE and SISTER JUSTICE did not have bids.
