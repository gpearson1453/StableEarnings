winner late. DILLON ROCKS was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. BECKHAM
JAMES was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. LOLLY EXPRESS was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SENSEMAKER broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going

ANGELO'S PRIDE lacked early speed, moved into a contending position before going a half, moved up from the inside to take command nearing the
quarter, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with something left. SPIRIT MISSION chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout but
could not match strides with the winner in the drive. PLUM LUCKY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. INDY'S OUTLAW raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the
second turn and failed to menace. KENZOU'S RHYTHM chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
gained a brief lead and gave way in the drive. GOLD TREASURE lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. WILD WILD
KINGDOM sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going three-quarters.

LOOPY sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY tracked the winner from
the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole, could not reach that rival but finished willingly. HURRICAIN HUNTER lacked early speed, raced three-wide
through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good courage. WHOA NESSIE chased the leaders while racing
three-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. MS SALLY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. MINE ME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

FIRST CALL tracked the pace of DON WITH THE WIND from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off.
DON WITH THE WIND broke sharply to duel for the lead with STRETFORD END from the inside, vied with that rival into mid-stretch and gave way.
STRETFORD END was away in good order to duel for the lead with DON WITH THE WIND while racing three-wide, vied with that foe and gave way
through the final furlong. HERZEN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MARCH ON LINCH raced off
the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. COLORADO CANDY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not
menace. LIL' NINJA showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HALF COCKED lacked early speed, was pulled up
after the opening quarter and vanned off.

Footnotes
SEATTLE SEE YA stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and quickly drew off.
SHOTGUN RIDER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead and
yielded to the winner through the final furlong. BLUES RAPPER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into
the stretch and finished with some late run. UNCONSCIOUS POWER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going
three-quarters. MIDNIGHT LUCK raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. WED O'S CHAMP was
forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. NORTH FORK lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, FRACTIONAL TIMES AND THE FINAL TIME WERE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
PLAYOFF BOUND was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore soon after and drew off with complete
authority. BLUE AZUL set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the half and yielded to the winner through the final quarter.
MORE POWER TO HIM was never far back, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly late. TEDDY TIME was off a step slow, lagged
early, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain late. GORDY'S RULES was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and weakened. DAVID NOSE BEST pressed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. WICKED FORTITUDE hit the gate at the start, lacked
early foot, raced between foes into the lane and did not offer a bid. LIL LATIGO showed brief speed, steadied nearing the half mile marker and weakened.
