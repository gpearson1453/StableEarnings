Footnotes
LEGENDARY GIFT stalked the pace from the three path then floated out slightly to make a bid on the turn and cleared the field and drew off. ONE TIME
AROUND tracked the leaders from the three path then battled down the stretch and was able to hold the place. MISS DIAL was hustled along in the two
path just off the leader then led briefly and challenged foe in the stretch for the place but weakened. HERE COMES LOVIE was allowed to settle in the three
path made a three wide bid on the turn to have her best strides late. MADISON JOY was allowed to settle on the inside but didn't have enough late. IT'S
TIME BABY broke well then was placed just off the pace on the inside and faded. OAK HILL SENIORITA failed to menace. PUMP IT was not a factor.
MOM'S PRAYER sprinted to the early lead then steadily retreated. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

ALIGNED INTEREST was rushed to contention while being four wide then vied for the lead from the two path made a bid on the turn and drew off in the
stretch. THE THIMBLE stalked the pace from the two path and made a late bid to be up for the place. GOTTATAKEHIMTO was allowed to settle and
steadily advanced to make a four wide rally on the turn to be up for the show. SHACK PARTOUT broke alertly to set the clear pace for a half and gave way.
DOUBLE PRIORITY was placed just off the pace on the inside but raced one paced. JR'S SAUVAGE raced in the middle of the pace on the inside but was
not a threat. ZION'S CALL had an awkward start and was never a factor. ROBTADI STORM chased the leaders from the three path made an advance on
the backstretch but faltered.

at the start then was rushed to the lead to set all the pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch. BLAZING CHARM raced in the middle of the pack
and made a three wide bid on the turn to be best of rest. LADY AVE was well placed on the inside then made a mild bid going into the final turn and faltered.
MIAMI ROSE was unhurried early and passed tiring rivals. MARIPOSA D'ORO was allowed to settle but was not a threat. MISS BILLIE K was placed on the
inside in the middle of the pace and gave way.

MOSTLY AWESOME stalked the pace from the two path then dueled with leader around the turn and into the stretch, wore down the leader to prevail.
FRIENDLY AND KIND stumbled slightly at the start then rushed to the lead to set all the pace while dueling around the turn and into the stretch but tired.
SUPER LEGS was unhurried early and steadily advance, galloped in to be the best of rest. NANA'S JOY was allowed to settle, made a three wide bid on
the turn but was empty in the drive. HONEST N LUCKY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside but was not a threat. MITCH'S PINS tracked the

Footnotes
RARE STRAIN tracked to leaders from the two path then angled out mid turn and dueled down the stretch and dug in to prevail. CHIEF CHEETAH was well
placed started to move up on the backstretch while racing four wide then dueled from mid turn to the wire and was denied. TYLER'S ADMIRAL stalked the
pace from the three path then dropped back but made a late bid to be up for the show. REAL BRAVE hopped at the start then stumbled slightly and was
unhurried early, made a late rally to have his best strides late. TWILITE LIASON was placed just off the pace moved to take the lead briefly and weakened.
LAST BATTLE was allowed to settle and made a mild bid on the backstretch but failed to menace. BRITHASGOLDENCENTS was fractious in the gate was
able to set the early pace but then steadily faded. DISIDE was not a factor. HOPE FOR CHANGE saved ground to no avail. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
