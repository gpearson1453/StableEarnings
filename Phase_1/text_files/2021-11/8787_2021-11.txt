Footnotes
CAUMSETT angled in while going to the front, dragged herself clear of the rest of the field, showed the way in the two path, responded well when asked
near the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong and held under steady urging.
SARATOGA GAZE moved in while taken under a strong hold early, pulled hard on the bit under restraint, was reserved on the inside, saved ground through
the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out in pursuit of the winner near the furlong marker and finished willingly to narrowly get the place. LADY
THORNHILL was taken under a tight hold early then reserved towards the rear in mostly the two path, remained under tight restraint on the far turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch and finished with late energy to just miss the place but earned the show. OUT OF SIGHT was
taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated inside of a foe in the second flight, ranged up two in the two then three path on the final turn,
was asked for her best in upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then missed the show. DUCKPHAT saved
ground on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, moved closer at that point, was driven five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SALUKI was asked to establish early position, went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the
outside, moved closer in the three then four path on the final turn and came up empty. ESCAPEWITHFRIENDS went two to three wide around the opening
bend, was reserved on the outside, traveled two to three wide on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole and failed to respond. BARREL OF BLISS
stumbled at the start, lugged out some into the first turn and trailed.

Footnotes
EXXTOP brushed at the start by LITTERBOX due to pressure from FOREST SPIRIT breaking in a step, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and
then along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying up
the inside to engage a duel nearing the sixteenth marker, had that pair of foes come inwards and slipped up the rail to take command in the last jumps to the
wire and prevail on the line. FOREST SPIRIT broke in a step at the start bumping LITTERBOX into EXXTOP, prompted the pace between foes three then
two wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking command straightened away, dug in dueling with
HANGAR ONE to his outside through to the finish getting caught in the final strides to his inside and was forced to settle for the place honors. HANGAR
ONE got away to an awkward beginning, ranged up outside to prompt the leader from the five path down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dueled with the aforementioned foe through to the finish getting collared in the last
jumps in tandem while safe for the show honors. GREAT WORKOUT chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. BLACK IRISH bobbled at the break and
recovered under coaxing to establish the front and show the way in hand from the two path under pressure from a pair, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the final furlong. FLIPPING FUN chased four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LITTERBOX got bumped at the start by FOREST SPIRIT and
in turn brushed EXXTOP, chased three then two wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MO
MISCHIEF hustled from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
TASS went three wide on the first turn, was well placed while settling well behind the runaway leader in second position, gained in the two path on the far
turn, made a bid while carried four wide into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging.
ATHWAAQ opened up in the two path around the opening turn, showed the way with a large advantage, saw the lead diminish while inside on the far turn,
was asked coming to the quarter-pole, floated out under pressure into upper stretch, led determinedly under a drive into the final sixteenth and was denied
while just able to get the place. WAR CANOE went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back of the field, rounded the far turn in the two
path, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole, fought with good courage to the wire and just missed while able to get the
show. BLUE ATLAS was reserved on the inside, moved closer while continuing to save ground on the final turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and also
finished with good courage but missed the trifecta in a blanket finish. FIVE ALARM ROBIN was hustled from the gate, traveled around the first turn in the
two path, was reserved on the outside, moved from the two path to the four path on the final turn, was carried six wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick. FLASHING RED settled on the inside, was roused on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.
EQUAL MEASURE went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and
failed to rally. LAGOM went around the first turn in the two path, was rated on the outside, moved closer in the three path on the far turn, was carried five
wide into upper stretch then paused near the three-sixteenths, dropped in shortly thereafter and came up empty.

Footnotes
CORE CONVICTION forwardly placed after the start, advanced to take command with five and a half furlongs to run and showed the way in hand just off the
inside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down spinning from the two path at that station before taking to the inside straightened
away, drew off under a drive to prevail. WAXMAN stumbled at the start pecking the ground but only conceding about a length to the front, chased just off the
inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing half a mile from home and lost ground fading through the turn to near the rear of the field, spun two to
three wide for home, tipped out at the three-sixteenths to the outside five to six paths off the rail and showed late interest to come again and procure the
place honors. ROCK SUGAR bumped at the start by KHAFRE, who broke outwards, chased four wide down the backstretch and through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths and angled in to spin just off the inside for home, then weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors.
DISCO PHAROAH chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired. TOTAL EFFORT chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. KHAFRE broke out at the start bumping ROCK SUGAR, led early on before being displaced
from command by CORE CONVICTION, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired.
SCALDING brushed at the start by STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT, chased three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along
from three furlongs out, went three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
GRADED ON A CURVE settled while saving ground, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out some while rallying in upper stretch, closed strongly to get
the lead into the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. GHOST GIANT went three wide around the opening bend, was reserved on the
outside, traveled two to three wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch and finished well to just miss while able to get the place. CHULAINN
brushed with a foe departing the gate, was taken under a strong hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path under stout restraint, dropped to the rail
midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and gained to earn the show.
DANZIGWITHTHESTARS went around the first turn in the two path, was rated in third position on the outside, came under urging in the three path late on
the far turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. JACK THE CAT was reserved on the inside, swung six wide into upper stretch and
improved position but missed the superfecta. MATTY'S EXPRESS went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then
responded well under a drive in upper stretch, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken. MO READY brushed with a foe at the start, tracked the
pace on the outside in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong and tired. MICROSCOPE went four wide on the first turn,
was reserved on the outside, traveled around the far turn in the two path under urging and failed to threaten. OPT went three wide on the first turn, settled
near the back, saved ground while asked on the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and was no factor. QUIET OUT EAST was caught five wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A TIMING

Footnotes
REPO ROCKS stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leaders in the four path on the turn, took over at the five-sixteenths, shook clear into upper
stretch, drew off while shaken up into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much
the best. HIM SHE KISSES disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and
proved no match while narrowly able to get the place. CHARLIE FIVE O bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased
inside to the two path on the turn and just missed the place while clear for the show. ROCCO STRONG lost his footing some at the start, dropped back
while in hand outside the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ONE WHIRLWIND
RIDE moved out while settling towards the rear, shifted further out and brushed with a foe late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, drifted out
outside the furlong marker and came up empty. TWELTH MAN broke slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, was urged along towards the back,
brushed with a foe while forced out late on the backstretch, was caught six wide early on the turn then dropped to the four path, moved back to the six path
late on that bend, was carried out outside the furlong marker and capitulated. COPA showed speed then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn and
tired. MR FANTASY bumped soundly with an opponent at the start, recovered well to dispute the pace, dropped to the rail under urging on the turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
SALINO was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked near the quarter-pole, fought on even
terms for the lead into the final furlong, battled gamely to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) went three to four wide on
the first turn, was rated on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, pursued the leaders in the stretch, gained on the winner late and missed while just up
for the place. KEMBA was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked inside the quarter-pole, fought on well under confrontation from the
winner in the stretch and just missed the place but earned the show. ADRIATIC ROSE saved ground in the back half of the field, was asked for her best
while off the inside in upper stretch and finished with late energy for the last spot in the superfecta. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE saved ground on the first turn,
settled off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, came out some then bumped with a foe in upper stretch and gained but missed the superfecta.
FREDDYMO FACTOR went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went three wide on the final turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE was taken in hand early, raced in the two path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace while keen,
saved ground through the far turn, came under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. BELLA PRINCIPESSA went three to four wide on the
first turn, settled off the pace, was asked three to four wide on the far turn, bumped with a foe in upper stretch and failed to rally. LEMON TAFFY rounded
the first turn in the two path, settled in the back half of the field, went three to four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, had a rival clip her
heels near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. ZERENIA bobbled at the start, went three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch, moved
out around the three-sixteenths and clipped heels then checked and had nothing left. EMMA AND I saved ground towards the rear of the field and never
reached contention. DELLA LUTE dropped back after the start, went three wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear and showed little. MILE FRACTION WAS
