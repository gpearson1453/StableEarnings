Footnotes
COPPER CHARM was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, quickly opened a clear lead and held
off the closing JUDY WITH GRACE to prevail. JUDY WITH GRACE bobbled at the start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn
and was gaining on the winner late. BACK TO BUSINESS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way after going
three-quarters. BIG NEWS COMING showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and failed to rally. SEVEN POINTS chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. PANCAKES AND BEER pressed the pace of BACK TO BUSINESS while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.

FICTIONAL pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteens marker, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run
and drew off with authority. GOLD ROSE was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
was up for the place. SILLY NOTION lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FINISHED MY P H D broke sharply
to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged nearing the half, vied and gave way through the final furlong. RUN FOR BELLE settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. TWIRLY GIRL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. DADDYS LITTLE GIRL lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace.

CLUBHOUSE SAINT was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with LILA'S LUCKY LADY, vied with that rival into mid-stretch, responded
when challenged by IF YOU WANT IT with a furlong to run and gamely held that rival off the prevail. IF YOU WANT IT was never far back, raced three-wide
through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was gaining on the winner late to just miss. LILA'S LUCKY LADY broke sharply to

Footnotes
EVER VIGILANT pressed the pace of OLD TOY while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival and
drew clear through the closing yards. PARAWAN pressed the pace while racing five-wide, stayed on well in the drive but could not match strides with the
winner. OLD TOY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. EMMA'S A BEAST settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. C C THE BARTENDER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. SECRETS OF MY SOUL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
SUMMER LOVE was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.

ROWDYROOSTER raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, forged to the front with a furlong to run and drew clear.
OBSTRUCTED VIEW was away in good order to set the pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by JUGGLES into the lane, could not
match strides with the winner through the final furlong but was clearly second best. JUGGLES tracked the leader from the inside, angled out nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, offered a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied and gave way. MUSKYMAN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. ESTEEMED settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. MI MALDITO AMOR raced four-wide through the
first turn, lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

proved best late. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner
nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly late. STONE CREEK stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, stayed on well in the drive and
finished willingly. SQUARED STRAIGHT was pinched back at the start, raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished
evenly. GATO DE RAYO lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, drifted out slightly nearing the quarter and failed to menace. CRAZY AL

SAVED BY ZERO was away alertly then appeared hard to rate, opened a clear margin and drew off with complete authority. SUCCESS RATE chased the
winner while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the placee. JEN LORS LEGACY broke sharply to chase the
leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. PRIVATE JOKE settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed rally.
WORKING raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. DOBY showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. MO GEE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. REGAL CANDY showed no
early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten.
