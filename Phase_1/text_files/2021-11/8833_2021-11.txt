ROYALLY BLUE coaxed from the gate, ranged up to establish command just inside six furlongs remaining and showed the way lightly coaxed in the two
path, tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding her lone threat and bay when holding sway to
the finish. NEXT TUESDAY led early on, raced four wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, advanced
outside to apply pressure when placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to chase
the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. AMAZING DREAM coaxed from the start, chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. S
OH S coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. SEIZE
THE WHISKEY coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home,

with nine-sixteenths to go, came under prolonged encouragement at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and was outrun. PRIMA DELLA five

Footnotes
TOP OF THE MINT became restless in the gate when other foes were fractious, came away in good order, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped
from the two path to the rail while dictating terms around the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, drifted out under a strong hand-ride
into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady handling. DAMILANO lightly popped
open the front of his gate prior to the start, broke a half-step slow then was sent, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back into the turn, was
ridden along while two to three wide around that bend and got up for the place while no match for the winner. MAJESTIC TIGER was hustled from the start,
chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened then lost the place but just
held the show. EL MAYOR was fractious in the gate, raced on the inside under urging, moved off the rail midway through the turn, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and tired. GREY GIANT settled towards the rear, was urged two to three wide on the turn, moved out some in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. V PATTERN was fractious in the gate, dropped back to the rear of the field, saved ground under urging on the turn, moved out into the final furlong
and was no factor. BAIL OUT THE BANK broke a half-step slow, was urged on the outside, went four wide under strong urging on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. SUIT OF ARMOR was hustled from the start then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, dropped back four
wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
ABAAN established the front and showed the way three then two wide through the first turn before taking to the inside past the stands for the initial time,
remained along the rail from the point forward patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in and held well kept to task. JARREAU a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, got bumped at the start by the veering in SOUTHERN
DISTRICT, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
GLOUCESTERSHIRE off a beat slow when away to a hesitant start, tracked the pace two to three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. EXPERIENCED saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped out three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the wire. WIN WORTHY steadied at the start when
SOUTHERN DISTRICT veered in front, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. EVIE'S PRINCE coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed tracking the leader in closest aim in the two path, came under
a ride with five-sixteenths to go, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) mostly three wide in pursuit from just
off the pace, remained patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late
stages. SOUTHERN DISTRICT veered in at the start forcing WIN WORTHY to be steadied and bumping JARREAU, tracked two to three wide, came under
coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, tipped out to swing five wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
HEZASTONECOLDFOX angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, responded well when asked near
the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best
under strong urging. BUCKORTWO was away alertly then hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the two path on the turn, dropped
back some under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while up for the place late. SANDRONE brushed with a rival at the start, tracked the pace
on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, made a bid into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just lost the
place while clear for the show. MY FRIEND DUKE bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear on the outside, went three wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and improved position. WHISTLER'S HONOR was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced near the back under
urging, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, shifted further out inside the furlong
marker and also improved position. CALL MY BANKER broke in and bumped hard with a foe, was coaxed along off the pace, navigated the turn in the two
path, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. DEVIOUS BANKER bumped with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, was
roused in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WINETASTIC bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along
off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. LORD BROWNIE was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace, chased inside
on the turn and came up empty. LOOKING TO HEAVEN brushed with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to
respond. CHIEF ENGINEER dropped back on the outside, went four wide on the turn and had nothing left. KANE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was
urged along while well behind, saved ground on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
FOXTAIL coaxed from the gate, established the front after a brief tussle with SUBSIDIARY seven furlongs from home and showed the way in hand three
then two wide, got roused spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in growing leg weary a sixteenth
out and drifted out under a left handed crop and lasted on the wire. SUBIACO coaxed from the start, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
near the rear of the field, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied along the inside
and missed at the finish. VIOLENT TRICK took the overland route six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under
coaxing from three furlongs out, went eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just latch on the winner as she hit the line. INDIAN BELLA
chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. LADY BY
CHOICE three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, bid five wide into upper stretch, then flattened out in the stretch. DOUBLE DOINK five
to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. SUBSIDIARY led early on before tussling briefly with FOXTAIL, settled four then three wide in closest aim of that rival, got put
to coaxing three furlongs out, faded through the latter portion of the turn and went two to three wide for home, then tired in the drive. SWEET MIA five then
four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SWINTON broke a half-step slow, was hustled to the lead, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole,
kicked clear in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. FORTY COMETS chased the pace
down the backstretch, saved ground in pursuit of the leader on the turn, moved out in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. SCHERZANDO
was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch and finished
with good courage for the show. BREW PUB settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed kick. B C GLORY DAYS chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner in
upper stretch and tired. GOT THE GOLD was urged along towards the back, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
SIR WILLIAM broke a half-step slow then was hustled, dropped well behind under urging, saved ground on the turn and showed little. FIVE-EIGHTHS

Footnotes
KING ANGELO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, got set down continuing just off the inside into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. UNCLE GEORGE three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. GONGHEIFATCHOY coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. SARATOGA FLASH
five then four wide in pursuit, got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. STANHOPE two to
three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. SAMAY four then three
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. WAR TERMINATOR five to six paths off the inside
down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide for home and made no impact.
THUNDERBIRD CAFE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under encouragement from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. COTTON five paths off the inside down the backstretch bumped and jostled for position with GIRAMONTE with nine-sixteenths to go
taking a hard hold off heels of rivals in front, settled four wide into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.
CORAGESCONTENDER crossed inside after the start to chase three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. GIRAMONTE away to an awkward start, jostled for position with COTTON to his outside with nine-sixteenths to go, then got
hard held off heels of a rival with half a mile remaining, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along near the quarter pole, swung four wide for home
and tired. CONSTANT KNIGHT seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the

Footnotes
PLUM ALI went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive
in upper stretch and held sway under strong urging. WHITE FROST was rated on the inside, moved a bit off the rail late on the far turn, dropped in from
behind foes in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. MISS DRACARYS rounded the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace,
saved ground on the far turn, moved out under a drive outside the furlong marker and also finished willingly but just missed the place while narrowly able to
get the show. GAM'S MISSION stumbled at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went two then three on the far turn, swung six
wide into upper stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the trifecta. RUNAWAY RUMOUR went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace,
was asked while two then three wide on the far turn and gained some but lacked the needed kick. INVINCIBLE GAL (GB) raced in the three path on the first
turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) pulled
while keen under restraint early, went two to three wide on the turns, swung five wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed kick. FLOWN went three
wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under some urging while two then three wide on the final turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. OUT OF SORTS went three to four wide on the turns, came seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. QUINEVERE
(GER) was reserved on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and failed to rally. BATYAH was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths,
traveled around the first turn in the two path under restraint, tugged hard at the bit while keen near the five-eighths, saved ground on the far turn and also
failed to threaten.
