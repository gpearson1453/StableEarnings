Footnotes
KATHLEEN O. shied out briefly as ROBOZ broke outwards along her inside, crossed to the inside after the start when outrun early on growing detached at
the tail of the field, tipped to the three path five furlongs from home, tipped four wide into the far turn and came under light coaxing three furlongs out, angled
five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting on track inside the eighth pole and offered up a good finish to close stoutly outside the top pair
and was just up in the shadow of the wire to score. MISCHIEVOUS DIANE forwardly placed three paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to
the two path into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth
pole, dug in dueling through to the finish with GREATITUDE to her inside and was nailed in the final jump to the finish. GREATITUDE hustled from the gate,
came out slightly after the start floating DEMANDSRESPECT and PUGLIA outwards, established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed along in the
two path, tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, dug in under a drive and was headed near the eighth pole,
fought on inside dueling to the finish and was forced to settle for the show honors when collared in concert with her main rival in the last stride. PUGLIA got
floated out slightly after the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two then three wide when placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. INTO HAPPINESS coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened in the late stages. DEMANDSRESPECT coaxed from the start, got floated
out slightly after the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened. ROBOZ hustled from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper
stretch and tired.

through the turn, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. DEALING JUSTICE coaxed from the gate,

GIOCARE was hustled from the start, moved out early then was urged along on the far outside, went five wide on the turn, gained coming to the
five-sixteenths, made a bid under a drive at the three-sixteenths then took the lead, shook clear into the final furlong, drew away under a drive until just
outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. MAKE IT IN NY was hustled from the start, moved in early,
settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and earned the place while no match for the winner.
SPEED EFFECT went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, came out under pressure into upper stretch,
lost the lead around the three-sixteenths and weakened but held the show. MR. FIDGET was last to commence then fell well behind while lacking speed,
went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISTER WINSTON was forwardly placed on the outside, chased
in the four path on the turn and came up empty. SCOTTY was hustled from the start, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn
and tired. BELLAMY DOLCE was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

KITTEN MISCHIEF dueled from the four path down the backstretch with CHARMING CHARLIE to his inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and took
over sole command three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, got headed nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in to
engage PREDICTED now in head to head combat through the stretch drive widening away in tandem as a pair from the rest of the field and gamely
prevailed at the end. PREDICTED five paths off the inside just off the duel up front, tucked three wide into the turn and came under coaxing five-sixteenths
from home, advancing on the aforementioned foe to the outside, took over narrow command spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads
through the length of the stretch fighting on gamely to the end while opening up in concert with his main rival but was ultimately denied on the wire. DEBATE
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top pair while well clear of the rest, isolated for the show honors. PIONEERING SPIRIT got bumped at the start by
AMERICAN DAY and was forced to steady off that rival's heels conceding six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased two then
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. EDDIE THE GREAT
bumped at the start by EXCLUSIVE ORDER who broke outwards, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn
coaxed along from midway, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE got brushed at the start when AMERICAN DAY broke
outwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped out to swing six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. CHARMING
CHARLIE broke in at the start and was corrected, dueled three then two wide with KITTEN MISCHIEF to his outside, tucked inside through the turn and was
placed to coaxing near the three-eighths, got headed for command at that station, faded through the latter portion of the turn and took the inside route into
upper stretch, then folded in the drive. WICK LOVES A FIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside just off the duel, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and faltered. EXCLUSIVE ORDER broke out at the start bumping EDDIE THE GREAT, chased seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, tipped five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AMERICAN DAY broke out at the
start bumping PIONEERING SPIRIT and forcing that rival to steady in behind, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went
seven wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
ESOTICA coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under light coaxing advancing to issue a challenge when angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch,
took over command with three-sixteenths remaining and edged away under a drive to prevail. CHASING CARA six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went four then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick. PRETTY CLEVER got guided out after the start to be seven to eighth paths off the rail down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn getting
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on mildly and belatedly for the show honors. TOWERING ORBIT
dueled from the three path early on with BLAME IT ON MARY to her inside, shook off that rival near the nine-sixteenths taking sole command and tucking to
the two path, came under pressure from ESOTICA nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide for home, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and
weakened in the late stages. SHE'S DANCING hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. PENDOLINO a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced four paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide for home and made no impact.
BLAME IT ON MARY dueled early on from the two path with TOWERING ORBIT to her outside, got shaken off by that rival at the nine-sixteenths and tipped
three wide into the turn coming again to apply pressure under coaxing between foes at the three-eighths, got shaken off nearing the quarter pole and went
three wide at that station, then tired in the stretch. ANCIENT BROWN chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

sixteenth, steadied when haven her path taken by the aforementioned foe late and settled for the show. BASELINE DRIVE was well spotted just off the
