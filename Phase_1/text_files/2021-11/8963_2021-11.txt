Footnotes
RED STORM RISEN was off a bit slow from outside, chased three deep before challenging for the lead first time through the stretch, cleared around the
clubhouse turn, opened up a comfortable advantage while moving well off the rail, angled back in for the second bend, roused in the lane and urged a few
times right-handed and remained clear to the wire. EASTERN OCEAN away quickly and sped to the front, ceded control nearing the first turn, stalked the
pacesetter from inside to the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner but stayed on to secure the place. MEDIA BLITZ
traveled in mid-pack off the inside, chased three wide into the lane and never threatened. WHOOPING JAY tracked the pace along the inside, exited the far
turn two wide and could not rally. OVERDUE unhurried in the beginning, saved ground on both turns on the inside and failed to menace. DUBBY DUBBIE
broke a bit slow, settled in the two path, remained two wide on the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
A PAYCHEQUE SMILE well placed behind the top pair while off the inside, bid alongside SHE'S SO SHINY at the three-eighths pole, dueled through the
turn, took control into the lane, then drew away in the stretch run. CLASSICAL ROMANCE bumped rival in the beginning, sat off the pace up the
backstretch, was asked two to three wide around the turn, closed well but had to settle for second best. SHE'S SO SHINY away quickly from outside,
pressed STARSHIP DIPLOMACY early, took over at the seven-sixteenths marker, put that rival away then dueled with the winner around the bend, lost
command into the stretch and weakened to third. BLONDE BOMBSHELL bumped with rival at the start, dropped back early, took the turn three to four wide
and failed to respond when asked. STARSHIP DIPLOMACY set the pace under pressure from the outside, lost command at the seven-sixteenths pole,
dropped back on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE CAMIE sped to the front, vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, kicked clear at the quarter pole and held safely under right-handed
urging. URBAN tracked the pace well off the rail then outside a rival, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend, closed well
and earned the place honors. DARLING DONNA was forwardly placed along the inside, exited the bend two wide, chased within striking distance through
the lane but finished evenly late. EXACTLY WENDY raced off the pace, tucked inside on the turn and could not rally. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN sat off the
pace on the inside, angled three wide on the turn, steered out in the stretch and summoned a mild response to improve. AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS stalked
the pacesetters from between foes, angled four wide late on the turn and flattened out. SILENT BEAUTY stalked three deep up the backstretch, angled five
wide leaving the turn and could not rally. SO SOFTLY showed early speed between rivals, lost contact the leader with a quarter of a mile remaining and
weakened. GODDESSOF THE NILE off slow to begin, traveled along the inside into the turn, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, remained inside in the
drive and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL broke out, showed early speed three deep up the backstretch, lugged out around the bend while the rider
tried to correct his mount and dropped back, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN WIND forwardly placed in the two path early, prompted the pace while in hand in the middle stages, headed rival and dueled around the
second bend, held a short lead in upper stretch and drew clear in deep stretch. BETITO sped to the front and moved to the rail, set the pace under pressure
up the backstretch, dueled for command on the final turn, lost the lead but fought back through the lane and yielded in the final sixteenth. SYNTHESIS
traveled three wide around the clubhouse turn, stalked the leaders off the rail in the middle stages, remained three wide through the second bend and never
produced a bid. UNBROKEN STAR bumped lightly at the start, got floated out by inner rival and had to steady off heels entering the first turn, chased three
then four wide around the far turn and lacked a needed rally. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE bumped lightly with outside rival leaving the gate, drifted out a bit
early on the first turn, moved out to track the top pair in the two path, tired and was eased in the lane and walked off.

SILARDI broke quickly and sped clear from inside, dueled with MAC DADDY TOO into and around the bend, battled down the stretch and was all out to
prevail. MAC DADDY TOO chased outside rivals early then went up to duel for command, battled through the turn and down the stretch, finished gamely to
the wire but could not get by the winner. CLAYTON DELANEY dropped back and angled to the inside, waited briefly past the quarter pole, angled to the
inside in upper stretch then angled back outside the leaders and was closing fast. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL chased inside then two wide leaving the bend,
bumped twice with rival at the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. ELUSIVE TREAT (GB) raced outside a rival then between foes near the back,
angled four wide on the turn and summoned a mild response to improve. JAMMING EDDY chased between rivals early then was force to check at the
half-mile pole, chased outside a rival then three wide into the lane, bumped twice with rival at the three-sixteenths pole and lacked a late bid. ROOKIE
MISTAKE got shuffled between rivals early, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide leaving the bend and lacked a rally. CARAMELITO chased three
wide into the turn, got floated five into the stretch and failed to threaten. DEPUTY BERNARDINI chased between foes then got crowded early, angled to the

range from off the rail, took the turn four then three wide and held the show. DAMIANO stumbled leaving the gate, traveled along the inside then a bit off the
rail into the drive and failed to rally. INCH broke out, chased five wide into the turn, four wide leaving the bend and could not rally.

stumbled a bit leaving the gate, went up to chase behind the top pair, angled in on the turn, remained inside to the stretch and finished evenly in the furlong
grounds. SQUALOTORO settled off the pace, was driven three wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and finished with late effort. EL TIGRE
TERRIBLE dropped back early, angled out into the clear, navigated the turn five wide and failed to menace. JAZZ HANDS bobbled at the start, stalked the
pace off the rail, went three wide around the turn and weakened. BOLD VOYAGER tracked the top pair on the inside, hugged the rail into the stretch and
flattened out. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased outside rivals, between foes on the turn, exited the bend two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BADGER KITTEN stumbled a bit leaving the gate, angled in on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, bid inside the leader with a furlong to go, took over
in midstretch then cleared with a sixteenth to go and drew away. TWIRLING GRACE stalked along the inside, reeled in the leader on the far turn, took over
leaving the bend, led clear to the eighth pole, relinquished command in midstretch and held the place. BOWL OF CHERRIES tracked the lone leader in the
two path, tipped three wide leaving the far turn, moved out in the stretch and needed to find more in the final sixteenth. AIR FORCE WOMAN broke slow
and propped at the start, ran up on heels and was forced to check, angled to the inside for the first turn, tipped two wide leaving the second bend, angled
out then back inward in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. WITCH MOON unhurried in the beginning, moved out on the backstretch, entered the
stretch six wide and improved position. ACOUSTIC SHADOW allowed to settle off the inside, chased four wide into the lane and flattened out.
CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) was crowded shortly after the start, pulled on the first turn, angled five wide leaving the second bend, lacked room in upper
stretch, angled in and could not rally. MAGICAL WAND was off slow and stumbled leaving the gate, traveled along the inside the moved off the rail in the
middle stages, went two to three wide on the far turn, angled out in the lane and could not rally. WHISTLER'S STYLE went two to three wide around the first
turn, got put in tight past the quarter pole, raced five wide into the drive and weakened. SUEZAAANA cleared quickly and opened up a large lead around the
first turn and backstretch, started to weakened around the final bend, lost command leaving the bend and tired through the lane. ALLISON'S SURPRISE
