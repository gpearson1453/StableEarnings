DURITZ was allowed to settle in the two path angled in on the turn to make a bid and was just up in final strides. ELISHER hustled to the lead from the four
path then was able to set an uncontested pace but was caught in final jump to be second best. TOOCAN DANCE broke to the outside slightly then raced in
the middle of the pack made a bid from the three path on the turn and was up for the show. SHADY'S TURN stalked the pace from the inside and weakened
late in the drive. BREWSTER vied for the lead from the three path and tired. KITKAT KITTEN was unhurried early then made a rail rally. MY PAL GREELEY
broke to the inside and trailed the field but improved position late. UNBRIDLED HOPE saved ground on the inside but was never a factor. BRUSH WITH

Footnotes
DOBBY SUE set a pressured pace throughout but kept to task and drew clear. ZYDECO MUSIC was unhurried early and steadily advanced to make a rail
rally for the place. CLOCKED IN TYME was allowed to settle in the two path then slipped through on the turn to be up for the show. BEAUX TOX tracked
the leaders from the two path and made a mild bid in the stretch to be best of rest. LIL HOT TODDY raced in the middle of the pack in the three path but
was one paced throughout. POINT OF VICTORY pressed the pace from the three path and lacked a late response. KELLYS THE BOSS trailed the field
early in the three path but failed to menace. CHATAIN'S FLYER vied for the lead from the two path and retreated.

SHOW vied for the lead from between horses and lead briefly then battle to keep the lead in the stretch but was no match for the winner. BOSTON
BENBOW was rushed to the lead then battled into deep stretch to be out kicked late. WAGER NO MO was rank early then settled just off leader and ended
up best of rest. SHOETRICK was unhurried early in the two path made a middle move on the backstretch but flattened out. OAK HILL SOLUTION failed to
menace. V. R. FRIENDLYGARY was allowed to settle on the inside but was never a threat. MY PAL PINOT tracked the leaders from the three path and
gave way after a quarter but walked off. FALCON EX was off a step slow then raced wide and was eased but walked off.
