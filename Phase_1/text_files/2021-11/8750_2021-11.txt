Footnotes
PERSEVERING saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn, began an outside bid approaching the eighth pole, and gained ground quickly to pull clear and draw off in the final sixteenth of a mile. BLARNEY
GIRL saved ground around the first turn, tracked the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, finding room
to move through on the rail, drifted out and brushed with MISS HIGH N MIGHTY near the eighth pole and chased the eventual winner home from there, the
best of the rest. MISSEN THE POINT raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge from the two path while racing around the far turn, was carried out slightly when MISS HIGH N MIGHTY ran out entering the stretch, continued to
duel in upper stretch and was outkicked late. GIRLS COUNT pressed the pace between horses while racing around the first turn, dropped back to run in the
middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and finished evenly. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY saved ground around
the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, ran out mildly entering the stretch, carrying
MISSEN THE POINT with her, dueled between horses in upper stretch, began to weaken approaching the eighth pole and was brushed slightly by
BLARNEY GIRL as she dropped back. TWELVE RED ROSES broke slowly, hitting the gate on her way out, trailed the field while saving ground around the
first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was never a threat. STORMY MATTIE raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty from there. SUPREME IRENE
raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to drop back while racing in the three
path around the turn, and continued to tire down the lane.

Footnotes
MAXIMILIANO broke sharply, led early while prompted by MOVE ON OVER, briefly cleared into the back straight before engaged again from the outside by
that same foe, was headed at the seven sixteenths by MOVE ON OVER, continued to attend the pace inside around the far turn, vied inside MOVE ON
OVER into the lane, brushed with him midstretch, got his head in front for good near the furlong mark and edged to a more pronounced lead through the
final furlong. MOVE ON OVER was anxious in the gate, was keen to track the leader early, briefly found himself relegated to the tracking flight into the back
straight before keenly advancing again to attend outside MAXIMILIANO, headed that foe while still racing two wide near the seven sixteenths, vied outside
of MAXIMILIANO into the lane, brushed with him midstretch, lost the lead for good near the eighth pole, continued on willingly but was ultimately second
best. BABA'S BOY broke out and bumped LONESOME DREAM lightly in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair inside of that horse, advanced to
track inside of MOVE ON OVER briefly into the backstretch, continued to track the leading pair as MOVE ON OVER advanced again, tracked the leading
pair down the rest of the back straight and in the two to three path on the far turn, chased the leading pair while all out in the lane but could not reel them in.
RIP IT RYAN settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path around the far turn while still at the rear, swung out four wide into upper stretch, and made a
mild rally between horses under a drive. TOM'S LAST GENERAL chased two wide early, settled in second last into the back straight, raced with the rear of
the main group in the four path around the far turn, was driven three wide in the lane, improved position in upper stretch but flattened out late. LONESOME
DREAM was bumped lightly in the opening strides by BABA'S BOY and bumped into MOVE ON OVER lightly as a result, tracked the leading pair outside of
BABA'S BOY, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn, and offered no rally while drifting out in the lane. ON THE MUSCLE chased inside,
continued toward the rear of the main group in the two to three path on the far turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, stopped from the three
sixteenths, pulled up midstretch and was vanned off.

the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. PIONEEROF NEW YORK pressed
the pace from the two path around the first turn, moved up to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn and tired entering

DEORA STORE raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths
pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong under a drive. INSIDE THE CIRCLE chased the leader on the outside
up the backstretch and into the turn, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the five sixteenths pole, took over the lead with a furlong to go, and
could not go with the winner from there. LOOK AWAY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, and improved
position mildly between horses in late stretch. GOOD YEGG raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
three path, and improved position on the outside down the lane, but was outkicked. DASTARDLY DEEDS brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the
gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, dueled in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. J J'S SOLUTION brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and offered no bid. GREAT PLAINES led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, gave way with three
sixteenths of a mile left to run and continued to tire from there. MUCHOMATIC raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the early going, came
around the turn in the three and four path and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SICILIAN tracked the leader inside of ASTI SKY early, settled back into the turn and chased in the two path well behind the leading pair,
improved when driven two wide in upper stretch, altered out slightly in midstretch when FAST JACK came out, sustained his rally nevertheless, rolled right
past his stablemate approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. FAST JACK was reluctant to load, broke sharply to the lead, set the pace while saving
ground on the turn, drove clear in upper stretch, drifted out slightly midstretch, kept on under a drive, was caught approaching the sixteenth pole, had no
answer, and chased on second best. VITALE broke inward and bumped TRUIST in the opening strides, chased well behind the leading trio, was pushed
along while saving ground on the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and improved under a drive, proved no match for the top two but got up for show
inside the sixteenth. ASTI SKY tracked the leader two wide early, continued to track in close range of the leader in the three path on the turn while well clear
of the rest of the field, was driven into upper stretch, proved no match for FAST JACK, flattened out and lost the show inside the sixteenth mark. SAFE
settled near the rear inside of ROCKET MAN ATTACK early, was hard ridden in the two path toward the rear around the turn, took closer order in upper
stretch but ultimately lacked the necessary finishing kick. TRUIST was bumped by VITALE in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed while saving
ground on the turn, raced in the two to three path under a drive in the lane but proved no threat. ROCKET MAN ATTACK settled near the rear toward the
center of the track down the back straight, raced in second last in the three to four path on the turn, raced into the lane in the six path and offered no bid.

Footnotes
FLYING BUSINESS tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, found room between horses to began a bid
passing the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch, pulled clear with a furlong to go and drifted out from there to the wire. KIANA'S LOVE chased the
frontrunner on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch,
gave way at the eighth pole and weakened from there. KENAI COOL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from
the two path, and gained ground between horses in late stretch. NICE AND TRUE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the three path, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. HIDDEN FIGURE bumped with the horse to his
inside and stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, gained ground entering the stretch and flattened out
from there. APOLLO U ANYWHERE was away from the gate quickly, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground
around the turn and tired in the stretch. BIT MONEY bumped with the horse to his outside and steadied slightly at the break, raced off the pace on the
outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path and was empty from there.

Footnotes
BIG SPORT soon led, took pressure from SUSPECT from the eleven sixteenths, continued to set a pressured pace while racing in the two path on the turn,
took over in upper stretch and was clear past the sixteenth, and held sway even as KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was closing to his outside late. KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE raced four wide with the chasing flight early, improved to track the leading pair outside of EL ASESINO approaching the half, advanced in the
three to four path on the turn to take closer order on the leading pair, was driven four wide into upper stretch, got carried out slightly by the weakening
SUSPECT in upper stretch, kept on under a drive, gained late but could not reel BIG SPORT in. EL ASESINO tracked the leading pair early, chased the
leading trio inside while driven on the turn, continued under a drive inside in upper stretch but could not reel in the leader, proved no match for the top two
late but kept on willingly for the show. D' YANK raced at the inside of the chasing flight early, settled near the rear approaching the half, was pushed along
into the turn and chased in the five to six path, swung six wide into the lane under a drive, and rallied mildly. SUSPECT was sent to press the pace outside
of BIG SPORT, hounded outside that foe from the eleven sixteenths to the top of the stretch, proved no match despite being put to a drive, flattened out
between horses, drifted out in upper stretch, and continued to flatten out gradually. TALKTOEACHOTHER broke outward and awkwardly, lightly bumped D'
YANK in the opening strides, chased between horses early, was pushed along toward the rear in the three path on the turn, came three wide into upper
stretch and proved empty. OLSON was fractious in the gate, settled at the rear, went to a drive near the three eighths while trailing in the five path,
continued five wide into the lane and offered no bid. MISTER KELLY was lightly bumped by TALKTOEACHOTHER in the opening strides, chased three
wide early, advance into the turn to chase two wide outside of EL ASESINO, continued with the middle of the pack to midstretch and emptied out in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
THE LAST OPTION raced in the two path around the first turn, continued off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the four
path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, gained ground on the outside and wore down his rivals late. SYMBOLIST dueled for the lead from the
two path around the first turn, led the way between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, shook clear entering the stretch, and was
caught by a late closer, giving way grudgingly in the final sixteenth of a mile. REDOUX raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn still in the two path and gained ground between horses in the final furlong. ROAR
OF THE LION dropped back to trail the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, got
