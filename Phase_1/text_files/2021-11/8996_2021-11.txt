the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. FIRST COUNT was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. PAYNT YOUR WAGON pressed
the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. AMERICAN CHAVO chased the pace early, was in the four path into the
lane while making a bid but was empty late in the stretch. CLOUD CREEK was never involved. THE Z MAN was bumped and bothered at the start.
BLACKSMITH STRONG was through early. IKE AND JACK had brief speed then folded up.

lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the final stages. MONOLOGUE raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane, altered out down the
lane and finished willingly in the late stages. BOLD LOOKER was a bit slow at the start, raced in the three path along the first turn, was in the four path
along the far turn, in the five path into the lane and ran evenly down the lane. GOOD SOLDIER came in at the start, raced in the three path into the lane and
moved up in the stretch run. ENCOURAGE chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. FULL ON was slow at
