Footnotes
MORELLO broke in brushing the near side stall at the start and was briefly taken in hand when corrected getting away last and conceding three lengths to
the front, advanced after the start to settle just off the pace three wide in pursuit, came under light coaxing spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. INEVTABL CONECTION showed the way in hand along the
inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, kept
on to just hold on for the place honors on the wire. GLEN ECHO chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish to just miss for the place honors. NEVER CHANGE coaxed along chasing four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MUNNY
BOLT forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in
retreat and tired. GUN MAESTRO chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. Please
note due to a Teletimer procedural error the five furlong split was unavailable.

TIMELESS JOURNEY saved ground on the first turn, settled comfortably off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, shifted four wide into the
stretch then moved further out while roused, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail.
MARVELOUS MAUDE bumped with foes on both sides leaving the chute, went three wide around the opening bend, was reserved off the pace, came
under some urging while four wide on the far turn, rallied to make a bid into the final sixteenth but just missed while able to get the place. INSTINCTIVE
saved ground while in hand around the first turn, was taken under a tight hold while off heels late on that bend, raced just off the pace while rated along the
rail, was let out on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong, hesitated near the sixteenth-pole after drifting in
a bit passing the chute, tipped out to the two path shortly thereafter then came between horses and finished willingly to narrowly grab the show on the line.
CARA'S DREAMER broke in and bumped solidly with a rival, bumped with a foe leaving the chute, went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the
outside, traveled three wide on the far turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch, made a bid near the eighth-pole, fought on well in the final furlong but
just missed the show. PURE BODE went to the front, set a solid pace on the inside, came under increasing pressure on the final turn, was put to a drive in
upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just missed the show. WAR CANOE was asked leaving the gate, tucked into the two path
entering the first turn, was reserved off the pace, navigated the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole, raced behind a wall of horses
from that point to near the furlong marker and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. MASTEROF THE TUNES bumped with a rival leaving the chute,
became keen under restraint, checked sharply early on the opening turn, went around that bend in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went three then
four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out and gained some but missed the minor awards. ENGLISH BREEZE was
bumped at the start then forced into another foe, settled near the back on the inside, was roused in the two path at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed
kick. CHOOSE HAPPINESS was bumped solidly at the start, bumped with foes on both sides leaving the chute, checked behind another checking foe early
on the first turn, went three wide around that bend, settled outside at the rear but with cover, was removed from cover around the half-mile pole, came under
urging while four then five wide on the final turn, was driven six wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. DIXIE
CANNON broke out then was corrected by the rider, established a forward position early, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked for
her best in upper stretch and was out-kicked.

turn and came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
holding well to the finish kept busy to the end. FEATHERS ROAD chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into

the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive tipping out a path or two near the sixteenth marker
and offered up a mild bid to miss for the place honors while up for the show. CITIZEN K chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths,
angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. D'VINICRIS chased along the inside and was taken briefly in hand when in tight with
seven-sixteenths to run, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no headway through through the
final furlong. FUOCO prompted the leader along the inside down the backstretch until shaken off into the turn and tipped to the two path to give chase
patiently handled until let out spinning three wide for home, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. GOT THE GOLD chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home, offered no response. DAKOTA DANCER bobbled at the break, chased three wide under coaxing
from three furlongs out, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BIG LITTLE RISK chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
went seven to eight wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. IGOTTAHAVEIT off half a beat slow at the start, grew detached at the tail of the
field striding greenly three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch well behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TEXAS SWING pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, drew even with the leader passing the five-sixteenths, took the
advantage approaching the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the runner-up in the stretch and proved best under strong urging. ROYAL REALM dropped off the
early pace, dragged his way forward inside the three-quarter pole, gained quickly to track the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, was
given his cue around the five-sixteenths, made a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while well clear for the place.
WICKED INDEED was fractious in the gate, showed good speed then dropped off the pace near the three-quarter pole, settled outside from that juncture,
went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. BLU GROTTO was asked leaving the
gate then corrected with the left-rein early, dropped towards the rear under urging, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. NO BURN
set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead passing the quarter-pole and tired. FRENCH TOAST was asked to
show early speed then taken back off the pace outside the three-quarter pole, came under stout restraint while now reserved off the pace, was put back to
urging nearing the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn then was driven four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. MR. BRIGGS was hustled
from the start, showed early speed then was well placed just off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths and came up
empty. PIER FORTY was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

EVVIE JETS tracked the pace along the inside, got set down tipped three wide into upper stretch, split foes nearing the eighth pole to take command, dug in
under growing late threat and held safe to prevail. SPORT MODEL saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got let out angled six wide into upper stretch,
rallied to threaten through the final furlong but was ultimately safely repelled to the wire while clear for the place honors. BELLE BELISA (IRE) saved ground
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to just get up for the show
honors. GOLDEN PLUME got pinched at the start as rivals on each side broke her way, settled tracking just off the inside from just off the pace, got set
down angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. UNRULY JULIE just off the inside tracked the front from near the rear of the
field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS broke out at the start
bumping and pinching GOLDEN PLUME in concert with WINDFALL PROFIT, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide
into upper stretch and had no rally. COLOR CHART showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong. WINDFALL PROFIT broke in at the start
bumping and pinching back GOLDEN PLUME in tandem with DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS, pulled early on under restraint before settling just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide for home and weakened.

along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, pursued the winner four wide into upper stretch and proved no match while able to safely secure the
place. MARYSVALE lacked speed while ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was along for the show. FAVOR angled in while urged
along off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. CUPIDS GIRL was off slow then taken up by the
rider, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out, remained on her inside lead to outside the sixteenth-pole
and failed to threaten. SPLITSECONDSONNY was bumped hard at the start and had the rider lose his left iron for several strides before regaining footing,
moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. ROUGH TOUGH LOVE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the
turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch then lost touch with the winner and came up empty. CHARLOTTESOMETIMES
brushed with a rival at the start, raced off the pace, paused inside of a rival coming to the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn and failed to repsond.

Footnotes
SY DOG settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong and was just up in the last jump to the wire to prevail. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE broke in at the start bumping GRAND
SONATA, chased three wide forwardly placed outside the top pair, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat coming in to tighten up the rail and was nailed in the very last stride to the finish. MASETA three
wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the
show honors by a bob on the wire. GENERAL KEN stumbled at the break, recovered to track just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside into the far
turn and was patiently handled, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive in behind the leader and attempted to nudge that rival in the
hindquarters nearing the eighth pole to gain clearance on the rail, had that rival tip out and rallied through the seam until inside the sixteenth marker when
OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE came inwards closing down the inside and was stymied in the late stages to the finish. GRAND SONATA bumped at the start by
OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE, who broke inwards, tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, cut
the corner into upper stretch in behind GENERAL KEN and was steadied off that foe's heels with about three-sixteenths to go, tipped to the two path and
was again paused as TRUST DADDY tipped out in front, gained clearance outside with a sixteenth to run and angled out four paths to the finish unable to
impact the top spots. GENO tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
stayed on to the finish but was outkicked. WISH ME HOME forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader in the two path, remained patiently handled until set
down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. TRUST DADDY showed the way in hand along
the inside patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of rivals and was bumped in the
hindquarters and slightly nudged askew by GENERAL KEN attempting to make a seam nearing the eighth pole, tipped out yielding the front at that station to
the two path and weakened in the late going.

MILES D dropped back early, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, continued to advance
with a half-mile to run, was asked three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop then moved out in pursuit of the runner-up, gained
under a drive to make a bid coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling. SPEAKER'S CORNER went to the front, set the pace on the
inside while in hand, controlled the action through the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, drifted out under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put
to a right-handed crop near the furlong marker, drifted out more around the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead while being collared late and
missed but earned the place. VINDICTIVE stumbled at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer midway down
the backstretch, came under urging around the half-mile pole, went four wide on the far turn, chased under the crop into upper stretch then moved out in
pursuit of the top two, kept on well in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. BOURBONIC settled at the rear on the inside, shifted three wide
with about three furlongs to run, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and was no factor. MANOR HOUSE brushed the inside of
the gate at the start then bobbled, rounded the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch,
dropped back in the two path on the far turn, moved closer to the rail late on that bend and faltered.

upper stretch and weakened. ORGLANDES (FR) just off the inside near the rear of the field, got coaxed along with three furlongs remaining, tipped out four
wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
ARREST ME RED was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to the outside while off the rail, dropped to the inside entering the turn, was asked in
the two path into the stretch, responded very well under threat from the runner-up in the drive and held sway under strong urging. PULSATE was well
spotted just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased the winner into the final furlong, gained to make a bid along the
rail into the final sixteenth but just missed while clear for the place. CHEWING GUM was urged along towards the rear, started the turn in the two path then
shifted four wide, came seven wide into upper stretch and was along for the show. BACKTOHISROOTS chased the pace on the outside then in the three
path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was out-kicked while just able to save the lost spot in the superfecta.
VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed
kick then just missed the superfecta while a bit crowded late. BIG PACKAGE was slow into stride, raced at the rear of the field, went three wide early on the
turn then moved to five wide, came eight wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MAXWELL ESQUIRE was hustled from the start then coaxed along
off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. OMAHA CITY dropped back with a half-mile to run, moved
from the inside to the three path near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TURNED ASIDE pressed the
pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired.
