Footnotes
NOFANSINTHESTANDS bumped with SPECIAL CONQUEST in the opening strides, settled at the rear outside of LOCASH, began to improve between
horses into the turn, chased in the four to five path around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied, angled slightly inside of GHAALEB'S DREAMS
into the final furlong, got up to the lead inside of GHAALEB'S DREAMS inside the sixteenth mark and held sway. GHAALEB'S DREAMS settled toward the
rear between horses, was pushed along into the far turn and improved with a three wide rally, swung five wide into the lane, sustained her bid, headed
TORN JEANS near the sixteenth pole, was soon headed by NOFANSINTHESTANDS, kept on with interest but proved second best. SPECIAL CONQUEST
bumped with NOFANSINTHESTANDS in the opening strides, settled toward the rear inside, continued patiently in the two to three path on the far turn,
swung out in upper stretch, rallied four to five wide between horses, could not get to the leading pair but stayed on best of the rest. LOCASH settled inside
of NOFANSINTHESTANDS in the rear flight, split horses into the far turn and began to improve, swung six wide into the lane, and produced an outside rally.
UNION PARK GAL (IRE) chased midfield inside, continued patiently while saving ground around the far turn, was driven between horses in the lane, offered
a mild rally, was bumped late by TORN JEANS but kept on with interest. TABLE ONE tracked the pace two wide through the first turn, continued three wide
down the backstretch, bid on the leader into the far turn, tracked her in the two to three path around the bend, took closer order approaching the top of the
stretch before TORN JEANS cleared further again, and flattened out two wide in the final furlong. MAGIC SOLUTION tracked the leader inside of TABLE
ONE through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader between horses down the back straight, tracked the leading pair around the far turn in the two path, and
flattened out in the lane. TORN JEANS cleared to set the pace inside, opened up when urged into upper stretch, was caught approaching the sixteenth
mark, and weakened while bumping UNION PARK GAL late. PRINCESS D'ORO raced behind the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, joined at the
inside of the tracking flight for the backstretch run, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven inside in the lane, continued in range to midstretch and
weakened in the last furlong. UNBURNT tracked three wide, lost ground on the leading group while racing in the four path around the far turn, and
weakened in the lane. EUROPA raced four wide into the first turn, settled back three wide toward the rear, was relegated to the rear three wide around the
far turn, and offered no bid. THAT'S ALL RIGHT chased between horses, weakened two wide on the far turn and was no further factor in the lane.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA LUCKY was sent to the lead early, showed the way while saving ground around the first turn, drew off while racing up the backstretch and
around the far turn, and held his margin to the wire under a drive, never threatened. ANDREAS saved ground around the first turn, raced well off the pace
on the inside up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and continued
to gain ground from there while proving to be no match for the winner. HALF OF MANHATTAN tracked the leader while saving ground around the first turn
and up the backstretch, continued to race inside around the far turn and and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. CITALI raced in the two path
around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path, swung out entering the stretch, and gained
ground mildly on the outside late. SO ALIVE brushed the gate leaving it, settled in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader between horses up
the backstretch, steadied slightly racing into the far turn, saved ground from there and faded entering the stretch. CAMPAIGN SPY chased the leader from
the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, offered a mild bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole and
tired from there.

continued off the pace between horses horses from there, navigated the far turn from the two path, and improved position mildly in the stretch while never
threatening the top three. ALLEGIANCE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the
first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to fade from there. CADET

clear past the three eighths when MARY OF BETHANY stopped, was driven while still on a clear lead in upper stretch, was headed past the sixteenths but
kept on well enough to hold the place. ACCORDING TO ASPEN chased three wide early, settled back toward the rear into the first turn, continued near the
rear down the backstretch and in the two path on the far turn, swung out into upper stretch, rallied four wide and just got up for the show. ZANDREA'S

Footnotes
SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE chased the frontrunners up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled for the
lead in upper stretch, and pulled clear while drifting out late under a drive. DEVIL'S RULE brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path coming off the turn, was bumped by
STORMINSIDE when that rival drifted into his path near the three sixteenths pole, and continued to gain ground on the outside from there. NORTH SIDE
dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, took over to lead outright while saving ground around the turn, dueled in upper
stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth of a mile. STORMINSIDE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back slightly
while racing in the two path around the turn, drifted out and bumped DEVIL'S RULE near the three sixteenths pole and finished evenly in the final furlong.
FOLLOW THE SIGNS brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the early going, ran out to the six path coming
off the turn, and was never a threat. MAY WE ALL raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, swung wide
into the stretch and made no bid. PAROLEE trailed the field in the early going, was pulled up while racing around the turn, and was vanned off after walking
onto the van.

Footnotes
SHEZ STUCK UP came out in the opening strides, set the pace while pressed by TRIPLE SCOUT down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn,
was driven in upper stretch, shook TRIPLE SCOUT off last the three sixteenths, opened up and held safe. TIZ SUSAN ANN chased three wide, was driven
while still three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied while still under a drive, and gained to the finish. MAYSTART raced in the rear flight
outside of LADY ATLANTIC early, inched forward four wide into the turn, advanced to track the leading pair around the turn while still positioned four wide,
continued four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for TIZ SUSAN ANN in the final furlong but chased on best of the rest. TRIPLE SCOUT was
fractious in the gate, came in and bumped LADY ATLANTIC in the opening strides, prompted the pace outside of SHEZ STUCK UP down the backstretch
and in the three path on the turn, was no match for her past the three sixteenths, flattened out, and lost the show late. LOUIE P raced at the inside of the
chasing flight early, saved ground at the rear of the main group on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. LADY ATLANTIC
was pinballed between PRINCESS LIVIA and TRIPLE SCOUT in the opening strides, settled at the rear just behind the chasing line early, trailed in the five
path on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and had no rally. PRINCESS LIVIA was herded out in the opening strides and bumped LADY ATLANTIC,
chased between horses down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, and emptied out between from the three
sixteenths.
