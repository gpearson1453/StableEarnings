Footnotes
MIACOMET quickly cleared off, maintained a loose lead in hand, drew off willingly under driving pressure through upper stretch, and held safely. VAIL OF
HONOR required urging to keep pace while lagging behind the field around the first turn, shifted three wide while picking up stride into the far turn, rallied
around that bend, then sustained his long rally to reach place passing the furlong pole, and finished well to narrow the clear leader's margin. SONIC CITY
settled off of the pace along the inside, gained between horses at the half mile pole to take aim on the clear leader into the far turn, chased that rival around
that bend while under steady urging, but tired in upper stretch after proving no match, and lost place passing the furlong pole. SEATTLESWAY stalked
along the inside, but faded around the far turn. LOVING LUCKY stalked the loose leader two wide, but faded under a drive around the far turn. COUNTRY
CAPTAIN tracked three wide around the first turn, but was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
AGGRESSIVITY stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole as LONG TERM THINKING gave
chase, and held well from that bidding rival through the lane. LONG TERM THINKING was allowed to gather himself at the back of the short pack, improved
to an inside tracking position down the backstretch, patiently withheld his run turning for home as AGGRESSIVITY made first run, tipped four wide and
outside of that rival entering the lane, rallied willingly thereafter, but only managed to chase that foe home, and proved second best while being kept at bay.
IN SKY WE TRUST pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as AGGRESSIVITY forced his hand, but was outkicked by that
foe at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded. ARARECO LAKE set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids turning for home, gave way entering the
lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
LADY PROTONICO sat comfortably behind the hot pace while trailing the filed, commenced a three wide rally turning for home, smoothly shifted six wide
and outside of the leaders approaching midstretch, rallied well to drive past the leader approaching the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. DANCE ON OVER
lied off of the pace in the three path, gained in the for path turning for home before being floated to the five path entering the lane, sustained her charge to
bid approaching the furlong pole, led at that marker, but was outkicked approaching the final sixteenth, and was second best. MOMMA RIO was bumped an
hindered by an inner foe at the start, stalked the dueling pair from multiple lengths off while in the three path, inched closer turning for home as DANCE ON
OVER ranged up alongside, drifted to the four path entering the lane before getting outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, claimed show inside the final
furlong while getting outkicked by another outer rival, then saved that position from an oncharging PAULAS GAME. PAULAS GAME settled far off of the
pace two wide around the turn, and improved through the late stages, but missed reaching show. SKY FACTOR broke outwardly, was hustled early on to
duel for the lead inside of ZERO POINT ZERO, drew clear of that foe in upper stretch, but was overhauled by outer rivals passing the furlong pole. TIME'S
ON MY SIDE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, chased along the inside, but faded around the lane. SEQUAYA bumped with an outer foe
before being shut off by a quicker inner rival, saved ground off of the pace, but was stymied through the lane while unable to slip inside of a tiring TIME'S
ON MY SIDE. ZERO POINT ZERO broke inwardly, dueled for the lead through quick fractions outside of SKY FACTOR, was driven at the three furlong pole
to lead turning for home, but weakened at the quarter pole, and shied from an outer rival in upper stretch. GOLDEN ACCOUNT was outrun.

Footnotes
TRUMPET LILLY set an unencumbered pace while well in hand around both turns, drew away from chasing foes entering the lane, widened under driving
pressure in midstretch, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. RIGHT TRAPPE stalked along the inside lost ground to the leading pair while
shifting outside of them into the far turn, chased around that bend, then claimed place from BAYSHORE FOXES at the three sixteenths pole while proving
no match for the leader. BAYSHORE FOXES stalked two wide, chased the leader around the far turn, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane,
lost place to an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, then kept on. A LITTLE FLYER trailed, improved outside of a pair of foes into the far turn, then failed
to make an impact thereafter. SUM KINDA PRETTY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TIME FOR GLORY lied off of the pace two wide, and
never got involved.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MANDATE stalked two wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch along with an outer VERB, led approaching the furlong grounds while hounded by
that rival, and gamely held to the wire. VERB tracked the pace three wide and outside of AMERICAN MANDATE, bid along with that foe in upper stretch,
dueled while failing to reach that foe's throatlatch, and was fended off. HEART RHYTHM lied off of the pace three wide, ranged up turning for home before
tipping four wide and outside of the leaders in midstretch, but only manage to slowly grind away at the leader's advantage, and did not have enough.
COLTONATOR lied off of the pace two wide, tracked around the turn, but only managed to chase from behind the leaders through the lane, and failed to
produce a bid. MR. HUSTLE cleared off early on, met a pair of bids in upper stretch, but weakened approaching the furlong pole. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS
chased along the inside, but was done early.

Footnotes
HIGHER STANDARD broke sharply but allowed BACK TO NORMAL to set the early pace, engaged that foe while well in hand into the turn, ranged up to
bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command when let out in upper stretch, drew off while shifting inwardly from right handed flagging in
midstretch, and was kept to task to seal the deal. STIRDATPOT stalked three wide while multiple lengths off the embattled leaders around the turn, bid for
place approaching midstretch while hanging on his left lead, failed to threaten the eventual winner, then found the wire to save place from a surging outer
foe. INEXORABLE broke half a step slowly and was allowed to settle at the rear of the field, took the turn in the three path before shifting five wide entering
the lane, and produced a strong rally outside of foes through the final furlong, but just missed reaching place. ATRAS saved ground off of the pace,
attempted to advance outside of MUMAYAZ entering the lane, but was blocked and shifted back inwards in upper stretch, then stayed on willingly along the
inside through midstretch before aiming to sustain the rally between horses at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe for a minor placing.
MUMAYAZ chased along the inside, but faded between horses through the lane. JACKYS BACK was outsprinted despite heavy urging early on, trailed the
field in the four path around the turn, cut the corner while picking up stride, improved through midstretch, then stayed on willingly among rivals in the final
sixteenth while under light encouragement. PRESSURE tracked the pace four wide, but faded through the lane. BACK TO NORMAL sped clear early on,
showed the way inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, offered little resistance turning for home,
and weakened through the lane. MIZZEN MAN never got involved. FULLY CONNECTED tracked from midpack two to three wide and from between horses,
but faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
DIVINE LEADER irrelevantly rushed the gate before it opened, but broke well once it did, prompted the pace three wide, led outside of COVE BLUE at the
three furlong pole, cleared when that foe gave way and IMPRESSED ranged up at the five sixteenths pole, drew off in upper stretch, and was driven home.
IMPRESSED was bumped between horses at the start, tracked four wide, ranged up outside of DIVINE LEADER into the turn while tracking that foe's bid,
pursued as that foe took over turning for home, but only managed to chase that foe through the lane while battling outside of DRENA'S STAR for place, and
prevailed for that position. DRENA'S STAR lied close up along the inside early on, chased after outer foes went on into the turn, tipped two wide to surpass
a rival entering the lane, bid for place inside of IMPRESSED in upper stretch while proving no match for the leader, vied for that position through midstretch,
but was outfinished. MACHISMO tracked from midpack three wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and chased evenly. ALEXANDROS lied off of the pace
three wide into the turn, shifted six wide turning for home, but lacked a punch to produce a rally. LOST IN LIMBO was bumped between horses at the start,
saved ground in midpack, tipped three wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. TIZ OUR TURN broke a bit keenly, trailed, and never got involved. COVE
BLUE vied for the lead two wide, but was headed by the eventual winner into the turn, and weakened turning for home. YES HE CAN stalked two wide, but
faded between horses around the turn without being asked for run, then was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BLUE KENTUCKY prompted the pace three wide, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole as inner foes gave way and outer rivals menaced, edged
clear from those bidding counterparts entering the lane, widened through upper stretch, then held well from a rallying HOME BREW in the final furlong.
HOME BREW tracked four wide, took back between horses when put to tight quarters while floated five wide at the five sixteenths pole, recovered and
tipped six wide entering the lane for clear sailing, and produced a solid rally to take aim on a clear BLUE KENTUCKY in the final furlong, narrowed the gap
on that foe late, but was denied reaching that rival. READY PURSUIT trailed, swung seven wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to reach show.
BALADI got crowed between horses at the start when an outer rival crossed over, tracked from off of the pace five wide, loomed large while ranging up to
the leaders six wide and outside of foes at the five sixteenths pole, attempted a bid outside of BLUE KENTUCKY while shifting ground inwards at the quarter
pole, but flattened out in upper stretch, and faltered. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT stalked along the inside, shifted four wide to gain between horses at the three
furlong pole, attempted a bid along with an outer BALADI turning for home, but was put in tight while getting outkicked by that foe passing the quarter pole,
then flattened out. BIG BOSS BEN pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but gave way to outer foes turning for home. ZIP IT SCOTTY saved
ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. LUCKY SHOT rushed to set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, then weakened inside of a group of
bidding foes approaching the quarter pole.

FAST AND FLIRTY stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses entering the lane, shot clear of them in upper stretch, and held sway from a rallying
MITIGATION late. MITIGATION tracked from midpack four wide, rallied in upper stretch in pursuit of FAST AND FLIRTY, took aim on that foe while claiming
place approaching the final sixteenth, but was denied reaching that rival, and proved second best. VALENTINA DAY settled far back three wide, shifted four
wide into the turn, rallied five wide turning for home, but lugged inwards in upper stretch, regained stride in the final furlong, and rallied late to reach show.
JACCACI saved ground off of the pace, split foes two wide entering the lane, but shied from an inwardly lugging VALENTINA DAY at the three sixteenths
pole, kept on thereafter to run up behind traffic in the final furlong, altered out at the sixteenth pole, and surged for a minor share. BERNABREEZY lunged
inwardly at the start, trailed the field, swung six wide entering the lane, and stayed on mildly. TROBAIRITZ lied forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead
entering the lane along with an inner FAST AND FLIRTY, but was outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, and flattened out. DELIGHTOF THE NILE ran off
while fighting with the rider down the backstretch, met a pair of bids entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. MY AIM IS TRUE was urged along far
off of the pace in the two wide, and failed to factor. SOCIAL MATRIX hopped slightly at the start, tracked from midpack two to three wide, but faded turning
for home. LOVED REIKO tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but faltered into the turn and was done early. CLAY'S CLOUD BURST broke
slowly, lied off of the pace five wide, shifted three wide at the three furlong pole, but got outkicked by and outer VALENTINA DAY entering the lane, steadied
when that foe lugged inwards at the quarter pole, and weakened. COCO PUFF stalked along the inside, but weakened turning for home. THE TRAINER OF
JACCACI CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF VALENTINA DAY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE SIXTEENTHS POLE, BUT IT WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS
