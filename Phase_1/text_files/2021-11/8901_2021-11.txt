steadily advance up the rail on the back stretch then went between horses in the stretch to just miss the place. KASENS TRAIN raced in the middle of the
pack from the inside then dueled on the turn and was outfinished in the drive. PORQUE SI set the early pace from the two path and weakened.
MULETRAIN raced near the back then made a four wide bid on the backstretch and flaltered. MORO PHAROAH was allowed to settle but was not a factor.
CYBER GUN was close up in striking distance early from the three path then steadily faded. ZONG TOUGH vied for the lead from the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
OLD INDIAN TRICK was hustled to contention in the three path then took the clear lead at the eighth pole and kept to task. TAPIT'S SPIRIT tracked the
leaders from the two path and made a move to battle in the stretch and was able to hold the place. DOUBLE BARREL MAN was unhurried early angled out
five wide at the head of the stretch to rally and just missed the place. BLACK SWORD was allowed to settle on the inside then went between horses in mid
stretch to improve position. SLITHER dueled for the lead but lacked a late response in the stretch. CARBON STRYKER raced in the middle of the pace
while racing four wide but was never a factor. HIGH CRUISE saved ground on the inside just off the pace move on the turn but flattened out in the stretch.
I'M LOOKING UP dueled for the lead and gave way.

BOOK raced four wide throughout but kept to the task. SIXTO was unhurried early then made a four wide rally. PAT ME DOWN was steadied at the break
then advanced from the four path but had no kick late. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND set the pace for a half and was empty in the drive. THE FLUSH KING vied
for the lead from the three path and tired. RED BUFFALO saved ground but was not a factor. VON DOM was forwardly placed within striking distance in the
four path but gave way going into the final turn.

SARAH'S PASSION was hustled to a clear lead while being unchallenged and held sway. QUIKFAST N AHURRY was unhurried early while steadily
advancing three wide made a late run but couldn't catch winner. JET SWEEP tracked the leaders from the two path but was one paced. MISS CHARLIE
SIOUX stalked the pace from the three path giving an even effort. SILVER SIREN was allowed to settle in the two path but failed to menace. BIRDIE CALL
saved ground but was not a factor. SPELLBINDING was placed just off the pace in the two path and gave way.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI BROTHER vied for the lead from the two path then inched away under a drive. SMOKY TOPAZ had the early speed from the inside but couldn't
match strides with winner. IDE LIKE HAWAII stalked the pace from the inside but raced evenly. MY LITTLE JUNIOR saved ground and made a late rally.
WINDSOR ACADEMY was allowed to settle and made a mild bid late. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR chased the leaders from the two path and improved
position. CONQUISTADOR GOLD tracked the leaders from the two path and faded. XIETELEHUAS was not a threat. HIGH PRIORITY raced in the middle
of the pack from the four path and gave way. BUBBA SMACK was fractious in the gate and was never a factor.
