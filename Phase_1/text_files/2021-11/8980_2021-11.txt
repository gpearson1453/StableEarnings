Footnotes
LAW PROFESSOR went four wide around the first turn, raced near the back outside a rival, angled out and was driven five wide into the stretch, reached
the front with a sixteenth to go and proved best late. TULSA TORNADO went three wide around the first turn, tracked three deep up the backstretch, exited
the far turn four wide, bid outside the leader and led briefly in midstretch but soon overtaken and outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. GREGORY'S
PRIDE tracked from between runners, tipped out and bumped rival at the three-sixteenths pole, finished willingly inside the furlong grounds and held the
show. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) unhurried in the beginning on the inside then moved to the two path on the far turn, tipped out leaving the second bend, got
bumped and put in tight quarters between foes at the three-sixteenths marker, kept on through the final furlong and missed the show. TIGERHON (FR)
showed early speed then became rank between rivals, chased the speed outside a rival then three deep on the front, vied outside same rivals through the
far turn, took over in upper stretch but flattened late. LI MU BAI (IRE) broke slow, pulled around the first turn, traveled along the inside then tipped two wide
on the far turn and summoned a mild rally. EPIMYTHIUM traveled two to three wide early, steadied off heels past the nine-sixteenths pole, exited the far
turn four wide and lacked a rally. APPRECIATED threw his head and broke slow, went three to four wide around the first turn, traveled outside rivals on the
backstretch, came five wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. C FALLS sped clear and crossed over to the inside, gained company in the middle
stages, cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole but was soon challenged into the far turn by same rivals, vied along the inside through the second bend, lost
command in upper stretch and gave way. I'LL STAND TALLER was closest in pursuit early then went up to press the pace outside the leader and between
rivals, lost contact leaving the backstretch then re-bid at the three-eighths pole, vied between to the stretch and retreated in the drive. DOMINANT SOUL
steadied off heels on the first turn, raced in mid-pack on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and weakened.

MONGOLIAN PANTHER stalked off the inside, closed in three then four wide around the turn, took over in midstretch and held the runner-up at bay.
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH broke well then dropped back early, raced in the two path into the turn, angled four to five wide, rallied but was too late. WITH THIS
VOW dueled briefly outside a rival before clearing at the half-mile pole, lost command past the three-eighths pole, came back to regain control past the
quarter pole, clung to the lead with a furlong remaining, relinquished the lead the lead to the winner and was edged for the place. LITTLE MISS ELLIE raced
off the pace in the early stages, moved closer around the turn while shifting to the three path, chased within striking distance through the lane but lacked the
needed late kick in deep stretch. ROSES AND CANDY dueled briefly then chased the speed past the half-mile pole, bid into the turn, gained the lead past

clear path along the fence and edged ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) for second. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) traveled in range early on two then three wide, bid there
deep into the stretch and got edged for the place honors. DUVET DAY (IRE) came away slow and got knocked into outside rival, steadied briefly on the far
turn, swung four wide and finished willingly for a minor award. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) vied for the lead from inside then dueled with rival, cleared at the
five-sixteenths pole but was soon challenged again, vied two wide into the lane and weakened in the late stages. FLUENT vied four deep into the first turn,
dropped back a bit to chase the top pair then moved up to be apart of the lead four deep at the half-mile pole, challenged three wide into the stretch and
weakened down the lane. ISOLA MIA tucked inside early, moved closer up the backstretch, bumped with rival repeatedly and checked along the rail on the
far turn and failed to make an impact in the lane. CELESTIA broke slow and got bumped hard at the start, trailed through the early stages, lacked room and
bumped late on the far turn and was no factor. ROCK THE BOURBON fractious in the gate, broke slow and was forced out to bumped outside rival in the
beginning, angled five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. VERY SCARY raced in range off the rail, bumped repeatedly in the two path on the far
turn and checked off heels, then weakened in the drive. BOOZE RUNNER vied between for command into the first turn then dueled from outside, lost
contact with the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, put in tight quarters approaching the quarter pole, retreated after and was eased in the lane and walked
off. EMPIRE D'ORO brushed leaving the gate, vied three deep into the first turn, ceded control then went up to press the pace outside the top pair, dropped
back on the far turn and bumped late on the bend and faded. THERE WERE TWO INQUIRIES INTO THE RUNNING OF RACE THREE. THE FIRST
INVOLVED THE START AND THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH STERLING CREST (IRE) DID BREAK OUT AT THE START, ROCK THE
BOURBON, DUVET DAY (IRE), AND CELESTIA BROKE SLOW AND THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION. THE SECOND
INQUIRY INVOLVED THE INCIDENT BETWEEN MULTIPLE RUNNERS ON THE FAR TURN AND THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE VIDEO WAS
INCONCLUSIVE AND THERE WOULD NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

clear in upper stretch and held off the late charge from the runner-up. SACRED LIFE (FR) broke a bit slow from outside, settled off the pace, angled four
wide leaving the far turn, rallied through the drive, drew alongside the leader in the final sixteenth and missed. INDIAN PEAK reserved in the early going,
angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch, rallied from outside but faltered late. MAJESTIC EAGLE forwardly placed in the early going,
went three deep into the far turn, remained three wide into the stretch and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. FLOP SHOT (IRE) showed early speed
inside a pair of rivals then ceded the lead into the first turn, stalked along the rail then moved to the two path, lacked room between rivals and off the heels
of the leader from upper to midstretch, moved inside to a clear path but lacked late punch. BOB AND JACKIE fractious in the gate, showed early speed then
chased the leader two wide into the first turn, bid between at the half-mile pole, dueled from inside through the far turn, then retreated in the final furlong.
LAMBEAU stumbled badly at the start, recovered well and went for the front while five wide leaving the chute, vied with a pair of rivals then cleared and
angled to the rail for the clubhouse turn, gained pressure on the backstretch then lost command at the half-mile pole, chased rivals to the far turn, put in tight
quarters along the rail entering the far turn, dropped back around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

steered out n the turn and entered the stretch six wide and bested the others. MAGGIE FITZGERALD sat off the pace in the two path and failed to rally.
MISS RENO off slow to begin, sent for the lead from inside, vied with a pair of rivals to the turn, lost contact with the winner at the five-sixteenths pole and

Footnotes
TEZZARAY (GB) got bumped leaving the gate, moved to the inside to stalk the pacesetter, steadied briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide
leaving the turn, moved out a bit further in the lane, rallied outside the runner-up and won the bob. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE was closest in pursuit through the
early stages, driven two wide into the lane, drew alongside the leader past the eighth pole, took over with a sixteenth remaining and lost the bob to
TEZZARAY (GB) at the wire. TOERIS got bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace from between rivals, tipped three wide on the far turn, rallied through
the final furlong and proved a game third. HELENS WELL (IRE) was off a bit slow from outside, traveled three deep on the first turn, angled five wide into
the lane and closed well to round out the superfecta. LIAM'S DOVE sped clear and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, pressured by
rival and put to left-handed urging midstretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. TRAVEL SMART was rank early between foes, got brushed by inner rival at
the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the lane, steered to the inside late but needed to find more. VIRULENTE (FR) off slow to begin, steered down
to the inside, reserved in the early stages, cut the corner into the lane, altered around rival at the eighth pole and kept on between runners late. MISS
BELLATRIX broke out and bumped rival at the start, tracked from the inside near the middle of the pack, brushed with rival past the five-sixteenths pole,
exited the bend three wide, angled inward in the stretch and failed to threaten. HALF PAST TWELVE stalked the pace three deep, chased outside a rival on
the far turn, got shuffled between runners entering the lane and faded. SPARKLE BLUE broke out, went three deep around the clubhouse turn, remained off
the rail then came four wide into the drive and had little left. REEM ZABEEL (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, raced between rivals then in the two path to
the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
TOOK CHARGE set the pace with company to the outside, cleared foes around the bend and showed the way two wide into the stretch, continued clear into
the final sixteenth and held gamely. ESCAPE ROUTE chased along the inside through the turn, continued along the rail in the drive then angled outside the
winner in the final sixteenth and was gaining to the wire. LETSGETLUCKY bumped at the start, chased early then went up to press the pace between foes,
could not keep up leaving the turn while three wide but stayed on to save the show. TETON VALLEY sat off the pace early on, went two wide into the turn,
steered out to the four path on the bend, angled out further in upper stretch and missed the show. CALIFORNIA STREET dropped back early, went two
wide into the turn, eased out to the five path around the bend and summoned a mild rally. SUMO chased five wide through the turn and never produced a
bid. AFFABLE tracked well off inside, went five wide into the turn, six wide leaving the bend and failed to menace. HEARTFULLOFSTARS raced outside a
rival at the back of the pack, angled to the rail on the turn and was not a factor. AMERICAN THEOREM bumped at the start, chased well off the rail then
went up to attend the pace three deep, chased four wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
BEYOND BRILLIANT controlled the pace on the inside, got tested from outside on the far turn but cleared again leaving the bend, led clear into the final
sixteenth and held gamely over the runner-up. SANTIN tracked outside a pair of rivals, went four wide around the far turn, summoned a late rally but was
not enough to get by the winner. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) stalked the pace on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, finished evenly through the final
furlong and held the show. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) tracked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out at the eighth pole then angled out
further with a sixteenth remaining and missed the show. SUBCONSCIOUS brushed inner rival at the start, stalked the lone leader three deep, was asked
three wide leaving the far turn, urged left-handed in the furlong grounds but flattened late. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) traveled in mid-pack between rivals, exited
the far turn three wide and lacked a late bid. FLASHIEST steadied leaving the chute near the inside, continued along the rail through the middle stages,
steadied early on the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and improved position. SIFTING SANDS (GB) stalked the leader in the two path, coaxed on the
far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and failed to offer the needed response. HUDSON RIDGE broke a bit slow, sat near the back of the field went two wide
into the drive then angled out and could not make an impact. CAMP HOPE brushed leaving the gate, raced between foes then bumped with IN EFFECT
and checked off heels entering the first turn, moved out and traveled three deep on the backstretch, entered the stretch four wide and could not rally. IT
CAN BE DONE sat well off the pace early and moved to the two path, traveled two to three wide on the second bend and lacked a rally. DICEY MO CHARA
(GB) came away to a slow beginning, trailed on the inside to the stretch, moved off the rail in the lane but never got involved. TEAM MERCHANTS forwardly
placed outside the leader early then stalked in the two path, put in a mild bid on the far turn but could not sustain the challenge leaving the bend and gave
way through the lane. IN EFFECT exited the chute outside a trio of rivals, bumped with CAMP HOPE entering the first turn, traveled three to four wide
around that bend, went four deep or five wide into the second turn, angled down to the three path and came up empty.
