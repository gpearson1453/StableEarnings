Footnotes
HONEY MUG angled in sharply in the opening stages crossing over the path of COWGIRL KIMMIE while being urged to dispute the pace a bit off the rail on
a narrow advantage, met the challenge of her aforementioned rival racing to midstretch while being carried out slightly, then edged forward late under hand
urging and a few right handed taps. COWGIRL KIMMIE broke inwards into the path of LADY MAGNA, was quickly righted, then forced inwards by the
eventual winner in the opening sixteenth, was prompted to advance along the rail challenging that rival racing into the turn, shifted off the inside disputing
the issue to midstretch but was outkicked. ARCH FLYER angled inwards in the opening stages prompting the pace three deep racing through the
backstretch to the turn, lost ground to the top pair nearing upper stretch but continued well enough to earn a share. LADY MAGNA, bumped, then squeezed
back at the start, switched outside foes with a sharp move just after the break to track just off the leaders racing four wide to the turn and steadily faded into
the lane. GODSGIFT broke out at the start bumping LADY MAGNA, was held up avoiding close quarters just after the break, shifted out racing through the
backstretch pulling her way between foes tracking just off the first flight to the bend but soon emptied out. HOLD THE SPENDING, held up three deep
between foes when caught in close quarters in the opening stages, dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF COWGIRL KIMMIE
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
UNBURNT was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, forged clear after a half and steadily widened the advantage under pressure.
NEXT TIME YOU WIN angled inside in the opening stages tracking the leaders in second flight, shifted out three wide racing into the backstretch, continued
with a steady effort to gain second nearing the lane and maintained that position to the end while failing to menace the winner. SPECIAL CONQUEST
settled inside rivals behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance switching four wide racing through the far turn and
continued with interest to improve position to the end. JANE'S GOLD TOUR tracked the pace outside foes. then between rivals in second flight racing to the
far turn and came up empty in the drive. FANCY SKY settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.
UNIVERSIADE proved no factor. MAGIC SOLUTION, prompted to a forward placing between foes in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight between
foes racing to the backstretch, shifted to the inside entering the far turn and steadily faded. NEVE DE LUA, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the
pace into the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
TEMPER TANTRUM was urged inside rivals to dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing into the first turn, met a rival's challenge dueling for command
leaving the midway point of the far turn, skirmished with that foe in a protracted drive to late stages but grudgingly prevailed on a narrow advantage at the
wire under firm handling. NILES CHANNEL, caught in close quarters while being prompted to contend between foes exchanging some contact racing to the
first turn, tracked just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, readily advanced to challenge that foe midway through the far turn, pressed the issue in a
prolonged drive to late stages striking the front between calls but lost the nod at the wire. FLY NIGHTLY, held up avoiding close quarters to track off the
second flight racing to the first turn, switched out three deep nearing the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path with an early move after a half,
continued in pursuit of the leaders to the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. LAND MARK DEAL, bumped in the opening stages while gaining a forward
placing three deep, was held up just off the first flight while pulling between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn,
switched out four wide in the drive but continued evenly late. SHADIZAAR off slowly, then shuffled back at the start, settled to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance outside foes while being fanned five wide in upper stretch and had no final response. IWILLPERSEVERE, held up along the inside
avoiding tight quarters racing to the first turn, continued along the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. TORNADO BOY
settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MUD HUT was urged along the rail disputing the pace inside foes on the backstretch, edged forward racing into the turn to dictate the pace on a narrow
margin to upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. BELLS OF JOY broke readily, pressed the pace between foes from the outset
to the turn, couldn't match terms with the winner but kept on to preserve the place honors. HELLO HERO settled well off the second flight while angling
inwards racing through the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share nearing the wire.
DANCING BARBIE, off a step slowly, tracked the leaders along the rail racing into the turn, improved position inside rivals to late stages and was just
outkicked for a share. HERO'S DAUGHTER swerved at the start while being bumped by CREAL SUGAR, then exchanging hard contact with GOSHEN
GIRL, was righted, then made steady progress four wide into upper stretch to gain contention but flattened out in the closing stages. GOSHEN GIRL
exchanged bumps just after the start, was prompted to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn and faded between rivals
into upper stretch. CREAL SUGAR swerved inwards at the start bumping HERO'S DAUGHTER soundly, was righted to gain terms with the first flight in the
four path early, shifted in to press the issue briefly racing three deep into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER broke
awkwardly while getting away very slowly and trailed the field to the stretch.

Footnotes
CHOPPER bobbled at the start while bumping FLORIDA FLASH, was quickly righted then hustled clear along the inside racing through the backstretch,
held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch and responded to firm encouragement to maintain that advantage to the end. COCO BRAVADO ducked
out at the start, was quickly righted to track off the leaders while angling inwards racing into the turn, tipped out in upper stretch to loom momentarily outside
the winner but couldn't match terms with that foe in the last furlong. HATCHET CREEK broke outwards bumping MINISTRY OF ART, was righted to track
just outside the pacesetter racing into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. FINAL CALL, held up dropping well off the leaders racing through the
backstretch, angled out five wide in upper stretch while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards midstretch but continued with an even effort between
foes. ON THE MUSCLE was rated outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch but lacked the needed closing bid. RIP IT
RYAN threw his head at the start, breaking slowly while momentarily losing his path to a rival, was devoid of pace despite some early encouragement and
passed only tiring rivals in the closing stages. FLORIDA FLASH, bumped by the eventual winner at the start, was rated between foes tracking the leaders
from out of striking distance in second flight and steadily faded racing into the turn. LAST SPRING made brief pursuit of the winner racing three wide to the
turn and gave way early. MINISTRY OF ART, bumped at the start, was rated inside foes tracking the leaders along the rail and steadily faded racing through
the turn.

Footnotes
P H FACTOR was urged clear while angling nearer the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half, steadily drew clear
racing through the far turn and responded to firm left handed pressure to maintain that margin. COWBOYS DREAM was rated off the second flight outside
foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and came through inside foes in the closing stages to
prevail for the place honors. CHRISTIAN C tracked off the second flight while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch, swung four wide nearing
upper stretch while being roused to advance but was outkicked for the place honors. PISTOL BOX settled well off the field racing to the backstretch, gained
some momentum nearing the lane, was fanned five wide in upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. DIAMOND DAVE reared at the
start breaking slowly, was settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention. RUFFOLO, urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the first
turn, shifted inside entering the backstretch tracking the pacesetter in second flight and faded between foes leaving the far turn. TRY TRY AGAIN tracked
the pacesetter racing three, then four wide to the backstretch just off the second flight and retreated early. ONE WAY HOME switched out racing into the
first turn while being urged prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, couldn't match that rival after a half and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MAXI MOON switched out five wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, was prompted to advance while shifting inwards nearing the bend to
advance three deep on the leaders, moved to wrest command in that path in upper stretch and held GIRLOLAMO'GLORY on a safe margin to the end
under firm right handed encouragement. The latter switched outside the leaders in the opening to track those rivals four wide to the turn, was prompted to
advance in that path racing through the bend to upper stretch, drifted out in the closing stages but continued with interest to close the gap on the winner
while edging rivals for the place honors late. A MERRY HEART settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out three wide racing through
the stretch and made an effort to gain some position between foes while earning a share. FULL MAGAZINE angled inwards in the opening stages while
being urged to force the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, dueled for command between through the turn to upper stretch and gave out in late stages.
DEORA STORE settled inside foes racing to the turn, tipped out racing through the stretch but offered no rally. FLASHY RICHIE broke slowly, then was
slow to gather stride despite encouragement, shifted out in late stages and gradually gained terms with the field while never proving a serious threat. LEE'S
LUCK was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn and gave way nearing midstretch.

Footnotes
DRAW THE LINE, urged between foes while squeezed in tight quarters racing into the first turn, tracked just off the leaders inside rivals on the backstretch,
tipped out three wide entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, angled to the rail to bid inside the leader in upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. ROAR OF THE LION, off slowly, was reserved last to the
backstretch, steadily gained position inside rivals racing into the far turn, tipped outside a tiring foe racing into upper stretch, was angling back to the rail but
altered course when losing that path to the eventual winner midstretch, then was roused to advance three deep between foes in the final stages while just
outkicked by the winner. DRAMATIC KITTEN was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside in the opening stages, steadily advanced along the
rail racing into the far turn to challenge for command inside foes nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage while shifting out racing into upper stretch, led
past the furlong marker but failed to sustain his momentum. MANGO TREE, urged four deep between foes disputing the pace into the first turn, was
bumped, squeezed, then steadied off rivals nearing the seven furlong marker, switched outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide
racing through the far turn, then continued in that path to late stages while finishing willingly to close the gap on the leaders nearing the wire.
YALIKEANYTHING, urged five, then four wide between foes racing into the first turn, exchanged some contact advancing in tight quarters racing through
that bend, tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn but lacked the needed late bid while finishing evenly between foes. UGO, urged to
join the pace racing six wide into the first turn, shifted inwards exchanging some contact entering that bend, tracked outside foes in second flight racing to
the backstretch, shifted in nearing the second bend and faded between rivals racing into the lane. CHARLES T was urged through tight quarters along the
rail racing into the first turn to gain a clear advantage to the backstretch, dictated the pace just off the rail to the second bend and gave way abruptly
between foes nearing upper stretch. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, urged five wide between foes while advancing in tight quarters racing into the first turn, shifted
inwards racing into the backstretch to prompt the pacesetter to the second bend but soon gave way. JIMMIE T, shut off, then checked out of tight quarters
racing into the first turn, never gained contention.
