Footnotes
POPPY'S C NOTE was away in good order to duel for the lead with BRETT while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and prevailed.
BRETT disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, vied through a prolonged drive but could not get by that rival in the closing yards. FORT YORK
settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly late. INQUISITION was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second
turn and lacked the needed closing response. PASCO raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to rally. HIGH
SPEED CHASE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. ACTIVE PASS raced off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. MEETMEATTHEBAR was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and
did not menace.

Footnotes
NORTHERN QUEST was reserved just off the leaders early, moved inside in tandem with DIECI to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off
with complete authority. DIECI broke in to bump rival, pressed the pace of SILVER SERVICE while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. SILVER SERVICE was off a step slow and bumped hard, set a pressured pace
and gave way through the final furlong. HAWK'S RISING was bumped at the start, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. SHOCKAZULU showed brief speed and weakened. THE RIDER OF SILVER SERVICE LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST DIECI
CONCERNING THE BUMPING AT THE BREAK, AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT SILVER SERVICE HAD
BROKEN A BIT SLOW AND MADE NO CHANGE.

FOREIGN PROTOCOL stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to gain command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held off the closing
SIX BLESSINGS to prevail. SIX BLESSINGS raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, lacked racing room nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, angled out with a sixteenth to run and finished with good energy to be gaining late. SUNRISE JOURNEY disputed the pace from the inside and gave
way grudgingly late. AWESOME IMAGE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. DUSALUT was away
alertly then carried out through the first turn, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. AZEE RULES
vied for the opening fractions while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. SKEESIX drifted out through the first turn, showed brief speed and
weakened.

Footnotes
CHIEFS LIL PEARL broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off with little
need of urging. GRAZEN VALOR pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. ABRAA JABRAA was
forwardly placed early, raced from off the rail through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. CLUBHOUSE SAINT raced four-wide
through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. TEASPOON OF PEPPER was off a
step slow, raced off the rail through the second turn and failed to rally. MERGIE TROID was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn
and did not menace. EMMA'S A BEAST showed no early speed, rider lost irons and was not a factor. STARACROSSTHEWATER raced off the pacesetters
early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. MORNING BLURS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and
did not offer a bid.

and drew clear. DON'T RUB IT settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with good energy to be up for the place.
HERE'S THE THING was away in good order to set a pressured pace and gave way through the final furlong. GREAT CURVES lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. SHEZA MACHIAVELLI showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn
and did not threaten. HEY WILMAAA pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. COWLITZ showed brief speed and

STARBOARD LIST sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off when asked. STREET MOXIE was bumped at the start then
hustled along to chase the winner from off the rail throughout, could not gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. OFFICER OF WAR was
forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, failed to gain late but finished well to hold the show. PAMPERS N' BOOTS lacked early
speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished with some late run but missed the show. WORKING lacked early foot, raced off the rail through
the second turn and was not a factor. ARDENLEE STAR settled off the leaders early, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened. ATTERCOP
was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, steadied with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid thereafter. WILD
WILD KINGDOM lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
MATTAWA N THAT sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. LONO
chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. LUCK IS MY NAME was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain late. PAPA'S HONEY was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. PREACHINATDINNER was bumped at the break, lagged early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and did not threaten. MISTER G. Q. showed brief speed and weakened. LORD VADER was bumped at the start, lacked early
speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
BIG ENOUGH stalked the pace of BRITE LILY while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, quickly drew off and
was ridden out to be kept to task. PARKERS ROSE settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy to
gain the place. KISSABLE U was away alertly then forwardly placed, moved three-wide through the third turn, failed to gain in the drive but held on well for
the show. BRITE LILY sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. BARBELLO (NZ)
lagged early, raced four-wide through the third turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and did not menace. LOOKOUT TAYLOR lacked early
foot, saved ground through the third turn and was not a factor. MISS GUNNY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the third turn and did not
threaten. SHESAIDSHESPERFECT showed brief speed and weakened.
