SAINTSATION set the pace from the outset along the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane then repelled foes down the lane and drew away late under a
steady drive. BEYOND A MILLION stalked the pace early on, made a bid from between horses nearing the lane, was bumped in the stretch while under a
long drive and prevailed for place in the final stages. BERTRADA tracked the pace early, made a three wide bid nearing the lane, bumped foe down the lane
while under a drive and missed place in the final stages. JULIAISON raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch
run. GRACIANA trailed the field early on, rallied along the turn, was in the two path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. JUST FINE BY ME was
done early.

the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. ELITE POWER set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in
the stretch run. CARMEL CRUSH was bumped early on, chased the pace, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in
the drive. EMERALD EXPRESS tracked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. FAN CLUB was never a threat.
SURVEILLANCE was put in tight and clipped heels after leaving the gate, chased the early pace, was in the five path into the lane and empty late in the
drive. MOUNT KENYA was never a factor. STREET RUCKUS was done early. ROAD ABROAD came out at the start and was through after a half.
