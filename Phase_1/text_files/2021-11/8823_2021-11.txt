Footnotes
PAPI BELLO tracked the pace, gained a striking position and the lead on the two path through the turn, then drew off and was kept to the task. ROJO
TORO broke in, bumping a rival at the start, was allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane,
angled out and closed for the place. STORMY VICTORY inside early, angled three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and got
up for the show. WADADA well placed and inside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path, then drifted in and weakened. SIDNEY'S
BID allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and weakened. MY MAN VITO sprinted to a clear lead
soon after the start, then faded late. GENERAL COMMAND well placed, lost ground two and three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. BAD

Footnotes
BRONX angled out early to stalk the pace, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader, gaining a short lead, then
dueled with that one, came again, edged ahead and held. NUREYEV'S DREAM broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear, stayed on when challenged
through the turn, came again and edged ahead in the lane, then was outfinished in a good effort. ZIGGY well placed and three wide, held that path through
the turn, bid, then flattened in the lane, holding the show. PACIFIC LEGEND well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. UNDER FIRE sent into the turn on the two path, steadied and dropped back. HEAVEN'S TALE was a brief
factor, three wide. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA showed little, widest. PRAKRITI was never involved.

OF A REVOLUTION broke a step slowly from the gate, was bumped and pushed in, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled four wide to bid,
gaining a short lead, then shook clear into the stretch, drew off and was kept to the task. SUMMERY well placed and three wide, gained a striking position
and bid on that path into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest. SIMPLIFICATION unsettled in the gate, set a
pressured pace on the inside, then weakened in the stretch and held the show. SHASTREE broke in, bumping a rival at the start, dropped back early and
held position inside through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and flattened out. DESERT RULER vied for the early lead from between rivals and
faded into the stretch. FAST N STEADY bumped and pushed in at the start, was no factor.

Footnotes
NURSE JUDY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drove
clear and held. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up for the
place. YELLEN never far back, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path and evened out in the lane. UPTOWN QUEEN well placed, held
position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. BAD PAY set the pace on the inside,
stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. TAKE ME AS I AM never far back, held position on the two path through the
turn, came through on the path and weakened in the stretch. UNWANTED INPUT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals and faded the final furlong. GREY JAZMINE allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had
no rally. LADY NOY well placed, held position three wide through the turn and faded into the stretch. BEAUTY QUEEN was no factor. JULIE BIRD (IRE) ran
evenly for a half and faded.

Footnotes
KARENVILLE stalked the pace on the outside, gained position and a short lead on the two path, shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady
pressure. PERFECT KIMBERLY S well placed, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and hung.
KHOSEA steadied on heels into the first turn, was rated inside, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, brushed with a rival into the
stretch, and edged up for the show. RAISON THE GLASS mid pack and outside, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path, brushed with
KHOSEA into the stretch, then flattened out. BEARS BREECHES mid pack, moved up three wide into the second turn, held position through the turn, then
weakened in the stretch. HARDLY SOCIAL tracked the pace, was blocked and steadied behind a wall of horses approaching the stretch, and faded.
BELLE'S KINGDOM had a wide trip. LA VIEXA bobbled at the break and was off slowest, and was never involved. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS sprinted to a
clear lead, then faded into the stretch.
