FAST INTENTIONS vied between rivals and then inside, edged clear through the stretch under steady handling. AWESOME PAL made a menacing wide
bid on the turn, drifted out badly into the stretch and finished willingly. HONORABLE LILLY chased behind a wall of rivals down the backstretch then
flattened out in the stretch. BABY ICE forced the pace in hand three wide then weakened in the stretch. ENIGMATICA saved ground within range then
faded on the turn. WEST HORIZEN trailed early and was never in contention. TRIXIE'S TIME flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly.

over midway on the turn and continued gamely. AWESOME LAUNCH far behind early, rallied very wide and closed well too late. LIB'S CONTENTO chased
within striking range then proved empty in the stretch. ROLLING PALISADES saved ground throughout and lacked a solid rally. SURFER BOY GEORGE
dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. CLAW set the pace inside to midway on the final turn and gave way. JAYJAYDEE prompted the leaders
outside then began fading near the three eighths pole.

SINISE well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid to the front near the five sixteenths pole and pulled away driving. MYSTERY ITEM prompted the pace in
hand outside, led into the far turn, was collared but continued gamely. HONESTA dropped far behind, made a brief wide bid into the stretch then flattened
out. CALL ON CLARA saved ground while lacking speed and was never a factor. BOHEMIA BABE hustled to the front inside then stopped on the final turn.

pace outside and faded after half a mile. JOZANI R V F dropped back early and was always far behind. LOVEDISC was a late scratch at the gate on the
advice of the track veterinarian.
