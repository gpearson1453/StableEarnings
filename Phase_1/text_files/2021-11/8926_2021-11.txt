MAKING ME CRAZY raced five throughout, rallied in mid stretch widest of all and drew clear late. SCORSESE pressed the pace throughout, could not
match strides late with the winner but was second best. LONGLIVEJUSTICE was bumped at the start and trailed early, rallied in the stretch and split horses
but needed more late. I'M EVER READY vied for the lead until mid stretch and was outfinished late. ASTROMAN well placed, lacked a late response. KING
RICHIE set the pace until mid stretch, weakened late. REINSURE never far back, had no rally.

Footnotes
TIMELESS BOUNTY was never far back early, rallied in the stretch four wide, closed fast and was along in time. BEREN dueled on the lead throughout,
held grudgingly and just missed after a long stretch battle. MISTER LUIGI was well placed early, lugged in mid stretch causing BABY YODA to steady, then
finished willingly. JAXON TRAVELER dueled on the lead until late stretch and weakened slightly. AHIMELECH had good position three wide and went
evenly late. CHANNEL FURY was never far back, saved ground in the stretch but needed more. BABY YODA was off slowly and was allowed to settle,
steadied in mid stretch and did not threaten. A FEW TOO MANY was allowed to settle early, altered course mid stretch and was no menace. REAL TALK
contended early and was through after a half. INSOFAR raced wide early and was no menace. KILTOOM was outrun. NEWBOMB raced mid pack and was
no threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND DISQUALIFIED MISTER LUIGI FOR INTERFERENCE WITH BABY YODA IN MID
STRETCH AND PLACED HIM SEVENTH

never far back, lacked a late response and went evenly. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB unhurried early, saved ground and was no threat. SEATTLE TREASURE
