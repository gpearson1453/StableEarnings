Footnotes
PASCAL Stumbled at the start, saved ground in hand, appeared to be blocked nearing the quarter pole, waited, angled out some, altered in leaving the
furlong marker and rallied. MAGIC GRITS In hand along the three path, gained to take on the leaders three across at the top of the lane, kicked loose and
then failed to handle the winner. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO In hand along the two path, three path on the last turn, lodged a bid, chased and hung. LIAMS
MAJESTY Set the pace along the rail while pressed, battled into the lane and tired. BAY DEFENSE Unhurried up the backstretch, four wide on the last turn
and tired. GO CASH GO Vied for the lead, between at the top of the lane and faded. THE HEART FIXER Broke awkwardly, lagged back, three path on the
final bend and finished wide. FORZA JUVE Stumbled at the start, four after a half mile and then dropped far back while eased but did cross the line.
