Footnotes
CLEAR HUMOR stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead mid way on the far turn, was under urging in the drive and drew off. OUR
LUCKY MAN , unhurried along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out to the three path near the three eighths pole, circled foes to reach a striking
position turning for home then gamely chased the winner. IRISHMAN lacked speed, raced four deep leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. ARTISTIC
REASON , four wide both turns, gave way. WICKED PRANKSTER sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and tired leaving the far turn.
JACK GAVE BACK was outrun. ICE RAIN raced in the three path between horses while chasing the pace for six furlongs then faltered.

Footnotes
CHICAGO RIVER took over at once, was well rated while setting the pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure leaving the three eighths, responded
when set down in upper stretch, kicked away under a drive past the furlong grounds and was kept busy to the wire. JUNGLE BRIDE , a bit rank while four
wide around the first turn, remained well wide when edging closer to the winner into the far turn, forced the pace into the lane, failed to quicken leaving the
three sixteenths, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. HUMMIN' THE FUNK settled off the rail, exchanged a bump with SECRET PRIZE when four
wide and outside that rival leaving the three eighths pole, gave hard chase into the lane, shifted out some in the final furlong and continued with decent
energy. SECRET PRIZE saved ground early, eased out near the far turn, was bumped while chasing between rivals past the three eighths, came three to
four wide for the drive but lacked a significant kick. LEIA ORGANA stalked three wide, was under pressure leaving the far turn and weakened.
BELLSWILLBERINGING angled out entering the first turn and prompted the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on leaving the far turn, shifted in and
faded. LIKEHAIL saved ground without threatening. OUR SWEET PEA , four wide outside rivals early on, dropped back. SAINT RITA stumbled at the break
and was outrun.

Footnotes
MY FRIENDS BEER , rated well off the rail down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the far turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and
prevailed under brisk urging. GOODLUCKCHUCK opened up mid way down the backstretch, raced in the two path in the stretch, lost the lead in upper
stretch and finished gamely. CRUSH IT advanced along the inner rail reach contention in upper stretch and faded late. MY GOOD MAN hugged the inner
rail around the far turn and failed to be a menace. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL lacked speed, raced in the three path between horses around the far turn and
failed to rally. SWING WEST , four deep on both turns, was not a factor. SOLOMONIC raced along the inner rail and dropped back.

TAUBER , under a snug hold close up and between runners early on, eased out mid turn and responded to bid four deep entering the lane, dueled outside
rivals past the three sixteenths, took over soon after and edged away under a drive. SO DIALED IN broke a step slow then quickly recovered and moved up
in hand while saving ground, sat behind rivals leaving the far turn, moved off the inside past the five sixteenths and knifed his way between runners to
challenge approaching the stretch, battled inside the winner leaving mid stretch then kept on gamely while well clear of the rest. SAN ANTONE settled off of
a contested pace, angled well wide for the drive but only had a mild kick. TOP BOSS set a pressured pace towards the rail, shook clear mid turn, was
collared heading to the quarter pole, fought on to mid stretch then faded. LAZARETTO , off a bit slowly, move up in the opening quarter mile and forced the
issue four deep, was under pressure between runners entering the stretch and gave way. ALPHA QUEUE pressed the pace two wide and weakened in
upper stretch. TEMPTING MOMENT , three deep forcing the pace, raced between rivals leaving the three eighths, failed to keep up and faltered.

Footnotes
SOFIA'S SECRET lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch, was in hand lacking room near the eighth pole, moved outside approaching the
sixteenth pole, closed determinedly and was up near the finish. SURYA , along the inner rail on the turn, angled out leaving the turn, was fanned six wide
turning for home, closed, led late and just missed. ISABELLA'S GLORY saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch,
gained the lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. CECILITA , inside horses on the turn, raced in the three path in upper stretch, moved up in mid
stretch and flattened out. DANCE ROUTINE , between horses on the turn, raced inside rivals in the stretch and weakened. TEN TWENTY ONE chased the
pace around the turn, drifted wide entering the stretch, tired and was eased late. SIGN AND SEAL set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way.
FEEL THE GLORY prompted the pace outside SIGN AND SEAL and weakened. MELIPONINI BEE was no factor. ARIANA VALENTINA , wide on the turn,
was fanned to the seven path turning for home and gave way. TIME GOES FAST , wide around the turn, gave way. BOAT MONEY chased the pace,
stopped, was distanced and crossed the finish. Due do photo finish malfunction, finish margins were provided by chart caller.

Footnotes
WHISKEY AND RYE tracked a contested pace off the rail, bid three deep mid turn, vied outside foes into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch,
drifted in slightly, was confronted in the final jumps by a resurgent rival and got the bob. DR B bobbled outward at the break, corrected and quickly moved
up to the outside of GIFTED HEART and put a head in front, dueled with that one into the turn and past the five sixteenths, altered out after the winner
cleared in mid stretch, came back strongly, appeared to put a nose in front late then was nipped at the wire. OLIVE KAT saved ground off the leaders,
eased out three to four wide in upper stretch and closed steadily. GIFTED HEART sped to the front and dropped in, was joined after a furlong and headed
into the turn, came back to gain a slim lead mid turn, fought on to mid stretch then faded a bit. FIFTEEN ROYALS drifted in at the break and was in a bit
close, raced off the pace, shifted four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) , in tight at the break, was outrun.

AWARD WANTED stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up nicely to take a two wide lead mid way on the far turn, opened up in upper stretch and
was kept to her business in the drive. MIT MAZEL sprinted to the early lead, angled in entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead on the
far turn and finished gamely. LIKE A PRO lacked speed, swung outside leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. FOOL YOURSELF , three wide the first
turn, hugged the inner rail around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. ADMONISH was outrun. JOANIE'S SUNSET , four deep the first turn,
raced in the two path on the far turn, gave way and was eased late. MISTY'S BANSHEE , no factor, dropped back and was eased late.

BATTLE STATION pressed the pace two wide and between rivals, saw the leader get away in upper stretch, stayed on under solid handling, found more to
come back gamely in the final yards and forged ahead. THREES OVER DEUCES set a pressured pace inside, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch,
kept on gamely but just failed to last. ALWAYS SUNSHINE broke poorly, regrouped and edged up four wide nearing past the five eighths, was under
pressure pursuing into the lane and failed to generate the needed response. ARTHUR'S HOPE lost ground six wide into the turn, dropped in and raced in
range mid turn, angled back out to be well wide in upper stretch and offered a mild kick. MOJOVATION broke slowly, lost ground five wide nearing the turn,
angled in but came up empty through the drive. WHISKEY AND YOU forced the pace three wide, was under pressure into the lane and faded.
