Footnotes
HAYDENS HAVOC broke outwardly at the start, dueled inside of a rival around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, drew off under driving pressure
through midstretch, and was ridden out late. DESOTO'S WAR stalked the dueling leaders from the inside around the turn, chased entering the lane while,
slipped inside of tiring foes in upper stretch to claim place approaching the furlong pole, but proved no match for the leader in the process, then found the
wire before being caught by an outer foe to save place. OXXON was pinched back at the start between horses, trailed the field two wide into the turn, swung
five wide entering the lane, and rallied through the final furlong, but just missed reaching place. FAMILIAR WAYS was washed out pre-race with a visible
layer of sweat on his neck, prompted the dueling leaders three wide, ranged up entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart
passing the quarter pole, then faltered while hanging on his left lead. FREDERICKTOWN tracked from midpack in the three to four paths around the turn,
but tired through the lane while lugging in and hanging on his left lead. EL CASADORA dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the
quarter pole. GOLD INCENSE bumped an outer foe before being jostled between rivals at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but was outrun.

Footnotes
OSBOURNE vied for the lead two wide, assumed command passing the quarter pole, drew off under driving pressure with HITTING BOMBS giving chase,
and safely held sway. HITTING BOMBS staked along the inside, shifted two wide into the turn, claimed place at the three sixteenths pole while in pursuit of
a clear OSBOURNE, and chased that foe home well to prove second best. LOCO vied for the lead inside of OSBOURNE, but yielded to that foe at the
quarter pole, and faded. PAID TWICE broke a step slowly and minorly cropped a jump at the start, stalked two wide, got floated three wide around the turn,
and failed to bid. MASTER LEA broke inwardly and multiple lengths behind the leader, and was outrun.

Footnotes
GUNDUZ set the pace inside of a pressing STEELY DANZA, shrugged off that foes challenge when let out passing the quarter pole, inched clear, and held
sway. STEELY DANZA prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, chased the leader thereafter,
drifted a bit in the final furlong, and saved place from an inner foe on the wire. LOOT THE MOON stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase
evenly through the lane, then missed reaching a tiring outer foe for place on the wire. MY HOT TODDY stalked two to three wide around the turn, then
chased through the lane while hanging on his left lead. BASSETT settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, and
improved. WATERBOY never got involved. GET TO KNOW ME chased from midpack in the three to four paths around the turn, drifted outwardly turning for
home, and tired through the lane. EASILY INFLUENCED broke inwardly, then shied from STEELY DANZA early on as that rival angled out, took up in the
process, then laid off of the pace four wide, and faded around the turn.

BEAR ALLEY set the pace inside of a pressing KINGMEISTER, met that foe's bid entering the lane, tenaciously clung to an advantage while dueling
through the final furlong, and held on via a head bob on the wire. KINGMEISTER pressed the pace setter from the outside, bid entering the lane sparking a
duel, battled determinedly while inching closer to the leader's throatlatch in the final furlong, but was denied via a photo finish. HIGHESTDISTINCTION
stalked from along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead, chased thereafter, and lasted for show. BLANKET
OF ROSES lagged well behind the field early on, saved ground while improving inside of foes turning for home, then sustained a chasing rally though the
lane, but missed reaching an outer rival for show. BLAKE B. lied forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, but was restrained back into the
backstretch, laid well off of the pace into the far turn, and continued to fade thereafter. HAWK OF WAR bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace three wide,
and was done early.

Footnotes
KASSERINE PASS set the pace inside of a pressing TAKE CHARGE ERICA while staying a path off of the rail, glided away while well in hand passing the
five sixteenths pole, was roused approaching the furlong pole while not being fully menaced by a chasing CHAKRA, and held safely while being kept to task
to the wire. CHAKRA stalked three wide, improved four wide to claim place and take aim on the clear leader entering the lane, but was no match for that foe,
and proved second best. BETHABARA chased along the inside while under steady urging, and kept on evenly through the lane. SUMMER STORM got
antsy waiting for the gates to open, then saved ground off of the pace around the turn, improved past outer foes in upper stretch while tipping tow wide, and
stayed on for a minor share. SAVING SOPHIE bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed the field two wide into the turn, swung six wide entering the
lane, then split foes in midstretch, and moved up. KAY BEE GEE broke a step slowly at the start, pulled between horses to a two wide stalking position
down the backstretch, tipped three wide in upper stretch, but came up empty, and tired. HONEY PARADE lied off of the pace three wide, shifted five wide
entering the lane, but lacked a rally before being floated seven wide in midstretch, and failed to factor. TAKE CHARGE ERICA bumped with an inner foe at
the start, vied outside of the eventual winner while being kept in the three path around the turn by that rival, but failed to keep pace approaching the five
sixteenths pole, drifted four wide at the quarter pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
SIMOVITCH tracked the pace three wide, swept past rivals into the far turn to forge an advantage at the three furlong pole, showed the way before inching
clear in upper stretch, and held firmly from a rallying SONO GRATO through the final furlong. SONO GRATO trailed, gained four wide and outside of foes
around the far turn bid for place entering the lane, claimed that position in upper stretch while taking aim on the clear leader, ranged up to that foe in
midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but was denied getting past. RUNNIN' RAY shifted inwards around the first turn to achieve a two wide stalking
position from between horses, but failed to maintain that position while being rated to back off of the pace down the backstretch, shifted three wide around
the far turn while attempting to gain inside of SONO GRATO, but was outkicked by that foe while vying for place in upper stretch, altered course outwards to
sustain the chase, but failed to keep pace with that rival and the leader in midstretch, then safely managed show. ARABIAN PRINCE tucked into the first
turn before progressing inside of rivals to a stalking position around that bend, but lacked racing room while getting outmoved by outer foes around the far
turn, patiently waited until the top of the stretch to shifted five wide for clear sailing, but lacked a rally thereafter. CONTINENTAL COINS set the pace, but
was headed by the eventual winner at the three furlong pole, sustained pressing position turning for home, but gave way in upper stretch. TUGGLE
prompted the pace two wide, but was outmoved by the eventual winner at the three furlong pole, pressed among rivals turning for home, but weakened
between horses approaching midstretch.

Footnotes
FLAT AWESOME JENNY comfortably trailed the field, gained four wide around the turn, rallied outside of LARIMAR to bid along with that foe at the
sixteenth pole, drove past the leaders while sustaining the stretch long duel with that foe to the wire, and prevailed via a head bob. LARIMAR settled off of
the dueling leaders three wide, commenced a rally turning for home as FLAT AWESOME JENNY ranged up alongside, stayed on well along with that foe
through the lane, swept past the leaders while sustaining a battle inside of her bidding counterpart, but lost the head bob on the wire. INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ
set the pace inside of a pressing LADY OF LUXURY, dueled with that foe around the turn, tenaciously clung to the slightest of advantages from that rival
through midstretch, but was overhauled by a pair of outer challengers while flopping back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole, then prevailed in the
prolonged duel for show. LADY OF LUXURY pressed the pace two wide, dueled for the lead around the turn through a solid second fraction, sustained the
fight with her inner counterpart into the final furlong, but offered little resistance to a pair of bidding outer foes at the sixteenth pole. CATECHISM stalked the
dueling leaders from the two path into the turn, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. STERLING MISS saved ground off of the pace, trailed approaching the
five sixteenths pole, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SIR ALFRED JAMES quickly cleared off, managed that loose margin while in hand around the turn, was roused entering the lane, maintained a clear
advantage into the final furlong as LONG RANGE TODDY gave chase and ENDORSED pursued, met the former's bid inside the final sixteenth, and lasted
to the wire. LONG RANGE TODDY stalked two wide and from between horses while in the three path around the turn, inched ahead of those foes entering
the lane to take aim on a clear SIR ALFRED JAMES in upper stretch, chased that rival into midstretch, steadily progressed thereafter to menace passing the
sixteenth pole, but was denied. ENDORSED laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted five wide around the turn to commence an advance, picked up
stride turning for home, rallied outside of rivals through the lane, then grinded away at the leader's margin through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to
catch them. THREE TECHNIQUE stalked inside of a pair of rivals while staying in the two path, but was outmoved entering the lane, failed to produce a bid,
and tired in upper stretch. PNEUMATIC tracked the loose leader from the four path while outside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but weakened in upper
stretch. BON RAISON was outrun.

into the final furlong, surged approaching the wire to produce a late bid, and just got up. WICKED ECSTASY set the pace from a stalking
SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI around the turn, repelled that foe's bid entering the lane, shook clear in upper stretch, maintained a clear margin into the final
sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. TEMPLE BELLE chased the pace from the two path while under strong urging around the
turn, shifted four wide while sustaining stride enteirng the lane, grinded away at the leader's advantage in midstretch, but finished up evenly.
SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI stalked two wide, ranged up to the leader turning for home, but was repelled at the quarter pole, chased between horses after
being floated three wide in upper stretch, and weakened. MAGIC LAMP saved ground off of the pace, split foes two wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed
on. FRONTIER DYNASTY took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and improved in the lane. C V THUNDER bumped with an inner foe at the
