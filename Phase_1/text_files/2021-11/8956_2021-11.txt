Footnotes
CARASYNTHIA prompted the pace through the second turn from a two wide position, was given her cue inside of the furlong marker and made a quick rush
to collar the pacesetter and pulled away in the late going. CONFIDENCE BUILDER stalked the pace into the second turn and was outkicked in the stretch
run, while getting up for the place. REMEMBER SUE sat off of the pace while saving ground, gained ground leaving the second turn, was bumped by
DON'T TELL HYDEE inside of the final sixteenth and was outfinished. DASHING DEMI stalked the pace through the second turn while four wide and
weakened in the stretch drive. DON'T TELL HYDEE set all of the pace through the second turn, was confronted and quickly passed by the winner leaving
the furlong marker, was tiring and was erratic and swerved in the final sixteenth, bumped REMEMBER SUE and was empty in the late stages. VALDINI was
unhurried in the early going, was two wide on the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOSTER BOI sat just off of the early pace, mounted a two wide bid leaving the turn to confront EVENEREVENWORSE, found a stubborn foe in that rival
but wore that one down and drew clear in the end. EVENEREVENWORSE was away well and was sent to set the fractions, was confronted by FOSTER
BOI off of the turn, stubbornly battled back but gave in inside of the final sixteenth and was outfinished while besting the rest. COUNTING CARDS stalked
the pace from a four wide position and closed well in the stretch to win the nod for third. ELUSIVE LOVE stalked the pace while three wide on the turn,
gained ground leaving the bend but just missed for the show. LUCK IS GOLDEN was outrun into the turn, saved ground on the bend and made a mild late
rally in the stretch. STONE GROOVE chased EVENEREVENWORSE for the first quarter, lost ground heading into the turn and did not have a late kick.
DARKSABER chased the pace, mounted a five wide bid on the turn and weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
MECKLENBURG (IRE) attended to the early pace while rating nicely, was engaged by the runner-up on the second turn, gave a bit of ground to READY
SAY GO leaving the second turn, battled back and came on again in the final sixteenth to prevail. READY SAY GO sat just off of the early pace, mounted a
two wide bid at the five-sixteenths marker to confront MECKLENBURG, took a slight lead on that foe leaving the second turn, battled back when
MECKLENBURG re-rallied but could not hold him off while besting the rest. AMERICAN FARMER was content to settle at the rear through the second turn,
improved position leaving the turn and closed well in the stretch to claim the show in a blanket finish for that placing. BLUE DIVA settled off of the pace
through the second turn, gained ground in the stretch but was outfinished and just missed for third. SACRED RIDER stalked the pace through the second
turn, mounted a three wide bid leaving the turn and was outkicked in the drive. HYGH I. Q. set the pace through the backstretch while being pressured by
MECKLENBURG, dropped back entering the second turn, stopped nearing the top of the lane, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
IL BELLATOR attended to the quick pace by MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH, mounted a two wide bid on the second turn to confront that foe, extended the lead off
of the turn, ducked in under right-handed urging inside of the final sixteenth but was clear in the end. DEL MO sat just off of the early pace, was three wide
on the second turn and closed well in the stretch to claim the place. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH set quick fractions while being prompted by IL BELLATOR, was
confronted by that rival on the second turn, relinquished the lead and was outfinished in the late going, while holding for the show. KLIMTOGLORY was up
close while four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace from a ground saving position on the second turn and mounted a mild late bid in the stretch. HANS
GRUBER was forwardly placed to the second turn while four wide and gave way in the late going. LITTLE CASINO settled near the rear of the field through
the second turn and did not offer a late rally. SUBITO SLEW was unhurried through the second turn while two wide and did not have a late kick in the

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE prompted the pace into the second turn, made a two wide bid to confront SLEEP OVER entering the stretch and kicked clear in the
end. BERNALINHO settled toward the back of the field, was two wide on the second turn, swung out to the four path for the stretch run and made a bold late
rally to claim the place. MOUNT PELLIAR settled in the midflight, saved ground on the second turn and closed well in the stretch for third. BARBARONI
stalked the pace from the midpack and lacked a final kick in the stretch run. MAYBE SOMETIME was forwardly placed through the second turn and was
outkicked in the late going. SLEEP OVER was away well and set the pace while being prompted into the second turn, was confronted by AUSPICIOUS
STYLE nearing the head of the lane and tired in the stretch run. SEAHAWK CODY stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground and
weakened in the drive. SEA SAILOR was keen and pulled on the jockey on the first turn and into the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn and
gave way in the stretch. RAILSPLITTER was unhurried in the early stages, was three wide on the second turn and was not a factor. CROWN AND
PICKLES sat just off of the early pace, gave ground on the backstretch and was done after a half-mile.
