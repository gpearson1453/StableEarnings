GOTIGER SPECIAL away alertly, set all the pace, turned back bids from multiple opponents near the quarter pole and prevailed under confident handling.
AWESOME BREAK chased the winner into the far turn, drew closer two wide then was no match while clear for second. BAY DEFENSE stalked the pace
into the far turn, offered a mild bid three wide at the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. MUTADARRIB void of early speed, passed tiring rivals.
SUVOROV'S HERO saved ground and failed to menace. BOBBIE'S DERBY BOY was outrun.

marker and finished full of run to win going away. TREASURED NIKKY broke sharply, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted out under left handed
urging then was no match for the winner. ROSA'S SOUL inside, angled out to the six path entering the stretch and finished determinedly. KIKI'S LULU

four path entering the stretch then faded. LINK IN FRONT well placed, gave way in the stretch.

GRINS N' WINS stalked the early pace, drew on even terms for the lead three then two wide midway on the turn, matched stride until mid stretch, edged
clear and just lasted under right handed urging. UCANTKEEPUP unhurried early, closed fast two wide through the stretch and just missed getting up in time
inside the winner. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE never far back, finished with good courage in the five path. HEIDI'S BACK failed to menace. DOLLY DEAR sprinted
to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the rail until the furlong maker then weakened. BLANCONIA pressed the pace two into the turn then
weakened. LAISSEZ FAIRE trailed.

Footnotes
GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then drew off at will to win as much the best under
brisk handling. JUJU NINETEEN never far back, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished second best. MIDNIGHT ALIBI close up from the
start, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished for second. BUNDLEDLIKE BERNIE closed ground in the four path through the
turn then failed to sustain that bid. FIRST CROWNED pressured the winner along the inside for a half, drifted to the five path entering the stretch then faded.
FLYING GUILLOTINE raced wide and was never involved. GAISGEACH was no threat. MASTER had speed for a half then gave way. RUN KITTY was a
sharp threat into the turn then flattened out. VIOLENT SURPRISE trailed far back into the turn, lost contact with his field, was eased and returned bleeding
from the nostrils.

STARLIT SECRET broke well, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win easily. QUEEN CREED was in tight at the start, settled inside, shifted
out three wide near the furlong marker then rallied for second. SONNET saved ground, offered a bid along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished for
second. WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD chased the winner two wide into the stretch, shifted out then faded. FLATTER HER AGAIN chased the winner two and
three wide into the stretch and weakened late. THE LAST APPLE raced outside into the stretch, steadied outward as inside rivals shifted out in mid stretch
then weakened. BUSYBEING FABULOUS broke inward and had brief speed. MAYBE FRANKY trailed.

Footnotes
CAROL'S ROYALTY made the lead soon after the start, se5t all the pace under pressured, drifted in a bit brushing FLAT OUT SUPER at the sixteenth pole
and just lasted under strong handling. EXTRA SALSA pressed the pace four wide into the turn, drew on near even terms for the lead, drifted to the six path
entering the stretch giving up ground then came on again late and just missed. VELVET SAMI slow early, closed fast two wide through the stretch.
ARCHIE'S GIRL unhurried early, was steadily gaining ground three wide late. CASCABRIA never far back, finished well outside. FLAT OUT SUPER broke
inward bumping a rival at the start, was then bumped from her outside rival, offered a strong bid along the rail into the stretch, was brushed by the winner at
the sixteenth pole then outfinished. WOLF EYES broke inward bumping FLAT OUT SUPER at the start and had a late gain in the middle of the racetrack.
GOLDEN GALAXY GIRL had speed two wide into the stretch then faded in the stretch five wide. TURING MACHINE raced wide and lacked the needed
response. HOXIE was outrun. DIAMONDSINHEREYES was bumped at the start, had speed along the inside into the turn, stopped abruptly and was eased
too the wire and walked off. THE RIDER OF FLATE OUT SUPER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CAROL'S ROYALTY AND PLACED HER SIXTH.
