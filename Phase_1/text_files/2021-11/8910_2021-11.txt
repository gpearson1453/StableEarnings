Footnotes
FRITTONS GOLD never far back, closed with a rush in the six path through deep stretch and was along in time under mild urging. FLAMING HOT broke in
front, set all the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. HURRICANE NATION chased the pace until deep stretch and finished with good
courage. YOU ARE AWESOME well placed, failed to respond. UNCLE KEVIN failed to menace. BORN TO BE KING pressed the pace for three and one
half furlongs then faded. JAMAICAN MAGIC close up, weakened in the stretch. NO TIME TO YAWN was outrun. AMERICAN DRIVEN was no factor.
LONESOME PHIL checked repeatedly while lacking racing room along the inside nearing the turn and lost his irons. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION. FRITTONS GOLD WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

wide through the final furlong and just missed between horses. ABBY'S DESTINY had a mild late rally. WEIGHTLESSNESS stalked pace the early pace
then went evenly. AT FIRST BLUSH had good early speed then faded. MOR BREEZE matched strides for the lead two wide into the turn then weakened.

LUCKY QUARTERS away alertly, set all the pace and drew off through the stretch under a hand ride to win going away. I'M FEELING LUCKY chased the
pace three wide, brushed near the quarter pole then finished second best. BAD KARMA never far back, offered a mild bid four wide on the turn then leveled
off. WHOVILLE broke a step slow and was no threat. OFFLEE SILKIE chased the pace two wide, brushed near the quarter pole and faded late. ON THE
CLOCK vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, brushed at the quarter pole, gave way and returned bleeding from the nostrils. THE RIDER OF
OFLEE SILKIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BAD KARMA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW
THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

PLAY BALL chased the pace two wide into the stretch, surged in the five path to make the lead late and drew off under mild urging. CLEVERLY WICKED
hopped then bumped a rival at the start, trailed early, closed rapidly along the rail through the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, set the pace until
deep stretch then was no match for the winner. QUALITY MAN never far back, finished with good courage three wide. THE MAN CAN settled close up in
the five path, had speed into the stretch and faded late. OHIO PLAYER away alertly, set the pace in the two path for nearly a half then weakened. JUDGE
HEAD failed to menace. ATTACK ANGLE was outrun. CHARLEE'S MAGIC hopped then bumped with the runner up at the start, settled mid pack then
lacked the needed response. FIREUPTHEJET had speed from the start, inched closer three wide on the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
HIP HIP HOORAY away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a hand ride. MCGRAW stalked the pace
near the inside, shifted out entering the stretch then finished well clear for second in the four path. DEXQUIRE pressured the winner two wide into the
stretch then faded. ROLLIN SO PERFECT failed to menace. GONE IN A FLASH had speed for a half then weakened. YOU'RE OUT was no factor. GRACE
SILENT WISH was outrun. DERBY DAY CENTS was no threat.
