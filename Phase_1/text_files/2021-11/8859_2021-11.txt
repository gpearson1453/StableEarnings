the turn, could not move on with rival turning for home, sustained a two wide bid under a left handed drive and finished clearly second best. WAR MAIDEN

Footnotes
NOBLE PURSUIT was allowed to settle and save ground around the first turn, was nicely rated just sitting just off the early pace through the backstretch,
tipped out and headed in pursuit near the quarter pole, hustled up three wide into the lane and ran down TIZONA in the final sixteenth. TIZONA was ridden
along and held a slim lead going by the wire for the first turn, set the pace near the inside through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, roused
two wide into the lane, fought back when challenged by the winner in the final furlong but was no match late. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR stalked the pace
along the inside, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained a two to three wide bid and prevailed for a share. MORE POWER TO HIM tracked the pace
three wide through the backstretch, hustled along four wide into the lane and failed to move on. CREATIVE PLAN was forwardly placed sitting just off the
pacesetter through the backstretch, coaxed two wide leaving the far turn and weakened in the lane. SWAMP SOUFFLE was reserved in the back, saved
ground around the far turn, was put to a drive entering the lane and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
ROUSING RUBBLE vied for the early lead racing outside of UNCONCIOUS POWER, shook free from rival near the five-sixteenths pole and turned back the
bid from CIBERTRUCK late on the turn, roused for more turning for home, responded gamely, widened to a clear advantage and finished going away.
NORTH FORK took closer order while was ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and secured second best.
CIBERTRUCK tracked the top two early leaders in the opening quarter, raced three wide in striking distance at the quarter pole, could get by the eventual
winner, weakened off the top spot and just lasted for show. THIRTYMINUTEMASS chased up the inside around the turn, gained closer contention in the
upper stretch then gave way in final stages. AGUA DORADO hustled up out of the gate but lacked early speed, went wide into the lane and never
threatened. UNCONSCIOUS POWER vied inside of the eventual winner, could not match strides past the midway point around the turn and steadily faded.
WED O'S CHAMP raced in the last flight, wide into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
PASSED BY PAUL was forwardly placed racing four wide around the first turn, vied outside of SPITIT MISSION through the backstretch and around the far
turn, held a slight edge then shook clear just past the eighth pole, came out wider under right handed pressure and stayed sharp while pulling away. SPIRIT
MISSION held a slight edge around the first turn and dueled inside of PRESSED BY PAUL through the backstretch, remained on equal terms around the far
turn, could not move on with the winner past the eighth pole but stayed on well to clear second best. KENZOU'S RHYTHM hustled up out of the gate and
raced up close three wide heading into the first turn, tracked the top flight through the backstretch, launched a bid for command near the quarter pole, tipped
out wider under left handed urging at the eighth pole and churned on for a share. INCLUDE HOO rated outside off the early pace, floated out leaving the far
turn, angled in to race three wide a furlong out and lacked a needed rally. INTIMIDATING settled and saved ground through early stages, came off the
inside entering the far turn, coaxed two wide between foes in the upper stretch and failed to move on. CHEF was reserved in the back, saved ground around
the far turn and lacked the needed response for late impact. OUT FOR JUSTICE vied for the early lead, came up empty after a half and jogged in.

BLACKBERRY LISA tracked the embattled top pair through early stages and picked up the pace near the quarter pole, was put to a drive at the head of the
lane, responded willingly, swept by leaving the furlong marker and was ridden out in the final sixteenth. MY FUNNY GAL dueled with SUNSHINE AND
EMILY through early stages, briefly held a slim lead at the quarter pole then came back under attack at the head of the lane, was no match for pulling away
winner past the furlong marker but sustained a steady bid for second best. SUNSHINE EMILY vied inside of MY FUNNY GAL for the early lead, remained
up close late on the turn then given cue turning for home, regained a slight edge at the head of the lane then failed to be a match for pulling away winner
past the eighth pole. WINDI'S MOMENT tracked the top flight through early stages, launched a four wide bid late on the turn, angled in a couple paths under
pressure in the upper stretch and flattened out. INTOXICATING KISS raced off the early speed, hustled up turning for home and failed to rally. WAVERLY
WAY raced outside off the pace, came wide into the lane and never menaced. NOT THAT I RECALL hustled up around the turn, came two wide into the
lane and faded. MY EXPRESSION lacked speed, raced wide into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
FIRE WHEN READY settled nicely and raced two wide around the first turn, tracked in good position through the backstretch, moved up tree wide at the
three eighths pole, took a slim lead over UNION BROTHER, cleared on top at the head of the lane, angled inside and finished going away. UNION
BROTHER stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved up two wide entering the far turn, raced in aim at the quarter pole, was no match for
winner past the upper stretch but stayed on with response and cleared second best. WRATH raced off the early pace, launched a three to four wide bid
leaving the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and finished on equal terms for show. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT settled through early stages,
launched a rail bid leaving the turn, stayed on with response and finished on equal terms for show. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was reserved in the back, was
ridden along four wide into the lane and failed to rally. LIL LATIGO set the pace through the backstretch, got collared and weakened around the final turn.
CAPITAL REEF tracked up close through the backstretch and came up empty around the far turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
