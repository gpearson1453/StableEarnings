ZOOM UP tracked the two rival duel from the inside into mid-turn, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, moved to near even terms with the leaders
when straightening then drove clear. LEMON ROSES vied for the lead two wide through the far turn, dueled with the winner briefly into the lane, was no
match for the winner after straightening then stayed on well to save the place spot. THIRTEEN STRIPES raced in the three or four path through the far turn
when never far back, came into the lane from the five path and was up for the minor share. MISS BETTE LUTE reared up at the break and spotted the field
some six lengths, trailed into the lane while racing off the inside, was in the five path through the lane and never was a serious threat. ROYAL'S GIRL vied
for the lead along the inside through the far turn then gave way entering the lane. TONAPITA saved ground through the turns and when not far back then
was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
BOLD BIZNESS was brushed at the start and briefly last, rushed up to contend before the first call, pressed into the turn, cleared in late turn, widened to the
eighth pole and held while being kept to the task. READY FOR MORE was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, took aim on the top one into the
lane, was making slow progress through the final eighth from the three path and just lasted for the place spot. ROOKWOOD chased early from the inside,
was allowed to settle through mid-turn, asked for more into the lane and showed good energy while skimming the rail to just miss the place spot. PABLO'S
SUN raced along the inside through the turn when well back, came into the lane from the four or five path and passed a couple. GEORGE THE MAN set the
pace into mid-turn then gave way through the lane. TASER was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane widest and was empty.

SHIPSHAPE stalked the pace from the two path through the turn, asked for more near the quarter pole, quickly cleared then widened under a drive.
ALTERNATE NIGHTS raced in the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five or six path and was all out late to just get up for the place spot.
BENNY'S LEGACY chased from the three path through the turn, swung into the lane from the four path and stayed on well to just miss the place spot.
BABY VINCENT set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way. KULMER was never a factor while in the two path throughout. OVERJOY broke
out at the start, saved ground and lacked a response.

AKAMAI stalked the pace in the three path, rallied at the the three-sixteenths pole, dueled briefly and then drew off under mild urging. REMEMBER HYMN
led in the two path, dueled briefly in the stretch, then couldn't match strides with the winner. ROTARY DIAL stalked the pace in the three path but offered no
late bid. COMPASS POINT stalked the early pace between foes, but had no late bid. MACHO ALEGRE pressed the pace in the two path, was steadied just
past the half-mile pole while in tight quarters, bumping a foe inside. SILENT SONATA passed tired rivals. INDIGO RICH pressed the pace inside and was
taken up just past the half-mile pole when bumped and squeezed back. ROCKET DOCKET stalked the early pace in the three path, saved ground around
the turn, then faded in the stretch. The Stewards disallowed a claim of foul against MACHO ALEGRE which was lodged by the rider of INDIGO RICH
alleging interference just past the half-mile pole.

inside, then couldn't hold off the winner. PRETTY ASSETS stalked the pace in the four path but offered no late bid. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP pressed the
pace outside of the leader but then faded in the stretch. DONTYOUREMEMBER saved ground and improved position late. TIMELESS ROSE was off
awkwardly. AMAZING GAL stalked the pace in the three path before fading in the stretch. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN hopped at the start, stalked the pace
four wide, then faded.
