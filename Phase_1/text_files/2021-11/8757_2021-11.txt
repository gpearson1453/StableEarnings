Footnotes
PINK LLOYD forced the pace from the rail, dueled late turn, gained a short lead upper stretch and held gamely to the end under a brisk hand ride. SOUPER
HOT broke inward, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, yielded a narrow margin and gave PINK LLOYD no breather as he dogged the champ to
the wire. TOLD IT ALL, in range, rode the rail on the turn, angled out mid stretch and rallied late. FORESTER'S FORTUNE settled in mid pack, closed three
and four-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. DUN DRUM stalked the pace, chased on the turn but leveled out in the final 16th. MAGICAL MAN, herded at
the start, settled at the back of the pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
OVER THE HILLS bumped with PRIDE AND PASSION leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch, rallied and had command in deep stretch, driving. COMMANDER TOM showed brief early foot then pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide
through the turn but was outkicked. LOADED SNIPER moved up to a short lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear on the turn but was passed in deep
stretch. PRIDE AND PASSION, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn and stayed on the wood although tentative
while inside the eventual winner. JOJOMAR settled in mid pack, closed three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. RACE FOR PINKS stalked the pace,
came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. BETTER BOOGIE, in range, closed four-wide late turn and chased
gamely to the wire. HIGHLAND SOCIETY, in touch, chased three to five-wide on the turn and was also gamely to the end. KARAKONTIE PAT hopped at
the start, settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then failed to menace. GLITTER MOUNTAIN, pinched back at the start, settled well
off the pace, was hustled on the turn but was never in contention. PER RULING #HP104864 FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, LOADED
SNIPER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
PERFECT PLAY got over to the inside from his outside post into the first turn but had only two rivals beaten, stayed inside down the backside to get into
range on the far turn, was run into the back of a stopping foe and steadied back at the quarter pole, regrouped and zipped up the fence to bid turning for
home, had the lead quickly and opened up down the lane. MY REDEMPTION was bumped by a rival at the start and settled off the pace along the inside,
followed the winner on the far turn and into the stretch but was no match for that one's kick, up the fence for the place spot at the sixteenth pole and driven
hard to hold that spot. CAM WOOLLEY sat on the rail in midpack, angled out two to three wide between rivals on the far turn and out in the five path turning
for home, closing gradually down the lane while remaining on his left lead to get the show spot. AUKSINE KULKA bumped a rival at the start and chased in
the two path early, advanced to tackle the pace survivor on the far turn and had the lead turning for home but the winner zoomed by to his inside soon after
and he lost positions in the final sixteenth. BROKE AN BROKEN settled in midpack but dropped back to off the pace by early on the far turn, re-rallied along
the rail to behind a wall of runners in midstretch, yanked out to the outside of that group and went by them in the six path but was no threat to the top four.
HAYROLL off the pace and two to three wide early, circled the field three to five wide on the far turn and out in the eight path turning for home, evening out
in the final sixteenth. MORE HARDER chased the two early leaders along the inside, began to lose ground midway on the far turn and did not recover.
TIMMINS on hold and three wide near the back on the first turn, got inside late on the backside and angled out three wide at the quarter pole but his rally
stalled in the final furlong. DONTCALLMESWEETY began awkwardly but recovered quickly to set a fast pace while being pressed by a rival, shook that one
off late backstretch but was immediately challenged by another foe, headed by that one late on the far turn and called it a day from that point. CALM DOWN
was four wide and off the pace early, advanced three to four wide into range on the far turn and out in the six path turning for home, dropping back in the
final furlong. INNOCENT MOVES hustled for the early lead and dueled with a rival to his inside through fast fractions, began to leak oil into the far turn and
backed through them. WALSINGHAM chased three wide on the first turn, began to drop back late backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
STRIKER was in the mix early before dropping back to chase along the inside, angled out late on the turn, bid turning for home and got the front at the
eighth pole, switching leads back and forth and laying in greenly down the lane but powering away in the final sixteenth despite those antics. GHOSTLINER
won the break despite bearing out, led and maintained a short lead with stalkers to his inside and out, was collared by the winner at the eighth pole, staying
on to be a clear second best. BUCK MOON hit the gate at the start and was off the pace along the inside, rode the rail throughout and was inching up late
without threatening the top pair. WOOD BE WILD brushed with a rival at the start but quickly came up inside the leader and stalked that one from the rail,
stayed game to the eighth pole but faded from there. OLD BLUE CLIFF broke in and brushed with a rival at the start, in midpack and between runners three
to two wide on the turn and ran evenly down the stretch after a mild rally to midstretch. AZZURRO was taken back out of the early scramble for the front,
advanced four to five wide on the turn and out in the six path turning for home but could not get into contention. SASKATCHEWAN was herded when a rival
crowded him at the start, dropped back to trail the field entering the turn and passed a few stragglers down the lane along the inside. NIAGARA SKYLINE
was four wide the entire trip, loomed outside when rallying on the turn but lugged in upper stretch and retreated from that point. JACKIE'S PRIDE was
bumped by a rival at the start, in the mix three wide for the early lead, stayed in range until upper stretch but was out of run at that point.

LUCAS N' LORI raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the far turn, rallied determinedly and was up late under a drive. CERRADO forced the
pace, dueled on the backstretch, edged ahead early turn, shook clear into the stretch but was caught in the late stages. ROCKET PLAN settled off the pace,
closed two-wide on the far turn, tipped out four-wide entering the stretch and rallied outside. PICCADILLY BEAU raced in mid pack, was hustled two to
four-wide on the final turn then was outkicked for the show spot in the stretch. KNOPFLER set a pressured pace, dueled on the backstretch, was headed
entering the far turn and chased to the end. DOUBLE THE HEART stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn but lacked a
closing response. SWEEPIN HARD bobbled at the outset and settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn then evened out in the late
stages. SOCIETY JOE settled in mid pack, closed along the rail on the far turn, was in striking range upper stretch but leveled out. AMBERWOOD got away
poorly, settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. ENGLISH ILLUSION was away slowly and settled off
the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn and mistered a mild late run. GIANT MINE was off slowly, settled in mid pack, dropped back through
the far turn and trailed home.
