POSITIVE FORCE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, hit the front nearing the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn, then
drew out in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. FIRST LADY MAGGIE was well placed early on the inside, made a two wide bid leaving the turn, then
shifted back to the inside but could not go with the winner while clearly second best. CHIT CHAT GIRL was unprepared at the start, then was slow into
stride, then raced on the inside on the turn, shifted out three wide leaving the turn, bested rest. HEADED FOR HEAVEN was rank and drifted out badly at
the start, then raced far back early and was never a threat. MAD MOMMA set the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
MOONSAFE was rated along the inside, eased out midway on the turn, was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the drive, closed well late to
get up in time under a drive. MAJESTIC GREELEY was bumped at the start, then vied for the early lead, then was rated off the pace and shifted out to
make a three wide bid on the turn, drew clear leaving the turn and widened by the furlong marker but was caught at the wire to just miss. GRAY ROYALITY
was settled early and came three wide into the drive, finished willingly despite trying to lug in through the drive. FARMAVET passed the tiring rivals while
saving ground. TIP TOP TAPPER bobbled slightly at the start, chased the pace two to three wide and weakened. YOU NEVER CALL set the early pace and
moved down to the inside and faltered.

settle early, dropped down to the inside on the far turn and had no rally. OSCAR WINNER pressed the early pace three wide and tired. EYES OF ZEUS

ANNAMATED MOON stalked the early pace two wide, then made a three wide bid on the turn, hit the front leaving the quarter pole, then drew off in the
strtrech to prove much the best, driving. COMMANDING GENERAL set the early pace on the inside while clear, then was headed by the winner by the
quarter pole, proved to be no match for that rivals while clearly second best. CALCULATED THINKIN chased the early pace and was four to five wide on the
turn, then finished evenly late, held show award. YES IT'S ROO was allowed to settle early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally
on the outside. SURE WOULD FOREST was allowed to settle early, then raced two to three wide on the turn and had no rally. SIR ROCKPORT chased the
pace three wide and weakened. OXIDE failed to menace. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. SWEET N SILVER
was not a factor.

Footnotes
AMERICAN FORCES broke outwardly at the start, bumping ZILLION, then once corrected was rated on the inside on the first turn, made a inside move on
the turn, drew off in the stretch to prove best under a mild drive. CRYPT was sandwiched at the start, then relegated to the back early, made a inside move
on the turn, angled out in mid stretch, but could not gain on the winner while clearly second best. CAYMAN ISLAND vied for the early lead three to four
wide, then rated off the pace on the backstretch, continued four wide on the turn and weakened, bested rest. ZILLION bumped soundly at the start, then
was settled back early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, swung out three wide for the drive and had no rally. MIDDLE EARTH chased the pace four
wide and weakened. HOLD THE IRISH broke in and bumped CRYPT at the start, then chased the pace from between rivals and tired. ECONOMIC POWER
vied for the early lead two to three wide, then went on to set the pace leaving the five eighths, then got out leaving the seven sixteenths, then was six wide
by the quarter pole and gave way. The rider on ZILLION and the rider on CRYPT claimed foul against the rider on AMERICAN FORCES for interference out
of the gate, after the stewards reviewed the replays they allowed both claims of foul and placed AMERICAN FORCES fourth from first.

COUNTESS SHANAKILL was well rated early and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, hit the front nearing the furlong marker and drew out in the final
eighth to prove best under hand urging. SOCIAL EXCLUSION dueled for the lead and made a inside bid on the turn to shake clear, then was headed by the
winner by the three sixteenths, proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. CELTIC RING was reserved early, then advanced on the
inside on the turn and bested the rest while saving ground. RED HOT KITTEN was allowed to settle early, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole and
then was empty. MAKEMEASAMMICH dueled for the lead three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
MADAME CHANNEL was allowed to settle early, then raced on the inside by the quarter pole, made a inside bid in the stretch and hit the front in the furlong
grounds and won going away under left handed urging. SAND IN MY SHOES was bumped soundly at the start, then advanced three wide on the turn, made
a bid by the furlong marker but could not go with the winner late while clearly second best. FALSE RULING set a unchallenged pace and was headed
shortly after the furlong marker and weakened, lasted for the show award. EMILIA STRONG was reserved early, came five wide into the stretch and had a
belated rally for the minor rewards. NIKKIS KITTEN was allowed to settle early on the inside but offered no rally. SINFUL BEAUTY broke out, bumping
SAND IN MY SHOES at the start, then tacked the early pace and was four wide by the quarter pole and then was empty. ESKENDEREYA'S GIFT failed to
menace. IVY was not a factor.
