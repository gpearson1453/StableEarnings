in late stretch. LAB RAT chased the early pace while inside then saved ground but was no menace to the top two in late stretch. BLUEGRASS BREEZE
rallied four wide on the turn making a bid then flattened out in the drive. RICHARD'S TX BLING was unhurried early then rallied four wide on the turn making
a bid in the stretch but was no threat in the end. KING JINGALING was unhurried early then made a mild rally while four wide in the stretch but as no threat.
THE BONDSMAN was inside on the turn and no menace. STRAWMAN chased the early pace while two wide, was sued up and gave way. NABS was
bumped at the start then unhurried and was no threat. ELLIOT'S HOPE was unhurried early and no threat. COME ON COME ON was through early and
