THE MET tracked the early pace, raced five wide into the turn, took control late and edged clear. LIFE IS A BANQUET chased the early pace, raced four
wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up and finished second best. REVOLT AND RIOT was void of speed, advanced between rivals
and was along for third. CORRINA CORRINA was unhurried early, raced seven wide and flattened out. CHARLIE DYNASTY stalked the early pace from off
the rail and was empty. BITTEN was taken back early, raced between rivals and offered no late rally. SUPER HUNK was allowed to settle behind horses
and never fired. ARROGANT PUNCH set a clear early pace from the inside and faded.
