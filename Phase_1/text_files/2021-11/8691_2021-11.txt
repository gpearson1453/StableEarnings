lane and saved the show spot. CREATIVE JOY raced off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn and closed mildly. REACH FOR THESTARS
raced four wide early, stalked four wide, continued four wide on the far turn and had no rally. SIMPLY SMASHING tracked along the inside, saved ground

was outrun. ALYS GREAT NOTION raced three wide early, chased the pace, gave way, had the saddle slip, then was distanced in the stretch and walked

AMERICAN UNITY stalked close up three wide, bid on the turn, dueled with INSTAFAMOUS, put a head in front in upper stretch, then dug in determinedly
outside of that rival to maintain the edge. INSTAFAMOUS set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled inside entering the stretch, dug in gamely on
the rail in the final furlong and battled to the end. BUCKS ARE MOVING chased between rivals, raced two wide on the turn, rallied inside and finished
evenly late. TATE was outrun early and closed well late on the inside. HOISTTHEMAINSAIL raced three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the turn
and lacked a rally. FEARLESS FLY chased inside, came three wide into the lane and tired. BUFFALO SHUFFLE bobbled at the break, raced off the pace
inside, three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. VOY A TI was outrun.

SENSE A MILLION reluctant to load, bobbled at the break, stalked the leaders, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside, took over, pulled away under some
urging and then was ridden out. MOON CHANT pulled in the early stages, dueled inside for the lead, then chased, re bid two wide, took over on the far turn,
briefly dueled with the winner and then weakened. FROSTY FRIEND raced off the pace inside and did not factor. LIFE ON THE EDGE was fractious in the
gate, dueled two wide for the lead, took over on the backside, briefly dueled again, then gave way, was eased in the stretch and walked off.
