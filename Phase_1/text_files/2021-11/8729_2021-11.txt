Footnotes
SCOOPER CHICK sat just off of the early pace while rating nicely, mounted a bid while three to four wide on the turn and applied pressure to SKY MAKER
through the lane to edge clear over that foe in the end. SKY MAKER was away well and set quick fractions from the two path, was confronted by SCOOPER
CHICK leaving the turn and was outfinished, while a clear second over the rest. PERFECTAMENTE stalked the pace from the midflight while traveling in the
three path and closed well in the stretch to win the head nod for third. MI AMARE pressed the early pace, vied for the lead on the turn while three wide and
weakened in the late going. HAYDEN'S ANGEL settled in the second flight and did not have a late rally. AVANTERINA was rank in the early going, saved
ground while trailing on the turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch. STYLIZED had no early speed, saved ground and was not a factor. KAZAKHSTAN
pressed the early pace from the inside, steadied on the turn while in tight quarters and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
FATHER O'FLAHERTY settled off of the early pace, was three wide between foes on the turn, angled out to the five path for the drive, had a late kick in the
final sixteenth, was confronted in the final strides by BY MOONLIGHT and just held on over that oncoming rival to prevail. BY MOONLIGHT was content to
trail through the early going while saving ground, swung out to the six path for the stretch run, surged through the final sixteenth to confront the winner but
was denied for the win, while besting the rest. SCRATCHY APACHE tracked the early pace from a three wide position, gained ground leaving the turn but
was outkicked by the top pair in the late going. LUCK IS GOLDEN was away well and set the pace from the inside, was confronted inside of the eighth pole
and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. CORSICAN pressed the early pace from a two wide position and weakened in the stretch run. SEA SAILOR
chased the pace while saving ground on the turn and did not offer a late rally. SABUDA tracked the early pace, was four wide on the turn while losing
ground and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
IL CAPITANO was away in good order and set moderate fractions while rating nicely, was two wide on the second turn, had a clear lead into the stretch and
felt pressure by the runner-up in the final sixteenth but dug in to hold for the win. AS AMATTER OF FACT hopped at the start and settled at the rear of the
field, improved position on the second turn while in the four path and closed well in the stretch to pressure the winner but could not reel him in while a clear
second over the rest. HIGHLAND GHOST stalked the pace through the second turn while three wide and did not offer a late rally. MIDNIGHT MOJO was
forwardly placed through the early going, gained ground along the inside on the second turn but weakened in the late stages. DIMMI QUANDO was four
wide on the first turn, settled off of the pace through the second turn while saving ground and finished evenly in the stretch run. VELVET GHOST tracked the
leader through the second turn while saving ground and tired in the stretch run. ALOIS settled in the second flight, saved ground through the second turn

BLUEBERRY EYES prompted the early pace while saving ground through the second turn, took the lead leaving the turn and was pressured late by
VALDINI but held gamely to prevail. VALDINI was pinched at the start and settled near the rear of the field, gained ground leaving the turn and pressured
BLUEBERRY EYES in the final sixteenth but could not reel her in while clear of the rest. DASHING DEMI settled in the second flight, gained ground while
five wide on the second turn but was outkicked in the stretch drive. UPTOWN RHAPSODY stalked the pace through the second turn, was four wide on the
second turn and weakened in the stretch run. GINGERDOODLE was fanned five wide on the first turn, had no speed through the second turn while three
wide and was empty for the stretch run. MUCHTOMYSURPRISE was away well and set the pace from a ground saving position while being prompted by
the winner, was confronted nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch run. KITTYBE QUICK sat off of the early pace on the first turn, made a
middle move to track the top pair along the backstretch, was four wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. SMILING MELANIE veered at the start
and was away slowly, settled near the rear of the field, saved ground throughout and was not a factor. SILVER AFFAIR was fractious in the gate and
chased the early pacesetters, lost ground on the second turn and faded in the late going.

ALESHA settled off of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, tipped out to the two path in the stretch to close the gap on MISS UNION and was up just in
time to prevail. INTO CLASSIC was unhurried in the early going, mounted a bid while three to four wide on the turn, surged in the stretch and just missed for
the win while holding for the place. MISS UNION was away well and showed good speed from the inside, had a clear lead into the stretch but was caught
inside of the final sixteenth and outfinished by the top two. TIZ A TIGER chased the early pace from the inside and was outkicked in the stretch drive. LIGHT
UP tracked the pace through the turn while two wide and did not offer a late rally. NENE ROMANO was away a step slowly and chased from the rear, saved
ground on the turn and was not a factor. AUTISM PRISM pressed the pace through the turn while two wide and faded in the late going.

CIRCULODEGANADORAS tracked the pace from a ground saving position, chased into the stretch and was outfinished in the late going, while holding for
second. SOJOURNER TRUTH tracked the early pace, was two wide between runners on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch drive. CONCISE
ADVICE settled toward the rear of the field while saving ground and did not offer a late rally. A J ROCK was away well and set quick fractions while saving
ground, led into the final sixteenth but was caught by the winner and tired in the late stages. GOOD TIME DOLLY took up in tight quarters soon after the
start, chased the field from the rear through the turn while five wide and was not a factor.

for the lead leaving the second turn, battled with the winner inside of the final furlong and just relented in the final stages while holding for second. ON

slow away from the gate and settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch. SENSEMAKER
chased the early pace then dropped back to settle near the rear of the field, mounted a bid while six wide on the second turn but did not have a late rally in

WINE AND WHISKY was four wide on the first turn, settled off of the early pace, continued to have a wide trip while going four to five wide on the second
turn and was outkicked in the stretch run. HARMON stalked the early pace, gained ground while three wide on the second turn but flattened out in the

Footnotes
TONI TWO POCKET was away quickly and set fast fractions from a ground saving position, extended the lead leaving the turn, was pressured in the final
sixteenth by VRONILLA PARFAIT and dug in to hold for the win. VRONILLA PARFAIT stalked the pace from a five wide position on the turn, mounted a
bold rally leaving the turn and put the winner under pressure in the late going but could not reel her in and missed for the win while clear of the rest. SING IN
THE WIND settled near the rear of the field, rallied from the three path off of the turn but was outfinished by the top pair. CROWN KITTEN tracked the pace
while three wide and was outkicked in the stretch run. MEET MISS KITTY settled in the midflight while three wide and finished willingly to gain ground in the
stretch run. OYSTER SHOOTER chased the pace through the turn while two wide between foes, was in tight quarters in upper stretch and made a mild late
gain in the closing stages. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was away slowly, trailed through the turn and offered a mild late gain in the stretch. LADY CHROME pressed
the quick pace while two wide and weakened in the stretch drive. PROOF OF JAZZ was forwardly placed through the turn while four wide and gave way in
the stretch run. I LOVE ROMANCE chased the pace through the backstretch, gained ground on the turn while two wide but tired in the late stages. SLEW
OF FASHION chased from the second flight while saving ground, lost position on the turn and was not a factor.
