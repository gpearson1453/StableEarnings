inside, bid to the front on the final turn but was outfinished. QUIET PLEASE dueled along the rail, led before half a mile then weakened. JOYCEE'S SPIRIT

Footnotes
REIGNING FIRE prompted the leader outside, edged clear on the final turn and remained safe while kept to a drive. IZA ONE saved ground early, angled
out, loomed a stretch threat but was second best. JANELLE DREAMS was bothered into the first turn, trailed early and gained late. MOLLY'S GAME set
pressured pace inside for five furlongs and weakened. WEST HORIZEN saved ground, bid closer before half a mile then faltered. SERIOUS HAPPINESS
dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. BROAD STORM steadied between rivals into the first turn, ducked out bothering rival then was no factor.
HOLA PRINCESS urged close up outside briefly then gave way. CREEDIBILITY dropped back outside and faded very wide. The stewards conducted an
inquiry into the trouble on the first turn.

the advantage into the stretch and continued gamely. BUCKS ARE MOVING angled inside in the opening quarter, steadied inside on the turn then faded.
GO HUSKIES dropped back in the two path and just missed for the show. SKY TEMPLE prompted the leaders three wide and was finished by the far turn.

wide and continued willingly. DEFIBRILLATOR angled inside early, bid closer on the turn then flattened out. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL forced the pace outside
and proved empty in the stretch. DON'T RECALL dropped back after the start, raced wide with a slight gain. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) saved ground well
behind and was never a factor. GREEN GROWTH was urged within striking range then faltered. BILL'S MAFIA dropped back early and was always outrun.

KOAN controlled the pace, repelled numerous challenges and edged away under steady handling. RUBY BLEU raced close up three wide throughout and
finished willingly. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD urged just behind winner in the two path, was asked on the final turn but weakened. KID D'ORO saved ground
throughout, moved closer after the half then faded. ATTA KID dropped back wide and was always outrun. AULD LANGE SYNE raced well behind in the two
path and lacked a rally. HOORAY FOR HARVEY was fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide and faded. AHSAD dropped back inside and weakened
steadily.

MUSK well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch and drew off driving. DINNA FASH vied between rivals then inside, dropped back, angled
out and came again for the place. FOX IN THE FOG chased in the two path then inside and offered late energy. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN advanced outside
on the final turn then flattened out. MURRICANE dropped far behind then made up ground without menacing. ITS ABOUT MY TIME broke out at the start,
forced the pace wide and tired. ENANO steadied into the first turn, raced far back and was no factor. GO SKIPPY GO raced far behind throughout.
ALPHA'S CANDY MAN pressed the pace briefly along the rail and stopped abruptly. BIG DADDY BUZZ turned his head at the start and was caught up in
the gate and declared a non starter by the stewards. All wagers on him were refunded.
