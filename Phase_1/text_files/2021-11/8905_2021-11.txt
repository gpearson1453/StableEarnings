Footnotes
DYNABLUE was rated just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the far turn, shifted out to the four path
in upper stretch, moved to wrest the advantage nearing the furlong marker, then went clear under firm encouragement. PINBALLER was urged to the lead
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, met a rival's challenge on the far turn dueling with that one to midstretch and held
grudgingly for the place honors while no match for the winner. RAVE ON tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the far turn, gained some
position three deep into the lane, shifted out to the five path leaving midstretch and continued with a mild bid while earning a share. KINGSBURRY ATTACK
angled to the rail in early stages while dropping off the second flight, saved ground through the far turn, came around a tiring rival racing into upper stretch
gaining some position but flattened out inside foes late. HERO'S DAUGHTER settled outside rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted to the
three path entering the lane and passed between tiring rivals. UNEMBELLISHED tracked just off the first flight racing three deep to the backstretch, steadily
gained position in that path racing to the far turn, moved to press the issue on the far turn to midstretch and flattened out late. ROCKET HOTSHOT proved
no factor. BLAZEN JUSTICE switched out racing into the first turn to prompt the pacesetter in the opening half, lost some ground to the leader entering the
far turn and gave out nearing the lane. J J'S SOLUTION, caught in tight quarters at the start, bolted racing into the first turn, was pulled up with some
assistance from the outrider and walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE briefly disputed the early pace inside BLOOMING GARDEN in the opening furlong, cleared into the first turn, set an uncontested
pace from there, was unperturbed in the two path as BLOOMING GARDEN drew closer past the three eighths, shook the field off into the lane, and held a
clear advantage while being vigorously hand ridden and shown the crop late. EASTON ROCKS settled toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, raced at
the rear of the chasing group down the back straight, chased in the three path outside of LEE LA DEW on the far turn, bid inside of BLOOMING GARDEN
into the lane, brushed with that foe near the three sixteenths, proved no match for CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, but kept on well enough to capture the place
despite drifting out. BLOOMING GARDEN disputed the pace outside of CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE in the opening furlong, settled back to track the pace into
the first turn, chased the leader down the back straight and into the far turn, bid on him in the four path past the three eighths, proved no match from upper
stretch despite going to a drive, brushed with EASTON ROCKS near the three sixteenths, and was outfinished for place between horses while drifting out.
LEE LA DEW tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, raced well behind the leading pair down the back straight, raced in the two path with the
chasing group around the far turn, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, made gradual improvement but did not have enough to get the show. DOM
CAETANO (ARG) trailed through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, began to make mild improvement in the five to six path on the far turn,
came six wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick to prove a threat. B'S TURNING POINT chased midpack, was relegated toward the rear into the far
turn, raced in the three path around that bend, was driven four wide in upper stretch and came up empty. ROCKET RIDE settled near the rear, trailed in the
three path on the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, and offered no response.

Footnotes
AMENDED was rated between rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted through close quarters to advance three deep
between rivals on the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch to challenge for command and went clear under pressure. POWER THROUGH,
urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, edged forward racing into the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch while being
roused to repel challengers midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while prevailing for the place honors. HARD NIGHT, reserved off the second flight a
bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the far turn, tipped out entering upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to
gain position to the end. JUNIOR BUG tracked just off the first flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside
foes racing into the far turn, tipped outside the pacesetter to bid between foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. TELLER tracked the leaders
three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position four wide racing into the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch.
LOCASH reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the far turn, passed between tiring rivals in the drive. RETAIN, caught in tight quarters at the start,
was reserved along the inside racing in the last flight, saved ground throughout but offered no rally. CONI'S COUP, urged between foes prompting the pace
racing to the backstretch, was eased off the leaders to track between foes racing into the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. STAR OF STARS
tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, gained some position saving ground on the far turn to upper stretch but came up empty late. MAC
PANDOWDY, urged to terms with the first flight three wide pressing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, gave way between foes leaving the midway
point of the far turn.

Footnotes
STOPSHOPPINGAMY raced at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, was driven for a bid
outside the leader into the stretch, dueled outside of BAILESTON LASSIE from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth mark, and edged to the lead late.
BAILESTON LASSIE was sent clear, set the pace down the back straight and in the two path around the bend, was engaged by STOPSHOPPINGAMY to
her outside into the lane, dueled inside of that foe from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth mark, and could not hold her at bay late. DRINKS ON ME
settled at the rear, was pushed along approaching the half mile mark, took closer order in the five path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, angled
inward in upper stretch and was driven between horses, and offered a mild rally. HONEY MUG broke outward and grazed the gate, settled at the rear of the
chasing group, chased near the rear in the three path on the turn, was driven for a bid behind the leading pair into the lane, drifted out slightly in upper
stretch, proved no match for the leading pair, chased on to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. ORDAINED KISS chased three wide down the
backstretch, continued in the five path in the chasing flight around the turn, came six wide into upper stretch, and chased on evenly under a drive. LADY
ATLANTIC chased between horses down the back straight, raced outside of STOPSHOPPINGAMY in the tracking flight in the four path on the turn, floated

Footnotes
TODDLES broke readily, angled inwards sharply carrying in COWBOYS FEATHER while also impeding MOON FLASH and IRISH TUFF, was urged
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage just off the rail racing into the turn, edged away to a clear advantage in upper stretch and maintained a safe
advantage to the end under firm left handed pressure. TOM'S LAST GENERAL broke outwards brushing the eventual winner at the start, tracked off the
leaders four wide on the backstretch, continued with a steady, three wide gain through the turn to the stretch and moved to close the gap on the winner in
that path late. COWBOYS FEATHER, carried inwards by the eventual winner just after the start, pulled his way along the rail prompting the pacesetter in the
opening quarter, ceded some position to that foe racing into the bend, raced in close quarters to midstretch, then tipped out in the closing stages to gain
position between foes while earning a share. IRISH TUFF, forced inwards just after the start, then steadied out of tight quarters along the rail in the opening
stages, switched out in the second furlong while being prompted to a forward placing, lodged a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out
in the drive. COCO BRAVADO off last, switched off the inside avoiding some traffic tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued evenly. FINAL CALL, held up outside foes avoiding some traffic early, raced five wide into the lane and offered no
rally. MOON FLASH, washy in the post parade, brushed the gate at the break, was caught in tight quarters just after the start while being forced to alter
course outside foes and soon dropped out.

from the seven sixteenths, vied from the five sixteenths into upper stretch, edged clear in upper stretch, and drew off late while ridden out. VEGAN GOES
BEST chased well off the rail inside of FEARLESS ANNA early, chased midfield in the two to three path on the turn, swung five wide for the drive, and
stayed on late to prove best of the rest. FIRST SQUADRON stumbled at the start, was sent for pace nonetheless, took the lead at the nine sixteenths, was
engaged by TRIPLE SCOUT to her outside past the seven sixteenths, vied inside that foe from the five sixteenths into upper stretch, proved no match from
there, chased on but was outfinished in the final sixteenth for the place. APOLLO U ANYWHERE led in the opening furlong, tracked FIRST SQUADRON
past the nine sixteenths, continued to track the pace while saving ground on the turn, had aim when driven inside into the lane, proved no match for the
leading pair, and was outfinished for the show. GO STORMIN GIRL tracked the leading pair early, settled back into the turn to chase the leading trio in the
three to four path, was driven four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the leading trio and flattened late. DEAUVILLE MIST raced two wide in the
rear pair early, chased near the rear in the three path on the turn, shifted out seven wide in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses late under a drive.
SUPERSTAR DIVA settled toward the rear, chased in the five path on the turn, was driven inside foes in the lane and lacked the needed late kick inside.

Footnotes
SAMURAI CAUSE dropped just out of striking distance in the opening stages, came under some prompting while angling to the rail racing into the turn,
saved ground to midstretch, shifted outside the pacesetter making light contact with TAP'S BIG SHOT in the final stages, then edged forward in time to
narrowly prevail between foes under firm hand urging and left handed pressure. COLONEL KLINK was settled into stride racing off the rail dropping well off
the leaders racing to the turn, shifted out racing through upper stretch to advance four wide and found his best stride late to challenge for command nearing
the wire while being just outkicked by the winner. STORMINSIDE sped clear along the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
stretch, drifted about under pressure leaving the furlong marker then drifted out under left handed pressure nearing the wire while just failing to maintain his
momentum. TAP'S BIG SHOT, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, advanced in that path nearing midstretch but
lacked the needed final kick while being brushed by the winner approaching the wire. MIAS MOONBEAM settled last while shifting off the inside racing
through the backstretch, angled out five wide racing through upper stretch but had no closing bid. CONTRACTION was urged through the backstretch
prompting the pacesetter into the turn, continued in pursuit of that foe to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ONE PUTT RICHIE raced four wide at the outside of the leading flight early, settled two wide in the tracking flight past the nine sixteenths as SEEK N
JUSTICE took the lead, improved to prompt outside that foe into the turn, engaged him in earnest approaching the quarter, vied outside him in upper
stretch, took over at the three sixteenths and drew off under a mild drive. MARCO'S DREAM raced at the inside of the leading flight early, settled back to the
inside of the tracking flight past the nine sixteenths as SEEK N JUSTICE seized the lead, settled back further to chase inside around the turn, was driven
inside in upper stretch, improved between horses in the final furlong and got up in the final sixteenth for the place. GIVIN UP NONE chased the leading line
outside of MORRISTON early, came in on WILLOW RIDGE just past the half mile mark, tracked the leading pair in the two to three path around the bend,
came three wide into upper stretch, chased while no match for ONE PUTT RICHIE, and was outfinished for the place. SEEK N JUSTICE raced three wide
between horses with the leading flight early, shook to the lead near the nine sixteenths, led inside around the turn while prompted by ONE PUTT RICHIE,
was engaged by that foe to his outside approaching the quarter, vied inside him while under a drive in upper stretch, proved no match from the three
sixteenths, chased inside to the sixteenth and emptied out late. PACHI settled at the rear outside of NOT AGAIN JACKIE early, bid outside foes into the
turn, chased in the four path around the bend, came five wide into upper stretch, and lacked the necessary late kick. MORRISTON chased the leading line
inside of GIVIN UP NONE early, settled back toward the rear approaching the half, made a mild bid when driven in the two to three path past the three
eighths, and emptied out in the lane. NOT AGAIN JACKIE settled at the rear, raced with the rear group in the four path on the turn, came four wide into the
lane and mustered no bid. WILLOW RIDGE was anxious in the gate, raced between horses in the leading flight early, tracked the pace as SEEK N
JUSTICE asserted himself on the lead near the nine sixteenths, began to settle back into the chasing flight near the half, took back just past the half when
bumped by GIVIN UP NONE, weakened in the three path on the turn and had no more in the lane.
