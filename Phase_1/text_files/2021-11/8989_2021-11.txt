HARPER'S GEM drifted in and bumped rival early on, chased duo off the rail on the backstretch, eased to the rail entering the turn, saved ground into the
stretch, found a sliver of room along the inside and responded gamely to get up in final strides. WHATWASITHINKING broke thru the gate after CONEJOS
broke thru, bumped early by NEAH BAY, dueled two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and into the stretch, battled gamely in the
stretch and nailed by inside closing rival in a game effort. NEAH BAY lugged out and bumped rival exiting the chute, dueled for lead on the inside on the
backstretch, continued to duel along the inside on the turn, entered stretch in range, battled through the stretch until wilting late. DEBT MONGER bumped
early by HARPER'S GEM, put in tight and shuffled passing the seven sixteenths, tracked leaders three wide, entered stretch, four wide, and launched a
belated rally to miss second. CONEJOS broke thru gate prior to the start, stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch
very wide and failed to improve. TAPITHA BONITA stalked pace along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, and failed to make any headway in
the stretch.
