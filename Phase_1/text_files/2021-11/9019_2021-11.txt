ABBIE'S WAY was void of any early speed, angled out seven wide through the turn, was gaining late and was up in time. DOUBLE STORM pressed the
early pace, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead, couldn't hold and finished second best. MINNIE ME HA was allowed to settle early, raced along
the inside, angled out and finished belatedly. ADORABLE BRITTANY set a three wide pressured early pace and weakened late. ZENMAGIC was unhurried
early, made a six wide move into the turn and was empty late.

Footnotes
BIG MAC DADDY settled outside mid-pack, went five wide on the turn, put to a drive by the top of the stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out driving past
and held safe. SIGALERT was off slowly, spotting the field about three to four lengths, shifted in and moved up heading into the turn, went two to three wide
on that bend, came out seeking room but finding none about the three-sixteenths then was in tight again past the furlong marker, ran on well to get the
place. OFFENSIVE just off the leaders, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, came out widest of all roughly ten deep in upper stretch and gained
belatedly. PHOENIX FIRE was not quickest away, steadily moved up heading into the turn, bid inside in upper stretch taking a brief and narrow lead but
lacked the needed late kick. ONE STEP AWAY chased the pace from outside a rival, went three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch.
COURAGE N ORDER tracked in behind the pace racing off the inside, went three wide on the turn, steadied in tight quarters past the eighth pole and was
empty thereafter. VROYSKY set the pace from off the rail going two wide on the turn, drifted out through upper stretch, faltered and faded. RACE

Footnotes
BRANDISTYLED stalked from outside, encouraged along five to six wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch while starting to drift out, was quickly
clear and straightened out then held safe. HEMATITE settled in the back half of the field, took slightly closer order four then five wide on the turn, was
carried out in upper stretch before altering in then ran on well. FI FI D'ORO set the early pace inside rivals, lost ground into the turn and came off the inside
passing the quarter pole, moved out wider still into upper stretch, kept on to regain position. POW WOW came out at the break, was mildly coaxed forward
to race up close, went three to four wide on the turn and weakened. SHELL GAME contended from between runners two to three wide, weakened. HIGH
ON LIFE broke a step slowly, raced outside three to four wide on the turn, swung out eight deep turning for home and passed tired rivals without
threatening. MS TAKE HEED broke a step slowly, was ridden along up the backstretch but lacking speed, went two to three wide on the turn and was never
a threat. WONTONTOMATO was urged at the break chasing inside, came out to go two to three wide on the turn then further still turning for home, failed to
rally. MARILYN MONEYROLL vied for the lead four to five wide, came up empty. PER RULING #2022-SUN-17 FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING
COMMISSION, HEMATITE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

hold on gamely. GIVE EM HECK BECK switched out heading up the backstretch, edged closer to pursue the leader three to four wide on the turn, fought on
gamely in the stretch but couldn't get by while second best. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP stalked, went four to five wide on the turn, kept on evenly. FEEL THE
BERNING tracked in behind early three wide into the turn, moved out six wide on that bend, ran on evenly. BARBARA'S CHAMP was floated from four to
seven wide on the turn, moved in once in upper stretch and weakened. THE HUNK NEXT DOOR reared at the start spotting the field several lengths,
moved up keenly while shifting in, tracked two to three wide on the turn and was empty for the drive. POSTMANFOURTYEIGHT was held up at the rear

Footnotes
SEVEN ROONEY tracked in behind the leaders three wide heading into the turn, moved out seven deep coming past the quarter pole, struck the lead in
upper stretch while veering in sharply, drew clear in the late stages. PALICE REVENGE settled off the leaders, steadily advanced through the turn into
upper stretch while saving ground, bid nearing the furlong grounds but was outkicked. SANDIA'S BEST stalked the leading pair, went two to three wide on
the turn, needed more. SMOKEN HOUDINI settled mid-pack, advanced five to six wide on the turn, was carried in and had to steady near the furlong
marker. SIXTH GEAR lacked early speed content to race well back, picked it up along the inside on the turn, came out in upper stretch and improved
position. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER was outside a rival up the backstretch in pursuit of the leading pair, went four to five wide on the turn, steadied outside
the eighth pole as rivals came in. ABETEMARCO dueled inside a rival but off the rail, came up empty. BE COOL IF YA DID dueled outside three wide,
faded. TANDES was a bit hard to load and loaded riderless, asked for run early but lacked speed, failed to threaten while racing off the rail. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH SEVEN ROONEY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND SMOKEN HOUDINI
FOR INTERFERENCE.
