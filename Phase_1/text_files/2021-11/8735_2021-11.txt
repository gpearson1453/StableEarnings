a convincing victory. LUCKY MARY tracked winner along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, proved no match for runaway
winner but finished well to be a well clear second. SPEEDY LOU C tracked leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued in between approaching
the turn, had to check out of a tight spot, entered turn three wide, re-bid along the inside entering the stretch to get up for third. RIVER RUNS NORTH
tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch widest in the lane and bested rest under steady urging. MY LITTLE
FANNY chased two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, in range entering the stretch and gave way in upper stretch. CIRCLE OF
