Footnotes
VALLEJO vied for the early advantage, challenged throughout and drove clear before the wire. LIGHT AS A WHISPER dueled on the front end, saved
ground around the turn, drove clear, but couldn't match strides with the winner late. ROARING QUINN raced within contention, saved ground around the
turn, was close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. UNTAMED MONEY pressed the pace, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third.
TIZINDY QUEEN stumbled at the break, racing in the rear, made a late inside gain and finished willingly. TAKENFORGRANTED raced near the back in the
beginning, moved up and hung down the stretch. SAYANOTHERPRAYER showed early speed, came around the turn wide and faded. LA LOLA raced near
the middle of the field, dropped back and was no threat late. AMBER PASS raced near the back, pulled up around the turn and was vanned off.

PULPIT pressed the pace, raced three wide around the final turn, weakened and finished evenly. AND YET ANOTHER raced within contention, saved
ground around the final turn, faded and was no threat late. ZION'S CALL void of early speed and was never close. STARVICTORY lacked early speed and

Footnotes
CARBON STRYKER challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane and proved the best late. KING OF THE COURT vied
for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn, dueled and was outfinished for the win, but was a clear second. MCLEAN lacked early speed, came
around the turn wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. YES BAB raced in the back of the field, improved position, but
was no factor. PAPA BRO showed early speed and faded. RUSTY CAGE pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. JAZZ IT UP was an early
factor, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
MACHO MARK void of early speed, moved up between rivals around the final turn, angled out entering the home stretch, made a wide rally and got up in
time. SO BRAVE pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, took the lead down the stretch, but was caught late. SYMBOL AZTECA lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, saved ground around the final turn and was a clear third at the wire. MARVINS GOLD broke in the air, rushed up, took the lead,
drove clear and weakened. MORO PHAROAH raced within striking distance, came around the final turn wide and finished evenly. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY
lacked early speed, came around the second turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. WHEELS TURNING raced in the middle of the field, weakened and
lacked a rally. TED STRIKER challenged for the early lead and was finished early. COLE'S SENSATION dueled on the front end and dropped back. MORO
SAVAGE raced near the back, lost contact with the pack and was never a threat.

Footnotes
DOBBY SUE broke through the gates before the start, quickly went to the front, drove clear and was kept to the task. FASHION MERIT vied for the early
advantage, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for place. THEBOYZTAP pressed the pace, saved ground around the
second turn, made a rail bid and was outfinished for second. STREAMER raced within contention, made a mild bid, finished wide and was no real threat.
GIFTED TALENT lacked early speed, came around the final turn on the inside, angled out, improved position, but was no factor. MAVE RUNNER vied for
the early lead and weakened. EUROROSE raced near the back, came around the first turn six wide, moved up, but was no factor. TRAPPE THE CAT near
back, five wide first turn, raced evenly and showed little. LUCKY HARBORAGE raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back. MADELYN'S MOMENT
void of early speed, pulled up down the final stretch and walked off.

pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, took the advantage, but proved no match late for the winner. HIP FOUR O FOUR raced within
contention, entered the home stretch wide, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. PORQUE SI raced within striking distance, made a late bid
and was outfinished for show. CLEVER PRINCE void of early speed, saved ground around the second turn, made a late gain and finished willingly. PAPA
