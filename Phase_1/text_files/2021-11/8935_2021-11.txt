Footnotes
LIGHTNING FLASH sent clear was measured on pace holding daylight through the far turn kicking clear in upper stretch holding firm to wire. DYNAFORM
stalked the pace saving ground to upper stretch proving no match for the winner finishing a clear second best along the rail. PONT DU GARD stalked the
pace beginning to waver on the far turn weakening in upper stretch needing all to hold position late. NOBODY MOVE gave a prompted middle move
looming through the far turn before flattening out in upper stretch. ONEWAYTICKET dropped off on the backside racing evenly after. WHITE GLADIATOR
was always outrun. BALK was never involved.
