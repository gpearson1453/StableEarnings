LONG GONE OKIE tracked the pace through early stages, moved up to race in aim for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled outside of GRAYGIRLGO
through the stretch run, gained a slight edge and held firm. GRAYGIRLGO held a slim lead out of the gate then came under pressure from RIVER LIBERTY
heading into the first turn, vied inside of rival through the backstretch, took on the challenge of the eventual winner mid-way around the far turn, fought back
gamely from the inside through the lane but had no closing kick left in reserve. SURE SHOT SHELLY tucked inside through the first turn and tracked the
early pace, saved ground around the far turn, tipped three wide at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid for the top pair and finished well clear over
the rest. THE ONE FOR FUN raced four wide into the first turn then remained unhurried, came under pressure along the outside leaving the far turn and
failed to menace. RIVER LIBERTY vied outside of GRAYGIRLGO through the backstretch then gave way midway around the far turn. SATURDAY
SERVICE settled inside early on, was ridden along three wide into the lane and had no response. PEARLY hopped in the air and veered out at the start, lost
the rider and walked off after the race. STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START WHICH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL was not far back in the early going, loomed closer along the far outside late on the turn, bid four deep top of the lane, quickly
cleared on top, stayed sharp under steady encouragement and finished going away. SWIFT TAP tracked the early pace, launched a three wide bid near the
quarter pole, sustained a steady bid three deep through the lane and finished second best. PINKY RING BLING drifted inward at the start while a away a bit
slowly then quickly advanced into closer contention, roused along the rail around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and held show. SHADOWLESS
was forwardly placed in early stages then moved up leaving the backstretch, held a slim lead through the turn, got collared by eventual winner at the head of
the lane then weakened between. CLIMB AND MAINTAIN lacked speed, came four wide into the lane and had no response. SAINT CHARLES cleared and
crossed over shortly after the start, got collared leaving the backstretch, retreated and eased up in the lane.

HALEY'S STEELMAN was away quickly and dueled outside of THREE TIME CHARMER for the early lead, battled on through the turn, shook free in the
upper stretch, widened advantage under steady pressure and finished clear. RAMAAH was reserved racing in the last flight, shifted out wide at the head of
the lane, rallied along the outside and gained place. SPORTY FLYER got bumped and shuffled back at the start, was reserved in or near the back, swung
wide into the lane, rallied along the far outside and gained show. BEGGAR chased inside through the turn, sustained a two wide bid through the lane but
needed more for late impact. MY TRUE REWARD chased the top pair through the turn, stayed on three wide past the furlong marker then weakened late.
THREE TIME CHARMER vied inside of the winner in opening stages, battled on around the turn then faded in the lane. CANDY BARON steadied inside not
long after the start, angled out three wide, chased into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FAMILIAR DREAM was ridden along off the early pace, came five
wide into the lane and never threatened. FROSTED PRAYER raced in range through the turn then came up empty. PERFECTOMUNDO raced near

Footnotes
SWEET BAKER rated through early stages then steadily edged up closer through the turn, given cue four wide entering the lane, cleared on top at the
furlong marker and held on over closing runner up. OSWALD COBBLEPOT waited for racing room along the rail around the turn, continued without a clear
path in the upper stretch, angled three wide near the eighth pole, launched a bid and close willingly. OKLAHOMA HEAT bumped with rival at the start,
dueled inside of YOU SEXY BOY through early stages, could not match strides with the winner near the furlong marker but stayed on and secured show.
LITTLE RED OKIE lacked early pace, hustles up along the outside into the lane and gained position. CRAZY LOVER raced up close three wide through the
turn then gave way in the lane. SOME DUDE got bumped at the start, raced off the pace and had a mild improve. YOU SEXY BOY dueled outside of
OKLAHOMA HEAT in opening stages, battled back through the turn then faded in the final furlong. OSIYO raced off the early pace, came three wide into the
lane and failed to move on. STEELY CAPER raced near midpack through early stages then gave way. BRICKTOWN BROWN raced near mid-range
through early stages, came four wide into the lane and had no late response. GREY ACTION saved ground and never threatened. KWONTRO steadily
weakened after a half. TIZ STRONG had no response, dropped far back and jogged in.
