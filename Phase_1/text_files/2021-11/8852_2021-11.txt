Footnotes
MICHELLE WHO was up close early, raced off the rail into the turn, dueled with ZIVA DA'VID to late stretch and prevailed. ZIVA DA'VID pressed the early
pace, went five wide into the turn, dueled with the winner and finished second best. GEE ETTA stalked the early pace from the inside and faded. HEMATITE
was not far back early, raced between rivals and tired. SWEET REGARDS set a seven wide pressured early pace and faded. SANDPLUM CREEK was
outrun early, raced six wide and offered no late rally. HIGH ON LIFE was unhurried early, went three wide and never fired. CANDY CARMA was taken back
and was no factor. TEXANA was void of speed, was eased and vanned off.
