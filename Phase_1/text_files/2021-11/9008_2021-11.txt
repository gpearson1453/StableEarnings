Footnotes
DILLY DILLY PHILLY vied three wide early, then dueled inside of LE PETITE PAPILLON on the turn, shook free from that rival nearing the furlong marker
and drew clear under urging. LE PETITE PAPILLON stalked in the early stages, bid three wide entering the turn, dueled two wide on the turn and came up
second best. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, rallied mildly and then finished evenly for third. BOCA ROYALTY raced off
the pace, moved up three wide on the turn and lacked a stretch rally. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER was off slowly and steadied, raced off the pace, came three
wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SNOW FORECAST vied inside for the early lead, then chased and tired. SIZZLING ROMA was fractious in the
gate, raced off the pace, off the rail and did not factor. UNO TIGRESS vied between rivals early, then chased and gave way.

Footnotes
SHIRLEY GREENE stalked the pace, took over when ready at the five sixteenths pole, repelled a challenge and drew away. ARTIE'S ROSE settled outside
the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn but no match for the winner. LIAM'S LADY reserved close up inside, moved wide in the stretch and flattened out.
SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD alternated for the advantage inside then was finished by the quarter pole. MISQUILLO raced far behind in the two path and was
never in contention. OUI MADAME lagged far back inside and was always outrun. LA ALTENITA saved ground off the leaders and gave way readily.

Footnotes
CUNEO quickly took control inside, was collared in the stretch but held on very gamely through the final furlong. SHARP RED EAGLE made a menacing
wide bid on the turn, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. BOARD CERTIFIED prompted the pace outside to the stretch and came up
empty. JASONTAKESLONG broke a step slowly, rushed to contention inside then faded. CLEAR CUT was urged close up between rivals to midway on the
turn and faded. RAGING TEMPEST was eased back into the far turn then lacked any further response. MERGING TRAFFIC raced very wide and trailed
throughout. PER RULING #22114PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA HORSE RACING COMMISSION CLEAR CUT WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

D' RAPPER settled off the pace, swung wide into the stretch and eagerly pulled away under moderate urging. NOBLE COMMANDER vied along the inside,
drifted in through the final furlong and continued willingly. BRILLIANT CHASE saved ground throughout, was placed in tight through the final sixteenth while
steadying along. ARRECIFE lagged far behind inside, remained on the rail and closed well. APPEALING FUTURE settled off the pace outside, remained
wide and finished willingly. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF dueled three wide for half a mile and faltered. DRENA'S BULLET stumbled at the start and raced far
behind then was no factor. JOHNNY RITT prompted the pace between rivals to the stretch and gave way. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by
the rider of the third finisher against the runner-up for interference in the stretch, NOBLE COMMANDER was disqualified and placed third.
