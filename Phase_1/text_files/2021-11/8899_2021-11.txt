Footnotes
SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT took bumps between horses at the start, tugged in the bit between horses into the first turn to stalk from the two path and just
behind the leading pair, settled into stride into the backstretch, bumped an outer MY DADDY'S TRAINER at the half mile pole when shifting outside of the
leading pair, ranged up to them into the far turn, vied before forging an advantage approaching the quarter pole, and drove clear in midstretch, then was
found to have bled. SODDY DAISY vied inside of MOON OVER TUSCANY, then inside of SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT as well around the far turn, but failed to
keep pace with those foes entering the lane, regained stride in upper stretch, then split rivals two wide passing the furlong grounds to prevail for place.
ALITTLESLICEOF PIE cropped a step while brushing an inner foe at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, improved down the backstretch to chase the
leading trio around the far turn, shifted outside of them entering the lane while inching closer, but lacked a punch to make a bid, flattened out, and got
outfinished by an inner foe for place. MOON OVER TUSCANY vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but was headed by
her outer counterpart entering the lane, and gave way between horses at the furlong grounds. MY DADDY'S TRAINER bumped an outer foe at the start,
pressed the pace three wide, but was bumped by an inner foe at the half mile pole, and faded. KASS' CHOICE laid at the rear of the field along the inside,
and never got involved. PINKABOO raced off of the pace four wide around the first turn, inched closer down the backstretch, but faltered approaching the
half mile pole, weakened, and was eased through the lane. THE RIDER OF MY DADDY'S TRAINER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SOCIAL
ENGAGEMENT FOR INTERFERENCE INTO THE FAR TURN, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
KAVOD stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of the dueling pair at five sixteenths pole as RUMBLE STRIP RON ranged up alongside, but drove clear
of those foes at the three sixteenths pole, and inched further away through the final furlong. RUMBLE STRIP RON tracked four wide, ranged up outside of
the leading trio turning for home, drifted five wide entering the lane, failed to keep pace with an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, drifted outwardly in
midstretch while dueling for place with SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY through the final furlong, and prevailed for that position via a head bob.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY laid off of the pace in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane with an aim to bid between KAVOD and
RUMBLE STRIP RON in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with the former at the three sixteenths pole before bidding for place inside of latter in
midstretch, dueled through the final furlong, forged a very narrow advantage in the final sixteenth, but got outfinished. SILENT POWER broke slowly, trailed
the field in the three path around the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and improved. CHISMOSO dueled for the lead two wide, vied between horses
turning for home, but gave way to outer foes in upper stretch. SUBURBAN COURT dueled for the lead along the inside, met a pair of bidders turning for
home, then weakened entering the lane.

BRAZIL NUT hopped at the start and trailed the field early on, improved down the backstretch, continued to gain along the inside into the far turn, shifted
four wide turning for home, then sustained his long rally through the lane to produce a late bid, and just got up on the wire. CACHIRULO bumped with an
outer rival at the start, vied two wide around the first turn before moving clear into the backstretch, showed the way from a chasing MIDNIGHT JJ around the
far turn, shrugged off that foe's bid entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong, drifted a path outwardly inside the final sixteenth
as BRAZIL NUT menaced, and got nailed on the wire. ELI settled off of the pace two wide, shifted three wide entering the lane, chased the clear leader
while grinding away through the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer foe for place at the sixteenth pole, then finished up under restraint after the
leader drifted into his path. MIDNIGHT J J hopped at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside around the first turn, shifted three wide down the
backstretch, chased a clear CACHIRULO around the far turn before inching closer turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, and faded.
DAHTESTES HERO saved ground off of the pace, chased from the rail around the far turn, aimed to split foes three wide in upper stretch but was outkicked
by an outer foe as his hole closed, then failed to slip inside of a tiring MIDNIGHT JJ at the furlong grounds, and lacked a bid thereafter. GLASSATO vied
along the inside before allowing his outer counterpart to clear into the backstretch, stalked that foe from the outside, but came under urging to keep pace at
the half mile pole, and weakened into the turn. SPEIGHTY SENSE tracked three wide around the first turn, but steadily faded thereafter. MATH MAN
bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid far off of the pace three to four wide, and never got involved. RITHMICALLEA pressed the pace three wide around
the first turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the backstretch, and was done early. THE RIDER OF ELI CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF CACHIRULO FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MONEY MIKE set the pace outside of MY MIRACLE MAN early on, cleared that foe at the half mile pole, showed the way along the inside around the turn,
met the aforementioned rival's and LAVENDER EARL's bid entering the lane, but swiftly repelled those foes in upper stretch, shifted outwardly while
clearing, and drew off under driving pressure. LAVENDER EARL stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair into the turn, ranged up to bid
entering the lane, but was repelled by the leader in upper stretch, battled outside of MY MIRACLE MAN for place through midstretch, but edged away from
that foe at the sixteenth pole. MY MIRACLE MAN pressed MONEY MIKE from the inside early on, allowed that foe to clear at the half mile pole, tipped
outside of that foe into the turn as LAVENDER EARL ranged up, re-bid for the lead along with that foe approaching the quarter pole but failed to keep pace
with the leader in upper stretch, then gave way to his outer counterpart for place a sixteenth out. HOLIDAY TICKET saved ground far off of the pace, shifted
four wide in midstretch, and moved up late. SCARY LARRY saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. HURRY ON OUT tracked from midpack three wide
around the turn, but tired through the lane. MAKE MY OWN LUCK broke a step slow and failed to recover in tight quarters between horses at the start,
settled off of the pace two wide, moved between horses into the turn, but faded through the lane. JOYRIDE broke a step slowly at the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
LI'L TOOTSIE comfortably trailed the short field behind fast fractions, shifted four wide and swept past rivals turning for home to bid for the lead outside of
AINT NO ELMERS, forged an advantage while getting brushed by that foe in upper stretch, and drew off through the final furlong under vigorous hand
urging. AIN'T NO ELMERS vied for the lead two wide early on, dueled into the turn while going a quick tempo, disposed of her inner counterpart while in
hand at the five sixteenths pole, but met LI'l TOOTSIE's blitz entering the lane, shifted outwards and brushed that foe in upper stretch while getting headed,
then proved no match at the furlong grounds, and was remained well clear of show. SHESOMAJESTIC stalked the dueling leaders from the two path into
the turn, but was outmoved outer foes turning for home, trailed the field entering the lane, then improved between horses in the final sixteenth for a minor
placing. PALACE AVENGER dueled for the lead inside of AIN'T NO ELMERS into the turn, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole. HEADLAND stalked
three wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe entering the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
STANLEY MARKET stalked three wide, bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds before inching clear, and held well from an inner foe late.
ALLOCATE tracked from off of the pace three wide, rallied in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, lugged inwards in midstretch before intently
shifting inside of REID'S FANGIRL at the sixteenth pole, attempted an inside bid approaching the wire, but did not have enough. REID'S FANGIRL vied for
the lead two wide, then from between horses in upper stretch before getting outkicked by her outer counterpart passing the three sixteenths pole, fought on
thereafter, but lost place to an inner bidding rival in the closing stages. PURRFECT MISTRESS chased along the inside, came into the lane in the three
path, and stayed on evenly. COST A FORTUNE set the pace inside of a pressing REID'S FANGIRL, then inside of a bidding STANLEY MARKET in upper
stretch, but gave way to those rivals approaching the furlong pole. LA NEBLINA broke a step slowly and bumped an inner foe at the start, settled at at the
rear along the inside, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, and moved up. PAPPYSAYSYES was unhurried in the two path far off of the pace into the
turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and improved. TETHERED took the turn in the three to five paths while far off of the pace, and failed to factor.
LIL' BIT OF CHROME trailed the field four wide around the turn, drifted to the eight path entering the lane, and failed to factor. RISATA saved ground in
midpack around the turn, but to no avail. SCINTILLATING STAR tracked from midpack two wide around the turn, but faded turning for home. MARESIAS
broke slowly while bumping an outer foe at the start, rushed to a stalking position, chased around the turn, but was eased up turning for home, jogged
before being pulled in the final furlong, then was vanned off.

Footnotes
LA CRETE broke sharply, set the pace outside of a hard pressing LATE NIGHT LADY into the first turn, cleared that foe at the seven furlong pole, managed
a loose advantage down the backstretch, widened her margin from a chasing LATE NIGHT LADY at the five sixteenths pole, drew off under mild hand
urging through upper stretch, and was geared down through the final sixteenth while holding safely. OPENING NIGHT switched outside of a faster breaking
outer rival at the start, settled far off of the pace two wide, trailed the field three wide around the far turn while patiently withholding run, tipped five wide
turning for home while commencing a rally, advanced outside of rivals through upper stretch to claim place at the furlong pole, then was gaining on the
well-traveling leader through the late stages, but was only second best. LATE NIGHT LADY was sent under strong urging early on to vie for the lead inside
of LA CRETE into the first turn, rated back to stalk at the seven furlong pole, shifted outside of that rival into the backstretch, but chased that foe around the
far turn before losing ground turning for home, proved no match before losing place at the furlong pole, and held show. DUNVEGAN DOLL broke a beat
slowly at the start, tucked to the rail at the rear of the field into the first turn, saved ground before shifting two wide entering the lane, and stayed on between
horses for a minor share. LEGERITY took a staggered step at the start, laid at the rear of the field in the five to three path around the first turn, gained mildly
four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the quarter pole, and flattened out. FROSTED DIAMOND saved ground in midpack, but to
no avail. MY SWEETNESS tracked two to three wide, but faltered entering the lane. PLEASE BE KIND broke a step slowly, sat at the rear of the field in the
three to two path, and got outrun.

Footnotes
CENTER AISLE cleared off early on, set an unpressured pace in the two path around the turn, drifted to the four path at the quarter pole while meeting
MISS MOSAIC's bid, but swiftly repulsed that foe in upper stretch, drew off under her own power, and won with much more to give. MISS MOSAIC tracked
three wide from the four path around the turn, inched closer to the clear leader turning for home, bid while getting floated to the five path entering the lane,
but failed to match strides with the leader in upper stretch, battled outside of SUN PATH through the lane for place, and prevailed. SUN PATH stalked along
the inside, but lacked a kick through a wide rail opening in upper stretch after the leader drifted outwardly, then chased that foe home. COMPELLING SMILE
trailed early on, took the turn four wide while off of the pace, and stayed on mildly. FARSIGHTED was reluctant to load, stalked two wide from the three path
around the turn, chased between horses turning for home, but faded at the quarter pole. RECODED saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SLAM
DUNK raced off of the pace two wide and between horses into the turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
TULANE TRYST settled far off of the pace four wide, rallied turning for home while tipping five wide, then sustained his charge outside of foes to drive past
the clear leader at the sixteenth pole, and drew off. COOL QUEST set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pressing PIRATE RICK around the
bend, shook clear of that foe at the quarter pole, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong, but was reeled in by an outer oncharging foe at the
sixteenth pole, and held show. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE tracked the pace five to four wide around the turn, ranged up to bid for place in upper stretch,
grinded away on the clear leader's advantage in midstretch, but was outkicked passing the furlong grounds, kept on thereafter, but failed to reach the early
pace setter for place. READY TO ANSWER tracked from midpack from the two path around the turn, shifted to the four to five path in upper stretch, and
stayed on to improve late for a minor share. GULFSTREAM WAY tracked four wide early on, chased the leaders from the three path around the turn, but
lacked a foe splitting rally in midstretch, drifted outwardly in the final furlong, and kept on thereafter. HERE MI SONG broke slowly, saved ground far off of
the pace, gained inside of foes in upper stretch, shifted outwardly while searching for racing room inside the final furlong, aimed to split GULFSTREAM WAY
and READY TO ANSWER in the late stages, but failed to achieve positioning between those rivals before the door closed. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE
brushed the gate at the start, trailed the field, came into the lane in the four path, and failed to factor. PIRATE RICK rushed inside of foes after a bit of a flat
footed break, but steadied when COOL QUEST cleared and crossed across her path, shifted outside of that foe shortly after, pressed him around the turn,
but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole, and weakened. KING'S MISCHIEF chased three wide, tucked into the turn, but tired through the lane while
drifting outwardly. NAME REJECTED laid off of the pace along the inside, and was done early. THE RIDER OF HERE MI SONG CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDERS OF READY TO ANSWER AND GULFSTREAM WAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY
THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
OBLIGATORY settled off of the fast pace early on, tracked the quick moving leaders from the five path around the turn, rallied through upper stretch to bid
for the lead outside of foes at the furlong pole, and swiftly kicked clear thereafter under very light encouragement. MATERA stalked two wide early on, then
three wide around the turn in pursuit of a bidding MISS BIGLY, ranged up to that foe entering the lane, sustained a grinding bid through upper stretch, but
was outkicked at the furlong grounds by an outer surging foe, and reached place a sixteenth out. MISS BIGLY stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of
PRINCESS CAUSEWAY at the three furlong pole, showed the way turning for home after that one faltered, dug in to meet MATERA's bid entering the lane,
fended that rival off through upper stretch, but proved no match for a wider bidding foe passing the furlong pole, then succumbed to her outer counterpart for
place at the sixteenth pole. PASS THE PLATE settled far off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane in the four path, and improved. SALLY'S
CURLIN laid far off of the pace two wide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. SHE CAN'T SING stalked the clear leader along the
inside, moved inside of the runoff leader as that foe came back to the back at the half mile pole, but failed to secure inside positioning, faltered while getting
shuffled back behind that tiring rival passing the three furlong pole, shifted two wide turning for home, but lacked a rebid. PRINCESS CAUSEWAY broke
outwardly, rushed clear down the chute while fighting restraint, settled in the two path down the backstretch as foes inched closer, got headed while shifting
to the rail at the three furlong pole, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
DAME JOVIALE tracked four wide, loomed outside of the leaders entering the lane, led in upper stretch, drove clear, and held sway. AL QAHIRA was
bounced around between horses at the start, advanced to a three wide tracking position into the turn tipped five wide in upper stretch after DAME JOVIALE
made first turn, then chased that foe home and proved second best. TAKE A STAND bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked two wide, cut the corner
entering the lane, but was blocked behind rivals through upper stretch and into the final furlong, then split foes two wide at the sixteenth pole for a minor
reward. RUN THE TAP was jostled between horses at the start, laid far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper
stretch, and moved up in the late stages. LISCOLVIN set the pace, met a pair of bids at the five sixteenths pole, but proved no match for another bidding foe
in upper stretch, then lost show late. CAMARADERIE stalked three wide, bid turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch. FABULOUS FANNY
broke outwardly and hindered a pair of foes at the start, pressed the pace two wide and from between horses, chased among those rivals while being
out-bidded turning for home, then faded in midstretch. RHUBARB MARTINI chased along the inside, but faded turning for home. GLACKEN'S CAUSE
broke slowly and showed little.
