SAPONARA angled out nearing the five eighths four wide, then made a four wide move on the turn, vied for command by the quarter pole, then shook clear
leaving the turn and drew out in the stretch smartly to prove much the best under a drive. ROYAL KAZ dueled for the early lead two wide, then made a bid
on the turn to shake clear by the five sixteenths, then was challenged by SAPONARA by the quarter pole, proved to be no match for that rival, while staying
on to be second best. DRINK MORE BOURBON stalked the pace three wide, tipped out five wide leaving the turn but had no late gain, bested rest. COOS
BAY stumbled badly at the start, was outrun early, came six wide into the lane and offered a belated rally. ECHOES OF DESTINY was allowed to settle
early and was three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. COMMUNICATION FAIL dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened.

MINER'S GEM was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then was pressured by the half mile marker, shook clear again on the turn but then was
challenged again by STORMY SPELL by the quarter pole, then shook clear by the furlong marker, then was given a right handed pop leaving the eighth
pole, then was wrapped up the final seventy yards to prove best. STORMY SPELL was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from between rivals, made a
three wide bid to try the winner by the quarter pole, but flattened out, kept on for the place award. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO chased the early pace three wide,
came four wide into the lane and offered a mild late rally. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD stalked the early pace on the inside then fell back on the turn, then
offered a late gain on the inside. GRACEYGAB had no rally while on the inside. ALL ABOUT REYANA chased the pace four to five wide and weakened.
