Footnotes
SHE DAZZLE advanced between rivals, disputed the pace outside, opened clear into the turn, widened into the stretch, was kept to task and maintained a
diminishing advantage. WORKING OVERTIME settled in hand, commenced her rally entering the stretch, shifted out and was getting to the winner too late.
CATIRUSIA was slow into stride and unhurried, angled out leaving the turn and finished to earn the minor award. SMOOTH AS GLASS was close up off of
the inside to the stretch and flattened. UNWANTED INPUT was hustled along in mid pack but failed to make headway. ME SAY SO failed to respond.
HAPPY LOUDON rushed up along the inside, disputed the pace to the turn and faltered. DRILL'S VALENTINE was never a factor. ROYAL ATHENA was
through after a half.

Footnotes
ALL FOOLS DAY contended between runners, took over entering the stretch, kicked clear and widened. DIVINE CONTROL was allowed to settle,
advanced between rivals, continued on well but failed to menace the winner. NANTUCKETER vied for the lead between horses, weakened slightly during
the drive but had enough left to preserve the show. TINKER'S PAL was allowed to settle, finished with a mild improvement, but failed to seriously threaten.
ROYAL BIZ set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed entering the stretch and gave way.. ASSERT DOMINANCE contested the pace outside,
but faltered leaving the turn and faded. TUDOX IMAGINEER failed to make headway. SEVEN ON SUNDAY passed only the tiring ones. LIL GREEN
MACHINE broke through the gate prior to the start, was hung wide and failed to threaten. DIAMOND MONEY vied for the lead between horses to the turn
and wilted. BYRON'S GOLD broke slow and never recovered. PRAKRITI was through early.

Footnotes
PANADERO attended the pace along the inside, shifted out and split rivals to commence his attack, came to level terms near the furlong marker, opened
clear was held sway under confident handling. HAD RIGHT prompted the pace outside, forged a narrow leaving leaving the second turn, fought on doggedly
but was unable to match strides with the winner. PROCURADOR was allowed to settle, wheeled out six wide leaving the second turn, loomed a danger but
lacked the needed late response. RACHEL DREAM was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, got through and was making up ground. THE
DUNGEON was allowed to settle, took closer order between runners on the second turn, angled in and got through to make a belated gain.
AEROBALLISTIC came away a step slow, ranged up three wide on the first turn, was collared between rivals and fanned out deeper into the stretch, and
weakened in the drive. IOWA CLASS was away in good order, angled in to set the pace, contested the issue to the final furlong and succumbed. CEDAR
BEACH was never a factor. FURRY BEAR broke slow and never recovered.

Footnotes
BLAKENSTEIN vied for the lead three wide, opened clear midway through the turn, widened into the stretch, then was all out to keep the fast closing
PHARAOH FANCY PANT at bay. The latter was forwardly placed along the inside, angled out to commence his bid, dug in and kicked on in the final furlong
and was getting to the winner with every stride. KATHERN'S JOY was allowed to settle, moved up between rivals on the turn, angled in entering the stretch,
slipped through and was up in time to earn the minor award. RUNNING VIOLENCE disputed the pace along the inside to the stretch and gave in. MIAMI
CHROME contested the issue between horses to the stretch and tired. FIFTY CENTS was allowed to settle, came four wide but lacked the needed late
response. MASPERO settled saving ground, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. HELLFIRE BOB was wide and never a factor.
COTTON JIM failed to respond. UNCLEJACKOMO was through after a half. SUPER EDGAR broke through the gate prior to the start, showed little. NOT
INVENTED HERE was outrun.

Footnotes
BIRD'S EYE VIEW settled saving ground, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, angled out five wide into the stretch, reeled in the leaders and was
kicking away late. D'CRAZINESS tracked three deep, launched a sweeping move through the second turn, loomed large entering the lane, continued on
well but was unable to resist the winner. SANDY LANE KITTEN was away in good order, angled in leaving the chute and tightened up SKIPPY'S STRIKE a
bit, opened clear and dropped to the rail to set the pace, fought on doggedly but grudgingly gave way in the final yards. PROJECTED (GB) settled off of the
inside in hand within reach, shifted out four wide entering the stretch and continued on fairly well. STUCK UP was rank to place into the first turn, leveled
into stride on the backstretch while close up, but weakened between foes on the second turn and gave way. SKIPPY'S STRIKE was put in tight early,
settled under a snug hold, shadowed leader to the second turn, moved up to engage, but faltered entering the stretch and faded. MITZRAYIM was forwardly
placed along the inside, took his run at the leaders on the second turn, but came up empty once straightened for the drive and retreated. GO HIPPO GO
was allowed to settle three deep but lacked a response when called upon. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC was never a factor. APRICOT was shuffled back early,
lagged well back and trailed.

Footnotes
HITECH IS BACK was away alertly, set the pressured pace toward the inside, opened clear after the opening quarter, was collared leaving the turn, turned
back the bid of CANDY JAR nearing the furlong marker and gamely kicked away. CANDY JAR settled between horses, launched a bold bid and caught
HITECH IS BACK leaving the turn, was unable to go on with that one in the drive but was clearly the best of the rest. LALOBA FEROZ was allowed to settle,
advanced between rivals, came three wide and churned on to earn the show spot. MILENITA was forwardly placed along the inside, got through but lacked
the needed late response. MYRA FLEENER was allowed to settle, rallied toward the inside entering the stretch and improved position.
CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE lagged well back, swung wide leaving the turn but passed only the tiring one. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE chased three wide, but came up
empty on the turn and faded. TIZ LOTTIE settled off of the inside, but lacked a response when called upon. MORNING COCKTAIL was unruly in post,
contended on the outside for a half and stopped.

Footnotes
VIP NATION tracked in hand three deep, made a sweeping move through the second turn, came to level terms entering the stretch, shook clear and
widened in the drive. SERENE was allowed to settle, launched his bid four wide leaving the second turn, failed to menace the winner but was up in time to
earn the runner up spot. TAP DANCE FEVER opened clear to set the pace, was headed entering the stretch and just failed to hold the place. TONAL
VERSE broke a step slow, was unhurried into stride, came five wide and was making up ground. ZARINA was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save
ground, finished with a belated improvement but failed to seriously threaten. BE UP was caught in tight and checked hard early, leveled into stride along the
inside, mounted a mild bid between foes on the second turn, but came up empty entering the stretch. CLASSY WOMAN was forwardly placed along the
inside, got through to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. FIRSTMATE was close up three deep, steadied from tight quarters near the
five-sixteenths pole and dropped out.

LOUD N PROUD dueled outside, fought on through a long drive and gamely edged clear. CORT'N ASONG dueled along the inside, battled through a long
drive, was unable to match strides and settled for the runner up spot. HIGHLAND PARK HERO moved up off of the inside, continued on willingly through a
prolong drive but settled for the minor award. FRONTIER MESA chased three deep, came four wide but toiled fruitlessly through the lane. GEMO settled in
the second flight, angled in on the turn, got through to make a mild bid, but flattened in the final furlong. CLIFFY contended early, dropped back some into
the turn, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY settled in the second flight and failed to make headway.
LUCKY LOVER BOY was unhurried, came five wide but failed to threaten. WILD WINTER passed only the tiring ones. NICK THE CARDSHARK was
hustled on in mid pack, moved up five wide to make a mild bid on the turn, drifted out further entering the stretch and dropped out. STRIKING HEIR showed
little.

Footnotes
LEXOPHILIA settled in hand, ranged into striking distance through the second turn, came four wide, wore down the leaders and was up in the final strides.
MUSETTA was allowed to settle, advanced between horses, drove to the inside entering the stretch, slipped through but was denied. SARA MIA prompted
the pace along the inside, forged a narrow lead on the second turn, fought on but grudgingly gave in. SIDNEY SUE was allowed to settle, split horses to
make a bold bid leaving the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive. INDEPENDENCE LAW stalked the pace, launched her bid three deep, poked her
head in front a furlong out, but weakened between runners in the drive. LULLABY LAND was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement, but failed to
threaten. BEAUTY GENIUS set the pressured pace outside to the second turn and tired. TWISTED TREASURE saved ground to no avail. V K STAR was
forwardly placed four wide for six furlongs and dropped out. FROST WARRIOR was through after a half.
