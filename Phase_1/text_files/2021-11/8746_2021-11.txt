Footnotes
RED KING was off slow to begin, unhurried in the early stages on the inside, went between foes at the half-mile pole, got blocked in traffic at the
five-sixteenths pole which cost him some ground, angled out and came three wide into the lane, rallied four deep in the drive and cleared late. MIDNIGHT
TEA TIME sped to the front, set the pace under pressure from inside, overtaken with three-eighths to go, chased the leader into the lane, re-bid in the final
sixteenth and got outkicked by the winner. LURE HIM IN settled early, raced two wide then moved out and traveled three deep at the half-mile pole, put in a
mild bid three deep in the lane and gained the show. KEYSTONE FIELD bumped leaving the gate, traveled in range in the two path, three wide in the
middle stages, drew alongside the top pair at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over at the three-eighths marker, cleared and angled in on the final turn, led
clear in the lane then yielded in the final sixteenth. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) off a bit slow from inside, settled off the pace, saved ground to the stretch
and lacked the needed late kick. BIG BUZZ bumped at the start, stalked early then went up to prompt the pace from outside, entered the final turn between
foes, started to weakened around that bend and tired.

Footnotes
GIRL RANGER came out at the start, showed speed five deep up the backstretch, chased the top pair three wide into the turn, bid from outside with a
quarter of a mile remaining, kicked clear in upper stretch and won going away. UNWRITTEN CODE was off a bit slow from inside, hustled early and went up
to challenge inside rivals, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, cleared briefly then got headed at the quarter pole, lost command leaving the turn, proved
no match for the winner but was clearly second best. ARTISAN DANCER came out leaving the gate, showed speed four deep early, pressed the leader into
the turn, lost contact around the bend, chased two wide into the drive and held the show. QUICK TAKE came out leaving the gate, settled off the pace,
traveled five wide around the turn and never threatened. BONITA LEONA had early speed three deep early, got crowded a bit past the half-mile pole,
shuffled at the three-eighths, went four wide into the drive and weakened. SPOILED ROTTEN broke out, showed speed between rivals, chased two to three
wide around the turn and faded. BLONDE BOMBSHELL was off slow then lost her path leaving the gate, trailed early on, went two then three wide around
the turn, moved to the rail in the lane and never factored.

the lead near the eighth pole, drove clear and padded the margin late. AUGUSTA MELODY went up to duel from inside, inched ahead into the turn, put
SWISS SWOO away then met the challenge from DONCIC around the turn, put that foe away into the stretch, tested by ALBIZU in upper stretch, finally
gave in nearing the eight pole but stayed on to hold the place. BIG SCOTT DADDY settled off the pace, traveled widest up the backstretch, navigated the
turn five wide and was along for the show. SWISS SWOO (IRE) off a bit slow to start, went up to duel for the lead outside a rival, failed to keep up around
the turn, raced three wide into the lane and weakened. DONCIC attended the pace three deep, bid three wide around the turn and weakened in the stretch
run. WARRENS CANDY MAN off a bit slow to begin, trailed through the turn two wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BROTHER REID left the chute six deep, angled to the inside, settling near the back, swung four to five wide into the lane, surged clear with a sixteenth
remaining and won going away. WORLD CRUISER bumped in the chute, tracked inside then shifted to the two path, moved out on the backstretch, spun
five to six wide into the lane, rallied and got up for second. ROSENQUIST bumped early in the chute, dueled from inside then ceded the lead first time
through the stretch, stalked inside then two wide on the second bend, went between foes at the three-sixteenths pole, lacked room with a furlong to go,
angled to the inside and finished willingly for the show. EAGLE CHIEF traveled four deep leaving the chute, settled outside a rival two wide in the stretch for
the first time, steadied off heels then bumped at the thirteen-sixteenths pole, went three deep on the backstretch, four wide into the lane, put in a bid down
the stretch but faltered in the late stages. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY exited the chute five deep, raced outside rivals then moved to the two path, tracked
between then moved out again, lacked room briefly with a sixteenth to go then kept on between foes late. CIRCUMVENT was up close four then three deep
early, dropped back off the top pair and stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the lane, put in a bid but flattened late. HULK raced three deep early
then between foes into the first turn, dueled outside a rival into and around the second bend, cleared past the quarter pole and weakened late. PRINCE
ZIGGY bumped with rival in the chute, dropped back early and moved inside, steered off the rail backstretch, angled four to five wide into the lane and was
not a factor. MONGOL ALTAI raced three deep leaving the chute, angled to the inside, bumped into the first turn, traveled in mid-pack near the rail, got
caught in traffic from the three-sixteenths pole to the furlong marker and could not rally when gaining a clear path. THE BOSS HARTY bumped with rival in
the chute, dueled from outside first time in the stretch then vied inside to the first turn, dueled inside a rival into and around the far turn, chased that rival into
the lane and folded.

LUNATIC set the pace from inside under pressure, cleared rival at the seven-sixteenths, drew off around the turn and padded the lead in the stretch under
right-handed urging then steady handling late. RED PANTY NIGHT threw her head and came away slowly, navigated the turn six wide, then rallied to gain
the place. DORITA'S HAPPY chased five wide through the turn and got edged for the place honors. GOLDEN HALO was off a bit slow to begin, chased off
the pace, three then two wide around the turn and improved position. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR stalked the top pair up the backstretch, went four wide
around the turn and weakened. O SHUGAH MINT off a bit slow to start, angled in and saved ground through the turn and failed to respond when called

PHILLY LISHES tossed her head and stumbled leaving, settled inside, entered the lane two wide, steered out and had little left. CAL ROUGH stumbled a bit

Footnotes
NICE ICE tracked in the two path out of range, moved within striking distance leaving the backstretch, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, split foes in
upper stretch, dueled with ULTIMATE HY in deep stretch and proved best in the end. ULTIMATE HY reserved early on in the two path, angled four wide
leaving the far turn, drew alongside the leader with an eighth to go, dueled with NICE ICE late and got outkicked. ROSE'S CRYSTAL traveled along the
inside near the back, angled four wide into the lane and rallied for the show. ALOHA KITTEN had brief speed four deep then tucked into the three path
behind the top trio, went up to be forwardly placed outside the top pair, bid three deep on the far turn, took control in upper stretch but weakened late.
FEARLESS GIRL (IRE) was bothered from outside leaving the gate, tucked inside early, moved out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. MET IN MIAMI was
off a bit slow to start, got floated five wide into the lane and failed to menace. RESARCIO off slow from outside, angled to the inside, saved ground then
tipped out late in the stretch and passed tired rivals. ANONYMOUSLY broke in and hit the gate at the start, vied between early then took control and angled
in on the clubhouse turn, carried the lead into the stretch, then gave way. FROSE vied for the lead from inside then checked early on the first turn, stalked
off the rail up the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, got bumped and checked in upper stretch and faded. BRILLIANT BIRD vied three deep early
then stalked outside, pressed between leaving the backstretch, started to weaken into the lane, got floated out and bumped rival in upper stretch and had
little left.

Footnotes
BELLA VITA broke in and bumped rival, stalked the pacesetter off the rail, applied pressure into the turn, raced on even terms at the quarter pole, took a
short lead leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire. WARREN'S SHOWTIME raced in range off the inside, navigated
the turn four wide, finished willingly in the drive but could not threaten the winner. BIG SWEEP brushed leaving the gate, sped to the front, took pressure
into the turn, got headed by rival with a quarter mile remaining, lost the lead into the stretch, could not kicked on in the stretch and kept to task to secure the
show. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH tracked in the two path through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FI FI PHAROAH broke
slow and inward, went up to raced inside the pacesetter, chased inside to the stretch and faltered in the late stages. HARPER'S GALLOP got bumped and
squeezed back leaving the gate, steered out widest early, went five wide through the turn and had little left for the drive.
