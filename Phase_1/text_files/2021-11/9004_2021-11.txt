Footnotes
FIFTH SEASON nestled nicely in behind a phalanx of runners vying for the early lead, stayed back of the pace survivors at the quarter pole and got a wide
seam turning for home, drove past the leader at the eighth pole and held a diminishing margin to the wire. DENMARK off the pace with only two rivals beat
late on the backside, circled four wide on the far turn and up behind foes in upper stretch before tipping out to be widest and closing fast on the winner but
ran out of real estate. LIVERPOOL MAN was four wide and pressing the pace on the first turn, bid two wide on the far turn to get a head in front briefly
against the pace survivor at the quarter pole, drifted out to the five path turning for home but hung on gamely for the show despite not changing leads down
the lane. RIGHT TO STRIKE off the pace and five to three wide on the first turn, began a long steady rally two to three wide on the far turn and kept it going
down the lane to grab a minor award, passing rivals eagerly. MAVERICK MAN was three wide chasing the leaders and on the flank of the eventual winner
to the quarter pole, loomed in the four path turning for home but stalled in the final sixteenth. DIAMONDBACK was in midpack four to two wide on the first
turn, rallied nicely on the fence at the quarter pole and tried to sneak up the fence turning for home but was shut off and steadied hard, regrouping and
tipping out to re-rally in the final furlong and pick off a few rivals. BIRCHMOUNT RD was two wide in a four horse scramble for the early lead, won the pace
battle and opened up into the stretch but was headed at the eighth pole and lost positions in the final sixteenth. SETSON broke out and bumped a rival at
the start and trailed the field until turning for home, put in a rally down the stretch to pass a few stragglers. CASH ADVANCE sat on the fence in midpack
and angled out on the far turn but could not threaten. SAMUEL H was bumped by a rival at the start but recovered quickly to be three wide in a four horse
scramble for the front, stayed game until dropping back near the quarter pole and retreating down the lane. POLYDEUCES was inside a four horse battle for
early supremacy, dropped back to chase rail backstretch and faded on the far turn and into the stretch.

Footnotes
GIANT TEDDY led early, set a reserved pace, widened upper stretch and held under a hand ride. UNCLE JOE settled in mid pack, closed four-wide late
turn, rallied willingly and was up for place. STREAMING TAP, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, moved
back to the rail in the stretch and rallied gamely. DIXIE'S FLATTER pressed the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out late. HYPERVELOCITY stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, was all out but was unable to gain. RED FLARE was off
slowly, closed to mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but failed to menace in the stretch. BET N WIN stalked early, dropped back
three and four-wide and settled in mid pack on the turn but lacked a closing response. LILNMIGHTY settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn
but never reached contention. ICE ROAD settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn but failed to menace. BET broke inward and settled off
the pace, saved ground on the turn but lacked a rally. SNOOKERED settled off the pace, was hustled on the rail through the turn then lacked a closing
response.

Footnotes
SPITE STORE dueled with a rival to his inside before clearing off into the turn, maintained an open length advantage for the remainder of the dash while
kept to his task although the margin was diminishing late. LUCKY SCORE trailed before closing up the inside early on the turn, angled out to the three path
at the quarter marker and out in the five path brushing with a rival to his outside, came running late wide to make it somewhat interesting in the final stages.
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS up to chase three wide early, ranged up outside the winner turning for home but hung in the final seventy yards, holding the show
spot stubbornly. MALIBU SECRET chased along the rail early, circled two to four wide on the turn to loom turning for home in the five path but levelled off in
the final sixteenth. STORMY SOUL sat in midpack on hold early, in behind the leaders on the turn and still in range to midstretch but could only run evenly
down to the wire. FORESTER'S FORTUNE was devoid of early foot, three wide near the rear on the turn, brushed with the eventual place finisher turning
into the stretch when out in the six path, never a factor down the lane. CELEBRATORY dueled inside the winner early, chased that one around the turn and
stayed inside but had run out of gas at the sixteenth pole. SANDY BAY trailed into the turn, angled two to three wide but could not enter contention.

Footnotes
GOD OF LOVE, four to two wide with one rival beat around the first turn, circled from the rear three to four wide on the far turn and floated out into the six
path turning for home, rallied strongly to grab the front at the seventy yard pole and pulled away with long powerful strides late. IRONSTONE was rank early
but settled in behind, chasing the early leader, angled out to target the pacesetter on the far turn, bid turning for home and inched by that stubborn foe near
the sixteenth pole but was immediately tackled by the winner, battling on gamely to hold the place. ON THIN ICE sat in midpack and three wide early,
circled on the far turn four wide to loom up turning for home, was outkicked by his stablemate down the lane but closed strongly in the final forty yards to
grab the show spot. CHURCHTOWN hit the gate and began off stride, quickly regrouped and outran two rivals to get the front into the first turn, was
challenged by the eventual place finisher turning for home and gave way grudgingly down the lane, losing the show spot as well late. HEAT MERCHANT
was in behind the leaders in the first turn, shuffled back on the far turn to last before getting in gear and angling out in midstretch, closing best of all in the
final sixteenth with a rally equal to the winner's. HICKSY chased outside three to two wide on the first turn, in range four to three wide on the far turn but was
outkicked in the three path down the lane. BE LIKE CLINT sat off the pace along the inside, was inside the winner midway on the far turn but could only rally
mildly down the lane to pass a few. INTERNATIONAL on hold at the back early, rail to three wide on the far turn and out in the six path turning for home, ran
by a few rivals down the stretch but never a threat. STOWAWAY was headstrong early outside the eventual place finisher, stalked the leader down the
backside but began to tire into that far turn and retreated from there. SHAMATEUR in midpack early, rode the rail on the far turn and down the lane while
backing up.

Footnotes
BEQUIA, bumped with ENGLISH BISCUIT early, stalked the pace, was hustled late on the far turn, was blocked upper stretch and bumped SANSA'S VOW
several times upper stretch to make a pathway then finally opened a portal and rallied gamely. SANSA'S VOW, bumped early then rated mid pack, was
boxed in late turn, was bumped several times upper stretch then rallied. EMMELINE forced the pace, was hustled on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch,
drove clear but was headed in deep stretch. ENGLISH BISCUIT was steadied and bumped repeatedly and was pinched back as well, was hustled two and
three-wide on the turn then chased to the end. QUINTE ROAD stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn and finished gamely in vain. RICHIES
NOBLE GIRL was rated in mid pack, hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. ENDORPHIN RUSH set a reserved pace,
quickened on the far turn, yielded upper stretch and gave way. CLAIMS OF FOUL WERE LODGED AGAINST BEQUIA BY THE RIDER ON ENGLISH
BISCUIT FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE EARLY RUNNING AND BY THE RIDER ON SANSA'S VOW FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH.
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT IN BOTH INSTANCES BEQUIA DID CAUSE INTERFERENCE AND SHE WAS
PLACED FOURTH BEHIND ENGLISH BISCUIT WHO WAS THE FURTHEST BACK OF THE TWO CLAIMENTS.

Footnotes
CANOLA WORLD showed early speed, set a reserved pace then held under light handling. IMPRESSIVE SPEED raced in mid pack, was hustled from the
rail to three-wide on the turn then was all out through the stretch and was gaining fast. ADELAIDE COURT raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the turn
then finished under a determined drive. BOCELLI raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then rallied outside. JOJOMAR stalked the
pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked into the turn, was hustled from the rail and
two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out. FRAC ATTACK, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled from mid pack on turn but
lacked a closing response. ANTE UP ALEX settled in mid pack, was hustled on the turn, closed along the rail approaching the stretch but never reached
contention. JUST START ME UP settled in mid pack, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. NORTH BATTLEFORD, bumped at the
start, stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. PRIDE AND PASSION settled off the pace, closed to mid pack,
came four and five-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. WENJACK settled off the pace and trailed throughout.
