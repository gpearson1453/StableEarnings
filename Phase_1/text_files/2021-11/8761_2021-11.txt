Footnotes
MURDO was last into the turn, moved up behind rivals through mid-turn, checked sharply nearing the five-sixteenths pole, shifted four wide into the lane,
gained momentum straightening then finished with good energy to catch the leader nearing the sixteenth pole and cleared. PAST POST set the pace on a
clear lead through the turn and into the lane, was still well clear with an eighth to go but could not hold the winner safe while well clear for the place spot.
VENETIAN DREAM chased the pace from along the inside and turned in an even effort while gaining the show spot. NO OBLIGATION was in the three path
through the turn, came into the lane three wide and weakened late. EL PIQUIN raced in the four to five path through the turn and into the lane and never
was a factor. DAY IN THE COUNTRY chased the pace while two wide into the turn and was empty after straightening in the lane. GOTTSACKER saved
ground through the turn and into the lane and was always last.

TIMELESS GLORY chased the two rival pace into the far turn, bid three wide through late turn, gained a short lead into the lane, dueled to the eighth pole
and cleared. SWIFT TEMPLE settled off the pace into the far turn, bid four wide on the outside of the winner into the lane, dueled with that one to inside the
eighth pole, could not keep up and settled for second best. TIZ ABBY raced in the two or three path through the far turn when gaining momentum, could not
gain on the top two but settled for best of the rest. REVS RUN set the pace under pressure into the far turn, vied for the lead in late turn then gave way
along the inside. TINY SNEAKERS vied for the lead while two wide into the far turn, was done in late turn but remained under strong, intermittent
right-handed urging to the end. WISHED was never a factor while off the rail through the far turn. PEEKACHICA trailed throughout while saving ground.

Footnotes
LIL KINGS PRINCESS set the pace on a clear lead through the far turn, was asked for more into the lane, quickly extended the margin to the eighth pole
and was never threatened thereafter while being kept to the task. ALITA stalked the winner from the outset while in the two path, could not go with that one
when straightening in the lane then just lasted for the place spot. BAYOU WIND chased the early pace into the backstretch, settled back into the far turn
while off the inside, came into the lane from the three path, drifted into the two path nearing the eighth pole, continued to stay on well, shifted into the four
path late and just missed the place spot. HENRIETTA TOPHAM was in the three path through the turns and into the lane and finished evenly. ROSE
HARBOR raced along the inside through the turns and into the lane and finished evenly while gaining on the show spot. LADY PALACE losing ground
through the far turn while in the three path and was never in it. DIME CUANDO saved ground through the turn and into the lane and was empty then
subsequently vanned off. LIVY B was outrun while in the three to the two path through the turns.

AMAZING JUSTICE stalked the early pace inside, rallied at the quarter pole and was up late under a steady drive. INDY BIZ dueled early outside of a rival,
went clear at the five-eighths pole, was engaged on the outside on the far turn, then couldn't hold off the winner. CONSIDER rallied outside of the winner on
the far turn, lacked room at the sixteenth pole, then angled three wide late and bid. BLAZEN JUSTICE stalked the early pace, bid as the three-eighths pole,
dueled outside of the leader, then gave way late. BROKEN JUSTICE stalked the pace between foes, angled four wide in the stretch but had no late bid.
SHA KON O HEY stalked the pace in the three path, then faded. GOT LOST was off awkwardly. BULLBRIAR pressed the pace outside of a rival, gave way
on the far turn, then was eased in the stretch.
