Footnotes
PALACE PRINCE took over the lead around the first turn and set the pace through the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, saved ground entering the
lane, responded under left handed pressure, held a slight edge over TWILIGHT RIDER in the final furlong, dug in gamely and held on. TWILIGHT RIDER
hopped in the air at the start and raced two wide around the first turn, settled through early stages then took closer order near the half mile marker, launched
a two wide bid through the far turn, raced in striking distance of PALACE PRINCE but could not get by the game winner. TW SKIPPING STONES held a
slim lead and drifted out bothering CLUB CHAMP heading into the first turn, was forwardly placed just off the pacesetter through the backstretch, drifted out
wide leaving the far turn, came in a few paths under right handed pressure and raced along for a share. VODKA TWIST steadied slightly around the first
turn, tracked the pace along the outside through the backstretch and came up empty midway around the far turn. CLUB CHAMP raced up close and was
forced to check when TW SKIPPING STONES drifted out heading into the first turn, recovered and raced in range between rivals going past the half mile
marker then had no response around the far turn and retreated. OBSTRUCTED VIEW trailed throughout. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY TW SKIPPING STONES WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FIRST TURN. The fractional
split of 12401 was removed.

Footnotes
MINDSHARE took over the lead soon after the start, remained clear on top around the turn, came under a ride two to three wide at the head of the lane,
responded willingly, pulled away to a commanding lead and kept to task. MYBESTISYETTOCOME raced off the early speed, hustled along three wide into
the lane, came in a path, sustained a steady bid and captured place. BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR raced in range along the outside, was ridden along five wide
into the lane and got outdueled for place. BRON AND THE BROW chased in contention along the inside, remained up close two wide into the lane then
failed to keep pace past the furlong marker. NOT NECESSARILY lacked speed, saved ground around the turn and failed to kick on. LOTSA LENA broke on
top then conceded position to the eventual winner, raced in contention behind the early early lead, then drifted out through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
BLANK IT prompted the pace in opening stages then dueled outside of SUCCESS RATE around the turn, shook free in the upper stretch and kept clear
under a driving finish. THETRAILERGUY was unhurried out of the gate and remained reserved in the lane, picked up the pace late on the turn, came five
wide into the lane and produced a solid finish. TEN CARAT ROCK raced outside in the second flight entering the turn, stayed on three wide into the lane
and got up late for show. SUCCESS RATE vied inside of BLANK IT around the turn, could not maintain equal terms at the head of the lane, evened out in
the final furlong and got nipped for show. JEN LORS LEGACY angled inside just after the start and tracked the top pair into the turn, was ridden along two
wide into the lane and had no late kick. DOBY was not too far back in early stages, urged three to four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response
for impact.

Footnotes
MOONLITE GRAHAM moved up the inside and held a slim lead in early stages, saved ground around the turn, roused for more in the upper stretch,
responded gamely, widened advantage under steady pressure, drifted out wider in late stages and remained clear. SKY CONFIDENTIAL gained ground on
the rail around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and dug in gamely to capture place. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH raced in striking distance of
the early leader, stayed on three wide into the lane and got outdueled for place. N. K. ROCKET MAN raced up close three wide in early stages, flattened
late on the turn then ran on evenly through the lane. WARRIORS HERO raced in the back, came three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. REBEL
ROUX raced off the pace, saved ground through the turn and never threatened. ISTAIN MAN raced in range four wide entering the turn then weakened past
the quarter pole. The fractional split of 4371 was removed. Hand timed.

MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER bumped with rival at the start then raced in range four wide around the turn, moved up in the upper stretch, dueled three deep at
the furlong marker, shook free under steady pressure then held on over late gaining MISS MALIA. MISS MALIA lacked early speed, came five wide into the
lane, rallied along the outside then surged to the wire and just missed. SILVERBULLITBADGER vied outside of RAVINA LANE through early stages, battled
on with the winner past the furlong marker then had no closing kick left in reserve. BALI STAR raced in range three wide around the turn, flattened a bit in
the upper stretch then regained some ground in deep stretch. RAVINA LANE vied inside of SILVERBULLETBADGER around the turn, fought back to the
eighth pole then gave way. LA CAPRICHOSA ducked in at the start and trailed in the back, showed interest in the upper stretch and passed tiring rivals.
MISCHIEVOUS KITTY was forwardly placed three wide through early stages then failed to keep pace past the quarter pole. SEAFARING WILDCAT raced
off the pace, came five wide into the lane, angled in near the eighth pole and failed to kick on. BONITA DIXIE raced off the pace and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MY FIRST PEARL raced two to three wide entering the first turn then tracked the pace through the backstretch, moved up the inside to challenge FLYING
TO THE LINE approaching the quarter pole, vied inside of rival to the eighth pole then shook free and held firm. FLYING TO THE LINE took over the lead
soon after the start, set the pace off the inside through the backstretch, came under attack from MY FIRST PEARL near the quarter pole, fought back to the
eighth pole then failed to move on with the winner. BOLD REY rated outside off the early pace, was ridden along three wide entering the far turn and
sustained a steady bid through the lane. TIZ WONDERFULLY broke in the air at the start and spotted the field two to three length, was ridden along four to
five wide around the first turn, launched a four wide bid with three furlongs left to run, took closer order then failed to keep pace in the lane. MIDNIGHT
GARDEN was reserved in the back, came five wide into the lane, angled in under pressure and failed to move on. REIGN OF FIRE stalked the pacesetter
through the backstretch then faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
SILENT MUSKETIER tracked the pace in close range through early stages, launched a two wide bid between foes near the quarter pole, hustled up three
wide into the stretch and drew clear under a driving finish. DOODLE TIME set a pressured pace through the backstretch, remained on top and swerved
inside in the upper stretch, got collared by the winner in the final furlong and stayed on for second best. ACHILLEUS was unhurried through early stages,
picked up the pace entering the far turn, drifted out and took BALIUS wide near the quarter pole, shifted in a few paths under right handed pressure and
steadily gained in the lane. INFATUATE was rated not too far through the backstretch, hustled up turning for home, was ridden along three to four wide into
the lane and needed more for late impact. CAPPER tracked in close range through early stages, launched a rail bid around the far turn, cut the corner then
tipped two wide and gave way. CAPTAIN RED raced in range along the outside, hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, stayed on to the eighth pole then
flattened out. BALIUS was unhurried, began to pick up the pace entering the far turn, got carried out wide by ACHILLEUS late on the far turn, lost ground
into the stretch and failed to move on. DOUBLE PERFECTION pressed the pace through the backstretch, remained forwardly placed around the far turn
then retreated. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND DISQUALIFIED ACHILLEUS FROM THIRD AND PLACED HIM
SEVENTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE
