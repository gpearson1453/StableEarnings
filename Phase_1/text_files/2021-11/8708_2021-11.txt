ALL THE DIAMONDS stalked the pace early, made a bid two wide along the turn, took over command into the lane from the three path and edged clear late
in the stretch under a steady drive. A C EXPRESSWAY chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was up for place
in the final stages. ABUNDANT tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but weakened late and lost place at
the wire. BEZOS set the pace early, was overtaken nearing the lane, raced in the two path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run.
COURAGEOUSLY raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. SPANKHURST shied from foe and ducked out
a bit after the start, trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and improved position in the stretch. BREW CREW was through early. ON K P
ducked in slightly at the start, pulled the rider down the backstretch, was getting out through the turn, raced extremely wide into lane and folded up down the
lane.

AUDREY'S TIME raced in the three path along the first turn, tracked the early leader, made a bid in the far turn, took over command into the lane, drew off
down the lane and was geared down in the final stages. FIRST COURSE came in at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane,
rallied for place down the lane but was no match for the winner. SINGITA DREAMS raced in the three path along the first turn, chased the early pace, was
roused along the far turn, in the four path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. ASSERTIVE STYLE was bumped at the
start, set a clear pace early on, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. PALLAS ATHENE was bumped at the start and done
early. PICASSO COLLECTION was never a threat. TALK RADIO bobbled at the start and was through after three quarters. PETER'S KITTEN came out and
was bumped at the start, through after a half.
