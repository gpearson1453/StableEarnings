yards. ZACAPA RUN unhurried early rallied into the far turn then checked near the quarter pole extending between horses down the stretch weakening late.
SKYDIGGER ANDY moved on pace chasing to the final turn fading there. DYNAFORM was never involved. WHITE GLADIATOR gave early retreat.
REVIVE AND RESURGE dropping back shortly after the start was done early. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF ZACAPA RUN AGAINST THE
