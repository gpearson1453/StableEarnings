CALLINGHERCOLLINS rated close off the rail then challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage while two deep
but dug in under determined handling to take the nod through the final yards. MY DREAM GIRL rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the
three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely to the winners' challenge but grudgingly ceded the final yards. C
V'S CAMPFIRE was bumped leaving the gate then again a stride later and setteled off the pace about the three path on the opening turn, raced outside into
the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS
came away awkwardly and outward and made contact with C V's Campfire then rated close off the rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid
toward the seven sixteenths pole then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BAHAMA BREEZE broke outward and made contact with C V's Campfire and
was pinched back a stride later, saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three
path, but showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
BADGER TOOTH settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far
turn, drew clear toward the head of the lane and was kept alert to the wire. MOMZA stalked two deep and moved to even terms leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, took the nod toward the five sixteenths pole, came in on ARE YOU HAPPY nearing the quarter pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and
ran evenly through the lane. The latter took the lead at the rail nearing the seven eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, ceded the nod nearing the five sixteenths, was pinched back at the rail toward the quarter pole and
weakened leaving the far turn. CARSON AND I saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path and showed little further. HEROIC DEED settled back in the three path the opening five eighths of a mile and showed little response the last three
eighths. CAYATANO stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened leaving the three eighths pole. RAGING
WHIRLWIND saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little further response. The Stewards reviewed a claim
of foul against the rider of Momza, lodged by the rider of Are You Happy and disqualified the former to third, for the riders' foul of elbowing the head of the
latter nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
WE B SHACKIN rated close the opening quarter mile then challenged leaving the five sixteenths pole, moved to even terms two deep midway on the turn,
dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew clear the final yards. WINDSORS TAIL set a clear early pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway on the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch and relented the final yards. CAJUN INVASION gave chase, rounded
the turn about the three path and ran evenly through the lane. PEACE ATTARDI chased and rounded the turn about the three path, drifted a bit wider into
the stretch and finished evenly. GOODLUCKWITHTHAT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, was carried out leaving the
turn and showed little more. BET ON BITZ was sluggish into stride and never factored. GOLDEN HUGHES gave chase inside, though, faded toward the five
sixteenths pole. JUSTICEHASBEENDONE chased inside then faded at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN SAM took over nearing the three eighths pole and rated the pace, came under steady encouragement leaving the turn and just lasted. COACH
RUBE broke in to make contact with Barbsgray Lion and was pinched back on the chute, picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off
the rail, eased around Sweetonthegents mid-stretch, dug in from that point and just missed. COUNTRY MAGIC broke in to make contact with Exact then
picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the three path, angled widest into the stretch and finished well while gaining on the top two. WINDSOR'S
CHAMPION chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. EXACT was bumped inward and into Anazara at the
break then gave chase outside, rounded the turn off the rail and finished well to pass rivals in the lane. SWEETONTHEGENTS angled in with the early lead
then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the turn, though, flattened leaving the eighth pole. BARBSGRAY LION was
bumped at the break, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, eased to the five path into the lane then flattened
inside the sixteenth pole. ANAZARA was bumped off stride leaving the gate, gave chase toward the outside then weakened in the six path of the turn.

Footnotes
CEDARS BULLS EYE settled off the pace about the three path on the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was steadily handled to edge clear the final yards. RIVER REWARDS RVF raced boxed at the rail the first turn
then settled close into the backstretch, bid at the rail leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead toward the five sixteenths, was met at the quarter and
raced close at the rail on the turn, recovered the advantage into the stretch but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride. EYE OF THE NEEDLE rated
close in the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, closed to a slim brief lead in the three path toward the quarter pole but was
caught midway on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and flattened stride. CREATIVE SPLENDOR saved early ground, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the five path then finished evenly to pass rivals. POWER SONDE rounded the first turn in the four path and raced
outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail into the far turn, though, angled to the six path toward the head of
the lane and finished evenly outside. LOVE TO ZOOM rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught
approaching the five sixteenths and weakened past the quarter pole. FIFTY GRAY SHADES settled just off the early pace two deep, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. GOT ANY stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase toward the three eighths
pole then gave way leaving the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
KYLE chased off the rail and raced close two deep on the turn, raced between horses toward the head of the lane and dug in determinedly through the
stretch to take the nod the final yards. SOMERSET BAY broke outward to make contact with Pass The Biscuits then angled to the outside to give chase,
came through the turn about the three path, was eased to the five path in the upper stretch and dug in to take second the final jump. G DADDY rated the
pace inside then contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the eighth pole but was outfinished the final yards.
PASS THE BISCUITS was bumped at the break then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead just inside G Daddy later
yards, but was outfinished approaching the wire. SACCO AND VANZETTI chased toward mid track and raced close three wide on the turn, remained a
factor to late stretch but flattened stride nearing the wire. FLAT RATE chased toward the outside, rounded the turn in the four path then flattned inside the
eighth pole.
