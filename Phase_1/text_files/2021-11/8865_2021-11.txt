TINA'S SONG took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the
far turn, drew away toward the top of the lane and was steadily handled to hold on. SILVER AND BLUES settled off the early pace in the two and three
paths, bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted a bit nearing the top of the lane but dug in leaving the turn and
finished well at the outside withers of the winner. STONES ROAD stalked from the three path then challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced close off
the rail on the far turn but weakened the final furlong. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI saved ground on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response and was not encouraged the final quarter. MISS ORA LEE stalked the
early pace two deep then gave way leaving the first turn.

Footnotes
AARON'S TAP tapered in to rate the pace off the rail, dug in to the challenge of FANCY CONCHO leaving the half mile pole and contested the edge nearest
the rail on the far turn, was met leaving the turn, but dug in under determined handling to inch clear of that one mid-stretch, while the latter rated close inside
then challenged into the backstretch, withdrew from tight quarters at the rail in the vicinity of the three eighths pole and resumed his drive past the pole,
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, took a brief nod at the eighth pole but drifted outward under a hard left drive and relented the
final sixteenth. BOSS E BOOGS rated close in the three and four paths the first turn, bid toward the three eighths and rounded the far turn two deep then
finished evenly while dueling for third. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the
far turn, then relented in the stretch duel for third. CANDY INVASION dropped well off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and raced outside
into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. OPERA NITE raced hemmed in
off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. RUSH TO THE CASTLE bobbled leaving the gate then stalked off the rail the
first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch but weakened nearing the quarter pole. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Aaron's
Tap for making things tight through the backstretch, lodged by the rider of Fancy Concho, though, found no cause for change.

Footnotes
DAY OF HONOR dropped well back inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved in the five path of the far turn, dug in leaving the
turn to take over inside the sixteenth pole and drew away later yards. NOW I'M BROKE stalked two deep past the five eighths pole then challenged at the
seven sixteenths pole and dueled mostly at even terms from that point, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn, took a slim brief lead
mid-stretch but was overcome through later yards. NEW SOUTH rated close inside on the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted a bit into the stretch but dug in past the eighth pole to take third late, and was
gaining on the runner-up. DUSKY took the lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate a slim lead, came under pressure from the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and continued a factor in the upper stretch before flattening
stride. SHAKEY rounded the first turn about the four path, moved to the outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. CHAPPIE JAMES rated just off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened in the four path of the far turn. STREET MOJO saved ground but showed little response through the
backstretch.
