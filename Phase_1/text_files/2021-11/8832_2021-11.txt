Footnotes
IMAGERY had one rival beat before rallying three wide into the turn and five wide near the quarter pole, tipped out to the eight path turning for home and
closed resolutely to the front at the sixteenth pole while widest, increasing her lead in the final stages. HAI BOBBI trailed into the turn, came two to four wide
and out in the seven path into the stretch, in the same path as the winner down the lane but no match for that one, clearly second best. TAKOTA stumbled
at the start but quickly recovered and forced the pace outside a rival, put that one away into the stretch but the winner ran by at the sixteenth pole, collared
for place at the seventy yard pole but just holding on for the show late. HARD STREET chased the two pacesetters throughout, in the three path on the turn
and loomed dangerously but could only inch up down the stretch to just miss the show spot late. HALFINTHEWRAPPER was inside pressed throughout,
dueled her pace pal to the sixteenth pole trading the lead back and forth but tired in the final stages. TAKE IT EASY sat in midpack, two to three wide on the
turn and in the four path behind a wall of runners at the eighth pole, moved inside for a clear run and put in a mild rally under light urging late. FOREST
DRIFT lost her footing and bumped a rival when recovering at the start, was in the mix early but dropped off to chase along the rail, in range until the final
seventy yards when a mild rally stalled. ROAD TO ROMANCE was chasing the duelers outside the eventual fourth place finisher all the way, in the four path
on the turn as well, keeping that foe company until fading in the final sixteenth. AMERICAN TAP off the pace early, advanced three to four wide on the turn
and in the six path turning for home but the winner went by to her outside near the eighth pole and that was the end of her run. MRS. DEL was off the pace
and trailed into the stretch, never entering contention. SYSTEMIC RISK was bumped by a rival at the start and off the pace, never entering the fray.

Footnotes
SKYGAZE stalked the pace, closed two-wide on the far turn, led into the stretch and widened under a hand ride. SISTER OTOOLE was away slowly and
settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn and rallied gamely for place. MERVEILLEUX raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to
three-wide on the far turn and chased to the end. LAKE LUCERNE, off slowly, stalked the pace, chased four-wide on the turn and finished under a
determined drive. CRYSTAL GLACIER forced the pace, closed on the far turn, dropped back a bit approaching the stretch then mustered a mild rally.
PEACE SEEKER settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn then rallied outside. ART OF ALMOST raced in mid pack, came two to
four-wide through the far turn then finished gamely between foes. LA LUNE (GB) raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, was blocked
upper stretch and evened out. BROADWAY LADY hopped out of the gate, assumed the lead, set a reserved pace, was passed mid turn, chased to the
stretch and faded along the rail. ANN OF CLEVES, jostled at the start, was rated in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE vied for the early lead inside the pacesetter, took back to stalk that one in mid backstretch, moved up without ask to bid late on the
turn and drove to the front turning for home, opened up at the eighth pole and was kept to her task to maintain a clear margin. OUR SECRET AGENT won
the break, was allowed by the winner to assume command, held the front until the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner's surge in upper
stretch, holding the place safely late. LA LIBERTEE settled between runners in midpack, in the two path on the turn and in behind rivals in upper stretch, got
through a seam late and inched up to nail the show spot late. AUG LUTES was off the pace and between runners early, advanced three wide to loom
outside the winner late on the turn but her rally stalled in late stretch and she lost the show spot in the final stages. GIDGETTA was off a tad slowly after
breaking in a tad, chased the leaders while on hold down the backside, was in range into the stretch but outkicked for a better placing in the final stages.
EMMELINE broke out at the start and chased three wide, angled out two to three wide on the turn and tipped out in midstretch to rally but levelled off in the
final seventy yards. TUNED (GB) broke out at the start, off the pace and over to the rail on the turn but was unable to get involved down the stretch.
JUXTAPOSE off the pace early, trailed on the turn and a mild run stalled in midstretch.

Footnotes
ANTIGONE raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, rallied, led upper stretch and held sway under a drive. CAPABLE
stalked the pace, closed two-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch, was passed and chased to the end. MOONLIGHT RAIN settled in mid pack, chased two
to four-wide on the far turn and launched a determined drive outside. FLAT OUT VIXEN settled in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the far turn but
failed to menace. CAPOEIRA set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, was headed upper stretch and faded. CLASSY MISTRESS settled in mid
pack, was hustled from the rail to two-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. ANITA GRIGIO got away slowly, settled well off the pace and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
EPILOGUE was bumped at the start and trailed on the backside, advanced up the rail to four wide at the quarter pole and tipped out to the six path turning
for home, ran down the leader at the sixteenth pole and was inching away late. BAY OF RUM leaped at the start but recovered quickly to lead in a mad
scramble for the front, repulsed challengers to his inside and out to get clear upper stretch but was collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole, a clear
second best. DYNAMITE KARMA bumped a rival hard at the start and was off the pace, moved up gradually four wide on the turn, outside the winner
midturn, in the seven path turning for home and closed inside the fourth place finisher for the show spot late. SEAU bumped by a rival at the start and
outside that foe in the five path on the turn, still beside that one in the eight path turning for home and outgamed for the show spot by the same participant in
the final stages. HALLIE'S HERO chased inside the pacesetter, dueled with that one on the turn but was put away by midstretch and stayed on to best the
balance. BLOCKBUSTER bumped with a rival at the start, rushed up the inside to chase the leaders before being put on hold, continued to inch up down
the lane but levelled off at the sixteenth pole. CRAFTY CONQUEST chased four wide throughout, was on the flank of the leaders turning for home but
outkicked in the final furlong. ITMAKESMEWONDER broke out at the start, chased three wide between rivals, stayed on until upper stretch but retreated
down the lane. CALL ME WALLY began sluggishly, rushed up into midpack between rivals and under restraint behind others, no rally forthcoming from early
on the turn. SPEEDY MOONLITE off the pace and off the rail on the turn, unable to put together a rally.

SILENT GUROO led quickly, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a drive. MUSICALLY INCLINED stalked the pace,
pressed the issue through the turn then chased determinedly in the stretch. MY FINAL TRICK stalked the pace from the rail, was hustled on the turn and
finished gamely. ROCHE'S POINT broke in the air, settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn then rallied with a good late effort. SHISHKA
raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely through the stretch. MACHISIMA broke outward and settled in mid pack,
was hustled four and five-wide through the turn then rallied from the outside. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS settled in mid pack, saved ground while coming
through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished willingly along the rail. BABY DRIVER raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn
and finished under a determined drive. ELITE PRINCESS broke slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn but evened out in the late
stages. I AM I SAID was bothered by MACHISIMA leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn but leveled out late.
CHASING DESTINY raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. LA BONITA settled off the pace, was hustled
two to four-wide through the turn but never reached contention. SWEET SHADES raced in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but lacked a
closing response.
