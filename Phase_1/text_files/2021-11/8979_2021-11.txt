Footnotes
CHASING TIME was well placed early on, raced in the three path into the lane, bullied through a hole near the three sixteenths pole, rallied down the lane,
drove past the leader and cleared the field in the final stages. PEACEFUL WATERS was a bit slow at the start, set the pace early on, cleared the field
nearing the lane, widened a bit near the eighth pole but was overtaken and no match for the winner late. GENERAL STRIKE tracked the pace early, was in
the two path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. GUNOE stalked the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and weakened late in the
stretch drive. HALFMOON was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. POUR ME A
DOUBLE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, pushed out near the three sixteenths pole and faded late in the drive. KING DOODLE
was never a threat. BENNY THE BOOK was done early. BRODY'S FLY had brief speed then folded up. VIGANO broke slowly and was outrun.

bid along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane, continued the bid three wide near the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the final stages.
WHITE ABARRIO stalked the pace early along the inside, was in the three path into the lane, altered out down the lane and came again for show in the final
stages. BEN DIESEL raced in the three path along the first turn, stalked the early pace, made a bid from between horses from the quarter pole to the eighth
pole but weakened late in the drive. HOWLING TIME set the pace early on, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. VIVAR
raced in the two path along the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the six path into the lane and lacked a bid down the lane. CALL ME MIDNIGHT
raced in the four path along the first turn and back early on, was in the seven path into the lane and moved up. RED KNOBS was a bit slow at the start and
never a threat. GUNTOWN was through after a half. TEXAS RED HOT was never a factor. READY PURSUIT was done early.
