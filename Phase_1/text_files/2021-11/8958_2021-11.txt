ALGEBRAIC set a pressured pace in the two path and prevailed in an extended drive. ZEN PI , four deep around the turn, had a mild rally between horses
and brushed late with SO DIALED IN. SO DIALED IN , rated in the three path behind horses around the turn, swung to the five path at the head of the
stretch, flattened out and brushed with ZEN PI and late. TOP BOSS hugged the inner rail, prompted the winner and faded in the drive. BOURBON AND ICE
bumped with ZORB soon after the break, dropped back on the turn, swung out for the drive and passed tired foes. DEGAS raced along the inner rail on the
turn and weakened in upper stretch. ZORB bumped with BOURBON AND ICE shortly after the start, chased the pace to mid turn and faltered.

Footnotes
FIX ME A SANDWICH was sent clear early and dropped in to set the pace, met an outside bid leaving the far turn, took pressure and drifted three wide into
the lane, drifted out in mid stretch brushing BULL SHARK, continued to drift out and bumped NASHVEGAS despite efforts from the rider with the right stick
then dug in to prevail. NASHVEGAS saved ground advancing past the three eighths, angled five wide into the lane, moved up outside rivals and was
brushed when BULL SHARK was floated out in mid stretch, continued on to challenge past the sixteenth pole, was bumped and forced out by FIX ME A
SANDWICH in deep stretch and kept on gamely. BAPTIZE THE BOY , four wide nearing the half mile marker, chased mid turn, shifted in a bit and rallied.
FORT FORTITUDE , between foes pursuing early on, angled in around the turn, moved up to the inside of a rival past the furlong grounds then flattened out
late. BULL SHARK rated off the leader then angled out after a furlong, bid two wide to engage into the turn, forced the issue into the stretch, was brushed
and floated out by FIX ME A SANDWICH in mid stretch then faded. DR HARLAN failed to menace. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the riders
of BULL SHARK and NASHVEGAS, FIX ME A SANDWICH was disqualified from first and placed fifth for causing interference in the stretch.

Footnotes
TREAT FOR THE EYES sped to a clear, early lead, was steered to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail and lasted under urging.
HOLY PINK lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home and rallied outside. SAFE REEZAN , along the inner rail on the turn, eased to the three
path in upper stretch, finished between horses and lacked the needed response. HELIACAL RISING , along the inner rail on the turn and in the stretch,
failed to menace in an even effort. STREETGARA saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. CIVIL UNREST
came out when breaking awkwardly and was no factor. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL stumbled then bumped with SAMURAISLUCKYSWORD leaving the
starting gate and was outrun. CARIBBEAN FLOW , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. SAMURAISLUCKYSWORD , fractious in the
starting gate, bumped with CHARLYS WILD ANGEL soon after the break then was outrun. MUSIC QUEEN dropped back leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
UNEQUIVOCAL rated close up and was between rivals leaving the far turn, bid three wide outside MANICOMIO into the lane, inherited command past the
three sixteenths, turned away an outside challenge in mid stretch, responded to firmer hand encouragement and kicked away. TITAN'S WILL prompted the
pace off the rail, was under pressure three deep past the five sixteenths, threatened four wide past the three sixteenths, failed to match strides leaving the
eighth pole but continued willingly to be second best. LOST MY VOWCHER , under rating early inside, pulled his way forward while saving ground nearing
the far turn, steadied soon after, chased the leaders along the rail into the lane, steadied and made contact with a fallen rival soon past the three sixteenths
then came up empty. BRICKBAT broke outward and was away slowly, hustled up four wide to pursued the pace, edged up a bit leaving the three eighths,
steadied lightly nearing mid stretch then faded. GLENGAR , three to five wide, was not a factor. COLONIST , sluggish early, settled off the pace, was under
asking saving ground nearing the lane, altered out past the three sixteenths but failed to make an impact. MANICOMIO cleared early, set the pace two wide,
met outside bids into the lane, fell when sustaining a catastrophic injury soon past the three sixteenths then was euthanized on the track and vanned off.
There was a stewards' inquiry but no action was taken.

Footnotes
MOHAAFETH settled off the pace, saved ground behind rivals leaving the three eighths, had room and rallied along the rail in upper stretch, collared
TREASURE TRADITION near the sixteenth pole, gained a short lead soon after and prevailed under a drive. TREASURE TRADITION stalked a contested
pace outside a rival, moved closer while off the rail mid turn, bid four wide outside foes int the lane, went clear in upper stretch, dug in when confronted from
his inside and kept on gamely. HACHURE lacked speed, was four wide turning for home, rallied mildly and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. FLYING WITH
ANGELS swung wide for the drive, raced outside foes and passed tired ones. BAKENEKO , four wide on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home
and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. SOLOMON'S CHOICE was no factor. SPRITZER showed speed along the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch
and tired. DA MONEY , in the two path stalking the pace around the turn, weakened. LET ME FINISH , fractious behind the starting gate, was outrun.
HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE showed speed in the two path and gave way.

Footnotes
MY SACRED PLACE rated kindly while tracking the leader, bid two wide mid turn, took over heading towards the stretch, opened up after being roused in
upper stretch then was kept to steady pressure to the wire. PERCHER , off the pace three wide, dropped back nearing the three eighths, shifted out six wide
for the drive, found more past the three sixteenths pole and came back nicely to bridge the gap and gain the place. LATE BREAKING NEWS rated in range
while saving ground, angled out four wide advancing into the stretch, had aim past the quarter pole, chased but came up empty late. LUDICROUS MODE
lagged back inside, moved up towards the rail in upper stretch, steadied off heels near the three sixteenths, came back on, had his rider misjudge the wire
for a few strides with a sixteenth to go, then churned willingly to the wire. ALWAYS FORGIVEN saved some ground leaving the far turn, eased out but
lacked a rally. ROCKET BLAST , four wide outside rivals early on, chased to mid turn then faded. BLUE DANUBE cleared early, set the pace towards the
inside, was collared mid turn, battled into the lane then weakened past the three sixteenths. RUNNER RUNNER INDY lagged back, raced very wide in
upper stretch and lacked a bid. VICTORY GIVEN was steadied along early, raced between foes into the turn, shifted five wide and gave way through the
final furlong.

Footnotes
DRY WELL disputed the early pace between horses, raced in the two path around the turn, asserted herself in mid stretch and drew out on her left lead.
SULLIVAN STREET showed speed along the inner rail, dueled with the winner in the stretch and finished willingly. DATE NIGHT KISSES worked between
horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. MONEY'S WORTH hesitated at the break, moved up between horses on the turn and tired in the drive. SEA
PINES , four wide on the turn, lacked the needed response. FASHIONISTA hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened. STORMIN' COUGAR
showed speed three deep and gave way. ICY REPLY was not a factor. GOOD STORY , a forward factor in the three path leaving the backstretch, gave way
on the turn and was eased late. WHEREDIDYOUGO lacked speed and showed some late interest. PSYCHE , outrun, was eased late.

Footnotes
HE'S A SHOOTER vied outside a rival before clearing nearing the backstretch, dropped in a bit and set a rated pace, raced two wide into the lane, opened
up a bit after being roused past the three sixteenths then dug in late under pressure to narrowly prevail. MAXIMUS MIDANI broke outward and bumped with
a rival, corrected and settled inside, moved up some past the three eighths, angled four wide approaching the stretch, straightened away and finished
gamely to just miss. AIN'T DA BEER COLD vied inside the winner early on then rated back to save ground into the backstretch, stalked under some coaxing
past the five sixteenths, came out in upper stretch and kept trying to the wire. CAN'T PASS IT UP settled off the pace, angled out around the final turn,
circled five wide into the stretch but failed to generate the needed kick. INK , between runners early, made a three wide run under a hearty ride near the five
sixteenths, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and faded. REASSURED pulled his way forward four wide into the backstretch and prompted the pace,
came under a ride leaving the far turn, chased between foes near the five sixteenths, angled in and gave way. WHATCHASAID , jostled at the break, lost
ground three to four wide and gave way through the drive.
