Footnotes
AWAY TO RETURN stalked the pace well off the rail, took command outside SILVER'S GIRL in upper stretch then pulled away with something in reserve.
WINKED , well placed early, raced three wide around the turn and rallied. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS , two wide around the turn, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and rallied. SILVER'S GIRL sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. I CAN DO IT
lacked speed, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. POLISH COOKIE , along the inner rail, chased the pace and gave way.
RONA , no factor, raced along the inner rail on the turn. PEACE OUT , four wide around the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and retreated.
BOURBON SWING was outrun after breaking sluggishly. MONSTER RISING , wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOPE HAS A NAME sprinted clear early, set the pace under a light hold while off the inside, moved away leaving the five sixteenths, readily increased her
advantage after being put to firm asking in upper stretch then was kept alert to prove much the best. PARTY AT PAGE'S , in the clear while off the pace,
dropped in towards the rail and under pressure past the five sixteenths, edged up towards the rail in mid stretch and continued on willingly to nab second at
the line. BEHIND THE COUCH edged up nearing the half mile marker, pursued two wide into the lane and gave way grudgingly. OWEN'S PLEASURE ,
sluggish from the gate, was under asking three to four wide into the lane but failed to generate a solid run. LUCRE lagged well back while saving ground,
remained inside through the lane, had belated action but failed to threaten. WRAPPER RULE , three to four wide within range early, gave hard chase into
the stretch then faded in the final furlong. LIVE AID , away well, stalked the winner into the turn, was under a strong ride trying to keep pace past the five
sixteenths, failed to do so and gave way past the three sixteenths.

COMBAT QUEEN showed speed along the inner rail, was rated back leaving the backstretch, eased out three wide on the turn, advanced outside
MENDING to gain the lead in mid stretch and drove clear. SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS , steadied when bearing out and bumping FORTES leaving the
starting gate, raced in the two path turning for home and rallied between horses. FORTES , bumped at the start, raced in the two path on the turn, was
taken to the four path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. MENDING disputed the pace, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened late.
FLAVA'S DREAM , circled the turn three wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch, raced on her left lead and flattened out. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL ,
always near the inner rail, was not a factor. MEMPHIS MAFIA disputed the pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn and faltered approaching the eighth
pole.

Footnotes
ZIGGY MON was nudged clear then taken to rate, set the pace two wide into the stretch, kicked away after being put to solid handling past the three
sixteenths, kept on under right handed rousing leaving the eighth pole then held firm. BLESSED ARION chased the winner while off the rail early on,
dropped in under a ride mid turn, edged up to the inside of a rival in mid stretch, altered back out for the final sixteenth and finished gamely to bridge the
gap. DALTON , in a bit close soon after the break, edged up between runners near the half mile marker, shifted in towards the rail around the turn, stayed
inside in the drive and finished with good energy to nab the show. WHERE PARADISE LAY , off the early pace, came three wide into the stretch, moved up
between rivals in mid stretch, was guided outward past the sixteenth pole and kept on with some interest. STONE COURAGEOUS , fractious in the gate,
dropped off the pace while saving ground, eased out and raced three wide into the lane, drifted in near mid stretch and had a bit of a late response. OLDIES
BUT GOODIES drifted out some after the break, chased the winner three wide, kept on willingly past mid stretch then faded in the final seventy yards.
ROBEY'S BOY , well back early on, saved ground into the stretch, eased out and found stride much too late. VALUED NOTION , off a step slow when
breaking awkwardly, rushed up soon after, gave four wide pursuit around the turn, failed to kick on under pressure near mid stretch and gave way.
SHOWTIME CAT , off slowly when bobbling in behind, drifted out briefly, raced well back leaving the three eighths, came three to four wide for the drive but
failed to generate a solid run.

Footnotes
LOVE IS STRONG saved ground under urging on the turn, was taken to the three path at the head of the stretch, engaged FEARLESS LASSIE near the
sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. FEARLESS LASSIE prompted the pace outside HOT TO PARTY, overtook that one turning for home and gave way
grudgingly. DIAL EMMA REILLY lacked speed, raced three wide on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. ADABEL
stalked the pace three deep around the turn, drifted wide entering the stretch and gave way. SHE'S ALL COURAGE hugged the inner rail around the turn,
remained inside horses in the stretch and lacked a rally. SUZZETTE STAR , two wide on the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally in
an even effort. HOT TO PARTY showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. FEARLESS IDEAS , along the inner rail on the turn, swung out in upper
stretch and was outrun. KABIKEKA bore out sharply leaving the starting gate and trailed.

Footnotes
WORKIN ON A DREAM was nudged clear leaving the chute, dictated the early pace in the two path, dropped in towards the rail around the turn, was guided
back off the inside entering the lane, eagerly widened under asking in mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden through the final sixteenth. SARATOGA
JACK , urged from the gate then was taken to rate off the inside, came under pressure mid turn, raced four wide into the lane and kept on willingly to gain
the place. MIDNIGHT ACT , off the pace and under a ride three wide past the three eighths, angled five wide into the stretch but failed to generate a solid
final kick. ZABRACADABRA , away alertly, stalked the winner three wide, was put to asking mid turn, gave hard and willing chase to mid stretch then faded.
MISSIN THE BIG DOG saved ground and gave way.

MY SUPER SALLY bumped with C TWO soon after the break, circled the turn four wide, floated to the seven path in upper stretch, closed resolutely outside
horses, led late and drove clear. MOON BIZ , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and finished gamely inside rivals.
TIPSY TOURIST , two wide on the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch, gained the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. C TWO , bumped on
both sides soon after the break, raced in the two path on the turn, eased over to the four path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late esponse. EL
BOCHINCHE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way approaching the eighth pole. ARBELA bumped C TWO soon
after the break, raced three wide on the turn and failed to rally. UNION BETTY , no factor, passed tired rivals. CAN I EVER was outrun. ELLAROUGE , three
deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. TIME AFTER TIME , along the inner rail on the turn, dropped back through the stretch.

DETERMINED TRUTH rated kindly outside a rival while in closest pursuit of the leader, went on the attack past the five sixteenths, forged to command while
between runners into the lane, spurted away under left handed asking in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. ESTATE , brushed at the break, rated
off the pace and off the inside, ranged up four wide outside rivals to threaten entering the lane, was turned away by the winner past the three sixteenths,
lugged in giving chase past the eighth pole, kept on trying and saved the place. DIVINE HUNTRESS , off last when hesitating at the break, pulled her way
forward while saving ground heading to the half mile marker, awaited room mid turn, swung six wide entering the stretch, drifted in when advancing outside
rivals in mid stretch, corrected and finished gamely to gain. I CAN RUN , three to four wide, was under pressure pursuing past the five sixteenths but lacked
a solid finish. DERWIN'S STARLET , off the pace and under asking past the three eighths, saved ground in the lane and continued with interest. BETTER
CALL MAMA broke outward and brushed with a rival, straightened and showed a sharp burst of speed between runners to go clear in the opening furlong,
set the pace towards the rail, was taken on past the five sixteenths and faded in the final furlong. MIDDLE ISLAND bore out at the break, lagged back while
off the rail, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to threaten. VINEGAR VEGGIES saved ground stalking the pace, eased out under asking into the
stretch and faded. SUPERIORITY broke a step slow, rushed up and gave early chase, stayed in range to upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
CURLEE FOX prompted the pace outside ROYAL THUNDER, overtook that one in upper stretch then drew off while kept to his business. GRECIAN
PHAROAH hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and had a slight rally. PRINCE OF CAPS , four deep around the turn,
lacked the necessary rally. ROYAL THUNDER set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened the final furlong. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA , wide turning
for home, passed tired foes. STRAIGHT UP GUY , unhurried to the stretch, showed a mild, late move. MINT GAME was no factor. IRON PEARLS raced in
the three path between horses on the turn and gave way. SPEAKERIT chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn and tired.
