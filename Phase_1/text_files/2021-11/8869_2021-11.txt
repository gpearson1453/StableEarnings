Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE set the pace from the inside, was well handled on the front end, shook clear on the turn and then drew out in the stretch to prove much
the best, driving. SEPICATO tracked the pace from the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, rallied well for the place award while no match for the
winner. AUTOMATE stalked the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn, tipped out three wide and faded late, bested rest. LADDIE LIAM was
allowed to settle early while two to three wide, came four wide into the drive and had no late rally. FLEET IRISH was reserved early on the inside, lacked a
rally while saving ground. PAL CAL was in tight and checked into the first turn, then chased the pace four wide on the backstretch, then continued pursuit
three wide on the turn and then was empty. BUILT THAT WAY was four wide into the first turn, then settled five wide down the backstretch and tired.

then was denied late. BLEZNIATKA was allowed to settle early, swung wide for the drive and had a belated rally. LOOP THE LOOP was well placed early

Footnotes
THURMAN MERMAN set the early pace while clear, then drew out leaving the turn and drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best under a drive.
PETTINBERG stalked the winner three wide, proved to be no match for that rival while drifting in the stretch and staying on to be second best. LETORT
chased the early pace on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and had no late rally, bested rest. FIGHTIN PHIL chased the pace three wide and
weakened. STONE SCULPTOR was bumped at the start, outrun early then passed the tiring rivals. MR. CAT was settled two wide early and had no
response. IWISHIWASPECIAL chased the pace four wide and weakened.
