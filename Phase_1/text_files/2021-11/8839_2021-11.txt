HEADLINE HUNTER stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position through the turn on the two path, bid, gained a short lead into the stretch,
then drew off and was kept to the task. POLISHED LADY well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path, made a steady
gain and edged up for the place. FRANKIE'S GIRL tracked the pace, came through on the two path into the stretch and flattened out. SIDNEY SUE lacked
room between horses to the turn, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
KATIESDREAMGIRL broke out, hitting the gate at the start, saved ground through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed a tiring rival. SWEET
PENELOPE set the pace inside and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
BAILEY never far back, was pressured for room into the turn, steadied and dropped back, then angled four wide into the stretch, exchanged bumps, made a
steady gain and drove clear. ABSOLUTE GRIT unhurried early, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path gaining a short lead into the
stretch, then dueled with POSITIVELY AWESOME, held that one at bay and was outfinished by BAILEY. POSITIVELY AWESOME sprinted to a clear lead
soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, dueled through the lane and weakened late. SIR KAHN allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and closed willingly to gain a share. PALADIO allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, exchanged bumps with the winner and weakened. AWESOME BEACH well placed and outside, gained a short lead on the two
path through the turn, then faded into the stretch. FLIPPING FISH chased the pace inside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
UPHOLD THE LAW stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the stretch, drove clear, then drew off late. BIG DADDY DAVE set the pace
off the rail, angled in into the turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. TIGER mid pack, looped three wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed for the show. NACHO PAPA stumbled badly at the start, angled out through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and edged up for a share. FIRST RULE mid pack and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and could not gain. RAISE THE RENT fractious in the gate, broke the gate prestart, drifted in after the start, vied inside, dropped back through the
turn, then weakened in the stretch. HANDSOME PRINCE bumped with TIGER at the start, came through inside, then weakened. KATIE'S COWBOY
checked soon after the start, and was never involved. MAYOR REMO broke sharply from the gate to track the pace, then faded on the two path through the
turn.

Footnotes
CAVE HILL well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
late. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) rated outside, moved up and shook clear through the second turn, increased his margin into the stretch, then was no match late
and held the place. HAIL TO THE CHIEF allowed to settle, angled three wide and moved up through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted
in and missed the place. SOUPER FORTUNE hard to rated early, angled out through the first turn, gained position into the second turn three wide, then
came four wide into the stretch and flattened. ALADO set the pace inside and faded in the stretch. ON BASE tracked the pace well back and faded after a
half.

AMERICAN PRINCE sprinted to a clear soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. MAGIC
ECLIPSE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, carrying a rival out slightly, then made a steady gain and closed
well for the place. GUMP well placed and off the rail, looped three and four wide through the turn, carried widest into the stretch, evened out. ALONZO
unsettled in the gate, was well placed inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
ORIENTAL TRIGGER (ARG) passed tiring rivals. SOSOSUBTLE rated back early, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path, lugged in, bumped
and faded the final furlong. NIXON JOY (ARG) was no factor. ROYAL SQUEEZE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn,
then stopped.
