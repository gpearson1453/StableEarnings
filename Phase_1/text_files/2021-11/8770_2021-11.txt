rail to make the lead at the quarter pole, shook clear in the stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. ALL THE BEST never far back, offered
a bid four wide into the stretch then was outfinished. SKIPSHOT LILLY found her best stride late. WELLOILEDCAT passed tiring rivals. EDGE was no
threat. CAROLINA'S THING pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then gave way. SANIBEL away alertly, set the pace off the rail for six furlongs then
was used up. LA LA ANGEL was no factor. REBEL POWER close up along the inside, stopped on the far turn, was eased in upper stretch and walked off.

SURE FIRE READY broke in front, set all the pace unchallenged and widened at will while being kept to task to win as much the best. AFLAXENDREAM
trailed through the far turn, swung wide, rallied in the eight path and got up for second. ZVOLUME jumped tracks soon after the start, raced erratically
through the first turn then passed tiring rivals. RUNAWAY BELLE was no factor. BEACH AND WINE advanced two wide through the far turn then came up
empty. TIDAL ROCKET chased the winner into the far turn, stopped and was eased to the wire. GIMME CLEARANCE had speed for a half then stopped.

Footnotes
JOES A ROCKIN prompted the pace from the inside into the stretch, dug in determinedly under right handed urging through deep stretch and got up in the
final strides. VOLUME OF TRUST never far back, rallied four wide through the stretch and got up for second. MA MOOS WARRIOR stalked the early pace,
rallied three wide into the stretch, made the lead then was outfinished in the final yards. NAMBITI stalked the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly two and
three wide nearing the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch then leveled off. THE GOSPEL OF MARK well placed, went evenly. CAT HEAT was through
after a half. ELLADA PINOT was no factor. KETTLE KING sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the too of the stretch then gave way.
HAPPY TAKEOVER checked repeatedly near the inside on the first turn and trailed. PINOT ENVY reared in the gate as the doors opened unseating his
rider and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
