Footnotes
VOODOOISM saved ground rallying on the far turn surging clear along the rail in upper stretch widening under a drive. MISS DOGWOOD moved on pace
dueling through the far turn being quickly overmatched from the inside in upper stretch hanging on as a weary second. ABUELA CORI hustled out prompted
the pace from the outset dueling on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. PEACH BELLINI gained to threaten along the outside on the far turn coming five
wide down the lane hanging the final sixteenth. CIRCLEOFCOLOR played no factor. ESTA CALIENTE raced second flight tiring on the far turn. PREGOLYA
RIVER was empty from the half mile pole. PER RULING FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, VOODOOISM WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR
POSITIVE TEST.

stretch holding firm to wire. THE FILTER surged up to pressure between horses near the quarter pole being rebuffed in upper stretch staying on to the end
saving place. JUSTIN FRONT hustled up to bid three deep at the quarter pole before weakening under extension down the lane. SLEEPING GIANT
pressed then chased on the turn racing evenly through the lane in the three path. ARTAVIA flashed early speed then backed off along the inside on the turn.

Footnotes
TUESDAY'S ROSE stalked the pace through the turn looming into upper stretch rallying clear late in the four path. COOL SPRING pressed the pace dueling
on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch being run down from the outside late. WEE MONIE CREEK raced mid pack through the turn giving steady
response down the lane to gain some late. SAMOA saved ground giving a mild rally to upper stretch vying evenly late on the rail. RORAIMA slow early was
hustled on the outside to upper stretch finishing evenly. FOXY GATOR chased early then faded on the turn racing wide down the lane. JIMA'S GOLD
played no factor. WORLD IS MY CITY dueled briskly through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. WARNING BELLE gave way on the turn.
