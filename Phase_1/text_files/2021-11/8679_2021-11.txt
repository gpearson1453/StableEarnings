AUTOMATE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew off in the drive to prove much the best under
a drive. RON DON SCORESE was rated along three wide early, then was between rivals on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and finished willingly
to be clearly second best, no match to the winner. ROLLING PALISADES set the pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole and gave way,
bested rest. KRACHENWAGEN was well placed down on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and came up empty. SOLAR WARMING stumbled
badly at the start, then made a mild move four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and tired.

Footnotes
CAPITAN FOFO dueled for the early lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and edged clear late to prove best under a drive. I SEE THE STARS
was bumped at the start, then tracked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid leaving the five sixteenths, came four wide into the drive while vying
for command but hung late. QUICKER was well placed early on the inside, then was boxed on the turn, angled out in the stretch for racing room and offered
a belated rally to gain the show award. PASSCODE dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole, then was between rivals by the
three sixteenths pole and faded late, lost show spot at wire. FOR THE MOMENT chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn and then was
empty in the drive. PURE SPRING was bumped at the start and was four wide early while being no factor.

Footnotes
MINER'S GEM set the early pace on the inside, then was headed on the turn, then was sent down leaving the turn and responded well to draw off to prove
much the best under a drive. GRAY LOLLIPOPS stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner in
the drive, second best. COWGIRL NIGHT hesitated after the start, then was rushed up between horses and three wide then came up empty in the drive,
bested rest. KAFFEINATED was settled early, made a five wide ruin on the turn and weakened. BLEZNIATKA chased the early pace and made a mild four
wide bid on the turn but weakened. OUT ONA LIMB was not a factor. ONE SMART COOKIE chased the early pace on the Inside and tired.
