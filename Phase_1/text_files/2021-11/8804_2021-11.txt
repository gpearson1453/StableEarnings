Footnotes
BAYOU SARGE vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane and drove clear before the wire. AS THUNDER HEART
raced in the back of the pack, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late rally and finished willingly. MAJOR GRIFFIN dueled for the early
lead, saved ground and weakened, while racing on the rail. G'S STORM raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and put forth an
even effort. FORT BONZ raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor. BLAZE OF GRAY raced in the middle of
the field, weakened and was no threat late. LAST NATIVE CAT pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first turn and faded. WHIPLASH WILLY
always raced near the back and showed little.

turn on the outside, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GRAND PRADO was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout and proved
no match for the top two. EBONY FLASH had a tight start, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide gain and was
outfinished for third. KINLEE'S SONG void of early speed and passed tired ones. DIABLO CAT raced evenly near the back and showed little. LOUISIANA

KELA'S TURN pressed the pace, raced close throughout, saved ground around the second turn, took the lead, was all out and proved the best. BECCA'S
ROCKET unhurried in the beginning, raced three wide around the final turn, made a wide bid and got up for second. SHES OUR FASTEST raced within
contention, came around the final turn three wide, took the advantage and was outfinished by the top two. EILEEN ALEXANDRA lacked early speed and
was never a factor. RUSSIAN ROULETTE had a tight start, quickly shot to the front, drove clear and faded. BOERNE vied for the early advantage, saved
ground around the final turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
HARRY'S LIL HIPPIE pressed the pace, took command, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and finished well. ONE PROUD BOY vied for the early
lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. WICKED FITZ unhurried in the early part, came around the turn
four wide, made a wide bid and got up for show. FIRST METAL COUNT dueled on the front end, weakened and got caught for third. CROWN ROCKET
lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. CHARLI MICHAEL raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. ON TILT vied
for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and faded. RICHARDS DREAM void of early speed, had a wide trip and was no threat. THE THREE KS
always raced near the back and was outrun. COOL FIRE pressed the early pace and dropped back.
