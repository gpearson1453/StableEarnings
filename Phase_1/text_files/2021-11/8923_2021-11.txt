PILOT EPISODE broke alertly, forced the pace, bid late turn, edged ahead upper stretch and held sway under light handling. REINFORCED was herded
inward leaving the gate, stalked from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was lugging in through the stretch but was still game to the end. BAYOU BELLE
moved up to take an early lead, was headed, forced the issue, led into the turn, was headed upper stretch and chased to the wire. IN MY OPINION settled
in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but failed to menace. TEACHER'S PET settled at the rear, closed late turn and chased through the
stretch. PIQUET raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. SHE'S A DREAM broke inward but also showed
speed, led briefly on the backstretch, forced the pace on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESSOFTHENORTH set a pedestrian pace without being asked between rivals, surged to a clear lead when asked by the eighth pole and opened up,
in hand the final seventy yards. CATICHE hit the side of the gate and was in a tad tight at the start, chased three wide before getting into the two path on the
turn, lay in a tad down the lane but was into second by the seventy yard pole, holding off a rival for that spot and galloping out with authority. MENAGERIE
sat in midpack and on hold through the slow early fractions, advanced two to three wide on the turn and was on the flank of the eventual place finisher in the
final furlong but could not get by. SPOOKY SPICE stalked inside the winner down the backside, dueled inside that one but was working harder to keep up,
tiring in the final furlong and losing positions late. LAST OFFENSE chased inside the eventual place finisher on the turn but was outfinished down the
stretch. DONNARUMMA was four wide stalking early, dropped back while giving her rider trouble mid backstretch and nearing the turn, three wide on the
turn with no rally forthcoming. HIGH TREASON trailed early, came rail to two wide on the turn but could not enter contention. TUDOR PEAK trailed the field
into the turn, gave the rider trouble when drifting out while three to four wide and could not recover. SALADA hopped at the start and made it up to midpack
on the rail before backing through the field on the turn.

four-wide on the far turn then rallied outside. STAR SCHOLAR, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn but leveled out in deep stretch.

three and four-wide on the far turn but evened out in the late stages. TRUECREST settled off the pace, closed late on the backstretch, was hustled from the
rail on the turn then flattened out late. KILLARY stalked the pace, dropped back approaching the far turn, was hustled along but had no closing response.

Footnotes
STARLIGHT RIDGE sat along the rail on hold in midpack, angled out to the two path at the quarter pole but dipped back inside rivals into the stretch, came
out again at the sixteenth pole and drew a bead on the winner, getting a fortuitous head bob on the wire to grab the victory. SILENT CAUSEWAY stalked
three wide early, on hold outside the pace survivor on the turn, pushed to the front and cleared at the eighth pole, getting nailed right on the wire. MARAIS
moved up early to stalk the early leader between rivals, chased in the two path on the turn, angled out to the four path turning for home but was outkicked by
the winner to her inside in the final sixteenth and couldn't close ground on the pace setter, settling for third. LIVIN IN THE SIX off the pace early, moved up
two to four wide on the turn and out in the seven path at the top of the stretch, closing resolutely while widest to best the rest. IMA BEAST won the break
and settled on the lead on the rail, was hounded by the eventual place finisher on the turn, passed by that one in upper stretch and retreated in the final
furlong. SUNSPRITE chased three wide on the turn and came out into the five path turning for home but could not sustain her rally and stalled in the final
furlong. STERLING SPEED was on hold inside the early leader, taken back to chase on the rail, still in behind the leaders turning for home but was out of
run by midstretch. SOUPER PECAN was pinched back a tad at the start, off the pace throughout, two to three wide on the turn and never in contention.
SILVER DAHLIA sat on the rail and off the pace, asked for run inside on the turn but did not respond. OLD SECRETS bore out significantly at the start,
turned left to get to the rail when far behind, passed a tire foe down the lane without ever being in the race. CARELESS HEIRESS was two to three wide in
midpack early, outside the eventual winner at the quarter pole but retreated down the stretch.
