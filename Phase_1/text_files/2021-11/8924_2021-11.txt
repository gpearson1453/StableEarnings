of speed, raced seven wide into the turn, was closing late, was no match and finished second best. MISS EASYGO was allowed to settle early, raced four
wide into the turn and weakened late. BRANDISTYLED was outrun early from between rivals and offered no rally. LONG RANGER raced in mid pack early,
advanced three wide out of the turn and flattened out. ALL STEAMED UP was unhurried early, raced in the eight path in the stretch and never fired.
