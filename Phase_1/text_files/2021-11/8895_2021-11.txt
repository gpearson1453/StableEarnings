GHOSTED GIRL held a slim lead in opening stages then took clearer command entering the turn, took the inside position in the lane, responded willingly
under steady pressure, pulled away to a commanding lead and kept to task. OUTLAW DAISY raced up close inside through opening stages, remained
forwardly placed around the turn, stayed on two wide through the lane and secured second best. KEBA LUCKY DAY tracked the pace in early stages,
coaxed three to four wide through the turn, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and cleared the rest. ROPERS N WRANGLERS raced in striking
distance in early stages, failed to keep pace mid-way around the turn and steadily weakened. LA CAPRICHOSA was forwardly placed in opening stages,
remained in close contention through the turn, then came up empty and faded in the lane. PHANTOM MISTRESS saved ground and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GABO'S MACONDO raced up close around the first turn, vied for the lead through the backstretch, battled back with REAL GLITTER to the eighth pole then
kicked clear. REAL GLITTER was forwardly placed around the first turn, dueled for the lead through the backstretch, battled on with eventual winner into
upper stretch, could not match past the eighth pole, stayed on and held place. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN rated off the top flight through the backstretch,
launched an outside bid in the lane, finished with good response and just missed place. REAL LUTE raced in the back, launched a bid leaving the far turn,
raced three wide at the eighth pole and gained position. OUR DANDY'S BOY tracked the top flight, bid two wide around the turn, remained in range at the
eighth pole then finished evenly. UPPER ROOM rated through early stages, launched a rail bid late on the far turn the flattened in late stages. ANGELO'S
PRIDE saved ground and failed to move into contention. CRACK A COLD ONE held a slim lead around the first turn, vied through the backstretch then
weakened around the far turn.
