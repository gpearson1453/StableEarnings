Footnotes
WINDCRACKER was crowded between horses soon after the start, recovered and picked up stride approaching the half mile pole, tipped three wide while
steadily progressing into the turn, ranged up to the leading pair entering the lane, took over from those foes in upper stretch, and drew off under driving
pressure. ROULETTE lied off of the pace three wide, and stayed on through the final furlong to reach place on the wire. AMAZING ROCKET gained early
on from off of the pace to a three wide stalking position at the half mile pole, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied outside of FREER around the
bend before getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, quickly proved no match, gave way, and was nailed on the wire for place. CALICO JOE
stalked along the inside early on, but faltered into the turn, trailed the field passing the three furlong pole, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on
outside of foes for a minor placing. FREER dueled for the lead outside of JASON BE GOOD through a fast pace, then inside of AMAZING ROCKET passing
the three furlong pole after the first foe faltered, dug in turning for home, but gave way at the three sixteenths pole. MOUNTAIN TIME broke slowly, trailed
two wide, moved up between horses entering the lane, but lugged inwards in upper stretch, and failed to sustain a bid. JASON BE GOOD dueled for the
lead along the inside through a fast pace, then weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
WELL SPENT tracked the pace four wide, ranged up to the leading group turning for home, took aim on a bidding BLOSSOM ROAD in upper stretch, forged
an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. BLOSSOM ROAD stalked three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane outside of LICHITA, dueled
with that foe through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. LICHITA set the pace inside of a
pressing ESCAPE FUND, dug in to resist BLOSSOM ROAD's bid at the quarter pole, dueled through upper stretch, but yielded to that foe and another outer
rival approaching the furlong pole. KEWPIE DOLL stalked along the inside, got outmoved by outer bidding rivals turning for home, then failed to rally
thereafter. FIELD DAISEY broke a step slowly, trailed the field in the two to three path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor.
ESCAPE FUND reared in the gate multiple times, pressed the pace two wide under steady urging, then weakened between horses passing the five
sixteenths pole.

HOSTILE PRINCESS prompted the pace setter from the outside, dueled with that foe down the backstretch and around the far turn, drew clear entering the
lane, maintained a clear margin from a chasing LA CHAPEAU into deep stretch, then drifted outwards in the final sixteenth, but held sway. LA CHAPEAU
lied close up inside of the leader around the first turn, took back and shifted out to stalk three wide into the backstretch, then chased the clear leader through
the lane while hanging on his left lead, attempted a late bid, but was kept at bay by the drifting leader. CHA CHA MISSION took both turns in the four path
while off of the pace, and stayed on for a minor share. MAKING PROGRESS broke sharply, set the pace in the two path, felt stern pressure from an outer
HOSTILE PRINCESS into the backstretch, dueled with that foe into and around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. I'M STYLIN trailed along the
inside, came under mild encouragement to pick up stride down the backstretch, but failed to respond, and was outrun.

ABROGATE dueled for the lead inside of SHELLBY, shook clear of that foe passing the quarter pole, and held sway from a chasing PRODIGY DOLL
through the final furlnong. PRODIGY DOLL stalked the dueling pair around the turn, split those foes in upper stretch after the outer one drifted out, took aim
on a clear ABROGATE in the final furlong, but was kept at bay. SHELLBY dueled for the lead outside of ABROGATE, but failed to keep pace passing the
quarter pole while drifting outwards, and faded. SOMEONE SAID SO was minorly brushed by an inner foe early on, lied at the back of the pack two wide,
and never got involved.

Footnotes
PURITY perched himself four wide and outside of the leading trio into the turn, ranged up turning for home to bid in upper stretch, forged an advantage at
the furlong pole, and held from an inner rallying rival to the wire. REDRIGHTRETURNING stalked along the inside, chased under mild coaxing around the
turn, slipped inside of the early pace setter approaching the furlong pole while commencing a rally, bid inside of PURITY in the late stages, but was denied
by that foe. DAWSON SPRINGS broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, pressed the pace three wide and between horses, vied around the turn,
showed the way entering the lane, but was headed by the eventual winner at the furlong pole, then was surpassed by an inner foe foe place in the final
sixteenth. SONNYNEEDSMONEY set the pace, felt stern pressure from a trio of hounding rivals, got headed turning for home, then weakened between
horses at the furlong grounds. KEINO tracked two wide, came under a drive while shifting four wide turning for home, but only responded mildly through the
lane, and failed to produce a bid. MOON OVER TUSCANY pressed the pace setter two wide and between horses, vied among those foes around the turn,
but yielded approaching the quarter pole. GOLDEN BOW was off a step slowly before being bothered by an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the four
to five paths into the turn, and failed to factor. JOY IN THE BATTLE tracked along the inside, swung five to six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally.
OFFENSIVE CHARGE lied off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but faded. MY DADDY'S TRAINER broke outwardly,
took the turn in the four to five path at the rear of the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LEA tracked along the inside, stalked comfortably behind the leading pair around the far turn, tipped outside of them entering the lane, bid
passing the quarter pole, took over approaching the final furlong, and drew off. MISS MCBRIDE pressed the pace two wide, vied down the backstretch and
around the far turn, but offered little resistance to an outer bidding foe in upper stretch, and was second best. STREET MISSY settled far off of the pace
along the inside, gained mildly three to four wide around the far turn, and stayed on to surpass the tiring early pace setter for show in the late stages.
TWENTYTWENTY HOAX set the pace inside of a pressing MISS MCBRIDE, but gave way to that foe and another rival in upper stretch, then lost show late.
FITS THE JILL stalked from the two path, chased the leading pair two wide around the far turn, but faded turning for home. MSCOVERTOPERATION
stayed in the five path around the first turn while faltering to last, then showed little thereafter. WILD EMPRESS got fractious waiting for the start and popped
open the gate, required backing out for veterinarian examination, then was reloaded, lied off of the pace three wide around the first turn, but was done early.

PERFECT CUT lied far off of the pace, rallied four wide and outside of JAY VEE BEE turning for home, shifted inside of that foe in upper stretch while
anticipating that rival to drift, then sustained his rally to take aim on a tiring AMANI'S EAGLE in the final furlong, and drove clear late. AMANI'S EAGLE set a
fast pace from a pressing MISTS OF TIME, shook away from that foe at the quarter pole as a pair of outer foes attempted bids, maintained a clear
advantage into the final furlong, but tired noticeably while flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and was worn down in the final stages. JAY VEE
BEE tracked three wide, gained turning for home as PERFECT CUT range dup alongside, but hung on his left lead through the long drive, and was
outkicked for place a sixteenth out. EYE OF THE CAT stalked along the inside multiple lengths off of the pace, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for
home, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. MISTS OF TIME pressed the pace setter in earnest from the outside
through quick fractions, chased that foe turning for home, and weakened entering the lane. SAVOY lagged well behind the field around the turn, and failed
to factor. GUNNER PAUL saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. EL AHIJADO chased from off of the pace two wide, got keen between horses into
the turn, and was done early.

BEVERLY PARK chased the clear leader early on, engaged that foe at the half mile pole, assumed command while well in hand with five sixteenths to run,
drew off before being roused at the three sixteenths pole, and willingly widened before being geared down in the final sixteenth. ROCKSTAR RO tracked
along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied to reach place approaching the sixteenth pole without threatening the winner. SCHMOOZIN
broke slowly, saved ground around the bend while trailing, and completed a rail rally to reach show passing the sixteenth pole. JACK VAN BERG stalked
the leading pair from the two path around the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, claimed place in upper stretch while proving no match for the leader,
but tired in the final furlong and was surpassed by rivals on both sides for minor placings. CHIEF HOWCOME broke sharply and quickly cleared, met
BEVERLY PARK's challenge into the turn, proved no match for that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, and tired through the lane. READY TO ROLL
lied off of the pace two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
PALACE COUP set a clear pace after tossing his head a stride around the first turn, maintained a loose advantage down the backstretch, and drew off
under driving pressure passing the quarter pole. TIZ RYE TIME lied off of the pace two wide, gained four wide around the far turn to reach place in upper
stretch, and stayed on thereafter. HOMBRAZO lied off of the pace three wide, gained four wide around the far turn to reach place turning for home, but was
outkicked for that placing in upper stretch. COUSIN LARRY settled far off of the pace, took the far turn three wide before tipping five wide in upper stretch,
and stayed on. LEADING WEST tracked two wide, chased the clear leader three wide and from between horses around the far turn, but failed to factor
before tiring. AMONGST FRIENDS lied far off of the pace three to six wide and failed to factor. CARMICHAEL tracked along the inside, but got shuffled
back behind a stopping foe turning for home. TREASURY stalked three wide, but chased from between horses around the far urn, and weakened entering
the lane. EASTSIDE COOL stalked along the inside, faded around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.
