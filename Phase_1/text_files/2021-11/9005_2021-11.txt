MICKEYS GOLD was allowed to settle early, advanced between rivals, was gaining late and was up in time. MR LEVI CANYON was void of any early
speed, made a eight wide middle move, took a brief lead, couldn't hold and finished second best. JEWEL OF NAVARONE tracked the early pace, raced
seven wide into the turn and finished evenly. ZAMBEZI FEVER set a pressured pace from off the rail and faded. ZESTY JAZZMAN was up close early,
raced six wide and was empty. KEY TO THE CITY was taken back and offered no rally. OAKES CROSSING pressed the early pace from between foes and
weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
