Footnotes
CAERUS chased the loose leader into the far turn, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, quickly gained the lead into the lane, cleared outside the eighth pole
then widened. RIGHTEOUS ROY was unhurried while off the inside, advanced through the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, was in
the six path near the eighth pole and stayed on well to be clear for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. SAQEEL saved ground through the far
turn, came off the inside and into the three path into the lane then was up for show spot. HONKY TONK HERO chased the pace from the three path into the
far turn, bid with the winner approaching the five-sixteenths pole while three wide, went with the winner into the lane then weakened. EVEN MONEY was
never a factor while along the inside. MO HEAT set the pace on a long lead into the far turn then was swallowed up approaching the five-sixteenth pole and
faded along the inside. MY BUCKAROO was outrun while in the three path through the turns. GJALLARHORN was well back while saving ground.

Footnotes
OCELIA was unhurried while off the inside, began gaining momentum into the far turn, rushed past the tiring leader nearing the quarter pole, quickly opened
a substantial advantage then was under intermittent urging while not threatened late. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY was unhurried while off the inside, moved
through the four path in mid-turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and finished with good energy to be well clear of the show rival. MYERS
TIGER set the pace from the two path through late turn, was no match for the winner into the lane, stayed on through the stretch and lasted for the show
spot. RUNNINAWAYWITHIT void of early speed while in the two or three path, was gaining momentum when checked sharply in mid-turn, shifted wider,
came into the lane from the five path and moved up. TO FAT TO FISH was far back early while near the inside, was in the three path nearing the quarter
pole, angled into the six path and gained belatedly. SECOND EXCHANGE was moving with the winner after mid-turn when in the three path, asked for more
and lacked a closing response. SWEET N WICKED saved ground through the turns and was empty in the drive. NAUGHTY JUSTICE chased the pace from
the three path into the far turn then retreated. LADY DONT MIND was reluctant to load, chased the pace from the three path into the far turn and then was
suddenly done and was pulled up nearing the eighth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
FOUETTE chased the two rival duel through late turn while in the three or four path, asked for more into the lane, quickly moved to the front straightening in
the lane, cleared, widened and finished under a hand ride while well clear. LAS RAMBLAS unhurried while in the four or five path through the turn, came
into the lane from the seven path and moved up to be clear for the place spot. VARTON vied for the lead while near the inside through late turn, was no
match for the top one into the lane then stayed on to be clear for the show spot. QUEEN BRIDGET raced near the rail into the turn, came off the inside and
into the two path outside the eighth pole then moved up while not a threat. MAGINE was never a factor while along the inside. STYLIN UPTOWN was in
mid-pack while in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and weakened late. SHOW ME THE BEST showed brief speed to
duel with two others before the first call, settled back to chase the pace into the turn then was empty in the lane. JE SUIS BELLE vied for the lead two wide
into late turn then faded.

BLUE STEEL stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, bid in late turn, cleared into the lane and drew away. DR. FORMAN dueled for the early
lead, maintained a short lead while racing in the two path, shook off inside challenger then was no match for the winner into the lane and chased that one
home to finish clear for the place spot. POLE SETTER pressed the pace along the inside into mid-turn, settled back along the rail, came again inside the
eighth pole, shifted from the rail to the four path late but could not gain the place spot. EMPIRE'S SCORE raced in the four path through the far turn when
never far back, bid into late turn then weakened. SHELL FIRE never a menace while in the two or three path through the turns. WILDCARD PRADO was in
the two to the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path and tired. GO RODNEY was outrun from off the inside. BAD BOY was always
last while saving ground.

Footnotes
NO DRAMA MOMMA was bumped at the start, vied for the early lead while two wide, cleared into the turn, remained on a clear advantage into the lane,
looked to be a comfortable winner inside the eighth pole but was all out late to hold. MOLLY'S WARRIOR pressed the early pace from along the inside,
settled to chase the pace into the lane, came off the inside for the drive and stayed on well to be closing in late. HABUIAH chased the pace along the inside
through the turn, angled into the three path for the drive and finished evenly. MAMALA KAMALA raced in the four or five path through mid-turn, angled in
towards the quarter pole, came into the lane from the two path and finished with good energy. ZIPSY ROSE LEE in the four path through the turn, came into
the lane from the five path and was never a threat. VIVIJO raced from the inside to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path
and moved up while not a menace. FASHION DIVA was along the inside through the turn and weakened in the drive. EMERSON'S DREAM never a factor
while saving ground. C F V TU BRUTUS chased the early pace into the turn, continued in the three or four path through the turn and steadily faded.
WRAPPINJUSTICE lunged at the start and spotted the field some fie lengths, raced in the three or four path through the turn and was never in it.
LIZZSAIDNO never a threat while racing in the three or four path through the turn. FARM SAFETY was outrun from along the inside.

Footnotes
SPA CITY was off with a slight hop and trailed the field into the first turn, raced in the five path through the turn and into the backstretch, continued well off
the inside into the far turn, moved up from the four path through late turn, bid four wide into the lane, caught the leader nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
drove clear through the final eighth. BAYOU CAT chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained the lead in
late turn, came into the lane from the two path, could not match strides with the winner through the final eighth but stayed on well to be clearly second best.
WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace while near the inside into the far turn, was no match for the top two straightening in the lane but kept on to regain the
distant show. CONTACT TRACING chased the pace from the inside into the turn and was losing ground through the lane. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK raced
in the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn, appeared to be a serious threat then flattened out after straightening in the lane. BYBEE was in the four to
three path through the turns and tired. TRUCULENT was outrun while in the two path through the turns.
