Footnotes
DARK HEDGES tracked up close through early stages, loomed a threat three wide at the quarter pole, vied outside of AABIAN STORY past the furlong
marker, shook free and edged away. ARABIAN STORY moved up the inside and took over the lead shortly after the start, set a pressured pace around the
turn, vied inside of DARK HEDGES in the lane, fought back past the furlong marker then had no closing kick left in reserve. GOT EVEN SMARTER raced in
range along the outside, angled in two wide late on the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared show. CROOKED FINGER RAY applied
pace pressure to ARABIAN STORY in early stages, remained in striking distance around the turn then gave way turning for home. MR. FIREBALL was not
far back early on, remained in range around the turn then weakened in the lane. OLYMPIC EXPRESS lacked speed, saved ground and had no response.
CATS BLAME got pulled up in the backstretch and vanned off after the race.

CHASING FAME took over the lead late on the backstretch, took clearer command at the head of the lane, stayed on gamely under strong handling and
held late. MCENTIRE was forwardly placed in opening stages, remained in contention around the turn, dug in gamely three to four wide through the lane
and was edging up on the winner in final strides. AUDACE raced near midpack, hustled up four wide into the lane and steadily edged up closer to the wire.
DON WITH THE WIND raced in range along the outside, was ridden along four wide into the lane and ran on evenly. FIRST CALL vied for the lead in
opening stages, lost the top spot but remained in striking distance around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, stayed on with response then gave way
approaching the final sixteenth. ENOUGH NONSENSE raced near mid-pack, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
BODEGA failed to move into contention. MANCUSO AT THE MIC raced three to four wide and never menaced. LINCHPIN STORM raced in range at the
half mile marker then steadily weakened. MY PAL raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
TEDDY TIME settled nicely off the early pace, remained patiently handled near the inside around the far turn, angled out four wide in the upper stretch,
given cue approaching the eighth pole, responded gamely and drove clear. DEWEY tracked the pace two wide through the backstretch, launched a three
wide bid heading into the lane, vied past the furlong marker, briefly held a slim lead then got overtaken by the winner. UPPER ROOM was unhurried, picked
up the pace around the far turn, responded under pressure in the lane, closed with response and got up for show. DEMERARA set a pressured pace
through the backstretch, remained on top through the far turn, vied for the lead at the head of the lane, battled back past the furlong marker then had
nothing left in late reserve. ANGELO'S PRIDE was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back, saved ground around the far turn, went two wide into the
lane and needed more for late impact. EMPEROR'S CHOICE stalked near the inside, bid along the rail around the far turn, vied past the eighth pole then
came up tired. SPIDER RICO raced in range through early stages then retreated. LIL LATIGO prompted the early pace then retreated late late on the far
turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
