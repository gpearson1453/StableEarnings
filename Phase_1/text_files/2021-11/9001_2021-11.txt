Footnotes
SPECIAL FREEDOM pressed the early pace while racing between rivals and finished well in the stretch run to be clear late under steady handling. SOME
IS NINE broke to the outside, bumped at the break, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, angled four wide in the drive and was no match for the winner.
RED PRIESTESS vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BROADWAY MELODY dropped back in the early stages,
moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. LA AITANA stalked the early going, raced four wide through the far turn and had
no late response. HEART OF SECRETS stumbled at the break, raced up close in the early stages and weakened in the stretch run. AMARETTO SOUR
was bumped at the break, raced near the inside and never was a factor. PERFECT SURVIVOR was slow early and never threatened.

Footnotes
HICKTOWN stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and just got up under all out pressure. CHICA RABIOSA showed
good early speed to set the early pace, raced off the inside in the drive, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. NO MORE MASK was forwardly placed
to lay up close in the early stages and had no final winning bid in the drive. MIZ THE BEST dropped back early on, raced towards the inside throughout and
made a mild late gain. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT stalked the early pace from the inside and weakened. HOLIDAY CONNECTION settled off the early
going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R stalked the early pace, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under
strong handling. INSPECTOR FROST tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, took command through the far turn, led inside the eighth pole
but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. LUXERO settled off the early pace, moved up four to five wide and closed in well in the
final stages. GRECIAN PHAROAH settled off the early pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled five wide through the lane and had not
enough in the drive. ONE TWO KID stalked the top pair down the backstretch and weakened while racing along the inside. FORE ON SEVEN was quick to
begin to set the pace from the outside and gave way the final eighth of a mile. STRAIGHT UP GUY raced up close early and failed to sustain a bid while
racing four deep. DR. FERBER was slow early, raced five wide into the upper lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WRITTENBYTHESTARS broke to the outside, bumped with rival, showed good early speed to set the pace while racing off the inside and held well in the
stretch run to be clear under steady pressure. PEARLYVILLE was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and
couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to finish second best. WILLOW'S CHARM stalked the early pace from the outside, raced three wide near
the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. TIPSY TOURIST raced up close early, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, continued to race along the
inside in the stretch and weakened. BAD TEMPER was squeezed back at the break, stalked the early going from the inside and had no rally. ALYS GREAT
NOTION was bumped and shuffled back at the break, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no response. BULLETS LADY was bumped at the
break, raced four wide around the far turn and never threatened. NINE MAST was off a step slow and raced far back.

the early leader, raced three wide and just missed in a game effort. GALATIANS stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole
while racing between rivals and finished gamely to the wire. RIPPOLINO settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the first turn, moved up five wide
into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. AL BROWN settled off the early going, raced towards the inside and had no rally. FERMAT was slow
in the early stages, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. TWITTY CITY raced five wide around the first turn, angled to the inside down
the backstretch, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and had no late response. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME failed to sustain a bid from the inside.

RADICAL RIGHT stalked the early pace, raced along the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out three to four through the stretch run and held to prevail under
strong handling. ROMINSKI was off slowly, settled to the back of the pack early, made a good advance towards the far turn, moved up five wide and
finished gamely late. SLAATS settled to the middle of the pack, raced three to two wide and showed good late interest. KENNER was forwardly placed to
lay up close early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. AL LOVES JOSIE showed good early speed to set the pace
along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GOLDEN AVIEATOR failed to sustain a bid. AMERICAN PLAYBOY dropped back early, was
injured past the eighth pole and had to be vanned off.

EXPECT THE SUNRISE tracked the early leader while racing three wide, moved well through the stretch run and edged clear late under steady handling.
CANDY CORNER showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside but couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to finish second
best. CELESTIAL DIVA stalked the early going, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, drifted a bit in the final stages and had not enough for the top
pair. ARBELA stalked early on, raced three wide through the far turn and had no late response. SCARLET'S SONG was forwardly placed early and tired
while racing four wide. EL MILAGRA hopped at the break, raced at the back of the pack early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
