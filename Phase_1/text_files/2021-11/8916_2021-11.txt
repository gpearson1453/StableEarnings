Footnotes
RIFEY was slow into stride and got shuffled early, came in and chased along the rail to the bend, angled three wide on the turn and into the stretch, came
out further in upper stretch, rallied from the outside and nailed inside rival on the wire. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER prominently placed from the outside early,
moved up on the turn, bid three deep and between rivals passing quarter marker, battled inside DONNER LAKE in the drive, gained advantage a sixteenth
out, inched away but could not stave off the winner. DONNER LAKE got shuffled between early, settled off the early leaders, made four wide move to join
leaders while four abreast from the outside passing quarter pole, reached front into the lane, inched away, lost lead nearing sixteenth marker and was
outfinished. PARTYOFSIXTEEN brushed with outside rival early, stalked from the inside, gained rail leaving the backstretch, remained inside and was along
late for minor award. IRONDALE dueled from along the fence to the turn, dueled on the bend, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. SELF
ISOLATION contested the pace while outside IRONDALE into the bend, gained advantage passing quarter marker from the two path and between foes,
relinquished control into the stretch and also weakened. VALIENTE brushed early with inside foe, stalked between, continued two then three wide to the
stretch and tired in the stretch. MASK OFF hesitated and broke inward to be off behind the field, chased inside, angled three wide on the turn then four wide
into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO was fractious in the gate, still stepped to the front to grab early control, was deftly rated through even fractions from the inside,
responded when challenged late on the last turn, re-established clear cushion and safely held under steady handling. KENNEBEC settled inside then came
off the rail early on the backstretch, saved ground chasing the pace, roused on last turn, rallied inside, was along for second in final yards and finished
strongly outside winner. STEAK AND CHEESE was closest pursuer into the backstretch, continued close up while bit off the rail, loomed outside leader a
quarter out, got no closer through the drive and lost second nearing the wire. OPTIMISTIC VALOR gained rail into clubhouse turn, tracked pace from the
inside, angled out exiting second turn and lacked needed late punch. BIG FLAME broke inward and lightly bumped rival, settled off pace, chased three wide
around both turns, came in some in the stretch and was no threat. CLUB CAL reserved from the inside, trailed while either on the rail or traveling on the two
path and never menaced.

Footnotes
POP POP'S DREAM off slow from the outside, unhurried while angling over early, chased from the inside, shifted out four wide passing quarter marker,
closed stoutly from the far outside and collared inside rival on the final jump. VIAZAR settled inside early, came out early on the backstretch, gradually
moved up three wide, joined leaders on second turn, reached front a quarter out, edged away and came in some, dug in later in the drive, drifted out under
left handed urging and was clipped on the wire. UNBREAKABLE received hard bump from inside foe leaving the gate, chased two then three wide into the
stretch while advancing, bid outside runner-up past eighth marker, was floated out a bit nearing the finish and narrowly from between rivals. TAYET broke in
and bumped foe, chased three wide to far turn, continued on same path into the stretch and went willingly to the wire. B'ESAME ME MUCHO was washy in
the post parade, forced the early pace, was between rivals past half-mile marker, dropped back late on the last turn and weakened. MALIBU HANNAH
bumped at the start, was three deep early then secured the rail, stalked inside, remained along the fence into the stretch and lacked needed late response.
READY JET GO was bumped sideways by outside rival at the start, recovered and stepped to the front, set pace to second turn, overtaken passing quarter
marker and weakened inside.

front at eighth pole, edged away while coming in some and safely held. SURELY SPECTACULAR chased while inside winner into and on the turn, entered
the stretch four wide, came in slightly through the drive and lasted for the place. UNFAITHFUL WAYS gained the inside early, hugged on the rail on the turn,
lacked room behind wall of rivals passing quarter marker, swung out four wide for room into the stretch, closed effectively from the outside and just missed
getting up for second. I'M A GIRAFFE was forwardly placed early, stalked two then three wide into the stretch, loomed passing eighth marker and finished
willingly from between rivals. ARTISAN DANCER had good early foot, padded cushion into and early on the turn, had that cushion dissolve around the
bend, was overtaken an eighth out but still continued willingly to the finish. PEARLS AND HEELS gained the rail early, moved up inside on the turn, awaited
room briefly late on the turn, continued inside and failed to product any late punch. MALIBUENA settled three wide and off the pace, chased four then five
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BIG MAMA THORNTON was off bit slow, rushed up inside to briefly pressure the leader, was taken off the fence
and later weakened. LASYA DANCE angled over early, dropped well back and never recovered from the inside.

BRISTOL BAYOU settled from well off the rail, moved up four wide on the turn then five wide entering the stretch, whittled gap on leader from the outside,
reached front a sixteenth from home and inched away under urging late. PROVOCATION advanced three then four wide on the turn, challenged three
abreast passing quarter marker, gained lead, edged away in the drive, was collared at sixteenth marker but comfortably held the place. STELLA NOIR
settled inside, was taken off the rail, chased two then three wide into the stretch and was along late for the show. EYES OPEN broke out, advanced
between rivals and off the rail into and around the turn, bid between foes nearing quarter marker, was inside runner-up in upper stretch but weakened late in
the drive. FOUNDER'S DAY suffered a mild shuffle then was reserved off the early pace, angled three, four then five wide to the stretch and failed to
menace late. HONOR AMERICA broke alertly and quickly sped to the front while crossing over, padded margin into the turn, was reeled in around the bend
and weakened from the inside later. SO VERY SMART stalked from the inside, moved up some while two wide into and early on the turn, lost contact with

decision on the wire. COLT FICTION forced the pace while three deep into the bend, moved up to challenge three abreast later on the bend, gained slim
advantage in upper stretch, fought outside POSITIVITY then inside PRINCIPE CARLO through the drive and just missed. NONE ABOVE THE LAW chased
from the inside while in hand, came off the fence leaving the turn and lacked needed late punch from the inside. PEACEFUL TRANSFER lightly bumped
with outside rival at the start, chased from between rivals then three wide to the stretch, drifted out some thru the drive and did not threaten late.
FASHIONABLY FAST set pressured pace from along the rail, resisted when challenged late on the turn, remained along the rail, relinquished command in

Footnotes
BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) content to chase from along the rail to the final bend, shifted out three wide into the stretch, rallied strongly collared leader
passing sixteenth marker and edged away in well-timed trip. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) was closest pursuer into the backstretch, whittled gap on leader on the
last bend, moved past that rival entering the stretch, edged away, was collared a sixteenth out but never threatened for second. FORBIDDEN (FR) brushed
early with outside rival, saved ground chasing the pace, continued two then three wide into the lane, came back in, rallied along the rail and gained third.
EVER SMART stepped to the front then moved well clear around the clubhouse turn, set uncontested pace to the final bend, had that margin disappear, lost
lead passing quarter marker then was caught late for third. TROUBLE MAKING chased from along the rail or on two path, awaited room behind rivals
nearing the stretch, roused when cleared but failed to threaten late. BUY AMERICAN was bit antsy in the gate, chased bit off the rail and outside winner to
the final turn, could not match that rival into the stretch and failed to menace. SUNNY MORNING (FR) brushed with inside rival shortly after the break,
settled inside, chased along the rail, swung out passing quarter marker but failed to make late impact. LAURA MARS (IRE) settled off the rail, chased three
wide to the final bend, shifted five wide departing that bend and also failed to threaten. FLORAL ESSENCE chased while outside rival, remained on two
path to the final turn, tipped out three then four wide into the stretch and lacked late punch. DREAM OF JEANNE settled inside, raced along the rail most of
the way, came out some in upper stretch and weakened. WASHINGTON SQUARE reserved early, gained the rail, chased inside to the stretch, swung out
and was never a factor.
