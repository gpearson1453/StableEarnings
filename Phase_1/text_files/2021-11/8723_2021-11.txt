GRAPHIC DETAIL three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
was up in the final jumps to prevail. TRIPLE ELVIS hustled from the gate showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from PROVOCATEUR
to the outside, dueled with that foe through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive
inching away inside the eighth pole under growing lone threat and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. DR. LEVY coaxed from the gate, raced four
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure
the show honors. PROVOCATEUR pressed the pace from the outside in the three path, advanced to duel with TRIPLE ELVIS through the turn widening
away from the rest placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide for home, dug in latched on to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late
stages. GUN MAESTRO chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BALLOT BOX chased
just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

that rival's inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive knocking heads through the final sixteenth with
PROPER GRAMMAR to her inside taking command with forty yards to go and was nailed on the line. PROPER GRAMMAR established the front just after
the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside briefly past the three-eighths pole before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch
set down for the drive, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat dueling inside the final sixteenth, got caught forty yards from home
and fought on to the finish to be along safe for the show honors. ADELE KAT just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and offered up a mild kick. APPRECIATE hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside, forced COOKIE

under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. LUCKY LATKES coaxed from the
start, chased three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three to four wide into upper stretch, made headway but was outkicked.
LOOKIN TO FLY chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and closed in through the stretch but it
was not enough to impact the top spots. CHEROKEE SONG coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and made no impact. HERALD ANGEL chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened. COOKIE COVE three then two wide in aim of the front, got forced to check
out between rivals just inside the half mile pole and lost three to four lengths of ground into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three

Footnotes
SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside safely clear through sensible splits, had the field take closer
order into the far turn and was given a notch to open up once more, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch under challenge, repelled that
rival edging away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and held well to the finish holding safe at the wire. SANCTUARY CITY just off the inside near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, closed well through the final furlong to threaten for it all rallying
willingly through to the finish but was ultimately staved off. CITY MAN coaxed from the gate, tracked the leader two to three wide from just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths advancing to challenge for the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, got repelled as the leader shook
away to the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. THERAPIST saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, CROSS BORDER steadied early
on out of the chute, tracked the pace along the inside coming under a ride at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered
no response. KLICKITAT tracked the leader along the inside in closest aim, tipped to the two path half a mile from home and advanced on the front coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when offering up a bid to nearly latch on, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened to the finish.

MISCHIEVOUS KISS three wide in pursuit from midpack, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced and swung four wide into upper stretch
set down for the drive taking over command straightened away, drifted in under a right handed crop to the rail when edging clear to the eighth pole, dug in
under lone threat and held gamely to prevail. CAIRONI away to an awkward beginning getting away last, saved ground near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing just off the inside near the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to threaten through the final sixteenth
but was ultimately rebuffed at the finish. KNEESNHIPS steadied after the start as rivals tucked over in front, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. OURAIKA (FR) tracked
the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on one paced to the finish. SHAD
NATION just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.
MISTHAVEN (IRE) three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over narrow and brief command spinning three wide
at the quarter pole, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. PHILLY EAGLES (IRE) just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside half
a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. EVANGELINE ALLONS coaxed from the gate,
prompted the leader from the two path between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. LADY
MILAGRO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits under pressure from a pair to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
WICKED FAST five then four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to duel
through the final furlong to the finish and got the nod on the wire. SPETTRO three wide in aim of the spurting leader, took over command and tucked inside
half a mile from home, showed the way through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and dueled through the final eighth to the finish but lost the bob on the line. UNINVITED GUEST six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and offered up a mild kick. HOOKY PLAYER three
then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
RVINDICATED four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. KINGHAM HILL four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing two to three wide at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. TOGA DANCER seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened in the late going. TIZ SNOW three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside
half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. NECROMANCER chased just
off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. UNCLE
WATER FLOW chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, made no impact, then walked off under
escort by outrider as the rider appeared injured after the race. IRIE SPICE five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three to four wide
through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. IN FACT hustled from the gate, showed the way
lightly coaxed along and was briefly challenged by SPETTRO before spurting off once more coaxed along, had that rival take over command half a mile
from home and chased along the inside, got checked when KINGHAM HILL took over the rail in front and retreated quickly angling out to spin eight to nine
wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish well behind.
