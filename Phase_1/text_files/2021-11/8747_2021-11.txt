Footnotes
SUMMANUS broke inwards a bit and was sent to set the pace from the two path, jumped shadows on the run into the turn, extended the lead along the turn
and headed for home under a hand ride. WELL CRAFTED had no early speed, mounted a bid while five wide on the turn and passed tiring foes to claim the
place. KEEP ON DANZING was off slow when SUMMANUS broke in at the start, was rank in the run into the turn, saved ground through the turn and
weakened in the late going. IKE BUTTE chased the winner through the turn while three wide and tired in the stretch run. COMMON CAUSE tracked the
pace from a four wide position and gave way in the late going.

LYRICALLY VIOLENT sat just off of the early pace while saving ground, swung out for the drive and made a bold kick in the stretch while on the left lead to
draw clear. KEEPINMYPROMISE stalked the pace while two wide between horses, was asked for run in the stretch but was outkicked in the late going.
DESERT FOG was away well and set quick fractions from the inside, had a clear lead into the final furlong but was collared by the winner and outfinished in
deep stretch. CLOCHARD STREET chased the early leaders from the rear, was two wide on the turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch. TICK TOCK
stalked the pace through the turn while three wide between horses and weakened in the late going. AFTER SUNDOWN chased the pace from a four wide
position and gave way in the stretch run. GARDEN IN THE SKY tracked the early leaders into the turn, did not handle the turn well and bore out leaving the
five-eighths marker and was eased in the stretch. THE HALF-MILE SPLIT TIME WAS 44.96.

LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) settled off of the early pace in the second flight, saved ground on the second turn, angled out for the drive, found his best stride
late and closed well in the stretch to just tag MY SUNSHINE on the wire for the win. MY SUNSHINE set moderate fractions while being prompted, had a
clear lead leaving the second turn, was under firm left-handed encouragement in the final sixteenth and was tagged on the wire for the win while clear of the
rest. GEE GEE WHIZ stalked the pace from the second flight, was three to four wide on the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch. BIG CITY
BANE stalked the pace while saving ground and weakened in the late stages. LINFIELD prompted the pace through the second turn from MY SUNSHINE,
was under a ride on the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
SATANTA settled in the second flight in the early stages, mounted a bid while five wide on the turn, quickly passed QUICK AND SILVER inside of the
furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. QUICK AND SILVER was away well and set the fractions from the inside, led into the stretch but was collared by
SATANTA inside of the eighth pole and was outkicked in deep stretch, while holding for second. ABERDEEN ISLAND prompted the pace into the turn while
three wide between foes and was outfinished in the stretch drive. KATZUMOTO took up soon after the start and was a bit rank in the early going, chased
the pace from the inside and flattened out in the drive. CAJUN BETTOR had no speed early, saved ground through the turn and did not rally in the stretch
drive. CONCUR was forwardly placed while four wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE had no early speed, was two wide on the
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TABLE FOR TEN was pinched at the start, settled near the rear of the field, improved position along the second turn while saving ground, angled out for the
drive, collared PAINT ME LUCKY inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the end. VANTAGE POINT pressed the pace through the second turn from
a three wide position, vied for the lead off of the turn but was outkicked by the winner while besting the rest. PAINT ME LUCKY was away well and set
reasonably quick fractions from a two wide position, led into the stretch but was overhauled by TABLE FOR TEN and tired in the late going. MOUNT
PELLIAR was pinballed at the start and was hustled to sit just off of the early pace, saved ground throughout and did not offer a late rally. TRASH TALKIN
CAT was forwardly placed through the second turn while four wide and gave way in the stretch run. SEAHAWK CODY stalked the pace through the first
turn, lost ground on the backstretch and weakened in the stretch. SPACE ODESSEY chased the pacesetter from the second flight, was three wide on the
second turn and faded in the stretch run.

START A RUNNIN was off well and set moderate fractions through the second turn while saving ground, was set down for the drive and was clear in the
end. KNOWN settled off of the early pace, improved position on the second turn while four wide and was outkicked in the stretch by the winner. CHOSEN
MOON prompted the pace through the second turn, steadied in tight quarters nearing the three-eighths marker and was outfinished in the stretch run. PURR
CAT made a middle move along the backstretch to form a trio tracking the pacesetter, saved ground on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch.
ORCZY (IRE) was away a step slowly and settled at the rear of the field, was three to four wide on the second turn, swung widest for the stretch drive and
made a mild late rally in the stretch. CONQUEST COBRA tracked the pace through the second turn from the three path and weakened in the stretch drive.
INVERTIGO was allowed to settle through the second turn while saving ground and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
FREEPORT JOE settled off of the early pace, mounted a bid while four wide on the second turn and sustained that long rally to vie for the lead inside of the
final furlong and held over an oncoming rival in the final strides. GALLANT WARREN settled near the rear of the field while saving ground, rallied along the
rail leaving the second turn and pressured the winner in the final strides but just missed while besting the rest. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) had no early speed,
saved ground through the backstretch, mounted a five wide bid on the second turn and was closing in the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair.
HANDR'SDREAM set quick fractions while saving ground, vied off of the second turn but gave way in the late going. MOHAWK KING (IRE) stalked the pace
through the second turn, lost a bit of ground leaving that turn and flattened out in the stretch. ROBBER BARON was forwardly placed through the second
turn while maintaining a three wide path and weakened in the stretch run. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS chased the pace from the inside and tired in the late
stages.

NAMORITA settled near the rear of the field early, improved position on the turn while advancing five wide, put away INDIAN DANCER inside of the furlong
marker and had a late kick to prevail. MISS SKI chased the pace from a three wide position on the turn, gained ground off of the turn and continued that run
in the stretch to close for second, just holding off an oncoming rival. WICKED SUNSET tracked the pace from the second flight while four wide, rallied in the
stretch and just missed for second while holding for the show. INDIAN DANCER attended to the pace by CHARGING HOME, mounted a three deep bid on
the turn to take the lead heading for home but was outfinished in deep stretch. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD had no early speed, mounted a rally from four wide
on the turn but was outkicked in the stretch run. DESERT SMOKE was forwardly placed through the turn, took up in tight quarters nearing the quarter-pole
and did not have a final kick in the stretch run. REGAL LADY chased the early pace from the second flight, checked on the run into the turn when she
glanced the inside rail, was steered out to four wide on the turn and finished willingly in the late going. COASTAL STARLITE was slow into stride and had no
early speed, was five wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch run. WELL DONE SALLY tracked the early pace from an inside position, was jostled
leaving the three-eighths marker and quickly lost ground and weakened in the stretch run. CHARGING HOME broke through the gate prior to the race, then
broke sharply and was sent to set the early pace from a two wide position, was confronted nearing the head of the lane and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SUMMER APPARITION settled just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn and closed in the stretch along the
rail to just get the head nod over the runner-up in a game win. GRIGORO set all of the pace through the second turn while two wide, was under strong
pressure in the stretch and was just nipped on the wire for the win while just holding for the place. BLUE BREEZE settled near the rear of the field in the
early going, was two wide on the second turn, rallied leaving the turn, split foes inside of the sixteenth pole and just missed for the win and place in a game
effort. MANGOTANGO pressed the pace through the second turn while three wide between foes and was outfinished by the top three in a blanket finish.
CAMEO SHORES was four wide on the first turn, continued to have a wide trip into the second turn while forwardly placed and weakened in the late going.
SUGAR KISSES settled in the second flight, was three to four wide on the second turn and did not offer a late kick in the stretch drive. INFO'S TREASURE
had her head turned at the start and was away slowly, trailed through the backstretch, was five wide on the second turn and did not have a late rally.
