SATANTA settled just off of the early pace, mounted a two wide bid on the turn, was four wide in upper stretch when collaring the tiring pacesetter and
kicked clear in the end. MCGEORGE had no early speed, was two wide on the turn, rallied leaving the bend and just won the nod for the place in the final
strides. EROTIC saved ground while stalking the pace through the turn, closed well in the stretch and just missed for second. HE BE MOJO RISIN was
hustled to set the early pace, was set down for the drive leaving the turn but was collared by the winner nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the late
going. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET tracked the pace through the turn while three wide and faded in the stretch run. RED HOT CAT stalked the pace while two
wide between foes on the turn and weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
DESERT SMOKE was away well and set the fractions through the turn while being pressured by REGAL LADY, was kept to task through the stretch and
held to prevail over oncoming rivals. MISS SKI stalked the pace from a three wide position on the turn, closed well in the stretch and pressured the winner in
the final stages, just missing for the win and holding for the place. BREAKING THE CODE sat just off of the early pace while saving ground in the two path,
was in tight leaving the turn and through the upper stretch, rallied in the late going and was up in time to claim the show. REGAL LADY pressed the early
pace from a two wide position, was still in contention leaving the turn but was outkicked in the stretch run. LYRICALLY VIOLENT stalked the pace from the
inside and was outfinished in the stretch drive. COASTAL STARLITE threw her head at the start and was away slowly, was four wide on the turn and was
not a factor. LACEY'S RAINBOW had no early speed, was three wide on the turn and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR was away well and set the fractions while rating nicely, extended the lead leaving the second turn, was headed inside of the furlong
marker by I WILL YEAH, re-rallied and gamely prevailed in the late going. I WILL YEAH (IRE) prompted the pace by MIKE OPERATOR, was three wide
between horses on the second turn, checked in tight quarters nearing the head of the stretch, closed well to confront MIKE OPERATOR inside of the furlong
marker but was turned away in the late going, while besting the rest. K P D DAY sat just off of the early fractions, saved ground through the second turn,
swung out for the stretch run and closed well to claim the show. MY SUNSHINE was forwardly placed through the second turn, mounted a four wide bid on
the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. GEE GEE WHIZ settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and lacked a
late kick in the drive. AGENT ZERO settled in the early stages while saving ground and lacked a late rally in the stretch.

MIMAJOON was away in good order and set the fractions through the turn while being prompted, extended the lead leaving the bend and was under mild
pressure in the end from her stablemate but held to prevail. UNCORKED was a bit slow leaving the break, chased from the rear through the turn while three

gained a bit of ground on MIMAJOON leaving the turn but was outfinished in the drive. BABY STEPS pressed the pace outside of rivals while three wide

that foe away and felt pressure from oncoming rivals in deep stretch but held to prevail. TABLE FOR TEN saved ground while sitting off of the pace through
the second turn, improved position leaving the second turn, closed well in the stretch to pressure the winner but could not reel him in and was up in time to
claim the place. LONG LANCE settled in the midflight while saving ground, closed well leaving the second turn and just missed for second.
ANITANEWMERCEDES prompted the pace by TED through the second turn, pressured that foe heading into the stretch but was turned away and was
outfinished in the late going. LOAFERS BOY settled at the rear of the field, was two wide on the second turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch.
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and lacked a late kick in the drive. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS
was four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace into the second turn from a three wide position and tired in the stretch run. SKY DINSKI stalked the pace
from the midflight, was two wide on the second turn, was rank and hard to place leaving the second turn and weakened in the late going. POUR ON THE

Footnotes
ELLAMIRA sat off of the dueling pacesetters through the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, was urged under firm handling in the lane and while
on the left lead held to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. CODE RIBBON was allowed to settle in the early going, made a four wide bid into the stretch,
closed well and was gaining on ELLAMIRA in the final stages but could not reel her in while besting the rest. SEN SEN settled off of the pace while two wide
on the turn, gained ground leaving the turn but was outfinished in the drive by the top two. I AM YOURS settled toward the rear while two wide on the turn,
gained ground leaving the bend and finished evenly in the stretch. TIZ A TIGER saved ground on the turn while sitting off of the pace and lacked a late kick
in the drive. GOLD RUSH GAL settled off of the early fractions, was three wide on the turn and was not a factor. SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH was hustled
leaving the start to set the pace, was pressed through the turn by ROYAL O'HAIGAIN, was collared nearing the head of the lane and was empty for the
stretch drive. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN pressed the pace through the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRINA was away alertly and set the fractions from a two wide path while being pressed by CROWN KITTEN, was pressured throughout the lane by several
rivals and gamely dug in to prevail. VRONILLA PARFAIT saved ground on the turn while tracking the pace, continued that rail trip through the stretch and
closed well to pressure the winner but was outfinished while holding for second. SWANEE stalked the pace from a four wide position on the turn, gained
ground leaving the turn and just missed for the place while holding for third. SING IN THE WIND had no early speed, was two wide on the turn, made a long
drive leaving the turn and was outkicked in the late stages. OYSTER SHOOTER sat off of the pace while three wide on the turn and closed willingly in the
stretch run. CASINO GAMES saved ground while unhurried early and made a mild late rally in the drive. MOMMY ROSE was four wide on the turn while off
of the pace and lacked a late kick in the stretch run. CROWN KITTEN pressed TRINA on the front end through the turn, gave ground entering the stretch
and tired in the drive. I LOVE ROMANCE was forwardly place to track the leaders from a three wide position and gave way in the late going.
