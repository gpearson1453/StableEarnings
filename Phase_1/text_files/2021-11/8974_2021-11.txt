Footnotes
NOTHINS FREE was away in good order, set the pace off of the inside, opened clear after the opening quarter, widened leaving the turn and scored as the
rider pleased. GLORY ROLL chased three deep, was unable to go on with the winner but continued on well to clearly prove the best of the rest. TEE UP
settled off of the inside, got through towards the rail into the stretch and finished willingly. DISTINCTLY BLUE was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch
six wide and improved position. CLEM GEM was unhurried while saving ground, got through every step, had the rider drop the crop inside the furlong
marker and failed to seriously threaten. TALE OF V K was forwardly placed along the inside through the turn and tired. MISS MIAMI contended three deep
for a half and faded. SUNDRENCHED was hung wide and failed to threaten. MAMBO DANCER was never a factor. MY BLONDE MARY showed little. Due
to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
TACTICAL RANGE attended the pace under a snug hold, advanced between rivals on the turn, angled in and caught KNIGHT SLEEPER nearing the
furlong marker, shook off that one and drew away. KNIGHT SLEEPER set the pressured pace outside, opened clear into the turn, was collared entering the
stretch, relinquished the lead a furlong out, was no match for the winner but continued on well to prove second best. TONE ELISE was allowed to settle,
looped into the stretch five wide and finished willingly for the minor award. MURUMBI stalked the pace, moved up three wide to make a mild bid, but
flattened in the drive. GOLDEN ROCKET was allowed to settle, came three wide and finished with a belated gain. BELLAVALENCIA failed to make
headway. BRASS BAND prompted the pace along the inside, but faltered midway through the turn and faded. MISS LADY L failed to respond. TIPHARAH
showed little. LOVERS NEVER SAY was through early, dropped well back and was distanced through the stretch.

Footnotes
MYSTIC DREAMS tracked the pace three deep in hand, came under a ride into the second turn, moved up swiftly to engage the leader, forged command
near the three-sixteenths pole, disposed of FAST FASHION and kicked clear. FAST FASHION opened clear to dictate terms, dug in to meet the challenge
of MYSTIC DREAMS leaving the second turn, was unable to go on with that one, but had enough left to preserve the runner up spot. RIVERCREST ROAD
settled in hand, took closer order off of the inside through the second turn, angled in and cut the corner into the stretch, tipped outside and was making up
ground. SPARKLING PLENTY chased outside FAST FASHION to the second turn, weakened between horses and faded. EXAGGERATED MOMENT was
allowed to settle, came three wide but lacked a response between rivals. LEFT OF CENTER was hustled along while never far back, but came up empty
after six furlongs and retreated. SHES SKY HIGH showed little. MAY BEAU saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MANGROVE MAMMA settled off of the inside, advanced between horses, quickened once uncovered inside the furlong marker and was up in the final
jump. PALMGIRL attended the pace three deep, launched a bold bid four wide, came to level terms leaving the turn, drifted in during the drive and snugged
up EMPEROR'S SONG near the furlong maker, edged clear thereafter and kicked on but was turned away in the shadow of the wire. EMPEROR'S SONG
stalked the pace toward the inside, made her bid between horses leaving the turn, was put in tight when PALMGIRL came in near the eighth pole and
steadied, was quickly back into stride and narrowly held the minor award. AUBURN was allowed to settle, moved with the winner through the turn, came
four wide and continued to make up ground. AUDREY was allowed to settle toward the inside, wheeled out five wide leaving the turn and made a belated
improvement. BELLARIFIC set the pressured pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong and gave in. PALIO SIENA prompted the pace
along the inside to the turn and succumbed. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE failed to respond. TAP TAP BIRDIE went wide and passed only the tiring ones.
SPECIAL INCLUSION showed little. WORKINONBEINSINGLE contested the pace outside for a half and dropped out. THE JOCKEY OF EMPEROR'S
SONG LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST PALMGIRL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FURLONG MARKER, BUT FOLLOWING THE
REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TWO STEPPIN KLUKI tracked in hand, launched a bold bid between horses, poked his head in front inside the furlong marker, dug in stubbornly and
proved narrowly best. BEAR CREEK settled at the tail of the field, came under a ride into the second turn, circled into the stretch five wide, drifted out
extremely wide in the stretch but was full of run and just missed. FARM BOY attended the pace along the inside, got through entering the stretch, fought on
but wasn't quite good enough. THOMOND PARK settled saving ground while never far back, advanced readily between horses on the second turn, worked
his way to the outside, loomed large entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. TOSS opened clear to dictate terms, was collared between
rivals leaving the second turn, fought on but grudgingly gave in. TAPSASIONAL was allowed to settle, moved up three wide on the second turn, angled in
entering the stretch, but faltered in the final furlong. SAUCY DEREK stalked the pace, offered a mild bid three wide, but came up empty between foes
entering the lane and faded. SALTIN' THE RIM broke a step slow and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CAJUN CASANOVA dueled with R MERCEDES BOY from the outset on the outside, was floated out leaving the turn, came together with that on inside the
three-sixteenths pole, fought on doggedly and gamely proved narrowly best. R MERCEDES BOY dueled toward the inside, drifted out a bit leaving the turn,
brushed with CAJUN CASANOVA entering the stretch, battled hard but grudgingly gave in. LIFE DON'T OWE YOU chased the dueling leaders three deep,
was unable to go on with the top two but stayed on to preserve the minor award. FIREMAN OSCAR broke inwardly, was away behind his field, settled
saving ground, got through but lacked the needed late response. RILEYS DUDE was unhurried into stride and failed to threaten. MY BOY LENNY bobbled
at the start, was quickly back into stride, moved into contention off of the inside, but was through after a half and retreated.

Footnotes
C'EST MARDI settled toward the inside, took closer order through the second turn, shifted out and came four wide into the stretch, reeled in the leader and
was inching away late. HOITY TOITY was caught in tight early, leveled into stride while saving ground, commenced her bid leaving the second turn, shifted
out and battled on between horses but was unable to match strides in the final yards. MORGAN'S Z VA attended the pace along the inside, inherited a clear
lead leaving the second turn, continued on well but was unable to resist the top two in the drive. STRONG GEM was unhurried, settled saving ground, got
through and was making up ground. STORMY D bobbled a bit and was pinched back at the start, was unhurried at the tail of the field, finished with a
belated improvement toward the inside but was left with too much to do. POSTINO'S IDOL stalked the pace outside, ranged up four wide to make her bid,
was carried out when PIONEEROF NEW YORK bore out leaving the second turn and lost her best chance. GO YEOWOMEN contended three wide to the
stretch and weakened. LIL HOOH'S HOOH settled between horses and lacked a response. SPIN CLASS was hustled along three wide while never far
back, but came up empty on the second turn and retreated. PIONEEROF NEW YORK broke slow, rushed to the lead on the outside, set the pace four wide,
but bore out leaving the second turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
GRAN RUNNER tucked in to save ground while shadowing the leader, launched his attack along the inside leaving the turn, struck the front entering the
stretch, shook off LITIGANT inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. LITIGANT was away in good order, set the pace off of the inside, was collared
leaving the turn, dug in to meet the challenge, but was unable to go on the the winner late. VICARAGE was allowed to settle, came under a ride entering the
turn, circled four wide and was just up to earn the show. MYSTIC LINK settled toward the inside, shifted out to make a mild bid, but lacked the needed late
response. CURLIN'S THRILL was unhurried, saving ground, got through and made a belated gain. JIMMY THE KID prompted the pace three wide, but
faltered between rivals entering the stretch and faded. TONY SMALL contended three wide for a half and dropped out. END ALL GET ALL was through
early.

Footnotes
FARCICAL was allowed to settle, came under a ride entering the second turn, made a sweeping move four wide, reeled in the leaders and was up in the
final yards. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL pulled clear to dictate terms, was collared entering the second turn, kicked away from that challenge, fought on through
a prolonged drive, but was nailed in the final yards. SYLLABUS was forwardly placed toward the inside, shifted out to launch her bid leaving the second
turn, but flattened and settled for the minor award. HURRY UP DEAR was allowed to settle, moved up three wide, continued on willingly and was making up
ground late. PASS THE SALSA settled saving ground, ranged into striking distance, offered a mild bid with a quarter to run, but failed to sustain the drive.
TAP SOLO tracked three wide, moved up to engage the leader with five-sixteenths to run, but came up empty thereafter and retreated. EMMA LIVE broke
slow, lagged well back, lost contact after six furlongs and was distanced through the lane.
