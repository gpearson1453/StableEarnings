REIGNING FIRE set the early pace, then vied inside on the backside, shook free on the far turn, responded when roused nearing the sixteenth marker and
held on well late to prevail. PARTY IN THE SAND raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the final furlong and dug
in gamely to the end. GALILEO'S AFFAIR tracked on the inside, advanced on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied between rivals in midstretch
and was outkicked. JOYCEE'S SPIRIT was fractious in the gate, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally in the lane.
FLORENCIA hesitated and was off slowly, raced five wide early, moved up outside to contest the pace, vied outside and weakened. SUPERLING stalked
three wide, chased three wide on the turn and gave way. SIDEREAL tracked between rivals, chased on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
PORTAL ONE took control inside, repelled a challenge on the turn then drew off again under moderate urging. FROSTED INDIAN saved ground early,
angled out on the turn and closed well. SPECTACULAR KID saved ground close up then flattened out in the stretch. DR ZRADA stalked the winner outside,
made a menacing bid on the turn then proved empty. STRUM AND PLUCK dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. RUN FAST steadied
along inside into the far turn and failed to recover. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD chased outside and weakened steadily. BAVARIA dropped well behind wide and
was never in contention.

Footnotes
HARD STING settled well back, moved powerfully to the front on the final turn and eagerly drew away while coasting home. GO HUSKIES saved ground
close up, angled out in the stretch and rallied for the place. DISTRACTANDATTACK prompted the pace outside and continued willingly. HERE'S WALDO
rated just off the leaders outside, moved wide into the stretch and flattened. LT. COLUMBO chased wide and lacked a rally. MUSK dropped far behind and
was never in contention. CALL ME G Q set a pressured pace inside rival then proved empty in the stretch. PETER G. FOX saved ground, stopped abruptly,
lost contact with his field and was eased through the stretch.

EL SOBREVIVIENTE vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, turned back a bid from BODEFLEX at the furlong marker and edged away for the win.
THE BIG BLUFF raced off the rail, off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and got second. BODEFLEX was off slowly,
advanced inside into contention, made a rail bid on the turn, then waited in a bit tight, rallied two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely past the furlong marker,
then weakened, held on for third and was vanned off. FAST BOB vied between rivals for the lead, then chased, weakened in the lane and missed for third.
