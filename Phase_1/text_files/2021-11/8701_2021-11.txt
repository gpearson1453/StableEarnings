Footnotes
BABY'S DIALED IN sent hard from the gate, gained a clear lead, was challenged through the turn and sprinted away, then drew off in the stretch and held
under steady pressure. SUNSPOT tracked the pace, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, then made a steady gain and edged up for the place late.
MEKANO stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one through the turn, couldn't match stride, then drifted in and weakened in the stretch.
CUPID'S DUDE allowed to settle, angled out and moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. GO
CRISTIAN allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, angled in and came through inside into the stretch and ran evenly. DRINKSONTHEBEACH
well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in and weakened. STORMY VICTORY was

SANDPIPER MEMORIES stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short lead into the stretch, then was challenged outside, turned back that bid, and drove
clear late. DRY HUMOR brushed the gate at the start, gained a striking position four wide through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then
could not match strides with that one late and held the place. ONLY TIME hard to rate inside, was forced to steady on heels through the first turn, gained
control inside through the second, angled four wide into the stretch and flattened out. FLECHE D'AMOUR mid pack and off the rail, dropped back through
the second turn, angled widest in the stretch and passed tiring rivals. THATAINT TOOSHABBY pulled and steadied along through the first turn, raced boxed
through the second, waited, angled out and came up empty. PAINTBRUSH well placed and three wide, faded through the second turn. BLAME THE VETS
rated on the lead, faded into the stretch inside.

Footnotes
GRANNY MAKES CENTS stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside that one, gaining
the lead into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. CATATUMBO bumped with LAST SECOND LOUIE at the start, allowed to settle,
saved ground through the turns, angled out four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. K. C. CHIEF sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. MILLENNIUM CONDO allowed to settle, saved ground on the two
path through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, angled out and got up for a share. SUMMER FIVE four wide through the first turn, gained
position three wide through the second, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened late. LAST SECOND LOUIE bumped with CATATUMBO at the start,
rated back early, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and weakened. HENRYTHETHIRD showed little, inside. SUN VIKING
broke in at the start, steadied along rank through the first turn, having to be taken wide, gained position three and four wide through the second, then had no
stretch rally. VOLTE FACE was never involved.
