Footnotes
MOREISBETTER took over the lead soon after the start and held firm over rivals around the turn, hustled up two wide into the lane, had plenty left in
reserve and remained clear. SUPAH SISTA tracked the pacesetter through early stages then launched an outside bid around the turn, remained in pursuit
three wide through the stretch run and finished second best. BLACKBERRY LISA got in tight and steadied mid-way through the backstretch, came under a
ride along the outside around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer and gained show. MY EXPRESSION was
forwardly placed sitting just off the leader leaving the backstretch, remained in close contention around the turn then flattened out in the lane. LA ROSA
DRIVE raced inside in range of the early leaders, cut the corner entering the lane then flattened out. SLEIGH RIDE raced off the early pace, was ridden
along five wide into the drive and lacked a needed rally. WINDI'S MOMENT raced in the back near the inside, angled out late on the backstretch, urged two
wide through the lane and failed to move on. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. THE TRAINER OF BLACKBERRY LISA LODGED A TRAINERS OBJECTION
AGAINST SUPAH SISTA FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE BACKSTRETCH, AFTER STEWARDS REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

NAUGHTY SWAGGER emerged on top soon after the start and held firm over pursuers around the turn, was set down three to four wide for the drive, dug
in on top under steady pressure and held late. LAUGHAROO hustled up three wide through the turn then came out five wide entering the lane, remained
game in pursuit of NAUGHTY SWAGGER and was inching up on rival in final strides. WRIGHT WINGED was ridden along four wide entering the turn, came
out six wide into the lane, sustained a steady stretch bid and steadily edged up closer to the wire. EVER VIGILANT steadied slightly near the three eighths
pole then hustled along while forwardly placed around the turn, came out four wide into the lane and flattened in the final furlong. SHARP MOVE was off
slow at the start, lost ground racing wide into the lane and gained some ground in final stages. OLD TOY chased two to three wide contention around the
turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. TICO TIME veered out at the start, lacked speed, raced in the back and never threatened. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS
was not too far back while ridden along the rail around the turn then faded in the lane. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

HEY NOW hustled up out of the gate and raced off the top pair entering the turn, was ridden along four wide turning for home, stayed on gamely through the
lane and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY vied inside of GATO SICILLIANO for the early lead, shook free midway around the turn,
came under a strong right handed drive in the upper stretch, stayed on with response but could not hold off the winner in late stages. THIRSTY KISS raced
in contention three to four wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and churned on for a share. MINNESOTA RED lacked early speed
and raced in the back, urged five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. ATTORNEY LOUIS weakened soon after the start, saved ground around the
turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. RIVER KAT was ridden along the outside off the early pace and failed to move into
contention. GATO SICILIANO vied outside of GODSGUNANCOUNTRY through early stages then faded late on the turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
BLAZINGBELLABLU tracked near mid-pack in early stages, picked up the pace mid-way around the turn, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane,
seized command past the furlong marker, stayed on gamely under strong handling and finished clear. ARIZONA SUN vied outside of HARKING for the early
lead, remained in striking distance around the turn, dug in gamely and moved back up to challenge three deep at the eighth pole, could not move on with the
winner but stayed on determinedly to clear second best. HARKING vied inside of ARIZONA SUN for the early lead, shook free to a slim lead at the quarter
pole, fought back when challenged in the upper stretch then had no late kick left in reserve. DANCE SHOES raced outside in the second flight leaving the
backstretch, hustled up four wide around the turn, got carried out six wide into the lane and offered no late bid. SHANGHAI KEELY raced in range chasing
the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the turn, spun out wider for the drive, shifted in under pressure and failed to kick on. NAT GIO raced off
the pace, urged four then three wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. SENORADIABLO raced off the pace near the inside, angled out, hustled up
three wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. ON DECK raced in or near the back, came wide into the lane and never threatened. EMPIRE
HOUSE chased the pace along the inside around the turn then quickly faded in the upper stretch. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
TEQUILA MARY saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, roused forward into striking distance at the eighth pole, dug in gamely
under strong handling and got up in final strides. SOMBRA NEGRA held a slim lead through early stages and held firm around the turn, battled back gamely
under pressure a furlong from home, stayed on determinedly but could not hold off the winner approaching the wire. MISTER MCLEAN raced in contention
near the inside around the turn, stayed on two wide and raced in striking distance at the eighth pole then evened out. C DUB was forwardly placed and
raced just off the leader around the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no late kick. SAVED BY ZERO urged along the outside around the turn,
came out five wide turning for home and lacked a needed rally. SIX NINETY ONE chased in range through early stages the weakened in the lane.
JOEJOE'S KINGDOM lacked speed, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
