the eighth pole, widened and was in hand for the final yards. AGELESS ENDEAVOR stalked the winner, chased on the turn, dug in gamely in the lane but
clearly second best. BERKS chased on the inside, saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch run. DADASHEV trailed the field, made a three
wide run on the turn and flattened out. FINNOGGINDUDE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MONOGRAM raced two wide off the pace, chased on
