Footnotes
MEASUREOFDEVOTION cleared quickly on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered stretch clear, roused and responded strongly to kick away
in upper stretch, and won well under mild drive. LUCKY MARY chased two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, in range entering the
stretch, proved no match for convincing winner while being a clear second. LIFE'S EMOTIONS tracked leaders along the inside on the backstretch,
continued along the inside entering the turn, eased out around rival on the turn, bid two wide in upper stretch and angled inside approaching the sixteenth,
kept on well to the wire to best the rest. SPEEDY LOU C chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued chasing on the turn and into the
stretch, weakened in upper stretch and just held fourth. ROSES FOR LIFE broke a tiny bit slow and settled off the rail in a stalking position, continued two
wide on the turn, made mild progress in the stretch, and just missed fourth. ANGELS RULE broke out and settled into a stalking position three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch widest and came up empty when asked.

Footnotes
JAY BOY sent to lead and cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered stretch clear and stayed clear under steady urging.
DAPPER sent to contest pace and had to settle into a chasing two wide position, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in range and battled
gamely to earn second. HE BE DANGEROUS chased inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, entered stretch inside and battled
gamely to miss second at the wire. CALIE VIEW tracked pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, and launched mild bid in the lane
three wide. DEPUTY GARY settled off the pace along the inside and failed to make an impact while trailing throughout.
