Footnotes
BIG MAMA SUE reserved in the early going on the inside, angled four wide on the second bend, bid alongside the leader with a furlong to go, dueled to the
wire and edged the runner-up. BIG CLARE was off slow, went three wide around the first turn, raced in range off the rail up the backstretch, crept closer and
loomed three wide leaving the second bend, surged to the front approaching the eight pole, dueled with BIG MAMA SUE in deep stretch and got outkicked.
TAMING THE TIGRESS broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked the pace along the rail, tipped two wide leaving the far turn, lacked room and tried
angled out but was hemmed in by rival, final found a clear path and finished willingly for the show. HOT ON THE TRAIL was off slow to begin, angled to the
two path, traveled outside a rival at the back, angled out on the second bend and came five wide into the lane and could not rally. WARRIOR'S MOON
stalked in the two path then went up to apply pressure in the middle stages, dueled two wide through the second bend, gained control in upper stretch but
was soon overtaken with a furlong to go and weakened in deep stretch. PISTACHIO PRINCESS got bumped from inside at the start, sped clear and moved
to the inside, took pressure on the backstretch, dueled along the rail through the far turn, lost command in upper stretch, got put in tight quarters at the eight
pole and faded.

Footnotes
WHO'S THE STAR was off slow to begin, settled off the pace, raced wide up the backstretch, advanced five wide outside rivals then angled down to the
three path taking aim at the leader, drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and got up. TODAY'S FLAVOR vied for the lead from inside then ceded the
lead on the first turn, moved up to take control nearing the five-sixteenths pole, led clear into the lane, resisted the challenge from WHO'S THE STAR in the
final furlong but succumbed to the pressure late. INVISIBLE WAR vied three deep early then ceded control and chased three then four wide on the first turn,
was drive three wide into the lane and held the show. SOY TAPATIO hopped and came away slow, went three wide on the first turn, remained off the rail
then steadied at the three-eighths marker, traveled four wide into the lane and never threatened. AMERICAN ADMIRAL stalked along the inside, tipped out
to the two path around the far turn and could not rally. DESERVEDLY vied four deep early then cleared and angled down to the two path on the first turn,
showed the way along the rail into the far turn, was overtaken at the five-sixteenths and faded in the drive. VETOED bobbled at the start, tracked two wide
early then between rivals on the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide, tired and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
VERBAL allowed to settle and raced outside a rival, moved out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair and drove past in the closing
moments. BARSABAS tracked near the inside, took aim two wide into the stretch, bid between in upper stretch, fought back inside CABO SPIRIT in deep
stretch and went gamely to the wire. CABO SPIRIT tracked the pace outside a rival, took closer order leaving the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide,
bid three deep in upper stretch and took a short lead, vied between foes in the final sixteenth and got outkicked. LOTTERY PICK dropped back and moved
to the two path then steered inside, tipped two wide with a quarter mile remaining and produced a mild rally under right-handed urging. OPTIMISING (IRE)
bobbled at the start, sat well off the pace early on, angled four wide leaving the second bend and needed to find more in deep stretch. DERECHO DANDY
also sat well off the pace, put to a ride past the quarter pole and angled to the rail, lacked room along the inside then steered out but got put in tight
midstretch and could not regain momentum. KHANTARO D'ORO traveled near the back off the inside, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and
failed to make an impact. STOTLAND off a bit slow in the beginning, tucked inside on the first turn at the back, trailed off the inside into the far turn, entered
the stretch three wide, came in near the furlong marker and failed to menace. GET BACK GOLDIE dueled outside early then ceded control to GROOVY
HUEY, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, headed rival and took over just past the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared around the far turn, showed the
way a bit off the rail into the drive and weakened. GROOVY HUEY went up to duel from inside before clearing around the first turn, set the pace up the
backstretch, relinquished command past the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the far turn, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
NEWGRANGE vied three deep up the backstretch, continued to battle between foes around the turn, cleared two wide into the stretch and stayed strong
under a drive to the wire. GOT THUNDER vied for the lead from inside into and around the bend, lost contact with the winner entering the stretch and
stayed on to secure the place honors. GODSEND raced in range from outside, navigated the turn five then four wide and finished evenly in deep stretch.
MOMENT OF PEACE chased four then three wide around the bend, angled to the inside in the stretch and lacked a bid. MO THEM DOWN was off a bit
slow to begin, steered outside the top trio, bid four deep on the turn, three deep leaving the bend and weakened. BLUE DOG vied for the lead between
rivals into and around the bend, started to weaken late on the turn and faded through the drive. SENSE OF DOMINANCE raced greenly early, saved ground
around the turn and failed to threaten.

HANDY DANDY broke quickly but outward and bothered CROSBY BEACH, settled into a stalking position on the inside, moved off the rail and came four
wide into the stretch, struck the front with a furlong remaining and drew away. CROSBY BEACH got bothered leaving the gate, was then hustled clear by
the rider and angled in, set all the pace to the stretch, was overtaken at the eight pole and held the place. DANCING RINCA fractious in the gate, settled
along the inside, was ridden along a bit off the rail into the stretch, tipped out with a furlong left and finished willingly for the show. FACETIOUS stalked the
pace in the two path, took aim three wide exiting the far turn and flattened out. LOOKOUT POINT veered in and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled in the
two path then moved out in the middle stages, came four wide into the lane and showed a mild response to improve placing. SUNDOWN WARREN
fractious in the gate, got bumped into rival at the start, pulled and checked early, raced at the back to the far turn, saved ground into the drive and failed to
threaten. WALL STREET TRADER got bumped from outside and shuffled at the start, hugged the rail into the lane, moved out a bit in the drive and lacked a
rally. MALIBU MAYHEM raced three wide then between rivals on the first turn, traveled near the back of the pack in the early going, coaxed two wide on the
final turn, moved out in the lane and weakened. BREAKFAST RIDE was forwardly placed three deep early, got bumped between foes past the
five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. TORAJIRO broke slow and was bothered at the start, traveled five wide into the turn
then angled to the three path, entered the stretch three wide and failed to menace. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) got bumped and stumbled leaving the gate,
pulled and checked soon after, went three to four wide around the first turn, traveled four deep into the second bend, exited the turn six wide and came up
empty. YOGI BOY got knocked into rival at the start, steady off heels into the first turn, chased three deep and got bumped midway around the far turn,

for the place. COSMO settled off the inside, exited the far turn four wide and improved position. BIG SCOTT DADDY tracked the pace from off the rail then
between foes, went two then three wide on the far turn and never threatened. PERFECTO AMOR stumbled a bit then got crowded shortly after, went up to
press the pace from between rivals, lost contact and chased the leader into the far turn, went two wide around the bend and weakened. NO HANG

Footnotes
REGAL GLORY sped clear and angled to the two path then three wide leaving the first turn, controlled the pace in the middle stages, showed the way two
wide into the lane and inched away under urging. ZOFELLE (IRE) stalked the pace outside a rival, took aim three wide into the stretch but failed to threaten
the winner in the final furlong while besting the rest. PRINCESS GRACE settled along the inside, waited for room on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the
stretch but got put in tight quarters and was forced to check, kept on through the final furlong and gained the show. VIADERA (GB) tracked the pacesetter
from between rivals, roused entering the stretch and got edged for the show honors. FAST JET COURT (BRZ) tracked three deep through both turns and
failed to respond when called upon. BODHICITTA (GB) stalked the leader on the inside, remained along the rail to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FOWLER BLUE vied three deep then between rivals on the backstretch, dueled on the inside through the turn, cleared leaving the bend, drew away in
upper stretch then shortened late but was able to hold. HEAVEN'S MUSIC stumbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail, three then to four wide on the turn,
closed in late and was gaining to the wire. VANISKY got bumped leaving the gate, went up to vie for the lead from inside, chased the top pair around the
turn and kept on to secure the show. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET broke out, lacked early speed, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend,
altered out around rival at the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a mild rally for a minor award. DADSTAR vied four then three deep up the backstretch,
dueled outside a rival around the turn, lost contact leaving the bend and gave way. MR BUG Z broke in and bumped rival, sent between rivals for the lead,
could not keep up past the half-mile pole and weakened. INDIO MO MO broke out, tracked the pace well off the rail outside a rival, went outside a pair of
rivals then four to five wide around the turn and came up empty.

TONY ANN stalked the pace on the inside then moved to the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, struck the front in upper stretch and held off
CHARGES DROPPED in the final sixteenth. CHARGES DROPPED tracked the pace on the inside, angled four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the
winner but could not find the needed late kick. ZYDECO MAMA went three wide into the first turn then angled four wide around the bend, bid outside the
leader at the half-mile pole, dueled into and around the far turn, held a short lead into the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and churned on for a clear
third. HOLLYWOOD GIRL settled inside, angled four to five wide into the stretch and needed to find more in the late stages. MET IN MIAMI broke slow from
the inside, remained along the rail then came two wide into the stretch and produced a mild rally. FROSE chased between rivals through the early stages,
got floated five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ROSE'S CRYSTAL angled to the two path early, raced outside rivals on the backstretch, swung seven
wide leaving the far turn, angled back in some in upper stretch and failed to make an impact. KLEEN KARMA was off slow to start, trailed off the rail, angled
five wide leaving the turn and came out further at the top of the stretch race widest and failed to threaten in the drive. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT traveled
three deep early, went three wide to the far turn, got floated out six wide leaving the bend and weakened. UNICORN was reserved off the rail in the early
going, moved out and traveled four deep on the backstretch, exited the far turn four to five wide and lacked further response. RESARCIO went two wide or
between rivals on the first turn, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane and was not a factor. SO MUCH HAPPY sprinted to
the front and opened up a large lead early, got challenged from outside at the half-mile pole, dueled from inside to the stretch and gave way.
