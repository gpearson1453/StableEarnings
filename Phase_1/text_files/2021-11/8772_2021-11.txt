CREATIVE LOVE trailed early, advanced inside, angled out in the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and bid clear. ARTEMIS RISING set a clear pace
along the inside then weakened in the final furlong. STARSHIP BLANCA saved ground just off the pace then flattened out late. QUEEN ABARRIO 'dropped
back outside and lacked a rally. CONNOISSEUR trailed on the turn then passed fading rivals. VISITING ANGEL was urged within range outside briefly then
faltered. SHE BROKE MY HEART prompted the pace between rivals and stopped abruptly.

HARD WEST controlled the pace inside and widened under confident handling with moderate urging. CIGAR BOX pursued the loose pacesetter outside
and finished gamely for the place. ASK CHUCK saved ground close up and continued willingly. WILD HAVEN broke slowly, trailed then passed fading
rivals. FARA'S KID lacked speed outside and was never in contention. KID MAC COOL raced close up three wide then gave way readily.

CRISTIANO'S DREAM alternated for the lead outside then edged away through the final eighth while kept to his task. VICTORY BUILT vied along the rail
and continued gamely to the finish. EXPLAIN bobbled slightly at the break, saved ground throughout and finished well. E T'S DEUCES WILD dueled
between rivals to the stretch and weakened. SAILOR AGAIN dropped far behind then offered some late energy. SAPONARA raced inside within range,
angled out in the stretch and faded. MOMMIE'S JEWEL prompted the pace wide to midway on the turn and faltered. FIELD OFFICER lacked speed and
raced wide throughout.

the pace to midway on the turn and faded. PRESTO CHANGE O dropped far back then passed rivals without menacing. INTERVENTION flashed brief
speed outside then gave way. POSSEINEFFECTTOO lagged far behind throughout. PURDA VITA saved ground within range then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DIAMOND SETTER settled behind the pacesetters, bid wide into the stretch, came in near midstretch and edged away. TACTICAL PLAN bid outside on the
final turn, was crowded near the eighth pole but continued willingly. SYNERGIZED set the pace off the rail, vied to midstretch, came out and tired. DIG
CHARLIE DIG lacked speed, advanced inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. ESPRESSO CALIENTE prompted the pace along the inside,
finished after five furlongs. MUCHO MAS GRANDE dropped back early and failed to menace. JONES TAXI raced outside and gave way readily. The
stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run and the rider of the second finisher claimed foul against the winner but the result was allowed to stand.

Footnotes
DAVIDIC LINE controlled the pace, widened on the final turn and remained well clear under moderate pressure. I AM REDEEMED angled to the two path
early, went after the winner on the final turn and made a gradual stretch gain. SOUND MONEY stalked leaders four wide, bid on the final turn then
weakened. OVER SENSUAL settled off the pace near the inside and continued willingly. THE JONES BOY dropped well behind, advanced wide and was
no threat. INSPIRED OPTIONS was urged between rivals down the backstretch and faltered. JAMMIN JIMTOWN saved ground, was asked for run into the
far turn but faded. AWESOME LAUNCH dropped far behind throughout. PRINCE CHAMP lagged far back and was never a factor. AERIAL ASSAULT
stopped abruptly and was not asked through the stretch.
