Footnotes
DEJOHN sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail the final five furlongs, opened up in mid stretch and dug in stubbornly under brisk encouragement.
PET'S NIGHT raced in the three path between horses on the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch and closed gamely outside the winner. JUST PICK
ONE hugged the inner rail on the turn, was taken to the three path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. BOSS IS A PAL prompted the pace outside the winner
and tired the final furlong. TRADITION raced in the two path on the turn, was fanned four wide entering the stretch, worked between horses and failed to be
a threat. BOLD TREK , caught in tight quarters at the break, raced in the three path between horses on the turn and lacked the necessary late response.
INJECT THE LIGHT lacked speed and was not a factor. COSA MAS LINDA chased the early pace while racing near the inner rail and gave way leaving the
turn. STREET PRAYER , very wide on the turn, gave way. ARTILLERY gave way and was eased late. PER RULING #22-009 FROM THE MARYLAND
RACING COMMISSION, DEJOHN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
LIDO LEGACY settled off the rail, edged up to be within range of a contested pace leaving the far turn, gathered stronger momentum four wide and under
asking entering the lane, shifted and sustained under right handed rousing to join the embattled leaders nearing the eighth pole, took over near the sixteenth
marker, shifted in some and drove clear. ZIPPY angled out leaving the chute and tracked an early battle three wide, moved to apply pressure leaving the far
turn, dueled between runners nearing the stretch, kept on to the inside of foes past the furlong grounds and continued gamely to the wire. MY MAN POTS N
PANS rated forwardly while well off the inside, bid four wide outside rivals departing the far turn, dueled and held a slim margin in upper stretch, clung to that
lead while under a drive past the furlong grounds but failed to hold in the final seventy yards. CLUBMAN broke a bit slow, moved up between runners near
the five eighths, tracked a three way scrum mid turn, altered out past mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on. TITAN'S WILL sparred outside a rival early
on then held a short lead into the far turn, battled inside rivals past the three eighths to upper stretch then faded. EVEN THUNDER dueled inside to the turn,
dropped back mid turn, angled out but came up empty. GO POKE THE BEAR failed to menace. UNEQUIVOCAL broke a step slow, pulled his forward while
saving some ground heading to the five eighths, angled out around the turn, circled five wide and gave way.

Footnotes
AL LOVES JOSIE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and lasted under brisk urging. SCRIPT lacked speed, altered course near
the five sixteenths pole, was three wide entering the turn, angled to the two path in the stretch and closed smartly between rivals. BACKNTHEWOODS , two
wide on the turn chasing the winner, drifted out a bit in the stretch and flattened out. OUTKISSED , three deep around the turn, floated out a bit in the
stretch, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and failed to rally. QUITE READY , in the two path mid way on the turn, altered course to the three path
approaching the stretch and failed to rally. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR broke well but soon dropped back, altered course to the four path near the five
sixteenths pole and failed to be a factor. PHRA PHROM , outrun, steadied leaving the turn, was distanced but did cross the finish line. BUST'EM KURT , a
forward factor along the inner rail, unseated his rider when sustaining a catastrophic injury approaching the stretch and was euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN prompted the pace two wide outside PROPER ATTIRE, moved to near even terms leaving the three eighths, spurted clear entering
the lane, responded and opened up when put to stout asking past the three sixteenths, kept on under left handed rousing past the sixteenth pole and proved
much the best as her rider struck a pose nearing the wire. MARGIE'S HEAVEN stalked a contested pace three wide, ranged up to loom near the quarter
pole, could not impact the winner heading to mid stretch, drifted in but stayed on willingly to hold down the place. MS HEADLEY had speed then dropped
back off the leaders heading towards the turn, eased out and chased, circled four wide into the lane and kept on with interest. MONEY FROMHEAVEN
dropped in near the half mile marker while outrun, eased out in the drive but failed to muster up a strong run. SHE ANSWERED broke a step slow, raced
three to four wide and failed to generate a rally. PROPER ATTIRE was rushed up to the inside of the winner and grabbed the early lead, set a pressured
pace, dueled past the five sixteenths, stayed on willingly to upper stretch then gave way. AULDWOOD LANE , sluggish from the gate, raced well wide past
the five sixteenths and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GYPSY'S IMAGE , four deep stalking the pace around the turn, bid for the lead outside EXPECT THE SUNRISE in mid stretch then drew out under steady
handling. EXPECT THE SUNRISE , three wide on the turn, gained the lead approaching the stretch and was no match for the winner in the drive.
PEARLYVILLE bumped with CELESTIAL DIVA at the start, raced four deep on the turn and failed to rally. CELESTIAL DIVA bumped with PEARLYVILLE at
the start, checked in tight quarters between PEARLYVILLE and BAD TEMPER approaching the quarter pole and finished willingly. BAD TEMPER moved up
in the two path between horses approaching the quarter pole and weakened. GOT A GOOD REASON lacked speed, raced outside horses in the stretch
and passed tired ones. STEELY BAND worked between horses on the turn and failed to rally. VANDY CANDY , wide on the turn, was not a factor. TOP
HAT BOSS hugged the inner rail and was checked near the five sixteenths pole. ALL THE WAY MAE was outrun. MI BELLA ANGELIQUE trailed. An
objection by the rider of CELESTIAL DIVA against PEARLYVILLE for alleged interference approaching the quarter pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
LOCAL MOTIVE , poised to strike while three wide leaving the backstretch and around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously in
the drive to prevail. BEAST OR FAMINE , not far off the early pace, circled the turn four deep and steadily gained outside the winner to just miss. NO SABE
NADA , patiently handled outside horses down the backstretch, was four wide on the turn, five deep entering the stretch, had aim on the lead in upper
stretch, remained on his left lead and flattened out. SLAATS hopped then bobbled leaving the starting gate to find himself well off the pace, angled to the six
path at the head of the stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. AMIDSHIPS showed speed along the inner rail, angled out for the drive, worked
between horses and faded. TOPS THE CHART , in the two path between horses, disputed the pace to the stretch then weakened. RUN TO DAYLIGHT ,
along the inner rail stalking the pace around the turn, gave way. CYNERGY'S STAR was a brief factor between horses for three furlongs.

Footnotes
MISS LESLIE settled off the pace and raced in the clear near the half mile marker, angled out soon after, advanced five wide outside rivals heading towards
the lane, sustained under stout left handed asking and took a narrow lead past mid stretch, edged away a bit then held firm while kept to steady handling.
LOOKIN DYNAMIC rated in range while off the inside, was patiently handled behind foes past the three eighths, swung six wide into the lane, ranged up
outside the winner in deep stretch and continued gamely to earn the place. VILLANELLE , sluggish from the gate, pulled her way forward while saving
ground into the backstretch and gained a tracking spot, awaited room around the final turn, got through along the rail past mid stretch and kept on with good
energy. ARTFUL SPLATTER settled well off the rail, steadily advanced into the far turn, took closer order four wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths,
steadied behind runners when hemmed in near mid stretch, shifted out but came up empty late. JOSIE tracked three wide, moved up to challenge between
runners past the five sixteenths, gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, could not fend off the outside threat by the winner leaving mid stretch then
faded. SCATRATTLEANDROLL , brushed at the break, stalked three wide, had some traffic mid way on the final turn, shifted out but lacked a serious kick.
OFF TOPIC prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, came under a ride past the five sixteenths when surrounded, failed to kick on and gave way
nearing mid stretch. SOSUA cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, handled pressure from the far turn, raced two wide dueling into the lane and
weakened. TROLLEY RIDE lagged back off the pace, swung wide for the drive but never fired.

Footnotes
ALOTTAHOPE hugged the inner rail stalking the pace around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, swept to command near the sixteenth pole and drew out.
HE GONE set the pace along the inner rail, opened up leaving the turn and was no match for the winner the final sixteenth of a mile. LANTAU , three deep
chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. CLAUDEE BOY , four deep leaving the turn, angled in and raced between horses in the stretch
and failed to be a factor. SLOE GIN BIZ , four deep on the turn, lacked a rally. DATHOSS , steadied after breaking slowly, raced along the inner rail on the
turn and was no menace. BOLD MEDICATION , unhurried down the backstretch, was very wide on the turn and lacked a rally. DEFENSIBLE lacked speed,
raced well off the rail and showed mild, late interest. STRAIGHT TIME , no factor, raced in the two path on the turn. APPEALING THOUGHTS was outrun.
SUNDAY MISCHIEF prompted the pace outside HE GONE and gave way. DONTFORGETTOBLINK bore out leaving the starting gate and was very wide
on the turn.
