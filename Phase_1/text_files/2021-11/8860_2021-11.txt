Footnotes
ON A WARPATH tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, drew off as an easy winner. ARIMONY set a pressured
early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out and finished second best. COURAGE N ORDER was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide into the
turn and was along for third. DESERT DANGER was unhurried early, raced between rivals and offered no late rally. BORTSTEIN was taken back early,
went five wide into the turn and never fired. HOLD ME ONLY was reserved early, went six wide into the turn and was no factor. DIGITAL STAR was void of
any speed, shifted out to the eight path and had no impact. GUNSLINGERS LEGACY raced in mid pack from between rivals and faded. HOOK EM pressed
the early pace and was finished early.
