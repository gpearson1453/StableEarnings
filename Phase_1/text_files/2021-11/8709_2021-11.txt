Footnotes
TRIPLE TAP settled well off the pace, went two wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, rallied from outside and drove clear in the final
sixteenth. SUMO attended the pace from outside, vied three deep around the turn, dueled outside VITTORIO in upper stretch, inched ahead and cleared
that rival in midstretch but yielded to the winner in the late stages. SILVER MOON ROAD raced between foes early then stalked outside a rival, went two
wide into the turn, eased out to the fourth path and finished willingly for the show. VITTORIO sped to the front while under pressure, vied for the lead
through the turn and into the stretch, dueled inside SUMO in upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. HEARTFULLOFSTARS dropped back early,
raced five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path and churned on to improve position. I'LL STAND TALLER stumbled badly at the start, saved
ground through the turn and made no impact. FRATELLI showed brief speed from inside, chased the top trio leaving the backstretch, traveled along the rail
then two wide into the lane, moved out and weakened. NOTRE DAME pressed then challenged between foes, vied between through the turn, could not
keep up into the furlong grounds and faded. RED VALOR raced up close early then dropped back off the pace, took the turn five wide and had little left for
the stretch.

Footnotes
ASTRONOMER got bumped from outside into the first turn, stalked behind the pacesetter on the inside, bid inside the top pair in upper stretch and
outkicked OPTIMISING in the final sixteenth. OPTIMISING (IRE) raced in range in the two path, outside a rival in middle stages, bid three wide into the lane,
took over in upper stretch but outkicked by the winner. DEGREE OF RISK off a bit slow to begin, moved to the rail, tracked inside then tipped out on the far
turn, went three deep and between rivals at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch, loomed in the lane, finished well but lacked the needed final
kick. BOISE broke out, settled near the back early, tipped three wide leaving the far turn, rallied and missed the show. NOBALS traveled in midpack outside
a rival, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong but failed to threaten. BIRTH OF COOL raced off the pace in the two
path, raced outside a pair of rivals at the seven-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. READY TO PURRFORM settled at the back
while moving to the inside, swung six wide into the stretch but failed to rally. DETROIT CITY cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the pace to the far
turn, challenged into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and gave way. THIRTY FOUR COUPE pulled, rank and bumped into the first turn, was closest
in pursuit outside the leader early on, chased two wide through the drive and weakened.

to engage her stablemate inside the three-sixteenths pole, wore down that one and kicked away in the final sixteenth. BIG NOVEL was forwardly placed
along the inside, slipped through and poked her head in front before going a half, controlled the tempo through the turn and into the lane, was collared
nearing the furlong marker, dug in but was unable to resist. VIVACIOUS VANESSA was allowed to settle, took closer order through the turn three deep,
failed to seriously menace the top two and was all out to earn the minor award. DRIZELLA tracked four wide, joined the vanguard on the outside midway
through the turn, was within striking distance to the lane and flattened. MADIHA settled saving ground, commenced an advance into the turn, checked in
tight near the three-eighths pole, put in a bit tight again entering the stretch and failed to threaten thereafter. BOLD CHOICE was unhurried at the tail of the
field, angled out leaving the turn but failed to make headway. VRONSKY FEINT vied for the lead three wide, came up empty between horses after a half
and retreated. IT'S SIMPLE disputed the pace off of the inside for the first quarter, then between foes through the turn and stopped.

bay. TIME LIMIT bumped with inner rival early, stalked between foes, exited the turn three wide, bumped with rival in upper stretch, bid outside A G INDY

quarters then came out in upper stretch, rallied and gained the show. AQUA SEAFORM SHAME bumped leaving the gate, chased on the inside, lacked
room behind rivals in upper stretch, angled to a clear path and kicked on to gain ground late. ANNA FANTASTIC got shuffled between rivals early, went
three wide into the lane, forced out in upper stretch and put in a mild late bid. LAGERTHA (CHI) pressed the pace from outside into the turn, kept the
pressure on then lost contact at the quarter pole, got bumped in upper stretch, put in tight quarters at the eighth pole and flattened out. SUPERSTITION
tracked three deep early, came four wide into the stretch, altered out in upper stretch and weakened. AMBASSADOR LUNA tracked four wide to the stretch
and came up empty. ANGELCENTS set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared with a quarter of a mile remaining, relinquished command past the

FINNEUS settled in hand, advanced four wide between foes, loomed four wide entering the stretch, reeled in the leaders inside the furlong marker and
edged clear. SLOW DOWN ANDY tracked four wide, came to level terms midway through the turn, fought on doggedly but was unable to resist the winner.
FAST DRAW MUNNINGS contested the pace outside to the turn, then between rivals to the stretch, weakened slightly following a prolonged drive and
settled for the show. SOCAL RED broke slow, lagged well back, came five wide and was making up ground late. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was bumped at
the start and slow into stride, circled five wide to make a mild bid, but flattened in the final furlong. LOVE CANDY was jostled between foes at the start, was
away behind his field, wheeled out six wide and finished with a belated improvement. I KNOW CASH FLOW bobbled at the start, recovered quickly and
moved up between runners, came three wide but faltered entering the stretch. MOOSE MITCHELL broke in bumping LOVE CANDY sharply at the start,
was straightened away and vied between horses to the stretch and tired. LIBERTY FOREVER settled saving ground, got through to make a mild bid but
came up empty in the drive. JOKER BOY attended the pace along the inside, shifted out three wide, but wilted entering the lane and faded. BANDERA
AZTECA was close up five wide for a half and dropped out. BILLY'S BET disputed the pace along the inside, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole and
stopped.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) set the pace under pressure in the early stages, dueled for command two wide on the turn, put away rival in upper stretch,
drifted out in the lane and held off the late bid from GO BEARS GO in the closing moments. GO BEARS GO (IRE) sat off the pace on the inside, moved off
the rail in the lane, rallied outside the winner but was too late. KAUFYMAKER chased between foes, came three wide into the lane, got floated out in the
drive and finished well for the show honors. DERRYNANE lost her path and checked early, dropped back to last, raced two wide then tipped out and
finished with late effort to earn a minor award. AVERLY JANE chased off the rail or outside a rival, went three wide into the lane, got floated out in the drive
and finished willingly. HIERARCHY (IRE) came away slow to begin, settled on the inside in hand, saved ground to the stretch, put in a mild rail bid but was
not enough. VERTIGINOUS (IRE) tracked between foes early on, exited the turn four wide, got floated widest in the stretch and kept on with a mild
response to asking. ARMOR (GB) sat off the pace outside a rival, went between foes at the quarter pole, waited for room in upper stretch, gained a clear
path but needed to find more late. ONE TIMER prompted the pace from outside, dueled around the turn, could not match strides approaching the eighth
pole, drifted in the lane and flattened late. TWILIGHT JET (IRE) chased along the inside to the stretch and weakened. TIME TO PARTY chased the top pair
outside rivals, got shuffled back on the turn, went three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RUN CURTIS RUN chased the speed from outside, raced
outside rivals on the turn, exited the turn five wide and had little left for the drive. RACE TIMES REVISED AFTER DATA REVIEW.

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU asserted command at once, tucked to set the pace, shrugged off the perfunctory attack leaving the second turn, and drew away to score with
something left. JUJU'S MAP tracked in hand three deep, came under a ride into the second turn, moved into striking distance entering the stretch, failed to
seriously menace ECHO ZULU and was all out to earn the runner up spot. TARABI was nearest the pace off of the inside, took her run at the winner leaving
the second turn, but weakened slightly and just failed to hold the place. HIDDEN CONNECTION bobbled at the start, pulled to contention between runners,
leveled into stride on the backstretch, but came up empty after six furlongs and gave way. SEQUIST lagged well back and failed to make headway.
DESERT DAWN settled saving ground, moved up some after a half, but was through after six furlongs and dropped out.

Footnotes
CORNICHE established command into the first turn, angled in to dictate terms, dug in to meet the challenge entering the stretch and gamely held sway.
PAPPACAP checked off heels into the first turn, settled into stride along the inside within striking distance, got through to make his bid, shifted out a bit but
was unable to bridge the gap. GIANT GAME settled in hand, ranged up four wide through the second turn, loomed large entering the stretch, but lacked the
needed late response. COMMANDPERFORMANCE stalked the pace three deep, was in striking distance to the final furlong, but weakened between rivals
in the drive. OVIATT CLASS off slow to begin, was unhurried along the inside, checked in tight leaving the seven-sixteenths pole, altered to the outside,
looped into the lane seven wide and was making up ground. PINEHURST chased off of the inside, continued on between runners through the second turn
to the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN SANCTUARY came away a step slow, was unhurried into stride, finished with a belated improvement but failed to
threaten. DOUBLE THUNDER settled well back, moved up four wide on the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive. BAROSSA was restless in the gate,
came away in good order, settled off of the pace, but lacked a response when called upon. JASPER GREAT broke a step slow, got put in tight down on the
inside shortly after and saved ground to no avail. TOUGH TO TAME was never a factor.

Footnotes
MODERN GAMES (IRE) broke slow to begin, stalked the pace from inside, steered four wide into the stretch, rallied under right-handed encouragement and
surged clear in deep stretch. TIZ THE BOMB got shuffled early then moved to the inside, urged along the rail on the far turn, angled out in the lane, rallied
between late and bested the rest. MACKINNON bumped leaving the gate, checked when put in tight early, pulled a bit nearing the first turn, traveled outside
a rival near the back, went three then four wide around the far turn and rallied to earn the show. GRAFTON STREET went three deep around the first turn,
moved closer up the backstretch, bid outside the top pair at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and faltered late. DAKOTA GOLD stalked on the
inside, angled out with three-sixteenths remaining, moved in a bit with a sixteenth to go and lacked the needed late punch. SLIPSTREAM steadied between
foes early, moved inside while off the pace, waited around the far turn, kept inside to the stretch, steered out in the drive, split foes in the lane but finished
evenly late. STOLEN BASE tracked between foes then came three wide into the lane, moved out further in the stretch but failed to make an impact.
PORTFOLIO COMPANY dueled inside a rival into the first turn, cleared around the bend, pressured leaving the backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals leaving
the far turn and weakened in the stretch run. COINAGE broke out, went to contest the pace from outside into the first turn then ceded control around that
bend, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch then applied pressure at the seven-sixteenths, vied between foes on the far turn and weakened in the lane.
DUBAWI LEGEND (IRE) broke out, angled down to the two path racing outside a rival, rated in the middle stages, went between foes leaving the
backstretch, came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. GREAT MAX (IRE) came away slow and bumped at the start, saved ground into
the stretch and never got involved. GLOUNTHAUNE (IRE) traveled between foes around the first turn, raced in mid-pack outside a rival up the backstretch,
moved out and came five wide into the lane and weakened. CREDIBILITY sat off the pace three deep, got floated six wide into the stretch and weakened.
MODERN GAMES (IRE) WAS SCRATCHED THEN FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' REVIEW WAS REINSTATED TO RUN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY.
