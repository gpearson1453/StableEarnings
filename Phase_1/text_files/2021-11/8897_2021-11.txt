Footnotes
ROYNE just off the pace three then two wide, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down
spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with ARUBA and WAR FIGHTER inside to take command a furlong out, dug in dueling to the finish
leaning out on ARUBA a sixteenth from home, then got leaned on nearing the finish as ARUBA came inwards and gamely got the bob to prevail. ARUBA
two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled until let out angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong engaging ROYNE in head to head combat and getting leaned on by that rival coming outwards a sixteenth from home, came
inwards in response leaning on his main rival nearing the finish while battling on and just missed at the end. EVERESTING established the front and spurted
away in hand along the inside, had the field at times take closer order and shook away in spurts while remaining in hand, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, got roused with about three-sixteenths to go, dug in under threat from a trio and was overwhelmed and collared a furlong out, kept on under a drive
to preserve the show honors. WAR FIGHTER tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, got steadied near the
quarter pole as MAGICAL MARRIAGE came in slightly at that station, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied to offer a bid a furlong out, then kept on to
miss for the show honors. MAGICAL MARRIAGE coaxed from the start, tracked just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came in slightly near the
quarter pole forcing WAR FIGHTER to steady in behind and in turn ABUNDANT HONOR to be taken hold of in behind that rival and altered out, spun three
wide for home, dug in and weakened in the late stages. DADDY FRANK (GB) brushed the near side stall at the start, settled just off the inside near the rear
of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. ABUNDANT HONOR saved ground in pursuit from
mid pack, got forced to steady and alter out near the quarter pole when WAR FIGHTER had MAGICAL MARRIAGE come inwards at that station, went three
then two wide for home and offered no kick. ENDOWED saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went five to six
wide into upper stretch and trailed. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of ARUBA alleging interference in the stretch
against ROYNE. After review the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official. RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

VEXEDNRELAXED was well rated on the inside to the quarter pole, eased out four wide to make bid leaving the turn, wore down rival late to get up in time,
driving. SOLID TUNE stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid to shake clear by the three sixteenths, ran on well but was caught late to be denied.
NO TIME ALONE chased the early pace three wide, was roused on the far turn, kept on but needed more. BELLESHAZZA was allowed to settle on the
inside, tipped out two wide leaving the turn, made a bid but needed more while just missing the show award. MASABEEH was settled early while three wide,
then was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and raced a little green, switched leads late to have a mild late kick. BOURBON
DIVERSION was settled early on the inside, eased out on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, shifted out by the furlong marker and had no
kick. DREAM STREAK was settle early while two wide and in between horses and had no rally. DIAMOND STATUS set the early pace and worked way
down to the inside and gave way. LOVE UNLIMITED steadied after the start, then was settled back early, was four wide by the quarter pole and lacked a
rally. NO NANNETTE NO had no response.

FORT WASHINGTON broke a beat slow when brushing the near side stall, tracked just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a trio and then a pair to get up in the last jumps to the wire. AL'S ROCKET just off
the pace along the inside, tipped two to three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied
and lugged in despite correction a furlong out forcing DR BROWNES MIRACLE to steady and SUL PHAROAH to pause, battled head to head with a pair to
his inside and then between foes late taking command nearest the finish but was nailed in the last jump to the wire. PARQUETRY tracked the pace along
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong seizing
command seventy yards from home, got headed near the finish and missed at the end fighting on inside a pair of rivals. BAJ coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was
collared seventy yards from home, then got outfinished in the very late stages. FORWARDLY three then two wide near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. PATHOLOGICAL bumped at the start by the
breaking inwards WINIT, chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. DR BROWNES MIRACLE got placed to a hard hold along the inside into the first turn when anticipating BAJ tucking directly in front and took to
the two path after that rival crossed over, tracked the pace briefly just off the inside before taking to the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, rallied and was forced to steady in tight when AL'S ROCKET lugged in a furlong from home, got
re-engaged by the rider and weakened in the late stages. SUL PHAROAH three then two wide in pursuit in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and paused when weakening a furlong out when in tight due to AL'S ROCKET
lugging in, then continued to back away to the finish. KING OF HOLLYWOOD coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. WINIT broke in at the start bumping PATHOLOGICAL, chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. UNCLE WATER FLOW chased along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. RESILIENT COURAGE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
LIFE IS GREAT broke in at the start brushing SKY AND SAND, raced forwardly placed three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to take command
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive to prevail. SKY AND SAND brushed at the start by LIFE IS
GREAT who broke inwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid and
was along second best. MATT DOYLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages while along clear for the show honors. OUTPERFORM four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. ANSEL got
bumped at the start in a chain of bumps begun by DADS GOOD RUNNER, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home and weakened. PICCADILLY shied in at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for
home and tired. MAIN EVENT five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. LABARDE got bumped between foes at the start and was squeezed back and steadied due to
pressure from DADS GOOD RUNNER veering in at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. ICONIC ADVENTURE chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch
and folded. FAZARO got bumped and pinched at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. STANNIS saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. DADS GOOD RUNNER veered in at the start bumping LABARDE solidly into FAZARO
and in turn ANSEL, forcing the middle pair to steady when squeezed back, showed the way lightly coaxed along in the two path, tucked inside through the
turn, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
UNIQUE UNIONS vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid leaving the quarter pole and dropped down to the inside, drew out in the drive to prove
much the best under a drive. HOT ROD RUMBLE stalked the pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, finished willingly while proving to be
no match to the winner while clearly second best. THRILL OF IT stalked the pace five wide and came up empty in the drive, held on late to the show award.
CAVE MAN took a few steps to get into stride, then was sent up between rivals to chase the pace three wide, lacked the needed stretch id while just missing
the show award. ALWAYS CHARMING was settled back early, then was five wide by the quarter pole and passed the tiring rivals. RAW COURAGE was
outrun early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and improved position late. BOSSHIP was reserved early, was three wide by the quarter pole and
lacked a solid rally. CATCHING CUPID vied for the early lead on the inside and fell back on the turn, shifted out by the three sixteenths and weakened.
CLASH A. J. showed brief speed, then weakened on the inside on the turn. MY LAST MISSION vied for the early lead between horses, then stopped in the
drive.
