Footnotes
RIVER REWARDS RVF angled in to give chase, raced at the rail on the turn, angled out to take over between horses mid-stretch and drew away the final
yards. SWISS HORIZON gave early chase toward the outside, contested at a close disadvantage in the three path of the turn then dueled for second inside
the sixteenth pole. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE angled to the inside while setting a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was
caught mid-stretch then yielded second inside the sixteenth pole. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, was eased out toward
the head of the lane and finished evenly. COOK THE BOOKS gave chase inside then flattened past the eighth pole. DAFFYDILL gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little more. VICTORY ROYALE gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the three path and
finished well. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL hesitated at the start and dropped well back.

Footnotes
JESSICA stalked toward the inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead at the rail midway on the far turn, raced clear toward the head of
the lane and was steadily handled in the stretch. MORALITY CLAUSE settled back inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and ran in the five path on the
far turn, steadily improved to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. HETTY G. broke awkwardly and made contact with Lady Kaza, settled
off the pace in the four path on the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, raced evenly to
mid-stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. PETES PRIDE settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, was carried outward
toward the head of the lane then flattened the final furlong. LADY KAZA was bumped lightly at the break then accelerated to the lead while angling to the
inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught off the rail midway on the far turn, drifted out toward the head of
the lane and flattened stride. UPSY DAISY DO rounded the opening turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, then weakened into the far turn. LAVELLO rated just off the pace and off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded
into the far turn.

Footnotes
MOSBY'S RANGER stumbled at the break then pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced close two deep on the turn and took the lead into the
stretch, dueled clear past the sixteenth pole and held on. WILLIE THE WHALE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path, dueled
from the head of the lane to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner. GUNTER broke awkwardly then pressured the pace toward the inside,
raced at the rail on the turn, factored close through the upper stretch then flattened later yards. TRUTH SERUM gave chase, rounded the turn in the four
and five paths and finished well to pass rivals. ROMANOFF gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly down the
lane. VICTORIOUS BEAR was hustled up to set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, gave up the nod into the lane and raced
close to mid-stretch before weakening. CHURCH OF MANY chased from the start, steadied in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole then weakened while
drifting on the turn. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT gave only distant chase outside then carried out on the turn.

PEARLY GHOST stalked off the rail then challenged at the three eighths pole, took the nod leaving the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep on the
far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. BAYS CASTLE rated just off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take second the final yards. MOIRAINE took the lead nearing the
three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths, gave up the nod past the five sixteenths, contested at
a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride. BONNIE BLUETOOTH saved ground, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening. JULES RULES rated close off the
rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened past the five sixteenths. SOOEY'S PRINCESS raced well off the pace in the three and four
paths and showed little response through the backstretch. LOVETHEONEYOUGOT settled back about the three path on the first turn and showed little
response. IN TO THE NIGHT saved ground.

ISHIHARA settled back off the rail on the first turn, moved to the front past the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge two deep on the far turn, then
dug in under determined handling to hold off the game stretch effort of IRISH MEADOW, who saved ground off the eary pace, was hemmed in at the seven
sixteenths pole then bid toward the three eighths, steadily gained in the three path of the far turn and dueled gamely to the wire. BOP MARLEY raced well
back from early contention about the three path then eased outward into the backstretch, bid at the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five
and six paths and dueled for third mid-stretch. SPUNMAN settled back in the three path then stalked four wide into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced close in the four path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground racing well back, bid toward

Footnotes
THE IRON BANK raced well back in the four path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the four path of the far
turn, angled six wide into the stretch and dug in to take over the final strides. ON THE LAM settled just off the pace two deep the first turn then eased out
into the backstretch, started a four wide bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and dueled to a slim brief lead inside the
sixteenth pole, but was caught in the final strides. HAPPY CHAMP rated close inside the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and contested at a slim
disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn, flattened stride late yards but held the nod for third. FLAT RATE stalked two deep while
between horses on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn,
flattened later yards and missed the nod for third. LINDA'S NEKIA saved ground well off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, was blocked at
the rail from the mid point of the far turn to mid-stretch, but finished well when clear. BARRY KARAFIN BETS rated a short lead inside, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. JACOB T
raced well back about the four path the first turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch and showed little response. GOLDEN ANSWER stalked three
wide the first turn, showed no response leaving the three eighths pole and was eased through the final quarter.
