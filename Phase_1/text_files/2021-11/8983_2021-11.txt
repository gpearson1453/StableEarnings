Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TRIP was urged along into stride while off of the pace early on, rallied four wide around the turn, bumped an inner foe while claiming place
entering the lane, ranged up to the tiring leader in midstretch, and drove clear. ENOUGH HEART stalked along the inside, bumped an outer rival while
entering the lane before committing to a rail rally, but was outkicked by an outer bidding foe in the process, then chased that rival home to claim place
approaching the final sixteenth. STAR PRADO took the turn in the five path while well off of the pace, and rallied willingly outside of foes through the lane.
FLASHY SASSY pulled clear early on, stayed in the three path around the turn while given rein, but began to tire in upper stretch, was headed at the furlong
pole, and weakened between horses shortly after. TEMPLE QUEST tracked along the inside, moved two wide and between horses turning for home, but
was jostled among those rivals entering the lane, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, the chased from between horses thereafter. LUCKY HARBORAGE
broke a step slowly, trailed the field around the turn, steadily drifted five to seven wide in the final furlong, and moved up late. SONG OF PARADISE tracked
from midpack three to two wide and between horses into the turn, but faded. ALLSTAR MAGIC broke a step slowly, tracked between horses early on, but
steadied from tight quarters at the half mile pole, then saved ground, but to no avail. LITTLE TATOR TOT tracked from midpack four wide, but faded around
the turn. MISSBUDLITELIME stalked two wide, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC SIGN stalked while shifting four to three wide around the first turn, pressed the pace setter into the backstretch, ranged up outside of that foe to
bid at the five sixteenths pole while staying a path away, forged an advantage after switching to his right lead at the three sixteenths pole, then drove clear
passing the furlong grounds. THE GREEN MO'STER set the pace inside of a moderately pressing MAJESTIC SIGN, dug in to resist that foe's bid at the five
sixteenths pole, but was headed at the three sixteenths marker, gave way at the furlong grounds, and safely held place. ALFONS WALDE (IRE) trailed,
rallied two to three wide around the far turn before tipping four wide entering the lane, then willingly sustained his advanced outside of foes to claim show at
the sixteenth pole. CONVICT PIKE bumped an inner foe into the first turn while achieving a two wide stalking position, but failed to progress while chasing
behind the leaders in upper stretch, and failed to keep pace through the final furlong. INDY TOURIST was pinched between horses into the first turn and
was unable to achieve forward early position, saved ground off of the pace around the turns, but faded turning for home. NOBRAG JUSTFACT bumped an
outer foe into the first turn while stalking from the pocket, but lacked a kick to split the leaders in upper stretch, chased, and faded.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN LIAISON prompted the pace three to two wide, bid turning for home before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, then drew off in upper
stretch, and safely held sway through the final furlong. SHE'S GONE D'WILD was bumped by an inner foe before taking back from crowded quarters
between horses at the start, trailed the field, gained four wide around the turn, to bid for place at the three sixteenths pole outside of MISS NITAP, chased
the clear leader while battling with that rival for place through midstretch, then edged away from that foe a sixteenth out. MISS NITAP broke outwardly and
bumped a foe at the start, vied along the inside of a pair of rivals early on, stalked from the pocket around the turn, tipped two to three wide in upper stretch
to bid for place inside of SHE'S GONE D'WILD at the three sixteenths pole, dueled with that foe while chasing the clear leader, but lost that battle for place
at the sixteenth pole. DANCE AWAY tracked along the inside, but was tentative to move between horses into the turn, checked mildly at the seven
sixteenths pole, trailed the field around the bend, shifted five wide at the three sixteenths pole, and improved outside of foes late. SIENNA BREEZE vied two
wide early on, cleared an inner foe into the turn while feeling stern pressure from SOUTHERN LIAISON, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and
gave way inside of rivals in upper stretch. THE COMPLETE COURT lost her hind footing at the start, recovered to track the pace four wide, stalked three
wide around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN TANK cleared off into the first turn, widened his advantage into the far bend, held sway under driving pressure into midstretch before the rider
checked for competition, noticed a chasing MORE THAN WORK in the process, then tired in the late stages as that foe drew closer, but lasted to the wire.
MORE THAN WORK bumped the gate before bumping an inner foe at the start, vied early on before allowing RUSSIAN TANK to clear off, stalked outside
of that foe from multiple lengths off down the backstretch, chased that rival through upper stretch while greenly shying inwardly from right handed pressure,
but picked up stride in midstretch, closed in on the clear leader late, but ran out of ground, and missed. WARRIOR JOHNY tracked from midpack in the four
to three paths around the turns, then stayed on through the final furlong to reach show late. MAZUMA bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked three
wide, ranged up to bid for place outside of MORE THAN WORK entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, and lost show late.
HOLIDAY HOUSE stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid while chasing into midstretch, and faded. BEAU NOIR (IRE) hesitated at the start and
trailed the field early on, took the far turn three wide before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. FREEDOM'S WAY stumbled at
the start, then saved ground far off of the pace before moving up in upper stretch. OVERANALYTICAL saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
BENISSIMO turned his head to the right just before the gates opened and was unprepared for the start, broke slowly and laid at the rear of the filed in the
three path around the first turn, took the far turn in the four path before shifting six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. INBOUND was
bumped by an outer foe at the start, settled far off of the pace two to three wide, shifted five wide at the quarter pole, but failed to factor. BROKEN RIB
tracked from midpack along the inside, raced keenly in the two path around the first turn, sustained that position around the far bend, but weakened in
midstretch. ALEBRIJE laid off of the pace two wide, checked mildly between horses around the first turn, then failed to factor. HARMON KILLER BREW was
visibly sweating pre-race, then was bumped by an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace three to two wide, but weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
DREAM ON IT prompted the pace three wide, bid turning for home before leading entering the lane, drew off under her own power in upper stretch, was
driven at the furlong grounds to stay on task, then was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. DROP DEAD SEXY showed the way two wide while feeling
pressure from rivals on either side, but offered little resistance for her outer counterpart at the quarter pole, quickly proved no match, but sustained stride to
fight on for place in upper stretch, then edged away from chasing rivals on either side in the final furlong to secure that position. BUCKLEY BUNNY chased
from midpack two wide while under steady urging aimed to split foes approaching the three sixteenths pole to bid for place, but had that narrow hole close at
that marker, altered course outwardly a path, but only produced a mild kick through the closing stages. SUNSHINE STAR broke outwardly and bumped a
foe at the start, pressed the pace inside of the leading pair, stalked those foes around the turn, then vied for place along the inside in upper stretch before
tiring. CHARGED TEMP gained mildly from off of the pace in the four path turning for home, but flattened out in midstretch. STRONG CHICK laid off of the
pace along the inside, and never got involved. IRON BANNER was reluctant to load, then got outrun two wide. AVERI EVER AFTER got bumped by an
inner foe at the start, and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
ANOTHER MYSTERY saved ground off of the pace, advanced along the rail turning for home, tipped outside of the leading pair at the three sixteenths pole,
chased approaching midstretch before progressing in the final furlong to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged an advantage in the closing stages. PIXELATE
stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home to bid for the lead outside of FORTY UNDER at the quarter pole, forged an advantage at the
furlong pole as ANOTHER MYSTERY gave chase, flopped back to his left lead when challenged by that foe at the sixteenth pole, and was bested in the late
stages. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) took back from tight quarter between horses soon after the start, trailed the field around both turns before picking up stride
along the inside in upper stretch, altered four wide at the furlong grounds, grinded away while hanging on his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, but
changed over at that junction, and finished up evenly. FORTY UNDER broke through the gate, set the pace inside of a pressing PIRATE'S PUNCH, inched
clear of that foe turning for home before meeting PIXELATE's bid at the quarter pole, battled gamely through upper stretch, but yielded to that rival passing
the furlong pole. MUTAKATIF (IRE) settled off of the pace two wide, attempted to gain three wide around the far turn before shifting to the six path in upper
stretch, and moved up in the final furlong. LOGICAL MYTH stalked the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with leading foes
entering the lane, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but continued to fade through the final furlong. BIG AGENDA was brushed by an outer foe at the start,
stalked the pace three wide, but was outkicked by an inner foe while getting floated four wide entering the lane, and weakened. PIRATE'S PUNCH broke
inwardly and brushed a rival at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
COM' ON SWEET LUV had her hind quarters knocked from underneath her soon after the start, recovered to stalk the pace two wide, bid outside of
SPEEDOMETER into the turn, forged an advantage while well in hand passing the five sixteenths pole, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway safely from
an inner chasing ELLE OF THE BALL to the wire. ELLE OF THE BALL stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, shifted inside of
a clear COM'ON SWEET LUV at the furlong grounds, but only managed to chase that foe home and proved second best. CARNELIAN broke outwardly and
bumped an outer foe into other rivals at the start, settled off of the pace, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied mildly to reach show passing the
furlong pole. OCEAN SIZE was bumped by an inner foe and forced outwardly into other rivals at the start, tracked along the inside into the turn, shifted four
wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally to produce a bid. SPEEDOMETER sped clear early on, met COM' ON SWEET LUV's bid at the three furlong pole,
was headed passing the five sixteenths, and weekend in upper stretch. MELVIN was pinched back between horses at the start, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
PINE KNOLL stalked four to three wide around the first turn, inched closer to vie at the five furlong pole, shifted two wide while forging an advantage into the
far turn, drew off in upper stretch from a bidding BARLEEWON, remained clear through the furlong grounds before meeting TAKAFUMI (BRZ)'s bid a
sixteenth out, but held gamely. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) was reluctant to load, achieved two wide stalking position passing the wire for the first time, shifted outside
of the leaders entering the lane, took aim on a clear PINE KNOLL in midstretch, grinded away while hanging on his left lead to bid at the sixteenth pole, but
hung. EL SOCIO bumped an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, faltered to trail the field into the far turn, swung eight wide in upper stretch
while still at the rear, but rallied well outside of foes through the final furlong to reach show late. BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) stalked along the inside, but was
shuffled behind a tiring BEAUREGARD into the far turn, tipped three wide at the three furlong pole, got floated five wide entering the lane, but only managed
to chase the leaders thereafter, and lost show in the late stages. RONITHELIMODRIVER broke a step slowly at the start, settled at the rear while caught
four wide around the first turn, gained noticeably five wide around the far turn, got floated six wide entering the lane, but leveled off while shifting inwardly
approaching midstretch, and stayed on. MASTER OF THE RING settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted from the two to three path around the far
turn before tipping to the six path in upper stretch, and improved. BARLEEWON tracked from the three path around the first turn, improved to a stalking
position, intently bid for the lead outside of IPNE KNOLL at the three furlong pole, vied turning for home, but faltered in upper stretch. COURAGEOUSLY
bumped outer rivals at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, took the far turn four wide, but failed to mount a rally among rivals through the lane. FEVER
TEMPLE was bumped between horses at the start, settled at the rear two wide, and never got involved. FULL DINNER JACKET bobbled before being
pinched back between horses at the start, pulled outside of foes around the first turn to a stalking position into the backstretch, pressed the pace before
chasing around the far turn, and weakened turning for home. BEAUREGARD set the pace while tucking down from the three path around the first turn, but
failed to keep pace with outer rivals at the half mile pole, and faded around the far turn. FILIPPO vied two wide, cleared an inner foe at the half mile pole
while vying inside of the eventual winner, but was headed by that foe into the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. LEROY JENKINS broke a step
slowly, laid at the rear three wide, swung to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
BEHEMAH STAR broke outwardly, chased from midpack two wide and between horses, rallied between horses approaching midstretch to bid inside of the
leader passing the furlong pole, and kicked clear. CHROMPTON tracked the pace three wide, pressed into the turn, but was outkicked by an inner foe in
midstretch, chased thereafter, and reached the tiring early pace setter for place in the late stages. BIG BRASS MONKEY rushed after a step slow start to
set the pace, showed the way two wide around the turn, maintained a margin between horses entering the lane, but was headed by an inner bidding foe at
the furlong pole, tired, and lost place late. TOTALLY ADDICTED trailed early on, tracked the pace three wide around the turn, split foes four wide entering
the lane while attempting a rally, but only managed to chase evenly through the final furlong. SCHNELL chased along the inside, but failed to keep pace
with the leaders while shifting tow wide in upper stretch, then kept on. BITSY'S CUSTOM C stalked three wide, decisively bid for the lead inside of the pace
setter into the far turn, vied turning for home, but gave way in upper stretch. BOURBON ST TAPPIN failed to factor. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU laid off of the
pace four wide, ranged up turning for home, but faltered when floated five wide at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
A G'S CHARLOTTE tracked the leaders from the two path, tipped three wide to take aim on a bidding BELEOUT in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the
sixteenth pole, and edged an advantage late. BELEOUT stalked the leader from the three path, bid entering the lane, lugged inwardly and across that foe's
path while clearing at the furlong grounds, dug in to meet A G'S CHARLOTTE's bid at the sixteenth pole, but was bested. ISN'T IT TIME hesitated
significantly at the start, race far off of the pace three wide into the turn, tipped four wide in midstretch, and rallied willingly. MOMENT TO DREAM sped
clear, showed the way while in hand and in the two path around the turn, but was headed by an outer foe in upper stretch, failed to keep pace at the furlong
pole, altered course outwardly when his outer counterpart crossed over while clearing at that junction, then continued to fade thereafter. TENSAS VIRGINIA
stalked along the inside, chased through upper stretch before fading. I'D BE RICH failed to factor. SUPER ET saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
BODE'S CONNECTION broke a step slowly and never got involved. LA FEME JOLIE chased along the inside, but folded into the turn. THE RIDER OF
MOMENT TO DREAM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BELEOUT FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION,
AS WELL A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE MATTER, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
