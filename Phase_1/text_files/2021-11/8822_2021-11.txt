Footnotes
AMANDA ROSE dueled for pace duties through the turn with MARANDO PASS, continued to duel with that foe into the lane, put her away inside of the final
sixteenth and felt mild pressure in the end from the runner-up but held to prevail. SAVAGE LOVE veered in at the start and chased the early fractions while
three wide on the turn, angled out for the drive and was closing late, put pressure on the winner but could not reel her in while besting the rest. MARANDO
PASS dueled on the front end with AMANDA ROSE from a ground saving position, continued that duel into the final furlong but relented and was outfinished
by the top pair while clear of the rest. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ chased the early pace from a three wide position and weakened in the stretch run. CHELINA
veered in at the start, was outrun in the early going and was not a factor. BALI BRAVA tracked the dueling pacesetters from a three wide position and faded
in the stretch drive.

the final sixteenth to get by STATEFOREST and prevail. STATEFOREST set moderately quick fractions from a ground saving position, had a clear lead into
the stretch but was confronted by JUSTA POPPIN inside of the final furlong and was outfinished while besting the rest. BOLD ARTICLE stalked the pace
from a three wide position through the second turn and finished evenly in the late going. MALIBU JEWEL hopped at the start and was allowed to settle at
the rear through the second turn, gained ground leaving the second turn but was outkicked in deep stretch. KERRALIA chased the pacesetter through the
second turn, stopped on the run leaving the second turn, was eased and walked off under her own power.

close on the winner but could not reel her in while besting the rest. ASCENDANCY settled off of the early pace, gained ground while four wide on the turn
but was outfinished by the top pair. CHIVALRYISNOTDEAD tracked the early pace from a three wide path and weakened in the stretch drive. FILLY PELLI

Footnotes
SMILING SPIRIT was content to settle in the early going, mounted a rally while two to three wide on the turn, drifted out significantly nearing the
three-sixteenths marker, closed on BIG PASSION in the final sixteenth and had a late push to get by that foe to prevail. BIG PASSION stalked the early
pace from a two wide position, mounted a bid along the turn to take the lead and led into the final sixteenth but was tagged on the wire by SMILING SPIRIT
while well clear of the rest. WINE AT SUNSET was hustled from the break and set the pace from a three wide position, was confronted by BIG PASSION
leaving the turn and weakened in the late going. BLUEGRASS SKY sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn, was bumped by ABSOLUTE
SCENES when SMILING SPIRIT drifted out leaving the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) chased the leaders from
the rear while four wide, was bumped sharply when SMILING SPIRIT drifted out leaving the turn and did not rally in the late stages. LADY MOHICAN
chased the early pace from the inside and tired in the stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN THE UPPER
STRETCH AND DETERMINED THAT #6 SMILING SPIRIT DRIFTED OUT INTO THE PATH OF #5 ABSOLUTE SCENES, CAUSING ABSOLUTE
SCENES TO THEN BUMP #4 BLUEGRASS SKY, AND COST BOTH RUNNERS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, SMILING SPIRIT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FIFTH.

COUNTRY DUDE was away well and set the fractions through the turn from a two wide path, had a clear lead into the lane but felt pressure late from the
runner-up and held to prevail in a drive. ARTEMUS GORDON stalked the early pace from an inside position, was boxed in in tight quarters along the turn,
closed well leaving the turn and pressured the winner in the final stages but could not reel him in while besting the rest. NORTH SEA tracked the early pace
while three wide between foes and was outfinished in the stretch run. C J EXPRESS had no early speed, rallied along the turn while three to four wide but
was outkicked in the stretch drive. COMMISSIONER DAVID chased the early pace while saving ground, was outrun on the turn and passed tiring foes in the
stretch drive. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was off slowly, was hustled to stalk the pace through the turn but did not offer a late rally in the stretch. ONE LAST
THOUGHT tracked the pace through the turn while four wide and gave way in the stretch run.

DR PESCADO stalked the early quick fractions from a two wide position on the turn, confronted STANFORD BAY inside of the furlong marker, dueled with
that stubborn foe and determinedly kept on to prevail. STANFORD BAY was away well and set quick fractions from a ground saving position, was
confronted by the winner inside of the final furlong, battled back and was stubborn in the final stages but could not hold off DR PESCADO for the win, while
holding for the place. C'MON MAN was unhurried in the early going, saved ground along the turn while mounting a sustained bid, was closing in the stretch
but was outfinished by the top pair. HIGHLAND GHOST chased the early pace from a four wide path and did not have a final kick in the stretch run.
NORTHVALE ROAD tracked the early pace while five wide on the turn and faded in the late going.

HEAT SEEKING LETA was allowed to settle through the turn while traveling in the three path, improved position leaving the turn and surged in the final
sixteenth to nip CONCISE ADVICE on the line for the win. CONCISE ADVICE tracked the pace from an inside position, put away the pacesetter inside of
the furlong marker, led into the final stages but was nipped on the wire for the win while holding for second over an oncoming rival. SOJOURNER TRUTH
stalked the pace from the inside, closed well in the stretch and just missed for the win and place. JAN JAN CAN settled toward the rear of the field while
saving ground, gained leaving the turn but was outfinished in the stretch run. THUNDER WOMAN set the fractions through the turn while being prompted by
CONCISE ADVICE, was collared by that foe leaving the turn and tired in the late going. AROUSE N GO stalked the pace from a four wide path and gave
way in the stretch. BRITE TAN stalked the pace through the turn while three wide and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) stalked the pace through the second turn, mounted a bid while four wide into the stretch, put away ROBIE inside of the furlong
marker and pulled away in the late going. ROBIE attended to the pace from a three wide position, took the lead heading into the lane but was quickly
passed by the winner inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked while besting the rest. RULER OF ANGELS steadied while in tight quarters on the first
turn, stalked the pace through the second turn while two wide and was outfinished in the stretch run. RICH WARRIOR set the pace through the second turn
while being prompted by ROBIE, relinquished the lead to that foe off of the second turn and gave way in the drive. SARLAT settled near the rear of the field,
was three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late rally. SUGAR BEETS was forwardly placed through the backstretch while saving ground, lost
ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. PLATONIC pulled on the rider in the run into the first turn, was four wide on the first turn, was
five wide on the second turn and tired in the late stages. TALISKER BAY was unhurried in the early going, saved ground throughout and was not a factor.
