Footnotes
WMA BIG BABY stalked the early pace, raced four to three wide in the stretch run and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. RB BLAIR HOPE
was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced in tight quarters as the leader came in a path near the sixteenth pole and kept on willingly to the wire.
Jockey of RB BLAIR HOPE claimed objection against the winner for the interference near the sixteenth pole and stewards ruled no change. JHESSABELL
stalked the early pace, checked sharply nearing the quarter pole, raced two to three deep in the lane and had not enough for the top pair. RB
FASSYNATOR was off slowly, rushed from the inside to set the early pace and tired the final eighth of a mile. RB MUNCHIE stalked the early going, raced
four deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. KD DERBY GIRL raced up close early and tired while racing three wide. SOUTHERN
BELL MHF dropped back early and failed to respond. DANCE WITH ME MHF was slow early, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a
factor. FATA MORGANA MHF raced far back and never threatened.
