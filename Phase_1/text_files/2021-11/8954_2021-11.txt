Footnotes
MELTING SNOW settled off the speed and moved inside, tipped out leaving the turn, rallied and drew alongside the runner-up inside the sixteenth pole and
proved best late. SWEET SOULMATE chased the leader outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, bid from outside around the bend and took the lead
exiting the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch but got run down late by the winner. I'M THE BOSS OF ME showed speed along the rail and made a clear
lead, challenged by SWEET SOULMATE on the turn, relinquished the lead leaving the bend and stayed on to secure the show. MUCHA WOMAN away
quickly from the gate, chased the pacesetter to the turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN tracked the pace off the rail,
went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked the pace in the two path, bid three deep at the quarter pole, fought with MISS COSTA RICA in the late stages and inched
ahead to prove best. MISS COSTA RICA sped to the front from inside, set a pressured pace on the backstretch, fought with rivals on the last turn, resisted
to deep stretch but yielded to the winner in the end. CIDER APPLE (GB) unhurried early on and moved inside, angled three wide on the second bend and
finished willingly while unable to make an impact on the top pair. NAZUNA (IRE) tracked the top pair in the two path, moved closer but lacked room with a
quarter mile left, remained inside to the lane and lacked the needed late kick. LUBNA (GB) came away awkwardly at the start, raced four wide entering the
stretch first time around, went up to prompt the pace from outside and weakened in the lane. ZEYARAAT bumped leaving the gate, trailed two wide into the
lane and proved no menace. WARRENS CANDY GIRL got bumped and squeezed back at the start, pulled early first time through the stretch, tucked inside
on the clubhouse turn, moved off the rail and raced three then four wide on the far turn and was never a factor. IDA CLAIRE came away a bit slow, pulled
early and on the the clubhouse turn, tracked three deep on the backstretch, angled five wide leaving the final turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
NORMA JEAN B. raced off the rail early then angled in first time through the stretch, traveled in mid-pack on the backstretch moved a bit off the rail, tipped
out and raced three to four wide into the stretch, rallied from outside and gained the lead with a sixteenth to go and drew clear late. GLOBAL BRAND angled
to the inside early while trailing at the back, saved ground through the turns, angled out in the stretch and rallied for the place. QUEEN GODDESS raced
three wide around the first turn, bid three deep at the quarter pole, reached the front in upper stretch, lost command with a sixteenth remaining and got
edged for the place. KUORA (PER) got bumped at the start, traveled along the inside from off the pace, entered the lane two wide, steered out in the drive
and put in a mild late bid for a minor award. IVY LEAGUE got bumped on both sides in the beginning, settled off the pace outside a rival, angled five wide
leaving the far turn and improved position. CORDIALITY broke in and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, met bids on
the far turn, held command into the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and flattened out. PULPIT RIDER bumped with rival exiting the chute, went three
wide around the first turn, traveled outside rival in the middle stages, exited the far turn four wide and lacked a rally. DISAPPEARING ACT bumped with rival
exiting the chute, tracked the pace from inside, came under a ride on the second bend, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. FREEDOM FLYER was closest in pursuit in the two path, bid outside the leader then between foes leaving the final turn and weakened down the
lane. BACCHANALIA rated early in the two path, came three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
WIN OFTEN away quickly from outside then took a stalking position three deep, challenged three deep around the turn, cleared in upper stretch and held off
the runner-up. BELLA RENELLA dropped back early, raced three deep at the three-eighths pole, exited the bend four wide, rallied outside the winner but
lacked the needed late punch. FLAT OUT JOY tracked the path into the turn, eased out a bit and entered the stretch three to four wide and was along for
the show. MAJESTIC GIGI sped to the front in the two path, vied with rivals on the turn, could not kick on with the winner approaching the furlong grounds
and weakened. MORNING ADDICTION raced up close to the inside of the pacesetter, lost ground through the turn and weakened in the lane. ROYAL
BLEND broke well then dropped back off the pace, trailed into the turn, saved ground near the rail and was not a factor. ELGOFRANCO was forwardly
placed between foes, applied pressured between foes into the turn, could not keep up with the top pair around the bend, tired in the drive, bled and walked
off.

Footnotes
NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) sped to the front and angled to the inside, gained company on the backstretch, dueled with NICEST (IRE) around the final turn,
maintained a short lead through the stretch run and held gamely to the wire. LUCK reserved in the two path early, loomed three then four wide leaving the
last turn, rallied outside the top pair in the drive and could not get by the winner. NICEST (IRE) stalked the leader in the two path, drew alongside on the
backstretch, dueled on the outside on the final turn, battled down the lane and got outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch. ENGLAND'S ROSE reserved in
the early going on or a bit off the rail, moved out and went three wide around the clubhouse turn, eased out on the final turn and came four wide into the
drive and finished willingly to whittle the gap and gain a minor reward late. SINGLE SOUL (GB) was rank briefly early then angled to the rail on the first turn,
tracked the pace from inside, moved back to the two path on the final turn, steered out in the stretch and needed to find more in deep stretch.

Footnotes
CON ON THE RUN broke alertly and took the lead, dueled with THE KEY IS UNITY to the turn, cleared that rival just past the five-sixteenths pole, then
drew off under some right-handed urging and steady handling. KATONAH was forwardly placed outside a pair of rivals, exited the turn four wide, could not
threaten the winner in the furlong grounds but was clearly second best. KING APOLLO got bumped leaving the gate, chased between foes then angled out
in upper stretch and kept on to earn the show. EL POTENTE chased four deep early, three wide around the turn and weakened. THE KEY IS UNITY broke
in and bumped rival, went up to duel for command from inside, lost contact with five-sixteenths remaining and weakened. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT was off a
bit slow to begin, lagged far behind early, traveled five then four wide on the turn and was not a factor. HANNIGAN broke out and was quickly corrected,
tracked off the rail, went four deep into the turn, five wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. BIG SWEDE was bothered and forced in a bit at the
start, chased along the inside, lost ground around the turn, moved out in the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
OFFLEE NAUGHTY steadied early on the first turn, angled out then back in around that turn, raced off the pace, went between foes on the backstretch,
angled out and was driven four wide into the stretch, rallied to the front and cleared briefly late and held on. TROPICAL TERROR checked off heels early,
tracked inside and tugged a bit, chased two wide into the lane, lacked room from upper to midstretch, angled out with a sixteenth to go, closed well but was
too late. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE stalked the pace from inside then moved into the two path, steered out a bit further on the backstretch, lost ground around
the last turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied for the show. JIMMY P traveled near the back of the pack two wide then a bit off the rail, got floated
out with a sixteenth to go and missed the show. FIRST PREMIO was the closest pursuer from the two path early on, moved up to apply pressure on the
backstretch, vied between foes nearing the final turn, battled to the lane, gained command in upper stretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. K P ALL
SYSTEMS GO reserved early from inside, angled out on the clubhouse turn, bid four deep at the seven-sixteenths marker, vied three deep on the final turn,
fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. BURNIN TURF off alertly to take control, crossed over to the inside, got pressure on the backstretch, vied into
and around the far turn, held command into the stretch, lost the lead at the eighth pole and flattened out. BIG BUZZ traveled near the back of the pack in the
early stages, raced three wide around the clubhouse turn, moved out wider on the backstretch, put in a mild bid five deep at the half-mile pole, could not
keep up into the final turn, dropped back around the bend and tired. BEROLIJEAN (FR) tracked from off the rail, came six wide into the lane and was not a
factor.
