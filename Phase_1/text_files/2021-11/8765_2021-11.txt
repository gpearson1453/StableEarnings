Footnotes
PAPER BOY rated off the early pacesetters then headed in pursuit around the turn, moved up three deep to challenge at the head of the lane, vied into final
furlong then seized command and finished going away. ROLL OUT tracked the top two leaders then moved up three wide to engage rivals midway around
the turn, vied two wide to the eighth pole then failed to move on with the winner. THE KOHEN vied inside of MUSKEYMAN for the early lead, battled back
around the turn, took on the added challenge of the eventual winner at the head of the lane, dueled in a bit tight along the rail to the furlong marker then
gave way. GRANDPA A. C. raced inside then angled out entering the turn, came five wide turning for home, chased two to three wide through the lane and
never threatened. ESTEEMED was ridden along off the early pace, came two to three wide into the drive and had no response. MI MALDITO AMOR raced
in the back, was ridden along five wide into the lane and never menaced. MUSKYMAN vied outside of rival THE KOHAN through early stages then faded
midway around the turn. Hand timed.

CATS TOUCH grabbed the lead at the start and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, vied inside of ZORICH around the far turn, shook free
turning for home and widened advantage through the stretch under right handed pressure. ZORICH prompted the pace around the first turn and continued
to force the issue through the backstretch, vied outside of CATS TOUCH around the far turn, could not move on with winner turning for home but stayed on
with response and cleared second best. PRIVATE JOKE raced four wide around the first turn then settled off the early pace, headed in pursuit around the
far turn, sustained a steady inside bid through the lane and stayed on for a share. PURELY POLITICAL stalked the top pair through the backstretch, was
ridden along three to four wide around the far turn and failed to move on. PLUM LUCKY rated off the early pace, urged outside around the far turn and failed
to respond. GOLD TREASURE raced in the back, saved ground around the far turn and never menaced. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

AVALON KING held a slim lead in opening stages then vied inside of TAPPED TO THE MAX around the turn, battled back gamely from the inside in the
lane and edged away in late stages. TAPPED TO THE MAX was forwardly placed in opening stages then moved up to match strides outside of AVALON
KING, battled on two wide into the lane then failed to kick on with the winner in late stages. ASTRONOMICAL stumbled sharply at the start and raced in the
back, angled out wider for the drive and finished with response to gain show. MIDNIGHT IN MAUI was forwardly placed just off the top pair leaving the
backstretch, remained in contention three wide around the turn then flattened out in the lane. BLUE AZUL hustled up four wide around the turn, kept under a
ride two wide a furlong out but failed to kick on. BIG BARREL was not too far back in the opening quarter, chased along the outside around the turn, came
out five wide into the lane and had no late response. WRATH raced in early contention on the inside, lost position around the turn, saved ground into the
lane then weakened past upper stretch. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
SPICY SOMMELIER tracked the pacesetter through early stages, was set down two wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer on AWESOME GALAXY,
dueled in final strides and got a nose up on the wire. AWESOME GALAXY quickly cleared on top and held firm still unleashed around the turn, saved
ground and given cue turning for home, dug in on top under steady pressure, dueled in final strides and got nipped on the wire. SNOOZY SUZY was ridden
along off the clear top pair around the turn, came five wide into the lane and churned on for a share. LOOKINANDCOOKIN raced off the early pace, saved
ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. TEQUILA RITA was off a step slow at the start, raced wide and never threatened. COPPER PEG raced
five wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. AKUBA showed response in the opening quarter then retreated. RACED WAS HAND TIMED

GRAY ADMIRAL was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, advanced along the rail leaving the turn, cleared on top and finished going away.
NEVADAN took the lead soon after the start and angled inside, held firm on top around the turn, came out two wide turning for home, got collared by rail
running GRAY ADMIRAL and stayed on for second best. UNION BROTHER was well placed tracking the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide
around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the and secured a share. NO SUPAH FOR YOU raced in contention between foes entering the turn, loomed
three wide at the quarter pole, given cue to head in pursuit turning for home but failed to kick on. MR VIEW was not too far back in early stages, came four
wide into then lane, angled in a couple paths under pressure and lacked a needed rally. PASSED BY PAUL was not far back and in a bit tight along the
inside, was ridden along two wide into the lane and gave way. CRACK A COLD ONE raced in the back along the outside and never threatened. DYNA CAT
chased two wide between foes three furlongs from home then gave way. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

SILLY NOTION was ridden along off the early pace, came four wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer along the outside then surged to the wire and
finished clear. TOTHEMOONANDBACK dueled outside of STONE TAP through early stages, battled on gamely through the lane then failed to hold off the
winner in deep stretch. STONE TOP vied inside of TOTHEMOONANDBACK in opening stages, fought back gamely two wide through the lane then had no
closing kick left in reserve. WIN LIKE COACH P raced off the pace, hustled up on the outside around the turn, came five wide into the lane, closed willingly
in the final sixteenth but ran out of time. WAR MAIDEN raced in contention sitting just off the top pair, stayed on three to four wide in the upper stretch then
faded leaving the eighth pole. RATIONAL lacked speed, came three wide into the lane and failed to rally. BODE'S BEST was ridden along off the early
pace, saved ground around the turn and had no response. MINI MAGS chased in contention through early stages then faded midway around the turn.

RAAGHEB was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried in the back, took closer order leaving the far turn then given cue three wide in the
upper stretch, roused forward three deep into striking distance, dug in determinedly in the final sixteenth and edged away. DYNAMIC RULER held a slim
lead around the first turn and set the pace through the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the far turn, hustled up two wide entering the lane, dug in
gamely holding a slim lead then got edged out late. ARIZONA MOON tracked the pace through early stages, launched a bid near the quarter pole,
advanced to race in striking distance a furlong from home, remained up close between foes going by the sixteenth pole then yielded. STACKIN SILVER
raced in range tracking the top trio through the backstretch, was ridden along four wide turning for home, remained in contention a furlong out but finished
evenly. LOOSE DIAMOND raced off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide in the lane, was not far back but had no kick. CLAVICHORD was
forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, remained in close range around the far turn then weakened in the
driive. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. Fractional split of 48.05 was removed.

Footnotes
HOTFOOT vied three wide through early going then shook free midway around the turn, stayed sharp in response through the lane and finished well clear.
RAOFTHESUN hustled along in steady pursuit, saved ground on the rail around the turn, cut the corner then tipped three wide for the drive and cleared
second best. WRITE ITINTHE DUST was ridden along out of the gate but lacked early speed, raced off the pace, came five wide into the lane, finished with
response and gained show. MYSTIC REALITY vied between rivals then got in tight and checked at the three eighths pole, weakened, chased four wide
through the lane and failed to regain. ATTA BOY BILLY raced n contention off the top trio, took closer order along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner
entering the lane then flattened out. SORRISO vied inside verse a duo in opening stages, could not match with the winner midway around the turn then
gave way in the lane. GEORGIAN ROAD raced near midpack, was ridden along two to three wide into the lane and had no late response. WHIDBEY
PRINCE lacked speed, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY
LOOKING INTO THE RUNNING NEAR THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN
