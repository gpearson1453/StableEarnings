Footnotes
STARSHIP CHEWBACCA forwardly placed early then had to check off heels at the nine-sixteenths pole, looked to make a run between rivals but had to
pause in traffic at the quarter pole, tipped out to the three path leaving the bend, bid alongside in upper stretch, took over in midstretch and drove clear.
HONORARY DEGREE broke out and a bit slow, recovered quickly to take control early, dueled outside a rival into and around the turn, cleared with a
quarter of a mile to go, challenged by the winner in upper stretch, relinquished the lead in midstretch and stayed on to prove second best. HOT PURSUIT
raced up close outside the top pair, went three wide into the turn, chased five wide into the stretch and lacked a late bid. PICK YOUR BID tracked the pace
early on, was a bit tight along the inside into the turn and altered outside rival, drifted five wide around the turn and weakened. HAWK HILL tossed his head
and hopped at the start, trailed three wide into the stretch and made no impact. FUN COUPONS pressed then went up duel from inside, lost contact with a
quarter of a mile remaining and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
SPARKLE BLUE settled well off the pace early on, closed in around the far turn, tipped three wide and drew alongside the top pair into the stretch, grabbed
the lead in upper stretch, met the bid from MISS BELLATRIX with a furlong remaining and turned away that rival in deep stretch. MISS BELLATRIX off a bit
slow and bumped at thee start, unhurried at the back near the inside, moved out and went two then three wide on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch,
drew alongside with a furlong to go but faltered in the final sixteenth. DOLLY MAY (IRE) settled near the back, traveled three then four wide on the far turn
and was along for the show. SATURDAY NITE GIRL set the pace on the inside under pressure, maintained a short advantage to the lane, lost command in
upper stretch and weakened. BLAME IT ON ROSE rated outside the top pair to the first turn then dropped back off the pace, got put in tight between
runners and steadied past the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane and weakened. FORTUNATA TENSIO pressed the pace from outside, vied
between leaving the far turn, got shuffled back in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
DIVINE FEMININE bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, sat off the pace early on, took the turn three wide, angled inward in the stretch, rallied inside the
runner-up and got up late. HEAVEN'S MUSIC got bumped hard leaving the gate, vied three deep to the turn, chased the leader three wide into the lane,
re-bid at the eighth pole, kicked clear and got run down the runner. INDIO MO MO bumped leaving the gate, raced on the inside then two wide into the
stretch and finished willingly to gain the show. BIG SWEDE tracked six then five wide around the turn and finished evenly in deep stretch. TRIBUTE TO
AFLEET off slow at the start, lagged behind early, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch and summoned a mild rally. DADSTAR vied
four deep up the backstretch, chased the lead four wide to the stretch and flattened out. EYE CANDY RANDY hit the gate at the start, recovered well and
went up to vie for the lead from inside, cleared rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, led two wide into the stretch, challenged again at the eighth pole, lost the
lead midstretch and weakened. LOOKINFORMISCHIEF broke out and bumped rival, vied between for command to the turn, could not keep pace around the
bend and chased two wide to the lane, then faded in the stretch run. REAL POUCH off a bit slow to begin, traveled along the inside then angled three wide
around the turn and failed to menace. MONDALE came away a step slow, navigated the turn five wide and was not a factor.

TROPICAL TERROR off a bit slow to start, trailed the field from inside early, moved out a bit on the backstretch, angled four wide on the far turn, closed well
and bested FERRARIANO in the late stages. FERRARIANO stalked the pace from inside, angled three wide on the far turn, got bumped from inside in
upper stretch, bid between in the furlong grounds and finished a game second. DR. TROUTMAN dueled for the lead from inside then cleared around the
first turn, set all the pace to the stretch, clung to the lead with a furlong remaining and yielded late. FOOTHILL unhurried in the beginning from inside, moved
closer but lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch, came out and bumped rival in upper stretch, kept on through the lane and
missed the show. WILDER THAN MOST dueled for command from outside then ceded the lead around the turn, chased two wide into the stretch, got
pinballed between foes in upper stretch and weakened. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, FOOTHILL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH TO
FIFTH FOR COMING OUT AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO WILDER THAN MOST IN UPPER STRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE A
BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
NEXT REVOLT stalked three wide into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend, bid four deep into the stretch, kicked clear at the eighth pole
and drew away. ACTIVE ACCOUNT pressed the pace between rivals, headed the leader and vied between around the turn and into the stretch, vied with a
trio of rivals in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner inside the furlong grounds but stayed on to best the rest. REBEL WAR attended the pace three
deep, challenged outside the top pair on the turn, vied three deep to the eighth pole, lacked the needed late punch but saved the show. SPEED PASS set
the pace under pressure from outside, vied with a pair of rivals on the turn, fought back from inside in upper stretch but faltered in the furlong grounds.
TROMADOR tracked the top trio outside a rival, took the turn four then five wide and weakened in the drive. FAST AS CASS chased along the inside at the
back, saved ground through the turn and made no impact.

MORAZ sped clear and moved inside, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well late. NAZUNA (IRE) was rank into and early on the first turn while drifting
out a bid, traveled in mid-pack in the middle stages and moved to the two path, swung four wide into the lane, rallied into second and closed the gap on the
winner. SUPER GAME stalked the pace from inside to the stretch and got up for the show. FEATHERS (IRE) stalked in the two path, moved a bit wider on
the backstretch then came back to the two path, shifted three wide around the far turn, could not summon a late bid and got edged for the show. MISS
COSTA RICA broke in and bumped rival at the start, bumped with inside rival nearing the first turn while traveling four deep, remained off the rail, two wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. CARPE FORTUNA was closest in pursuit in the two path, chased the winner two wide to the stretch and lacked the
needed response in the drive. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) got bumped on both sides at the start, pulled in between and behind rivals and steadied early, steered
down to the inside and settled off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and could not rally. CHASINGSERENDIPITY bumped with rival nearing the first turn,
went three wide around the bend, tracked outside rivals in the middle stages, got floated five wide into the stretch and weakened. DERBY QUEST unhurried
early on and moved inside, tipped off the rail and went two to three wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

LIVINGMYBESTLIFE sped clear and angled to the two path, showed the way up the backstretch, kicked clear around the bend and held safely to the wire.
MOONLIGHT D'ORO stumbled, broke out and bumped rival at the start, angled to the inside prior to the first turn, chased inside a pair of rivals on the
backstretch, tipped out entering the stretch, finished well but had to settle for second best. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE lagged behind early, angled to the rail
on the far turn then steered out leaving that bend and came four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally to gain the show. PAIGE ANNE got
bumped from inside at the start, crept closer while going between rivals at the half-mile pole, came three wide into the stretch and lacked further response.
MISS FIA went four then three wide around the first turn, stalked outside rivals on the backstretch, dropped back while navigating the far turn four wide and
tired.

Footnotes
TALLEMARK unhurried in the beginning while racing outside a rival, angled five wide into the stretch, steered out and rallied widest in the stretch and got up
in time. HAIL FREEDOM steadied off heels on the first turn, went between foes on the backstretch, angled five wide leaving the second bend, rallied to the
front inside the sixteenth pole but got nailed on the line. REALLY BIG NEWS got shuffled between rivals early, angled to the inside, angled three wide
leaving the far turn, rallied in the lane but got outkicked by the top pair. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH got bumped two times away from the gate, settled down on
the inside, went two wide into the lane, moved out a bit in the stretch and kept on to round out the superfecta. LIL NAS rated early in the two path outside
the leader, bid outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages. WHAT AN IDEA trailed the field from inside, angled six wide
leaving the far turn and never made an impact. HEAD FOR BUSINESS sped to the front from inside, got pressured leaving the backstretch, met a
challenger around the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. PYEONG CHANG bumped rival twice leaving the gate, was hard to ride into
and around the first turn, continued to fight the rider to the nine-sixteenths pole, went five wide into the drive and had little left. SOTTOCAPO went three
deep around the first turn, stalked off the rail up the backstretch, exited the far turn four wide and faded.
