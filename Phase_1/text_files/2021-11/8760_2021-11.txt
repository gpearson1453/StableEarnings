Footnotes
PASCO was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, took over the pacesetting duties after going a half, responded when challenged
and held PREACHINATDINNER off late. PREACHINATDINNER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the third turn and
finished with good energy to be gaining late. LONO was bumped nearing the seven-eighths marker, settled off the leaders from the inside, saved ground
through the final turn and finished evenly late. ACTIVE PASS was bumped nearing the seven-eighths pole, pressed the pace while racing four-wide and
gave way through the final furlong. FORT YORK hopped at the start, lagged and did not reach contention. HIGH SPEED CHASE set a pressured pace from
the inside, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
EMMA'S A BEAST was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin with three furlongs to run and drew off as a
handy winner. WINNING SOUND was reserved just off the leader the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second
best. MERGIE TROID showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. MEAN SHARON settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. MY LITE NITE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn
and failed to menace. NOBLE GIRL chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

SIX BLESSINGS stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, opened a clear margin and held late.
PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. ZOE'S PAPA CEE sprinted
clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way late. PREMIER LEAGUE was pinched back at the start, showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the third turn and was not a factor. BOTTLE NECK was pulled up after the opening quarter and vanned off.

GRAZEN VALOR sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. TEASPOON OF PEPPER raced unhurried
early, moved from off the rail through the third turn, reached a contending position, was no match for the winner but finished well to hold the place.
SHESAIDSHESPERFECT chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. PARKERS ROSE showed no early speed,
raced five-wide through the third turn and did not threaten. BEAU ROCKS was forwardly placed early, raced from off the rail through the third turn and
weakened. GEE STREET lacked early foot, raced from off the rail through the third turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EARNEST broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear lead soon after going a half, responded when challenged nearing the sixteenth pole and
held gamely. NORTHERN QUEST was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the sixteenth pole and just missed.
PREACHER BROWN lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the third turn and finished willingly. LITTLE JOHN showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the third turn and finished evenly. BOY HOWDY was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and
weakened after going a half. MOONLIGHT BLUE raced four-wide through all turns, settled off the leaders and gradually weakened.
