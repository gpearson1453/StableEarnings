Footnotes
SOUPER EMPEROR briefly matched strides with SHERRIF CHIP around the first turn then cleared on top, set the pace by a comfortable margin through
the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, came under a ride along the inside in the lane, stayed sharp in response and remained clear. SHERIFF
CHIP hustled up out of the gate and briefly held the lead then conceded position to SOUPER EMPEROR, stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch,
made a run for rival around the far turn, sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and had to settle for second best. PRIVATE NETWORK tracked
the top two leaders through early stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, sustained steady response and stayed on for
show. STROLLED ON BY rated off the early pace, launched a rail bid around the final turn, stayed inside into the lane and flattened out in late stages.
CREATIVE MINESHAFT raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. PAUPING failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
JOE vied for the lead in opening strides then settled just off the pacesetter and stalked rival through the backstretch, edged ahead to a slim lead at the
quarter pole, came two to three wide into the lane, repelled the inside bid from CAMINERO and finished clear. CAMINERO tracked the pace inside through
the backstretch, edged closer on the rail late on the turn then launched a rail bid heading into the lane, could not reach the winner but stayed on and just
lasted for place. OFF COURSE was allowed to settle through early stages, saved ground through the far turn, angled out three wide at the head of the lane,
sustained a steady bid and just missed place. SWORE was reserved in the back, launched an outside bid at the head of the lane and passed tiring rivals.
THE THUNDERER was unhurried through early stages, came four to five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR vied in
opening strides then edged ahead to a length lead, set the pace through the backstretch, got collared by the winner past the mid-way point around the far
turn and faded through the lane. ESPRESSO LUNGO raced in range tracking the early pace, came under a ride three wide midway through the far turn,
failed to move on and retreated in the lane.

PRACTICALLY DIZZY dueled outside of AMERICAS WOMEN for the early lead, battled on around the turn then shook free turning for home, stayed on
gamely near the inside under steady pressure and remained clear. BOURBON WILDCAT raced near midpack, hustled up four wide into the lane, steadily
closed along the outside and gained second best. GOING GOING GONE chased inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, sustained a steady
bid, then came under left handed pressure, drifted out in late stretch which impeded the progress of WINDRUSH KARMA. RAPIDAMENTE raced off the
early speed, angled inside late on the turn, tipped two wide past the furlong marker, gained position then evened out in final stages. DIGITAL DREAM
chased three to four wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. BUTTER PECAN saved ground through the turn,
angled out three wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. WINDRUSH KARMA raced in contention off the top pair, sustained a three wide bid in the
lane, raced between foes at the sixteenth pole then was forced to steady when GOING GOING GONE came out a path, lost all momentum and gave way.
AMERICAS WOMAN dueled inside of the winner through early stages, battled on into the turn, was no match turning fir home and faded. DANESSA BABY
raced near midpack outside and weakened in the lane. FASHION ICON raced along the inside and came up empty leaving the backstretch. EASY'S FINAL
ROSE was off slow at the start and trailed throughout. THE RIDER OF WINDRUSH KARMA LODGED CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST GOING GOING GONE
AND BOURBON WILDCAT, AFTER REVIEW STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GOING GOING GONE FROM THIRD AND PLACED SEVENTH FOR
INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH

MONSTER RISING vied for the lead around the first turn then shook free and led the way, dueled inside of ICY HARBOR around the far turn, shook free to
a slim lead in the upper stretch, battled on gamely from the inside and held on in final strides. HOME BY SEVEN rated inside through early stages then
picked up the pace and split foes at the half mile marker, loomed three wide at the head of the lane, steadily inched way up closer, reached MONSTER
RISING in deep stretch and hung in final strides. ICY HARBOR stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, could
not maintain equal terms in the stretch run and stayed on for a share. UNION BETTY was unhurried through early stages, picked up the pace around the far
turn, bid two wide into the lane and improved position. WILLOW'S CHARM fanned out five wide around the first turn, raced near midpack and had no
response when called upon. CAN I EVER tracked the pace inside through the backstretch then retreated. TUA fanned four wide on the first turn, raced off
the early pace and never moved into contention. ALYS GREAT NOTION was forwardly placed in early stages then retreated. X MARKS THE SPOT was
outrun. DIADORA stumbled at the start and had no response.

Footnotes
PRETTY LORI dueled outside of AMERICAN BASTET through early stages, dueled two wide into stretch run, shook free to a slim lead then grew sharp on
top and pulled away. AMERICAN BASTET dueled inside of PRETTY LORI, battled back from the inside into the lane then failed to be match in late stages.
MARVELLA NASTY chased the top pair near the inside, stayed in pursuit three to four wide through the lane and finished clear for show. DARE TO TRY
raced near mid-pack, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, gained position then ran on evenly in the final sixteenth. TAM CHAR raced in range near
midpack, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and failed to kick on. WHAT A TRICK bobbled and got bumped at the start, saved ground through
the turn, launched a rail bid top stretch and flattened out. HICKORY DICKORYDOC was unhurried inside to two wide, came under a ride four wide in the
upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. CALYPSO GHOST was ridden along four wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and had no late
response. GRAND SKYLARK raced off the early pace, coaxed three wide through the far turn and failed to move on. BE GOOD raced near midpack in the
opening quarter then steadily weakened. CAN I GET AN AMEN showed response in early stages then failed to keep pace.

Footnotes
MYSTICAL MAN was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried through the backstretch, angled out leaving the far turn, came wide into the
lane, steadily closed along the outside and cleared late. SKY'S NOT FALLING was well rated sitting off the top trio mid-way through the backstretch, edged
up closer around the far turn, responded under left handed pressure, took over the lead at the eighth pole, edged away then got outkicked late.
ZARKALLANI (FR) was reserved in the back, circled up closer five wide around the far turn, hustled up along the outside into the lane, exchanged bumps
with BROKERS REWARD in upper stretch, moved up in striking distance then yielded late. ENGLISH TAVERN settled off the pace, saved ground and
awaited room late on the far turn, shifted out to race five wide at the head of the lane and gained late. BROKER'S REWARD rated near midpack, moved
through traffic at the quarter pole, exchanged bumps in the upper stretch, angled in for a clear path in the final furlong, gained position then flattened out.
NICK PAPAGIORGIO raced in the second flight through early stages, awaited room along the rail on the far turn, launched a bid at the head of the lane and
needed more for late impact. GENTLEMAN JOE dueled three wide late on the backstretch, battled back into upper stretch then faded. PAPAL LAW dueled
inside through the backstretch, battled on around the far turn then tired in the drive. FORTUNE'S FOOL vied between rivals midway through the backstretch
then faded. FIRST CRUSADER rated near midpack, bid three to four wide around the far turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
SALAMINA prompted the early pace then took over the lead around the turn, responded under pressure three to four wide through the lane and remained
clear. MICK'SBESTBETYET tracked the top two leaders, was ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained an outside bid through the lane and
finished second best. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE held a slim then vied late on the backstretch, could not match strides with eventual winner but sustained a
inside bid into the lane and just lasted for show. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL raced in the second flight, launched a three wide bid into the lane and got nipped
for show. SUZZETTE STAR tracked the early pace, bid two wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. BLESS AND HONOR raced off the pace, came
four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. NOTION INTERRUPTUS raced off the pace, five wide into the lane and steadily faded. BORROWED
ANGEL was ridden along the inside through early stages, saved ground through the turn and faded.
