late and held sway in the final stages. FUTILE was bumped at the start, dueled early on two wide, took over command near the seven sixteenths pole and
cleared foe, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch but yielded late and held place in the final stages. MOROCCO chased the
pace early on, was in the two path into the lane, altered out down the lane, rallied late and missed place in the final stages. PROMPT raced back early on,
was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but flattened out late in the stretch run. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN was slow and hopped at the start,
trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up. CAN'TBETEMALL was through after a half. JAMMERS JUSTICE was bumped at

FASTEST SPIN came in at the start and raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane, rallied down the lane, rolled past the leaders and cleared the
field in hand in the final stages. PALM COURT bobbled and came out at the start, stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, took over and
inched clear in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the late stages. PURRFECT LOVE was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was on
the inside into the lane, made a bid down the lane from the inside but weakened late in the drive. SENTIMENTAL CROSS came out at the start, set a clear
pace from the outset, was in the three path into the lane and faltered in the stretch run. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN was bumped at the start, chased the pace
early, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. CUZZYWUZZY was never a threat. VIETNAM was never a factor.
FLIRTATIOUS KITTY was bumped at the start and done early. MISS SOVELIA showed little. SUNSET AT MALLORY was through after a half. AMERICAIN
BOURNE was never involved. HOLD ME GIRL was slow and bothered at the start, trailed the field throughout.

LAURA'S CHARM pressed the pace two wide, took over passing the three furlong pole, repelled CURBS AND CONES' bid entering the lane, and drew off
readily under strong hand urging. CURBS AND CONES stalked along the inside, ranged up outside of LAURA'S CHARM entering the lane, but was swiftly
repelled in upper stretch, and kept on to prove second best. MOHAYLADY trailed two wide into the turn, split foes turning for home to claim show, and was
best of the rest. BLEST LIFE chased three wide, but was outmoved by an inner foe turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. T. K.'S JOKER lied off
of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY set the pace along the inside, but wilted at the three furlong pole.
