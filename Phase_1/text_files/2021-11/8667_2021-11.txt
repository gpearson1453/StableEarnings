HE'S BANDIDO was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by DUTCH COLONEL after going three
furlongs, vied with that rival and gamely held. DUTCH COLONEL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the first turn, moved up
to engage the winner after gong three-eighths, vied with that foe through a prolonged drive and just missed. COASTING NOW showed brief speed, raced
three-wide through the third turn and lacked the needed late response. EQUIVOCATOR lagged early, raced five-wide through the third turn and did not
reach contention.

THANKS was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out with a furlong to run, reached the fore nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off with something
left. KAYLA'S COWGIRL sprinted clear after the opening quarter, increased her advantage through the back-stretch and yielded to the winner through the
final sixteenth. LIZETTA lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late. SWISS SCRIPT was away alertly to press the
pace of the winner from the inside for the opening quarter, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. BABY ROSE was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

STRIKE IT LUCKY was reserved just off the leaders early, waited for racing room through the final turn, slipped through inside the furlong marker, opened a
clear lead with a sixteenth to run and held CHRISTINE'S JACK at bay late. CHRISTINE'S JACK raced unhurried early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid
with a furlong to run, could not match strides with the winner late but finished willingly. LICORICE DROP POPS lacked early speed, angled inside nearing
the sixteenth marker and finished evenly late. JUNE GLOOM was away in good order to duel for the lead with TADEO from the inside and gave way through
the final furlong. TADEO broke sharply to dispute the pace with JUNE GLOOM while racing three-wide and gave way after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
BETHEL RIDGE disputed the pace while racing four-wide through the opening quarter, dropped back nearing the three-eighths pole, moved five-wide
through the second turn and was up in the closing yards. AT U LOVER pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths
pole, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths marker and just failed to last. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL settled off the leaders early, angled out with a
furlong to run and finished with good energy. ASTOUNDING ABBY lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, reached a contending position
but failed to gain late. PHANTOMS BOOK dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. FOUR SCORE raced five-wide
through both turns, settled off the leaders and failed to rally. WAHASHA raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor. SAN JUAN STORM lagged early, raced seven-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. WATERFALL lost and regained iron from
the gate, settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
YEAR OF THE OX sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and was ridden out to the wire to be kept to task. JERSEY RED
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good energy. FOOLISH TO DECEIVE chased the leaders while
racing three-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. HARDY CHISEL lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and
finished with some late run. TURNAROUND chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way gradually. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE was void of early
speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out with a furlong to run and did not menace. BULLET EXPRESS lacked early speed, raced six-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. SIR LAUGHALOT was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. VIX
HERO raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. EXTRACTOR drifted out through the first turn, lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RAIDERETTE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, bumped with TIMBERLAKE GAGE nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead
soon after, remained in control through the sixteenth marker and held off the closing BEAU ROCKS to prevail. BEAU ROCKS was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. SHEZ A GRINDER lacked early foot, raced off the rail through
the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. MY LITE NITE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late.
THECHAMPISFLORING was off slow, raced unhurried early, drifted out through the first turn, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not menace.
TIMBERLAKE GAGE broke sharply to press the pace of the winner from the inside, was bumped and steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and
weakened thereafter. BLUEGRASS BETTY settled off the leaders throughout and gradually weakened. GEE STREET was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. COSMIC TRIPSTER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
weakened. THE RIDER OF TIMBERLAKE GAGE LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST RAIDERETTE CONCERING THE BUMPING AND STEADYING
BETWEEN THE TWO AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICENT EVIDENCE TO MAKE
A CHANGE AND MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MORE HONOR was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. FORT LEWIS RIVERS
sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and yielded to the winner through the final sixteenth. BOY HOWDY chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. BURTON ERNIE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a
belated bid. RED STAR hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and
did not menace. CRAZY AL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. CRESCENT WILDCAT chased
the leaders while racing four-wide for the opening quarter and weakened. DUE TO THE TIMER BEING TRIPPED EARLY THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SPEEDY TOM set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin after going a half and drew off through the lane. ZOE'S PAPA CEE settled off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. BEING A BOSS was forwardly placed early, angled out nearing
the sixteenth pole and failed to gain late. PREMIER LEAGUE lagged early, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. HEAVY HAUL
was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong.
