Footnotes
TURBINADO, held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the bend, took a few erratic steps
when prompted to advance inside the pacesetter in upper stretch exchanging light contact with that rival, but came through along the rail to wrest the
advantage and edged forward under some right handed pressure. AFTERMATH was roused to contend from the outset, tracked off the first flight between
foes racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors. RODEO MAN
shifted out after the start impeding several rivals while being urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shifted
out racing into upper stretch while exchanging some contact with the eventual winner and couldn't match terms with that foe late while losing second
nearing the wire. TIGER HUNTER, pinched back, then steadied at the start, was collected to track off the second flight along the inside but continued with
interest to improve position inside foes late. MEATABALL, crowded by CHEEKERS momentarily at the start, tracked off the second flight outside foes early,
was fanned five wide racing into the stretch but had no rally. CHEEKERS broke outwards, was urged to a forward placing racing in the four path through the
backstretch, shifted in to lodge a brief, three wide bid on the turn but faded leaving midstretch. HOUR CAT gained terms attending a rival's pace racing
through the backstretch into the turn and gave way racing through upper stretch.

Footnotes
FAST ONE broke readily, went clear racing into the first turn while angling inside, pulled his way along dictating the pace on a comfortable margin to the
second bend, held sway into upper stretch and came under energetic handling through the last furlong to maintain a safe advantage. ANGELINO, off slowly,
was settled last to the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes racing through the far turn, shifted off the inside to split foes in upper stretch, then
tipped three wide in the closing stages while finishing well enough to edge a rival for the place honors while no threat to the winner. TAP THE MOJO angled
to the inside racing into the first turn tracking the leader as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance shifting a bit off the inside racing into the far
turn, continued in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. IRISH MAJOR settled off the second flight while angling inside
racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes racing into the far turn to make some brief progress four wide nearing the lane, shifted in sharply under
pressure racing into upper stretch but had no late response. WATER PATROL tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the
backstretch, continued under patient handling while angling to the inside on the far turn, was prompted to advance inside foes nearing the lane but proved
empty in the drive. PLEASANT MOON stumbled at the start, recovered to gain a position three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to make a brief advance in that path nearing the far turn but quickly emptied out midway through the second bend. ZANFORCE switched outside
the pacesetter racing into the first turn while being prompted to a forward placing, lodged a brief bid between foes nearing the far turn but gave way between
foes after six furlongs, was not persevered with in the stretch drive but walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK broke readily to gain a narrow advantage inside foes racing into the first turn, continued under rating dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage through the backstretch into the far turn, was roused to turn back a challenge from GATE CREW racing through upper stretch but kicked away
leaving the furlong marker to prove best. GATE CREW was guided to the rail racing into the first turn stalking just off the pacesetter under light reserve
racing into the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch to advance on the winner nearing the furlong marker but couldn't match
that foe in the closing stages. CAMMACK was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn while being
prompted to advance, swung five wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position while earning a share. POPPY'S BOYS, forwardly
placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes racing into the far turn and faded racing into upper stretch.
CURLINGTON, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out entering the lane but had no rally.
DUCHOSSOIS tracked just off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was floated three deep, then four wide racing through the far turn and faded
leaving the far turn. HONEST TO GOODNESS angled inwards early to tracked off the second flight racing into the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far
turn to split foes lodging a brief, three wide bid but came empty nearing the lane. PRADO'S PLAYBOY, reserved well off the field to the backstretch, proved
no threat. COMING UP ACES was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
GUN WAR tracked just off the leaders in the four path racing through the backstretch, shifted in racing into the turn to press the issue three deep, gained a
narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and edged clear through late stages under firm right handed pressure. LARK, held up between foes in the
opening stages. switched out four wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance, continued in that path into upper stretch and finished with
interest to prove best of the others. KARAYEL tracked just off the leaders between foes in the opening stages, was guided nearer to the inside tracking just
off the leaders, shifted out nearing the lane to bid three deep between foes just inside the eventual winner in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
TEARS ON A RIVER settled outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide entering the lane and continued with an effort
to improve position. TEA AFTER BALLET, reserved last racing through the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the turn, tipped out entering upper
stretch but passed only tiring rivals. HOUR NAP was briskly urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, dueled for command
between foes on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. SWEET TONIC, urged along the inside disputing the pace inside a rival through the backstretch,
dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch and gave way.

BIG SPORT, forwardly placed in the three path prompting a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the turn to press the issue,
shook clear racing into upper stretch, then steadily widened the margin under firm hand urging while his rider flashed his whip right handed. MARK OF THE
Z was rated while switching four wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, was prompted to advance on those rivals racing three deep into the
turn, couldn't match the winner in the drive but proved best of the others. RIDE INTO THE SKY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn,
lost some ground to those foes on the bend, shifted out to the four path racing through the stretch but continued with an effort to gain some position.
FOLLOW THE SIGNS reserved between foes in the opening stages, swung out entering the turn, raced five wide into upper stretch but made no real
impression. NORTH SIDE, urged to gain the lead in the opening stages racing a bit off the inside, dueled for command along the rail racing through the turn
and gave way into upper stretch. DEVIL'S RULE was rated off the first flight between foes racing into the turn but lacked a closing response.

MANHATTAN LEGACY switched outside the pacesetter in the opening stages racing just off that rival through the backstretch, advanced to press the pace
racing into the turn, moved to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear late under brisk handling. SHEZA SAVAGE, urged dictating the
pace a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch to the bend, dueled for command inside a rival remaining a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch,
couldn't match the winner late but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. RARE ACTION ATTACK was rated off the second flight between
foes on the backstretch, shifted out racing into the turn gaining position, angled to the four path nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a
rival for a share nearing the wire. STORMY EMPIRE tracked the pacesetter along the inside in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. RONAN, reserved last racing through the backstretch while angling to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped out in the
closing stages gaining some position while no real threat. LINDALOUIMAGE settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned five wide in upper stretch but
had no rally. RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH tracked the pacesetter in the four path as part of the second flight in the opening quarter, shifted inwards entering
the turn while continuing in pursuit of the leaders but faded from contention nearing upper stretch. CHRISTY ATTACK settled into stride while switching well
off the inside racing into the turn and offered no rally.

LIKE A SALTSHAKER broke readily to attend a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, prompted the pace between foes on the turn to upper stretch,
then edged forward in the closing stages to narrowly prevail under firm handling. GET HAMMERED broke readily, was urged along the rail dictating the
pace on a narrow margin into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch, resisted the winner to late stages and narrowly prevailed for the place
honors. HURRICANE HIGHWAY tracked off the first flight while shifting nearer to the inside racing through the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper
stretch and continued with interest to make a mild gain on the top pair late while missing for second. AGGRESSIVITY reared, then stumbled at the start,
then bucked while his rider collected her mount, settled well out of striking distance, shifted out three wide gradually regaining contention and went by a
tiring rival to gain some position late. STAR OF KODIAK, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders early, advanced to press the issue in that
path on the turn and flattened out leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
LAPIS STORM was urged to lead from the outset, dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, turned back the challenge of
AUTUMN ASPEN racing into upper stretch and edged away under firm left handed pressure. The latter angled inwards while moving to terms with the
pacesetter in the opening stages, prompted that rival racing into the turn, couldn't match that foe in upper stretch and weakened while proving best of the
others. FLYING BUSINESS was rated between foes behind the second flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail on the turn while being prompted to
advance, came through inside foes gaining some position in upper stretch, then altered course to race three deep in the final sixteenth while failing to gain
terms with the top pair. KIANA'S LOVE tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening quarter, raced four wide into the turn making an effort to
advance and evenly in that path while gaining some position late. HEY HEY switched off the inside tracking just off the leaders racing two, then three deep
into the lane but faded in the drive. HIDDEN FIGURE made brief pursuit of the leaders racing three wide into the turn but was through after a half. DARING
DAMSEL settled outside rivals dropping well off the second flight racing to the turn and failed to menace. FIVE QUEENS dropped back early.
