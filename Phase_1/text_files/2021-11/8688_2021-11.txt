turn, came again along the inside and edged up late. MAMBACITA stalked the two rival duel down the backstretch, bid through the turn while in the three
path, led in late turn and into the lane, gained a clear lead before the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while just saving the place spot.
JACK'S FINALE was unhurried while in the three path into the far turn, came with momentum into the lane from the four path, continued with good energy
through mid-track, was closing in to the wire and just missed the place spot. SAVEDBESTFORLAST tracked the pace while in the two or three path through
the turn, came into the lane from the three path and lacked a closing response. TOUCH OF BLESSING vied for the lead along the inside down the
backstretch, began losing contact for the lead into the far turn and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
POWERUPJUSTICE raced on the lead while under pressure from the runner-up through the turn and into the lane, dueled with that one outside the eighth
pole to inside the eighth pole, cleared and widened through the final seventy yards and was eventually pulled up on the clubhouse turn while galloping out
and subsequently vanned off. CHARLIE TWO SOX hopped at the start, was hustled up to press the pace through the turn and into the lane, got closet
straightening in the lane then could not keep up late. FOR MAMA was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, remained in
mid-track and just got up for the show spot. WHERE'S MOE bumped at the start, raced in the three to the two path through the turn, came into the lane near
the inside and just missed the show spot. SMILE LIKE KYLE broke inward, raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path,
drifted in a path or two inside the eighth pole and weakened. HOT N SWEATY was last away and was never in it.

MORE APPROVAL saved ground through the turn while patiently handled, cut the corner while gaining momentum into the lane, caught the leader just
inside the eighth pole and drove clear while being kept to the task to the end. EXPRESS LADY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came
into the lane from the four path and moved up to be second best. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE broke alertly and quickly cleared for the lead, remained clear
into the lane while in the two path then yielded to the winner just inside the eighth pole. HOOSIER PREMIUM raced in the two path while moving to press
the leader into the turn, could not keep up with that one through the turn, chased the pace into the lane then weakened. WEST COAST JUSTICE was in the
two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and never was a factor while under a strong drive to the end. PRINCESS CONSUELA
was slow to gather, moved to the four path into the turn and was never a serious factor.

FAITHFUL NOTION stalked the pace five wide, rallied at the quarter pole, then drew off under mild urging. HOBNOBIN GENERAL raced in the four path but
had no late bid. AEROBALLISTIC led inside, then gave way in the stretch. NO PROOF stalked the pace inside, then lacked a late bid. PURE TAP improved
position late outside. MONEY MAN BRYLAN pressed the pace in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. REAL RIOT passed tired rivals. LET'S GO
JOE pressed the early pace, then gave way in the stretch. WISHY WASHY was not a factor. PURSUANT stalked the early pace four wide, then faded.
