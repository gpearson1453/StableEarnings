Footnotes
WOW RUN sprinted to a clear lead quickly, increased his margin at each call, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. SARAWAT tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, came into the stretch on the stretch, closed willingly, then was no match late and held the place. BOURBON OVER
ICE well placed, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in, evened out and gained the show. POWERFUL GUY
stalked the pace on the outside, lost ground on the two path through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. ECCENTRICO allowed to
settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. THOUSAND LETTERS wello placed and between, faded
through the turn. CASSIDYS GOLD improved position. ITS OVER hesitated at the start, was no factor. ANGELUS DIAMOND chased three wide and faded.
NATHANIEL'S HOPE well placed and inside, dropped back through the turn and faded in the stretch.

SEAZAN tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove
clear. HARD TEN stalked the early pace on the outside, bid outside of that one gaining a short lead through the turn, then was no match for the winner,
while clearly best of the rest. CAMP PENDLETON fractious in the gate, was well placed, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, drifted in and weakened. MACHO REAL allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, angled in in the stretch and got up for a share. GODS
PROMISE steadied along inside, checked into the turn and faded. KING TARZAN set the pace inside and faded through the turn.

late, widest. R MAN JOE vied for the early lead on the outside, edged ahead, shook clear through the turn, then was no match late and held the place.

Footnotes
AERONAUT vied for the early lead on the inside, edged ahead into the turn, shook clear through the turn, then drew off and was kept to the task.
EIGHTHANDBROADWAY broke sharply from the gate to set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the turn, came three wide into the stretch
and made up some ground on the winner. PROUD CONTENDER allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path into the stretch, was bumped late and edged up for the show. UNIQUE PATH rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, then
veered out late, bumping a rival and missed the show. CAPTAIN well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch and weakened. CREATIVE CHOICE well placed and between, faded through the turn. MACK was no factor.

CONCRETE GLORY set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. CYBERVIKING broke out at the start,
was well placed and three wide, gained position on that path through the turn, bid, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest. GOLD
SPECIAL allowed to settle, came widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DEAL GO DOWN vied for the early lead on the outside, held position
through the turn, then weakened in the stretch. YES I'M A BEAST well placed and between, drifted out slightly through the turn, was steadied and faded.
GRAN ANDREWS tracked the pace well back, gained position through the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
MUTED stalked the pace on the inside, angled out into the turn, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside, then drew off and
was kept to the task. DIVINE CONNECTION broke in at the start and angled to the rail to track the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide
into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. LARA'S LADY set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, stayed on when challenged
and weakened the final furlong. ARROW SHAPE steadied just after the start, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and ran evenly. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and had no rally. ROSY APPLE
broke a step slowly from the gate, was bumped, hit the rail and steadied inside, then showed little. RUNAWAY BREEZE was no factor. LOVE HER LOTS
steadily lost ground, outside. CLAIMS OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDERS OF ROSY APPLE AND ARROW SHAPE AGAINST DIVINE CONNECTION
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE SHORTLY AFTER THE START WERE NOT ALLOWED.
