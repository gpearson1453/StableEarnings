Footnotes
LOST IN MANHATTAN was prompted to terms inside the leaders in the opening stages, was eased off the pace after the opening furlong, tracked those
rivals from just out of striking distance a bit off the rail racing into the turn, shifted out four wide racing through upper stretch and continued with a steady late
response to just edge BASEBALL POLITICS in time under firm right handed encouragement. The latter was shuffled momentarily in tight quarters at the
start, was hustled between foes while angling in sharply crossing the path of STALLONE to dispute the issue inside foes, eased back off those rivals nearing
the turn, shifted out three deep to challenge racing through upper stretch and contested the issue to the end while just outkicked. KOSHER COWBOY joined
the pace four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage midstretch but
weakened nearing the wire. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE was settled outside foes in the last flight, angled out to the five path racing into upper stretch and
displayed some belated interest. STALLONE was carried inwards a bit in early stages while being prompted to contention, tracked the leaders from out of
striking distance between foes racing into the lane and continued evenly. VALIANT VINNY was urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset while
angling inwards in the opening quarter, dueled for command inside a rival on the turn to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. FINNEGAN
(IRE) settled along the rail in early stages, saved ground to the lane but offered no rally. TUFF ATTACK settled between foes in the last flight and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD MAGGIE was rated out of striking distance a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position inside rivals racing into
the far turn, briefly awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, tipped out three wide in the lane, soon wrested the advantage and went clear under firm
right handed pressure. HOOSIER GOLD CASE was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin
for a half, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn while briefly losing the advantage but continued grudgingly to regain the advantage in
upper stretch but proved no match once confronted by the winner. ONE FLASHY GIRL switched off the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the
first turn while under firm rating, pulled her way to terms with that foe after a half, pressed the issue into the second bend gaining a narrow advantage on the
turn but faltered entering upper stretch. LITTLE CHICK was settled last racing well off the field to the far turn, then passed inside tiring rivals in the closing
stages. PAULETTE threw her head at the start, then was going a bit erratically into the first turn, tracked off the first flight racing outside a rival to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance making a brief bid three deep between foes leaving the midway point of the far turn, was fanned four wide in upper
stretch and came up empty in the drive. THE MORE I BURN was urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just outside the leaders in the opening half
and gave way racing through the far turn.

GAGOOTS was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted five wide after a half mile while being prompted to advance, continued four wide
through the far turn pursuing EMPTY HOLSTER to upper stretch, took over from that one in upper stretch and kicked away under firm right handed
encouragement. EMPTY HOLSTER was rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out four wide after a half while readily
gathering momentum, advanced on the leaders three wide through the far turn to bid for command between foes in upper stretch but couldn't match terms
with the winner while clearly second best. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT ducked out at the start, was settled last while angling to the rail, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued willingly inside foes to gain position to the end. AZRAEL, urged to the lead between foes while angling inwards racing to the first turn,
disputed the pace inside a rival racing through the backstretch, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way in the drive. RIVER FINN, urged to terms
with the leaders four wide racing into the first turn, shifted inwards pressing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, continued to dispute the issue
into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. TWO COOKIE RULE, forwardly placed three wide between foes racing to the first turn, was rated nearing
the backstretch to track off the first flight continued between foes to the second bend and faded nearing the lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN settled between foes
in the last flight, angled inwards nearing upper stretch but had no rally. MISTER CHARMING, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the first turn, was
eased off the leaders to track those rivals along the inside to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. STAGE DOOR tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
BLOOMING GARDEN, prompted to terms with the leaders from the outset, was bumped, then squeezed between foes racing into the first turn momentarily
dislodging his rider from the irons, continued to prompt a rival's pace racing to the backstretch while his rider regained his seat, pressed the issue through
the backstretch to go clear along the inside racing into the far turn, held sway to upper stretch, then gamely held the challenge of TOE THE LINE to the wire
in a game response under firm right handed pressure to prevail narrowly on the wire. The latter was rated out of striking distance while angling to the inside
racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, gained terms with the leader in upper stretch,
struck the front racing past midstretch, but was outfinished in the final strides to just lose the nod. LORD BOLSTON broke awkwardly, settled last to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting to the four path racing into the far turn, continued in that path to late stages but lacked the needed final bid
while prevailing for a share. MAGA COUNTRY settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the stretch and continued with an
even effort to gain some position late. OFF TO THE BEACH was prompted three deep while shifting inwards racing into the first turn, exchanged some
contact with the eventual winner, dropped off the leaders to track those rivals between foes to the second bend and faded between foes in the drive. KING
ZION was briskly roused to the lead from the outset inside rivals, exchanged some hard contact with the eventual winner racing into the first turn, continued
to dictate the pace into the backstretch and gave way once headed by that foe racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
INDIAN SIGN tracked the pacesetter three deep racing through the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance on the leader racing into upper
stretch and took over in late stages under pressure. CHOPPER broke outwards bumping LAST SPRING, was quickly righted, then went to the lead while
angling nearer the inside racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. FLORIDA
FLASH was settled along the rail in the opening stages, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position inside
foes late. KING'S STORY exchanged brushes at the start, was urged to contention along the inside in the opening stages, lost some momentum when
caught in close quarters nearing the bend, shifted out to race in the three path entering the stretch and weakened in the drive. LAST SPRING, bumped at
the start, was slow into stride, tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn to upper stretch and offered no rally. TSALI exchanged brushes at
the start, was righted to track the leader between foes racing to the turn but faded early.

SHARP HERO raced just off the leaders four wide in the opening quarter, responded when prompted to advance in that path racing into the turn, moved to
challenge for command racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed pressure. BONKERS, in touch with the
leaders between foes attending the pace in the opening quarter, pressed the issue racing into the turn to gain a brief advantage after a half but proved no
match when confronted by the winner. MORRIE'S JOY joined the pace three wide in early stages, pressed the issue in that path racing into the turn and
gave way in the drive. HERO'S DAUGHTER tracked off the first flight from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, switched out in upper stretch to
race four wide to late stages but offered no rally. MIZ TROUBADOUR, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn, gave way
after a half. HELLO HERO ducked out at the start while getting away slowly and trailed to the lane.

Footnotes
CALL THE COLONEL was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the far turn,
gained striking distance in upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage from SUPER SILVER and go clear late under firm
encouragement. The latter angled inwards racing to the first turn to gain a position tracking just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch,
moved to take over racing through the far turn, held sway into upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but proved only second best.
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS, caught in close quarters racing to the first turn, was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out on
the far turn, steadily gained position three wide between foes racing into upper stretch but had no late kick while finishing evenly for a share. COMFORT ME
NOW tracked the leaders outside a rival off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was shuffled a bit in some traffic losing position racing into the far
turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. RADIANT CASTLE, caught in close quarters just after the
start, was reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out to race three wide between foes through the far turn to the lane and finished evenly
between foes. CHAPEL BARN, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leader as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, faded between
foes racing through the far turn. ANDREW THE GIANT settled last early and offered no rally. EDISON FIRE, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, gave way racing through the far turn. ZANFORCE was urged clear outside rivals racing to the first turn, shifted
inside setting the pace on the backstretch, held sway to the second bend and gave way once headed.

Footnotes
WINNING QUALITY was prompted to terns with the pacesetter after the opening furlong while shifting outside that foe to attend the pace under rating, took
over from that foe on his own courage racing into upper stretch and kicked clear through the lane under hand urging while his rider displayed his whip right
handed to prove clearly best. LIL BIT TIPSEY tracked the leaders five wide in the opening stages, continued outside foes in second flight racing in the four
path through the turn to upper stretch and finished with interest to prove best of the others. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN tracked the leaders three wide between
foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn tracking off the first flight, tipped out entering the stretch and continued evenly between foes
while gaining a share. LADY EXPRESS, slow into stride, was settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn and gained some position inside
foes in the closing stages. CONSTANCIA broke awkwardly, settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out five wide racing through the
stretch but lacked the needed late bid. WATCHIN THE WHEELS tracked off the first flight four wide, then three wide between foes racing into the turn and
faded in the drive. SILVERA, urged to the lead from the outset while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled for command
inside the eventual winner entering the bend and gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch. JUKEBOX MONEY WAS FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE,
NECESSITATING HIS LATE SCRATCH PRIOR TO THE RACE.
