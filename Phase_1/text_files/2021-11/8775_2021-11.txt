QUANTICO JOE raced in mid pack early, advanced six wide, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear. NEAR GENIUS set a pressured early pace,
raced off the rail, was no match late and finished second best. LESTER'S MEMORY pressed the early pace from between rivals and weakened late.
SWEET BEAU ROLL was allowed to settle early, angled out to the eight path and offered no rally. WAYLAY was unhurried early, raced seven wide and
never fired. BABY SHAMU chased the early pace from the inside and faded. ATTILA'S LEGEND was void of speed and was no factor. MISS LUBBOCK
was taken back and was no threat. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BODIE GOT GOLD stalked just off the early pace, moved to challenge three wide on the turn, edged clear in the stretch and dug in to turn back the
challenge of a rival. WARRIORS MARK tracked in behind the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, made a mild bid inside but was fended off.
CHIPPSTER was forwardly-placed inside, lost some ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch and kept on. CALICHE set a pressured pace just off the
rail, weakened. LAUGHING STORM was close-up early racing outside, went four wide on the turn, failed to rally. CHA CHING CHARLIE was off slowly and
tossed his head at the start, angled in, saved ground on the turn but was not a threat. QUINTON'S CHARMER failed to threaten after going five to six wide
on the turn. CRAIGS VICTORY lacked early speed, raced inside to no avail.

Footnotes
CARRIE'S SUCCESS tracked in behind the dueling leaders, went two wide on the turn, lacked room late on that bend, came out five deep turning into upper
stretch, struck the lead past the furlong marker and held safe from a rallying rival late. STORMY WORLD settled off the leaders, moved out from three to
five wide on the turn, came seven deep into upper stretch, rallied but too late. DANCES FOR KAMIA stalked the dueling leaders from outside, went three to
four wide on the turn commencing a bid, took over in upper stretch but was outkicked. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS saved ground tracked inside, came out six
wide turning for home and gained late. INVODKAWETRUST dueled inside on or just off the rail, weakened. A GREAT VICE dueled outside two to three
wide, weakened. PEACEOUTYOURHONOR raced evenly four to five wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
TRUST MANDO was three wide into the first turn, shifted in on that bend to track inside, moved out heading up the backstretch, commenced a bid three
wide on the far turn, lugged in at the furlong marker and drew away. HUNKY DUNN saved ground inside through both turns and gained the place.
BOB'SALLWICKED raced four wide through the first turn toward the rear, angled in early up the backstretch, went two wide on the far turn and kept on in
the stretch. MORE FIREWATER was forwardly-placed stalking four wide, lost ground and position three to four wide on the far turn but passed rivals in late
stretch. TALKABOUTNAVARONE tracked the leaders in behind, went mostly three wide, loomed a threat near the quarter pole but flattened out. ANXIOUS
INDIAN set the pace in the two path, was asked for more about the five-sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. ABETEMARCO was close-up
early racing five wide, steadily weakened. ATLATL went five wide on the turns, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
WESTERN SMOKE set the pace racing off the rail, came in just a bit heading up the backstretch, was challenged on the far turn going two to three wide on
that bend, regained command in upper stretch and held sway. SMOOTH BLUES tracked the pace from inside, moved up to challenge on the turn, kept on in
the lane to gamely secure the place. RIO CUTIE was bumped hard into a rival early, shifted in from two wide to the rail on the turn before coming back out,
was within striking distance in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. AGRONOMO was bumped and forced to check early, raced just off the rail
through the turn coming out five wide into the stretch and improved position. TOMBI was hard to load, came in and bumped a rival hard early in the going,
went three wide on the turn, failed to rally. FLIGHT SPEED switched out, went three to five wide on the turn, failed to threaten. ALEXANDER WHO was
outside early, went four wide on the turn, failed to menace. ROBYNS LUCKYLIZARD saved ground inside, came out in the stretch, was never a threat.
FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDERS OF AGRONOMO AND RIO CUTIE AGAINST WESTERN SMOKE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.
