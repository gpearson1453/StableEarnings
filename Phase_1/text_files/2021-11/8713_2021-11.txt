Footnotes
CIDSTAYINURLAINE hopped at the start and lugging in, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out,
lugged in, was straightened by left hand urging quickly, then made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. CAJUN SPICE stalked the pace in the
early going, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. MAMA
LONGLEGS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a challenge into the stretch, shook clear, then was outfinished. DRILLZILLA allowed to
settle, looped three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well late. FOR EVER OURS well placed and outside, looped four wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. G T'S BLUE SQUALL well placed, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane and weakened the final furlong. MARIMBA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and passed tiring in the stretch. MILENITA fractious
in the gate, broke through pre start, then was a brief factor. ANGELS CAN FLY tracked the pace and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
THE TWINS SNEAKERS allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged
up in the final strides. BIRD WILDCAT set the pace on the inside, came again into the lane, shook clear held that margin in the late going and was
outfinished. POSEIDON'S SON well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had a mild gain.
KNIGHTS BIRD stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position and put a nose in front on the two path, then could not stay with BIRD WILDCAT,
drifted in slightly and weakened. GOLDEN SURVIVOR passed tiring rivals. TRINNI SURPRISE broke in at the start, checking and straightening, then was
no factor. SPRING THE BEAST tracked the pace and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
MY DESTINY broke sharply from the gate, angled in to track the pace, angled out to bid outside, was carried out into the stretch, then edged ahead and
held under steady pressure. PATRICK'S LASS well placed and outside, angled in through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a
steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. AWESOME VIEW sprinted clear, drifted out into the stretch, carrying the winner, then weakened the final
furlong and held the show. BEAUTY QUEEN mid pack and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
evened out. VICTORY CRUSADE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and passed tiring rivals. GREY JAZMINE was no
factor, widest. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE well placed and outside, faded two and three wide through the turn.

place. QUEEN OF GOD mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed for the show.
