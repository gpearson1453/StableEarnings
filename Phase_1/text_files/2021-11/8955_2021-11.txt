Footnotes
NOSY BANKER dueled for the lead inside of a rival, battled through upper stretch before shaking clear at the furlong pole, bug drifted many paths outwardly
through the final sixteenth as BROOK IS GOLDEN menaced, but held to the wire. BROOK IS GOLDEN stalked two wide while outside of the dueling pair,
ranged up to those foes while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over inside of the furlong pole while chasing under a long drive, produced a
bid outside of the drifting leader approaching the wire, but was denied. P T'S FLASH broke slowly and trailed early on, saved ground while progressing
around the turn, rallied in the three path to cut the gap on the leaders approaching midstretch, shifted inwardly inside the final furlong to attempt a bid inside
of the leaders, but only managed to chase them home. STEALING APRIORITY settled off of the pace along the inside, gradually shifted three to four wide in
upper stretch, and grinded away evenly outside of the leaders through the final furlong. CRUSADER EXPRESS dueled for the lead two wide, but failed to
keep pace between rivals at the furlong pole. MUSADA stalked along the inside around the turn, but only managed to chase the leaders through upper
stretch before fading. THE THREE KS broke inwardly, settled off of the pace two wide, got floated five wide entering the lane while failing to keep pace with
an inner foe, and made no impact. WIDDLE ZEE bumped an inner foe early on, got caught five wide around the turn, and failed to factor. BIG BOSS MAN
was bumped by an outer foe early on, faded into the turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied to take aim on a clear CUSTOM BOBBY'S in the final
furlong, bid approaching the sixteenth pole, dueled, and edged an advantage late. CUSTOM BOBBY'S cleared off early on, maintained that clear margin
into the final furlong, but dug in while meeting JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT's bid a sixteenth from home, and got bested. CITY PARK settled off of the pace two
wide and between horses, took the far turn three wide, tipped five wide in midstretch to bid for show, reached that position in the late stages, but failed to
kick on, and just lasted. BAYOU JAM stalked the clear leader two to three wide around the turns, but was outkicked at the three sixteenths pole, and chased
thereafter. I'M D'CAT rated off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, chased from behind the leaders while shifting four wide
approaching the furlong grounds, and stayed on between horses. RUN ROCKET settled off of the pace three to four wide, tipped five wide entering the lane,
failed to keep pace through upper stretch, but maintained stride in the final furlong as leading foes tired, bid for show on the wire, but missed. INCA
WARRIOR saved ground in midpack, but failed to menace. LOUISIANA MOON settled at the rear of the field along the inside, and never got involved.
THIRTYSIX G'S broke a step slowly, then failed to factor. HOORAY AUSTIN stalked along the inside, then outside of the clear leader around the far turn,
but weakened between horses leaving the furlong grounds. DEGRASSE was put to tight quarters between horses at the start, and got outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
OFF SIXES stalked along the inside, chased a bidding TRIVISTA around the far turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, grinded away in midstretch while
taking aim on that clear foe, bid a sixteenth out, and edged an advantage. TRIVISTA laid forwardly placed two wide and between horses in pursuit of the
cleared off leader, made first run and bid outside of that foe approaching the five sixteenths, pole, drove clear in upper stretch, but met OFF SIXES' bid in
the final furlong, was headed a sixteenth from home, and proved second best. BETTER WATCH OUT tracked three to four wide, then stayed on through the
late stages to claim show in the final sixteenth. DICTATOR cleared into the first turn, met TRIVISTA's bid at the five sixteenths pole, yielded to that foe in
upper stretch, and lost show in the closing stages. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN broke a step slow, raced far off of the pace around both turns, and improved
between horses. SKYCRAFT laid off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. GOOD INTENT failed to make an impact. QUESTION AUTHORITY
broke slowly, settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn three to five wide while trying to improved, but flattened out. CAP ROCK MINER stalked four
to three wide, chased a bidding foe around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch. CITALI showed little.

Footnotes
AMICHE vied two wide into the first turn, cleared around that bend, managed a loose advantage around the far turn, was set down entering the lane as
GLADYS pursued, but held sway safely under driving pressure. GLADYS stalked two wide, took aim on the clear leader turning for home, but only managed
to chase that foe through the lane, and proved second best. MO NORMAL settled off of the pace two wide, gained three to four wide around the far turn, but
drifted out subtly in upper stretch, and leveled off. DANCE RECITAL rated off of the pace along the inside, attempted a four to five wide rally around the far
turn, but was outmoved turning for home, then stayed on mildly through the lane for a minor share. INDIAN NICHOLS tracked along the inside, shifted two
wide into the far turn, chased the leaders entering the lane, but tired through the final furlong. ACCORDING TO ASPEN got fractious just before the gates
opened and was unprepared for the start, trailed the field, came into the lane three wide, and moved up. JUST PASSING THRU never got involved. GOOD
MONGOLIA vied along the inside into the first turn, stalked turning into the backstretch, but weakened around the far bend. ZANDREA'S stalked three to
two wide, but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
WALHALLA stalked two wide, intently maneuvered inside of a clear MASQUEREADE BALL to bid for the lead at the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way
from that pressing rival into the far turn, drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, managed a clear margin through midstretch, but dug in to meet BANCO's bid
at the sixteenth pole, and held gamely to the wire. BANCO tracked along the inside, trailed the short field around the far turn before regaining stride inside of
foes turning for home, tipped two wide entering the lane to take aim on the clear leader, chased that foe through midstretch while progressing mildly,
determinedly bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, dueled through the closing stages, but was denied. CURLIN EDGES laid off of the pace three wide,
chased four wide around the far turn, then kept on late to reach show without threatening the leaders. RONNIE'S VICE tracked from off of the pace two to
three wide, but lacked a bid. MASQUERADE BALL bobbled at the start, recovered to clear into the first turn, but wandered outwardly at the five furlong pole
before being headed by an inner foe at the nine sixteenths marker, then weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
FORTUITY tracked along the inside, stalked from the two path around the far turn before shifting three wide entering the lane, rallied to bid for the lead
inside of DON'TASK DON'TTELL at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage passing that marker as ATTORNEY TIM produced an inside bid as well, but
held well from that foe through the closing stages. ATTORNEY TIM saved ground off of the pace, rallied two wide and between horses in upper stretch to
bid for the lead inside of FORTUITY inside the final furlong, but was turned away by that rival, and held place. FENWICK STATION settled off of the pace
three wide, inched closer four wide around the far turn, but shifted to the eight path approaching midstretch to stay outside of the drifting leader, then stayed
on late, but failed to reach ATTORNEY TIM for show. TWOKO BAY rated far off of the pace, took the far turn two wide, shifted to the nine path in
midstretch, and rallied outside of foes late to reach a minor placing. DON'TASK DON'TTELL stalked the leading pair from the two path, bid outside of them
around the far turn, led turning for home, but drifted outwardly in upper stretch, got headed passing the furlong grounds by inner foes, and tired.
BEACHCOMBING vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with an outer rival turning for home, and
yielded. ARTIE'S RUMOR tracked two to three wide, but was outmoved by the eventual winner entering the lane, then chased from between horses. HAY
DAKOTA trailed three wide around the far turn, shifted to the ten path in midstretch, and failed to facctor. WAR CHEST set the pace from a pressing foe,
then inside of a pair of rivals into the far turn, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
JUST MIGHT set an unpressured pace along the inside while well in hand, shook away from a chasing STRIKE POWER in upper stretch, responded
willingly when nibbled at passing the furlong grounds, then widened his advantage under mild hand urging into the final sixteenth, and was wrapped up late.
GREELEY AND BEN chased three wide, ranged up to the leading pair turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch,
stayed on to catch a tiring foe for place approaching the sixteenth pole, and just held. PYRON trailed around the turn, swung five wide entering the lane,
rallied outside of foes through the final furlong, but just missed reaching place. NECKER ISLAND settled off of the pace along the inside, but steadied
behind rivals into the turn, shifted three wide shortly afterwards, came into the lane four wide and between horses, and chased thereafter. STRIKE POWER
stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader passing the quarter pole, and weakened through the final furlong. EMERALD FOREST chased
along the inside, but failed to factor. WENT WEST laid off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, ALL
INTERNAL FRACTIONS AND THE FINAL TIME WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
BREEZE RIDER set the pace inside of a vying DOMINGA, but shook free of that foe at the three sixteenths pole as ALMS loomed a danger from many
paths away, but held from that rival to the wire. ALMS took a bump from an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside and just behind the leading pair,
shifted outside of those foes turning for home, ranged up entering the lane, but drifted outwardly while failing to keep pace with the leader at the three
sixteenths pole, regathered herself in the center of the track in midstretch, re-rallied to produce a bid, but missed reaching the leader. BELLAGAMBA (ARG)
settled far off of the pace two to three wide, swung to the seven path entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the leading pair late, but ran out of ground.
DOMINGA vied for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, and faded. MORE THAN UNUSUAL
settled off of the pace, took the far turn in the two path, and chased between horses through the lane. CURLY RUTH saved ground while tracking from
midpack, but faded through the final furlong. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) bumped with an outer foe at the stalked stalked while tucking two wide into the first
turn, but was floated four wide around the far turn before fading entering the lane. WINTER SUNSET lunged inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, settled
at the rear two to three wide, and failed to rally. CATCH A BID bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer five
wide around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. KEY BISCAYNE saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. VALENTINES DAY
was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
BASALT STREET pressed LAKE MARIE from the outside, swiftly swept past that foe approaching the furlong grounds, readily drew off thereafter, and was
ridden out under mild hand urging to the wire. LAKE MARIE set the pace inside of a pressing BASALT STREET, but proved no match for that foe
approaching the furlong pole, then safely held place. PINEAPPLE ALLEY broke a step slow, settled off of the pace, got caught five wide around the turn,
stayed on to gain show at the three sixteenths pole, and chased the leaders home. SERIOUSLY SAM broke inwardly, gained mildly from far off of the pace
while six wide around the turn, but lugged in while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, then kept on to reach a minor placing late. SKY HIGH SUSAN
tracked from midpack four wide, bid for show in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival. GOLDEN ARTIST tracked two wide, but was shuffled
behind a stopping ZUMRA BAYOU at the five sixteenths pole, and faded. DREAM PEACEFUL saved ground off of the pace around the turn, gained chasing
position turning for home, but flattened out before contending. CANDY'S PRIDE stalked along the inside, came into the lane two wide, and faded in upper
stretch. GREY GREY broke inwardly, trailed, and never got involved. ZUMRA BAYOU chased three wide, but wilted between horses at the five sixteenths
pole. BETT THE LIMIT refused to leave the starting gate, then walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH. THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.
