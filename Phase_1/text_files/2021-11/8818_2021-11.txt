Footnotes
ALBERTA SUN rushed up along the inside, contested the pace through the turn, disposed of OFF WE GO entering the lane and opened clear, turned back
HEART FULL OF SOUL and held sway. HEART FULL OF SOUL attended the pace along the inside, shifted out and loomed large entering the stretch, but
was unable to go on with the winner in the final furlong. OFF WE GO broke sharp, drifted out a bit leaving the chute, dueled outside ALBERTA SUN to the
stretch, weakened but had enough left to preserve the minor award. SARIAH SARIAH settled off of the inside and lacked a response when called upon.
BIZZY ECHO was allowed to settle, came five wide but was never a factor.

Footnotes
RING ME DARLING settled off of the inside, came under a ride midway through the turn, came to level terms thee deep entering the stretch, shook off the
determined SURF SPA and edged clear in the final sixteenth. SURF SPA away away in good order, set the pace toward the inside, relinquished the lead
entering the stretch, boxed on doggedly to maintain the runner up spot. ANNAGANGSTA contended saving ground, angled out leaving the turn and
continued on fairly well to complete the trifecta. NANA'S GRAY was forwardly placed outside SURF SPA through the turn, but faltered between rivals into
the lane and faded. MY ANGELICA was allowed to settle, took closer order on the turn, came three wide but failed to make headway. MISS CHAMITA was
restless in the gate, was unhurried into stride and failed to threaten. CALIFORNIA KITTY was through early.

SOUTH BEND was unhurried at the tail of the field, moved up some on the turn, angled out five wide entering the stretch, reeled in his foes inside the
furlong marker and was going away. SONNEMAN vied for the early lead, settled off of the pace on the backstretch, moved up to reengage for the lead
leaving the turn, continued on willingly but was unable to resist the winner. TITLE READY attended the pace along the inside, was bottled up and waited in
traffic leaving the turn, shifted out and split horses near the furlong marker, but lacked the needed late response. RUSHIE was close up three wide, came
four wide and loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened in the drive. INDIMAAJ set the pace along the inside through the turn, was headed
entering the lane and gave way.

ABSOLUTE LOVE settled in hand off of the inside, advanced between horses on the turn, angled in and got through along the fence entering the lane,
struck the front inside the furlong marker and kicked away. LADY MCKENZIE vied for the lead three deep, fought on through a prolonged drive but was
unable to go on with the winner. LIL MISS HOT MESS was within striking distance four wide, looped up to vie for the lead leaving the turn, forged a narrow
lead but flattened in the final furlong. GIANNA'S GIFT set the pressured pace between horses to the stretch and succumbed. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT
broke slow, moved into contention along the inside, but came up empty entering the stretch. DIVA BANKER prompted pace inside through the turn and
faded. DR FRANCES failed to respond.

Footnotes
PARLANCE was close up three deep, took over entering the stretch and drew clear. BERAVINA was allowed to settle, ranged up four wide through the turn,
kept on well but was unable to reach the winner. ICY STARE DOWN settled in hand, launched her bid three wide, but flattened during the drive.
BACKYARD MONEY attended the pace along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked the needed response. LADY ARSINOE was slow into stride,
dropped well back through the turn, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. ARGUMENTAL was reluctant to load, broke slow, dropped
far back and was never a factor. BULLET ON TAP was allowed to settle, came three wide but came up empty entering the lane. RACEDAY ATTIRE
sprinted clear to set the pace, was collared leaving the turn and gave way readily once headed.

Footnotes
CHARTER OAK settled saving ground, commenced his bid midway through the second turn, took over between runners and opened clear entering the
stretch, wandered about in the drive and was all out to maintain the diminishing advantage. LONG CROW was unhurried along the inside, responded when
roused with three furlongs to run, angled out entering the stretch, was forced wider still when GINNSU WARRIOR came out nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, kept on well but was unable to bridge the gap. MR CREED was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, took closer order through the second turn,
weaved through traffic and was making up ground. GINNSU WARRIOR was allowed to settle, came under a ride into the second turn, moved into striking
distance, drifted out and back in entering the stretch and flattened. COUNTRIFIED tracked three wide, ranged up to make his bid nearing the quarter pole,
but weakened between rivals and faded. INGERSOLL opened clear to dictate terms, was collared on the second turn and gave in. AIN'T STRAIGHT tugged
to contention four wide, leveled into stride on the backstretch, but came up empty before going six furlongs and dropped out.

Footnotes
SONG RIVER was restless in the gate, hopped at the start to get away slow, was undeterred and moved swiftly into contention three deep, took over
leaving the turn, opened clear and maintained a safe advantage. MISS MOSAIC tracked in hand along the inside, was walled in entering the stretch, altered
out nearing the furlong marker, kicked on once uncovered but was unable to reach. BREAK CURFEW was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch five
wide and was making up ground. MISS T TOO set the pressured pace along the inside, relinquished the lead leaving the turn and gave way. PERFECT
HAPPINESS prompted the pace outside, assumed a narrow lead briefly leaving the turn, but wilted in the drive. HABOBANERO broke slow, was unhurried
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
EPICENTER sent for position, angled in and controlled the tempo removed from the rail, shook off SURFER DUDE entering the lane, shook clear and held
sway. SEAL BEACH was close up three wide, came four wide to make a bold bid, continued on willingly but was unable to reach the determined winner.
SURFER DUDE was fractious in the gate, came away in good order, prompted the pace along the inside through the turn, was unable to go on with the
winner entering the stretch, altered out near the furlong marker, but flattened in the drive and settled for the minor award. SEVEN FLAT was allowed to
settle three deep, came four wide leaving the turn, angled out further for the drive and improved position. MARQUEE RIDE was hustled along in the second
flight off of the inside, toiled on between rivals but failed to threaten. MASK PATROL was squeezed at the start and allowed to settle, came four wide but
failed to respond. HORNBEAM was slow into stride, finished with a belated improvement, but was never a factor. MINNESOTA READY saved ground to the
stretch, but lacked a response. CLOUDY was forwardly placed along the inside to the stretch and tired. DOWN TO BIZZNESS was through early.

Footnotes
GIRL WITH A DREAM was shuffled back a bit early, tucked in to save ground, came under a ride inside the three furlong marker, wheeled out seven wide
leaving the turn, caught DEVINE CHARGER nearing the furlong marker and was fully extended to wear that one down. DEVINE CHARGER was forwardly
placed along the inside, worked her way outside leaving the turn, split rivals and forged command inside the three-sixteenths pole, dug in to meet the bid of
GIRL WITH A DREAM but grudgingly gave in. PIPELINE GIRL was allowed to settle, ranged up four wide through the turn, was fanned wider into the
stretch, loomed a danger but lacked the needed late response. MABEE LUCKYNWILD vied for the lead three wide, contested the issue to midstretch and
weakened. LADY DANAE broke a step slow, advanced between foes, angled out leaving the turn and continued on fairly well. MURGATROYD prompted
the pace between runners to the stretch and faltered. SUNDAY GRACE disputed the pace along the inside through the turn and tired.

BELL'S THE ONE was shuffled back early, tucked in to save ground, commenced her rally into the turn along the inside, angled out entering the stretch,
took dead aim at CLUB CAR once straightened, reeled in that one and was up in the final yards. CLUB CAR was allowed to settle, made a sweeping move
four wide through the turn, took over and opened clear in the stretch, kept on well but was unable to resist. FRANK'S ROCKETTE contended three deep,
launched her bid between horses, but flattened during the drive and gave way. ELLE Z broke sharp, set a cracking pace, was headed entering the stretch
and faded. BLINKERS settled saving ground, shifted out leaving the turn but failed to make headway. VINTAGE READY prompted the pace outside, but
came up empty between horses leaving the turn and retreated.

CALL ME MIDNIGHT settled off of the inside, advanced between horses, tipped out inside the three-sixteenths pole, quickened once uncovered and drew
away. ALMANZO disputed the pace along the inside, was headed leaving the turn, fought on gamely but was no match for the winner late. QUICK TO
BLAME was allowed to settle, moved up through the turn, came five wide and kept on well to earn the show. OILER contested the pace outside, made a
bold bid leaving the turn, but faltered between horses in the drive. BRAWNDO contended three wide to the stretch, but faltered between rivals. LIAM THE
BRAVE saved ground to some avail. SCHMOOZE settled between horses and lacked a response. LOONSHOT was hung wide and was never a factor.
