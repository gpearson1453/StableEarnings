SUGAR MAC dueled inside to the stretch, roused to go away in the late going. DYNAMITE CLOUD just off lead to the stretch, proved no match, holding
place spot. FOREVERJUMBONMIKE with pace to the turn, could not go on, missed place spot. FLAT OUT OF CREDIT raced evenly to turn, floated out
through the stretch, no gain. STORMY TREASURE unhurried early, moved up a bit in the turn, leveled off late. SAMURAI WAY lost all chance at the start
when stumbled badly. MIZZEN SPOILS never a factor. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY dropped back into turn. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN
BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
