Footnotes
A SMILE A DAY was away alertly and quickly made the lead, led throughout and widened late under a strong hand ride. DYNA'S HOLIDAY was well placed
throughout, could not gain late on the winner but held place. PERSEVERING HONOR was allowed to settle early, rallied in the stretch with a mild bid and
just missed place. LOVELY LADY LINDA pressed on the inside and weakened in mid stretch. CHARDON was allowed to settle and failed to menace.
WAFFLESORPANCAKES raced close up early and was through after a half. MY PINK BABY BIRD raced mid pack and was outrun. APPEALING
SENORITA showed little and trailed.
