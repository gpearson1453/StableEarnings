Footnotes
QUEEN CARMELITA was away well and showed speed to set the fractions through the turn while two wide, had a clear lead into the lane and won in a
drive. SOMARA tracked the early pace, gained ground while four wide on the turn but was outfinished in the stretch. AMBER LOUISE settled off of the early
pace, was three wide on the turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch to claim the show. WICKED SUNSET chased the early leader while two wide
between horses, drifted in a bit along the turn while two wide between foes and did not have a late kick in the stretch run. BABE'S GOT APPEAL stalked the
pace from a two wide path and weakened in the late going. WELL DONE SALLY was forwardly placed through the turn while on the inside, steadied along
the turn when WICKED SUNSET drifted in and did not rally in the late stages.

FINAL FINAL was unhurried through the second turn, mounted a five wide bid on the second turn and had a good late kick to get by PUSH THROUGH to
prevail. PUSH THROUGH sat off of the early pace, gained ground leaving the second turn to confront ROBBER BARON, led inside of the final sixteenth but
was collared by the winner while clear of the rest. BIGFOOT CITY prompted the pace through the second turn, was still in contention into the lane but gave
way in the late going. ROBBER BARON set moderate fractions while being prompted by BIGFOOT CITY, was collared by PUSH THROUGH at the furlong
marker and weakened in the late stages. OUTRIGHT stumbled at the start, was in tight quarters between foes on the first turn, was four wide on the second
turn and was not a threat in the late going.

Footnotes
RUN LIKE KONA dueled with BRASTIKA in the early going, put away that foe heading into the stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up but held to
prevail. MIA SOLINA tracked the pace from a four wide path on the turn, rallied leaving the bend to pressure the winner in the late stages but could not reel
her in and held for place. SASSY EINSTEIN chased from the back of the field while two wide and closed well in the stretch for third. BARBARIUS stalked
the pace from a three wide position and was outkicked in the late stages. CUTETIP was forwardly placed into the turn, bore out on the turn and did not rally
in the stretch run. BRASTIKA pressed the early pace and faded in the drive. SHARP CURVE veered out at the start and had no early speed, was five wide
on the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
ISLA ROSE was forwardly placed to stalk the pace through the second turn, made a two wide bid on the second turn to challenge the pacesetter, put that
one away inside of the furlong marker and held over an oncoming runner-up. DIRT FLIRT attended the early pace from a two wide position, lost ground
leaving the second turn but closed well in the stretch to claim the place. B J'S SPIRIT set the pace while being prompted by DIRT FLIRT, was confronted by
the winner nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished by the runner-up in the late going. BANDEENA settled in the second flight through the second
turn, mounted a two wide rally leaving the second turn and challenged for third in the end but could not close the margin. BLUE BREEZE was unhurried in
the early stages, saved ground throughout and did not mount a late rally. BLUEGRASS SKY had no early speed, was three wide on the second turn and
was not a late factor. SANDY SUNSHINE stalked the pace from the midflight, was three to four wide on the second turn and gave way in the late going.

KNOCKOUT BERT was away in good order and set the pace into the turn, extended the lead leaving the turn and kicked clear in the end. SPACE
ODESSEY chased from the midflight while saving ground and closed well in the stretch to claim the place. CASHLINGS tracked the pace into the turn, was
boxed in while four wide on the turn and was outfinished in the late going. K P SILVER BULLET was a bit slow in the early going, was five wide into the turn
and closed willingly in the stretch run, challenging for third. AMERICA GREAT was off slow and was hustled to chase the pace into the turn, was five wide
on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SHORT RIB stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.
IMISSBAYMEADOWS was forwardly placed through the turn while four wide, lost a bit of ground leaving the turn and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
CAROLINA MIA tracked the quick pace into the turn, confronted the pacesetter leaving the turn, put away ALLIE'S PAL and drew clear in the end. ALLIE'S
PAL was off fast and set a quick pace from the inside, was confronted by CAROLINA MIA leaving the turn and was outfinished in the late going, while
holding for second. CRYSTAL PROOF settled off of the pace in the second flight, closed well in the stretch and just missed for the place. MISS MEGAN was
forwardly placed through the turn while saving ground and was outkicked in the stretch run. REBALATION settled near the rear of the field in the early
stages, was four wide on the turn and was closing on the leaders in the final sixteenth but unable to reel them in. BACK ON THE STREET stalked the pace
from the midflight, was three wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally. CANAM GAL settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the turn and did
not have a late kick in the stretch. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY chased from the rear into the turn, was shuffled back while in tight quarters at the three-eighths
marker and was not a late factor. ZAKKIYYAH sat off of the pace in the second group, was three wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MINOSO tracked the early pace while rating nicely, collared the pacesetter leaving the turn and felt late pressure from the runner-up but held to prevail.
SEASIDE DANCER bumped HAWK'S RISING leaving the break, stalked the pace into the turn while saving ground and was gaining ground on the winner
in the late going but could not reel him in and bested the rest. SMOKIN ENCOUNTER sat off of the pace while two wide on the turn and rallied well in the
stretch to claim the show. CAJUN BETTOR had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch, just missing for third. FAR
WEST stalked the pace from a three wide position on the turn and did not mount a late rally, while just missing for third. QUICK AND SILVER was hustled to
set the fractions while being prompted by the winner, was confronted by MINOSO leaving the turn and tired in the stretch run. TIME TO ZOOM was a bit
slow early and lagged in the opening half-mile, rallied from a ground saving position on the turn but was outkicked in deep stretch. HAWK'S RISING was
bumped at the start by SEASIDE DANCER, settled off of the pace while four wide on the turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch. HARDY CHISEL
chased the leaders from the midflight through the turn while five wide and weakened in the stretch run.
