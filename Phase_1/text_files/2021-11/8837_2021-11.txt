Footnotes
BESTRELLA (IRE) stalked the pace from inside to the far turn, tipped two wide around that bend, drew alongside the leader in midstretch and edged past to
prove best in the end. PISTACHIO PRINCESS was off a bit slow from outside, recovered quickly and sprinted to the front, cleared and angled to the inside,
set all the pace to the stretch, met the challenge from BESTRELLA (IRE) in midstretch and yielded grudgingly late. DEL MAR DRAMA traveled four wide
around the first turn, remained off the rail and chased four wide into the lane, urged left-handed in the drive, could not find the needed late kick but held the
show. ST HELENA unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, summoned a mild rally but could not get up for the show.
PRANCE brushed with inner rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, pushed upon around the second bend, lacked room and waited for an
opening nearing the stretch, tipped out in the lane and lacked a rally. REV RITA brushed with rival at the start, was closest in pursuit in the two path,
traveled three wide leaving the far turn, came back in a bit at the top of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
PROFESSORS' PRIDE raced up close outside the top pair, bid three deep around the turn, took over at the quarter pole, cleared with three-sixteenths
remaining and held well under mild hand urging. BOLD CHOICE stalked the pace off the rail, loomed four wide leaving the bend, chased the winner through
the lane and had to settle for second best. SQUARE FOOTAGE pressed the pace from outside, took over between rivals approaching the five-sixteenths
pole, lost command at the quarter pole and faded in the lane. ROMAN EMPRESS was fractious in the gate, broke slow and lost her path at the start, raced
well off the pace three then two wide around the turn and finished out well with a mild rally. MO CONNELLY got crowded between in the early stages,
tracked off the inside then angled to the rail, went two wide into the stretch and could not rally. VEGAS DREAM set the pace under pressure from outside,
led two wide into the turn, lost command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, started to weaken leaving the bend and tired in the lane. ADDYDIDIT broke out,
lacked early speed, raced along the inside then angled three wide around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUMTER broke inward, stalked the pace from inside, moved to the two path around the turn, tipped outside the top pair in upper stretch, drove clear and
won going away. WHO'S CANDY went up to duel for the lead from outside, held a narrow advantage with a furlong to go, could not offer any resistance to
the winner and stayed on to save the place. B DAWK broke in at the start, got shuffled along the rail shortly after, was in a bit tight at the seven-sixteenths
pole, saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail in the lane and kept on between foes late to earn the show. APPREHEND chased off the inside then
two wide around the turn, moved in then out in the lane and missed the show. ADMIRAL HALSEY sped clear quickly then dueled from inside, battled
through the turn and into the lane, fought to midstretch and weakened late. MEMES tracked off the rail, two to three wide into the stretch and could not rally.
CHARLIE'S GHOST was off slow, broke in and brushed rival while losing his path, got floated out at the three-eighths then angled inside the drifting rival,
stayed along the rail into the lane and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT FURY got brushed from outside at the start, drifted out at the three-eighths pole, came
three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BACK RING LUCK hustled from the gate, prominent early while four wide on the turn, cleared inside rivals early on the backstretch, opened up a
comfortable lead, widened around the far turn, then padded the lead under a drive to the wire. ROOKIE YEAR tossed his head at the start, settled in the two
path, moved out on the backstretch, was closest in pursuit while angling from the four path down to the two path on the far turn, still had a lot of ground to
make up into the stretch, failed to make an impact on the winner in the final furlong but bested the rest. DOC ADAMS vied three then two wide around the
first turn, dropped back off the pace in the middle stages, exited the far turn three wide and churned on to earn the show. LAUNCH PAD settled on the
inside, entered the lane two wide and failed to menace. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES vied along the rail on the first turn, lost command early on the
backstretch, moved off the inside, went two wide into the second bend, angled to the inside around the turn and tired. MR. PICKLES went three deep into
the first turn then moved into the two path around the bend, trailed four wide around the final turn and was not a factor.

OVER ATTRACTED went four then three wide around the first turn, raced in range through the early stages, bid three wide leaving the second bend, kicked
clear in upper stretch and held gamely over the late charge from the runner-up. SUGARY settled inside, waited for room on the far turn and tipped out the
two path, steered out to a clear path in the stretch, rallied but was too late. FREEDOM LASS stalked along the inside, waited around the second bend,
lacked room in upper stretch, angled in and went between foes at the eighth pole, moved down to the rail and rallied inside to gain the show. MISS
FLAWLESS (FR) came away quickly, tracked the pacesetter between foes, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MERCY
MERCY stalked in the two path through both turns and failed to produce a bid. TIZNO'S DILEMMA angled to the two path early, pulled at the
nine-sixteenths pole, angled four to five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. AWESOME DRIVE traveled three wide and was tossing her head on the first
turn, advanced three then four wide on the second bend but weakened in the stretch run. BUY WAVE BUY took control early and took control of the rail,
showed the way into and around the far turn, was overtaken at the three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the stretch.

DURANTE stumbled at the start but still came away quickly, led in the two path through the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, cleared with
five-sixteenths remaining, drifted in and almost hit the rail inside the sixteenth pole and held off the runner-up. UNION TRAIN off bit slow, rushed up and
checked into the first turn, went three wide around the bend, pressed the pace from outside, lost contact at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leader into
the lane, re-bid in the final sixteenths but could not get by. PORTSMOUTH got fanned four wide on the first turn, stalked three deep in the middle stages,
chased two to three wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. NOBLE UNION bumped rival while fanned five wide on the first turn, tracked off
the rail, entered the stretch three to four wide and put in a mild late bid. BLACKADDER tossed his head and came away slow, tucked inside early, went two
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CORSICA FLAVOR got bumped between rivals and fanned six wide on the first turn, back off a bit
and angled to the five path then steadied at the three-quarter pole, went three then five wide on the final turn and weakened. DON'T SWEAR DAVE got
bumped and fanned seven wide on the first turn, dropped back and angled to the two path around the bend, entered the second bend in the two path,
drifted steadily and came six wide into the stretch and had little left.

the turn, tipped out in the lane and missed the show. NU PI LAMBDA raced in range along the inside to the lane and missed the show. MISS CAROUSEL
was off slow to begin, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and never made an impact. SUITE MADAM BLUE tracked the speed
from outside then moved closer leaving the backstretch, chased three deep around the turn, got crowded between foes in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
AGREETODISAGREE stalked the speed outside a rival, bid alongside the leader around the far turn, headed rival at the eighth pole, took over shortly after
crossing into the furlong grounds, led into closing moments and prevailed. BASILIA got pinched back and checked early, raced in range early on, split foes
at the quarter pole, angled out in the lane, closed from outside but got denied. GOLDEN VOICE forwardly placed along the inside, was patiently ridden
through the far turn, given his cue at the top of the lane, tipped out midstretch and lacked room behind the top pair in the closing moments. UNUSUAL RIDE
traveled in mid-pack, came three wide into the stretch, angled out and whittle the gap late. CHASINGSERENDIPITY got bumped at the start, sped to the
front in the two path, showed the way along the inside into the second bend, got tested by the winner past the five-sixteenths pole, held a short lead to the
furlong marker and flattened in deep stretch. CECILE'S CHAPTER settled outside a rival, went two then three wide on the far turn and could not rally.
CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) broke slow to begin and was rank in the early going, trailed to the far turn, raced three wide into the drive and lacked response in
the lane. LADY EMILY angled to the inside early, traveled near the back of the pack, tipped out into the stretch and failed to menace. DEL MAR FLASH
became fractious in the gate, broke a bit slow, reserved on the inside in the early stages, ridden along while saving ground on the far turn and could not
summon the needed response. MAGICAL THOUGHT broke in and bumped rival, went three wide around the first turn, three to four wide on the second
bend and weakened.
