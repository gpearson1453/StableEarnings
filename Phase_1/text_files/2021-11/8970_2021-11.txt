Footnotes
GAMESTONKS settled off the pace and removed from the inside, edged up into the far turn, came under a ride past the three eighths, circled four wide into
the lane, leveled off when put to left handed asking near mid stretch, sustained under pressure to forge ahead late and won going away. JACRODRA'S
DEVIL was sent to the front and secured the inside into the first turn, met an outside challenge heading to the backstretch, dueled to the five eighths while in
hand, spurted clear soon after, widened the advantage past the three eighths, kept on gamely under a drive but just could not contain the winner. CUENCA ,
three wide, moved up nearing the half mile marker, gave closest pursuit under pressure past the five sixteenths but came up empty in the final furlong.
MELIPONINI BEE , four wide advancing to the far turn to take aim, was under asking while chasing past the three eighths, failed to kick on and dropped
back. SHEMADEMELUCKY , taken to rate while saving ground, moved up in hand nearing the half mile marker, lacked a response leaving the three furlong
pole and tired. SOLEADA , off slow when ducking in, lagged well back, came wide for the drive but failed to respond. MY MAGIC LADY broke a step slow
and to the outside, was sent up four wide early and bid outside the leader near the backstretch, sparred to the five eighths, faltered leaving the far turn, was
eased through the lane then walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN broke alertly and was urged early while vying outside HELLO BEAUTIFUL, moved clear of that one heading to the four and a half
furlong marker and dropped in, set a rated pace and spurted away approaching the quarter pole, responded when shaken up in upper stretch, was kept to a
drive to about seventy yards out and was clearly best. NEVER ENOUGH TIME edged up three deep nearing the half mile marker, chased two wide into the
lane, battled inside PAISLEY SINGING from the head of the lane and kept on willingly to out kick that one for the place. PAISLEY SINGING, between rivals
early, eased out and moved up three wide nearing the lane, gave willing chase past the eighth pole but flattened out some late. MISS CHESAPEAKE
dropped off the early pace, saved ground into the lane, shifted out and had a mild response while failing to threaten. HELLO BEAUTIFUL was under some
asking while disputing the early pace inside the winner, eased back off that one leaving the five eighths, steadied when shuffled back into the turn, dropped
well off the pace mid turn, angled out and came up empty. An objection by the rider of HELLO BEAUTIFUL against the winner for alleged interference
through the backstretch run was not allowed.

Footnotes
GOODLUCKCHUCK rated down the backstretch and on the turn while slightly off the inner rail, eased outside entering the stretch, closed determinedly
outside W W SPRINGTIME and gained the lead approaching the finish. W W SPRINGTIME sprinted clear soon after the break, raced near the inner rail
around the turn, drifted out a bit mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. ROUGH SEA lacked speed, was four deep around the turn and rallied outside foes.
ZIPPY , in the two path around the turn, angled in near the three sixteenths pole and offered a slight rally inside rivals. SATCHEL DE RITCHES chased the
pace two wide on the turn, floated out a bit in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. MY FRIENDS BEER , between horses on the turn and in upper
stretch, chased the pace and failed to rally. NO MORE TALK , three wide on the turn, was not a factor. SILENT MALICE , well positioned along the inner rail
leaving the backstretch, remained inside horses and gave way. POINT DRIVEN trailed.

UP AGAINST IT edged up leaving the chute and tracked inside, steadied near the three eighths, waited behind the embattled leaders near mid stretch,
altered out soon after, responded to left handed asking, forged to command near the sixteenth pole and early widened. ANTIPOISON stalked three wide,
moved up to take closer order into lane, bid past the quarter pole, dueled on a slim lead with a furlong to go, kept on gamely but was second best. RAD
PAISLEY pressed the early pace two wide, stalked between foes mid turn, gave hard pursuit past the quarter pole and faded. SUE LOVES BARBADOS set
a pressured early pace towards the rail, moved clear with five eighths to go, dug in when collared past the quarter pole sparred past the eighth pole then
gave way. CALL ME PLUCKY , sluggish at the break, saved ground into the lane and lacked a rally. FOLE'S NOTION , four to five wide stalking the pace,
was under pressure into the lane and faded. MONSTER MASON , four wide, faded. WICKED PRANKSTER stumbled at the break then was bumped, lost
ground four wide pursuing the leaders and weakened in upper stretch. MARYLAND PRIDE bobbled outward at the break and bumped with WICKED
PRANKSTER, dropped well off the early pace, saved ground leaving the far turn but failed to respond. BEACH TRAFFIC , rank when off slow, was outrun.
There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but no action was deemed necessary

ONE TEN , up close down the backstretch and on the turn, eased outside leaving the bend, swept to command in upper stretch and was kept under brisk
urging in the drive. MONEY ROOM , patiently handled down the backstretch, was in the two path on the turn, angled out for the drive and closed nicely.
HAND GESTURE set the pace in the two path, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. MR. NINETEEN hugged the inner rail on the
turn and failed to menace in the stretch. NIGHT BOSS , four deep leaving the turn, failed to rally. COATANDTIEREQUIRED , four deep leaving the turn,
tired in the drive. CROSSLAND no factor, passed tired horses. HIGHLAND DREAM , along the inner rail chasing the early pace, gave way on the turn.
MUGSY MALONE , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, faltered. DR. GRANT hugged the inner rail prompting the pace and faltered.

Footnotes
WHERESHETOLDMETOGO relaxed four wide and well within range of the leader, picked up momentum mid turn and circled rivals four wide into the
stretch, leveled off to his best stride when put to left handed asking near mid stretch, sustained under pressure and forged to command in the final yards.
YOUNGEST OF FIVE quickly went clear then dropped in to set a rated pace, responded when asked in upper stretch, wandered outward near mid stretch
then again near the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely after being straightened but just wasn't quite good enough. AIR TOKEN prompted the pace three wide,
came under pressure between foes approaching the stretch, gave hard pursuit past mid stretch and continued well between runners. GALERIO tracked the
leader two wide, was under asking to the inside foes entering the lane, shifted in some past the eighth pole but was out kicked. DOUBLE CROWN , off last
after an awkward break, regrouped and rated off the pace while saving some ground, moved between rivals gathering steam into the lane, swung five to six
wide and finished strongly to gain. ALWAYSMINING , between foes early, was under pressure two wide past the three eighths, shifted four wide and faded.
CLUBMAN saved ground, came under a ride around the turn, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. PLOT THE DOTS stumbled at the break,
recovered and settled off the pace and removed from the inside, raced four to five wide into the lane, dropped in a bit but came up empty. An objection by
the trainer of AIR TOKEN against YOUNGEST OF FIVE for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
ROYAL SPY quickly sprinted clear, set the pace near the inner rail, was confidently handled through the stretch and drew off. STEADY JOHN , rated behind
horses on the turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. FREE SQUARE , bumped with BLO MY BUDGET leaving the starting gate,
stalked the pace three wide around the turn, had aim on the leader entering the stretch then gradually weakened. BLO MY BUDGET stumbled then bumped
with FREE SQUARE leaving the starting gate, floated six wide entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. WINSTON'S GOLD saved ground on the turn,
eased out turning for home and lacked the necessary response. EPIC RISE , kept outside horses throughout, was seven deep entering the stretch. RED
MESA , three wide on the turn, was fanned to the five path entering the stretch and gave way. SHANGHAI CANDY , unhurried down the backstretch, raced
in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. DUDE AND JUMPER , two wide chasing the winner for a half mile, tired. WIRED IN , along the inner rail
leaving the backstretch, retreated.
