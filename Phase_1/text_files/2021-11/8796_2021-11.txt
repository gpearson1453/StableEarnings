Footnotes
PREMIERE CHOICE made the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and drew out in the drive while kept to his business. LASSMAN bore out leaving
the starting gate, rushed up between horses down the backstretch, prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened late. CHAUFFEUR circled the turn
four to three deep and had a mild gain outside rivals. SACHMO lacked speed and had a late rally between horses. EVER CLEAR , three wide stalking the
pace around the turn, gave way in the stretch. BALLYHOO PRINCE hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened in the stretch run. T REX , wide on
the turn, was not a factor. NINETYNINE EXCUSES was outrun after being pinched back by LASSMAN leaving the starting gate. RIP IT raced along the
inner rail on the turn and was never a factor. VESPER , inside horses around the turn, gave way in mid stretch.

Footnotes
MATTITUDE prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, bid to apply more pressure heading into the lane, dueled, gained a slim lead in mid stretch,
remained on her left lead while under left hand asking, had her rider drop a rein late and prevailed. MAGGIE'S BID sped to the front, set the pace off the
inside, dug in when taking more heat near the quarter pole, dueled inside the winner through the lane and stayed on gamely. CANOODLE drafted back off
the early pace, angled in mid turn but lacked a solid finish. VENEZUELAN TALENT pulled her way forward while saving ground near the half mile marker,
was under asking pursuing past the five sixteenths and gave way. ARCHER'S HALL bore out at the break, made a wide move to reach contention into the
turn, was under a drive pursuing three to four wide past the five sixteenths then faded. SUGAR SNAP was pulled up when sustaining an injury to her left
front approaching the far turn then was vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry into the running of the race but no action was taken.

Footnotes
CONFUSION BABY BOY rated in range while off the inside, edged up nearing the half mile marker, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled past the five
sixteenths, drifted four wide when kicking clear into the lane, kept on under right handed rousing in deep stretch then dug in late to narrowly prevail. BIG
RINNE , off the pace while saving ground, edged up leaving the three sixteenths, shifted out, worked between runners past mid stretch, kept on steadily on
while on his left lead, drew alongside the winner and just missed. GLENGAR saved ground pursuing the pace, dropped back a bit mid turn, came back on
while towards the rail in mid stretch and continued with some interest. PURIMETER , four wide under some early rating, moved up into the turn, was fanned
five wide pursuing into the stretch, gained past the eighth pole then churned on. FIFTY , off a bit slowly, raced between rivals leaving the three eighths,
chased into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. CLASSY SOLUTION disputed the early pace outside BLUE DANUBE then went clear after a quarter mile,
set the pace about two wide, met bids after a half mile, battled into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. LECTRIC CHOKE checked when
rank outside rivals nearing the five eighths, settled soon after while off the rail but failed to generate a rally. IRISHTOWN was outrun. BLUE DANUBE
contested the early pace to the inside of CLASSY SOLUTION, steadied back off that one then angled out, rebid between foes nearing the three eighths,
sparred to about the quarter pole then surrendered.

Footnotes
SEVILLE ROW , rated down the backstretch, was in hand waiting for room leaving the far turn, advanced inside horses, led in mid stretch and drew off.
OUCH OUCH OUCH , rated off the duel, was three wide leaving the far turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch, gained a short lead in mid stretch and
weakened. JESTFUL circled horses on the far turn, was checked and carried very wide leaving the turn and rallied on his left lead. TITRATE , widest on the
far turn, was carried extremely wide leaving the turn then rallied outside. GLORIOUS WEEKEND , a forward factor in the two path between horses, dueled
to upper stretch then weakened. DON'T DARE ME , disputed the pace three deep on both turns, weakened. LIFESPAN , four wide the far turn, was carried
out approaching the stretch. ZIP THE LIP , along the inner rail most of the trip, was not a factor. BIG POLO hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and
weakened. GOLDIE'S BOY , between horses and making a move leaving the far turn, was caught in tight quarters and unseated his rider at the head of the
stretch. GOLDIE'S BOY galloped through the stretch and appeared uninjured. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run into the stretch but no
action was taken.

Footnotes
FRANCIS X. quickly gained three to four wide heading to the half mile marker, engaged the leader from his outside soon after, dueled and gained a slim
lead entering the lane, was roused clear near mid stretch then steadily widened while kept to task. BALTIMORE BUD sped clear early, set the pace off the
inside, was joined leaving the far turn, dueled two wide and to the inside of the winner into the lane, gave way grudgingly in the final furlong and saved the
place. EFFULGENT , taken to rate while saving ground, moved up past mid stretch and kept on with some effort. CAPTAIN CARDO , bumped at the break,
stalked the early pace, was under pressure between foes leaving the three eighths, shifted out near the sixteenth pole and continued on willingly.
ALBERTANO , three deep near the three eighths, circled four to five wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE , jostled between
runners and taken up at the break, was outrun. MIRACLE BOBBIE came in at the break and bumped with a rival, settled off the pace, saved ground near
mid stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
KENNY HAD A NOTION , snugly rated along the inner rail down the backstretch and on the turn, eased out four deep approaching the stretch, gained the
lead outside ROOKIE SALSA near the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. ROOKIE SALSA , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the
lead entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly. HONOR THE FLEET lacked speed, was along the inner rail leaving the turn, swung to the four path in
upper stretch, loomed in mid stretch and flattened out. SILENT MALICE , sluggish early, saved ground on the turn, angled to the three path for the drive and
rallied mildly. KARAN'S NOTION disputed the pace in the two path and weakened through the stretch. WENTZ hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to
the stretch and weakened. TRIFOR GOLD was not a factor. CONTRAFLOW , three deep on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
DETERMINED KINGDOM stalked outside rivals, bid three deep nearing the five sixteenths, dueled into the lane, was roused clear past the three sixteenths,
opened up in mid stretch then held firm under a drive. RADICAL RIGHT was shuffled back in the opening furlong, regrouped and rated in mid pack,
advanced four wide into the lane, raced on his left lead and churned on willingly to gain the place. AMERICAN PLAYBOY prompted the pace two wide, bid
between foes nearing the lane, sparred inside the winner past the quarter pole, stayed willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. WISH ME HOME drafted
back off the early pace, raced three wide into the lane, was forced in past the three sixteenths and offered a mild kick. A DANGEROUS GUY was steadied
in the opening furlong, moved up some four wide heading towards the stretch, drifted in near the three sixteenths and faded. GOLDEN AVIEATOR , off the
pace, raced four wide into the lane and failed to menace. GALLANT GOLD flashed speed inside then steadied, dropped nearing the turn and came up
empty. STEVETHEVANDRIVER was sent up early while towards the inside, checked off rivals nearing the turn, angled out in upper stretch and faded. UP
FOR THE CHANCE had speed and cleared nearing the turn, dropped in to set the pace, took pressure past the three eighths and faltered nearing mid
stretch.
