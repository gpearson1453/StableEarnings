Footnotes
MASTER THIS stalked the earlier pace two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, took the nod leaving the pole, dueled clear midway on the
far turn then widened under steady stretch handling. SPANGLISH saved ground on the opening turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, steadily
improved in the three and four paths on the far turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in to take second later yards. CATFISH closed to the lead leaving the
three quarter pole and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught past the pole and gave chase
from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. C R'S MANDATE ran through the first turn in the three
path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little
more. MODERN DAY ROMANCE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and flattened stride. EISELE showed little response. SO COURAGEOUS stalked
inside the first turn then faded past the seven sixteenths pole. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
HIGH GLORY angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole and widened under steady handling. KIRBY
stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was no match in the lane. SARAH
BELLUM broke awkwardly then settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail. RAINBOW
RIVER settled off the pace inside on the first turn, was crowded at the rail by a loose rival past the seven sixteenths pole and was not encouraged further.
POSH PRINCESS settled back toward the inside on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, fell over a fallen rival in the vicinity of the seven
sixteenths pole but got up and walked off post race. KABIKEKA settled off the pace in the four path the first turn, got tangled up with COLETTE'S SPIRIT
and fell past the seven sixteenths pole, but got up and walked off. The latter saved ground off the pace, fell over the fallen RAISED WRONG at the seven
sixteenths pole but got up and walked off, while the latter stalked off the rail, was fatally injured at the seven sixteenths pole and had to be euthanized on the
track. The Stewards reviewed the incident at the seven sixteenths pole before posting this race official.

Footnotes
REAWAKENED broke sharply and contested the opening quarter of a mile, took the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear past the quarter and
was steadily handled through the lane. BROADWAY TROUPER was bumped at the break and gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about
the five path, was carried to the seven path nearing the end of the turn but dug in through the lane to take second the final yards. RED LIL SHIPMENT
chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. SIGNS OF JEALOUSY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn
about the four path, but drifted to the six path nearing the head of the lane and flattened later yards. EVA'S GIRL GRACE was bumped outward and into
Broadway Trouper leaving the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the six and seven paths and ran evenly in the lane. GRAM'S GAL broke
awkwardly but was hustled along with a slim lead most of the opening quarter, gave chase from the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail leaving the
quarter and weakened inside the eighth pole. COOL STANCE gave chase then weakened in the three path of the turn. MS. GUCCI GIRL broke outward to
make contact with Eva's Girl Grace then dropped well back to save ground.

WILLIE THE WHALE chased from the seven sixteenths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dueled for the nod mid-stretch, drew
clear later yards and lasted well. TRUTH SERUM chased well off the pace, angled to the seven path nearing the top of the lane and steadily closed to take
second the final yards while gaining on the winner. JESS'S RESERVE chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and dug in to take third the final
yards. CHURCH OF MANY gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly through the lane. GUNTER took over nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was caught mid-stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
MORE THUNDER chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. JOEYVILLE gave chase outside, rounded the turn
about the five path then flattened out. FLASH LIGHTENING broke a step slow and never factored. Per Stewards ruling #110, Church Of Many has been
disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
ALPINE MOON stalked the early pace from the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, dug in from the head
of the lane to take the lead later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. SKI BUNNY rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace into
the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail then dueled the final sixteenth for second. LADY MACHO
stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, was outfinished for the top two
spots but held on for third. MS HEADLEY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole and was met at the rail midway
on the far turn, continued a close factor through the upper stretch, though flattened later yards. RAVENEL saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out into the stretch but showed little further. JUST A BIT SASSY was reluctant to
load and broke a step slow. KALENJIN rounded the first turn in the five path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, then flattened in the five path of the far turn. EARNED THE SHOT saved ground well off the pace and showed little response.
