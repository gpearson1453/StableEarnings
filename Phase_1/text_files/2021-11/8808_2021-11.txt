Footnotes
STACK SHACK was urged setting the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch while
being roused to resist several challengers and maintained a narrow advantage to the end in with a game response in an all out drive.
NOFANSINTHESTANDS was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, swung out five wide leaving the midway point of the far turn to
challenge racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure through the last furlong and continued willingly to close the gap while just outfinished.
BEZEL SET, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, steadily gained between foes to bid for command racing into upper stretch, drew
on terms with the winner in the drive but was just outkicked. SPEAK ENGLISH angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half,
advanced along the rail to bid inside the leader in upper stretch, was caught in close quarters momentarily nearing the furlong marker and finished evenly
late. PRINCESS RENEE tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to gain striking distance four wide racing through the far
turn but flattened out in upper stretch. PRINCESS TINE (FR), forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, emptied out
between foes nearing the lane. RONAN settled near the inside in the opening half, saved ground to upper stretch making brief progress but lacked the
needed late kick. SIMPLY FAST settled off the second flight racing well off the inside to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
SHOWIT broke readily to gain a narrow advantage in the opening sixteenth, vied for command between foes through the backstretch into the turn, shook
clear in upper stretch and just held the late challenge of LADY MAGNA under firm handling. The latter was rated along the inside while dropping into last in
the opening furlong, split rivals racing into upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter entering the lane and continued willingly to close the gap on that foe
while proving only second best. GO STORMIN GIRL shied outwards avoiding a rival at the start, quickly recovered while shifting inwards on the backstretch
to press the pace three wide into the turn, couldn't match the winner in upper stretch and weakened late. FIRST SQUADRON ducked out at the start, was
prompted to a forward placing between foes, eased off the leader to stalk just off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch
but lacked the needed late bid. PRETTY SWEET, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way racing
into upper stretch.

Footnotes
LILY'S WOOFY raced five deep in the opening stages while being urged to contention, shifted inwards nearing the turn prompting the pacesetter racing into
the bend, pressed the issue into upper stretch, took over nearing the furlong marker and kicked away from the field under hand urging. CHROME ATTACK
tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn, shifted out to the three path racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort
to prevail for the place honors in the closing stages. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) sprinted to the lead along the inside racing through the backstretch, dueled
for command inside the eventual winner racing through the turn to upper stretch and weakened leaving the furlong marker. RARE ACTION ATTACK angled
to the inside in early stages racing as part of the second flight, shifted out of close quarters nearing the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and
gained some position in an even effort. GHAALEB'S APPEAL settled into stride along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out racing into the lane but passed
only tiring rivals. AND ISLES settled off the second flight in early stages, switched out under pressure racing into the turn but failed to seriously menace.
QUEEN'S MISSION made brief pursuit of the leaders outside rivals in second flight, angled inwards entering the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
IMPULSUS, shut off just after the break, steadied off rivals dropping into last on the backstretch, switched out nearing upper stretch to gain position three
deep between foes, angled inwards leaving the furlong marker to split rivals just off the inside nearing the wire and surged between foes in the final strides
to gain the advantage in time under firm handling. FABULOUS PHILLY tracked off the first flight racing four wide, then five wide to upper stretch, made
steady progress racing past midstretch to gain the advantage between calls late but just failed to contain the winner on the wire. HEY MA, urged between
foes pressing the pace in the opening quarter, dueled between rivals while being carried to the three path racing through the stretch disputing the issue to
late stages but was just outkicked by the top pair. TENSE ducked inwards at the start bumping DRAGONFLY KISSES, was righted while angled to the
inside disputing the lead inside foes into the turn, shifted off the rail racing into the stretch contesting the issue grudgingly but yielded in the final strides.
SHEZZ KOLDAZICE lost some momentum when her rider was dislodged from his irons just after the break, tracked off the first flight between foes to the
turn, angled five wide entering upper stretch and continued to make some mild progress late. DRAGONFLY KISSES, bumped, then forced inwards at the
start bumping STARSOVERPARADISE repeatedly, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper
stretch to gain position inside rivals nearing the furlong marker but lacked the needed final kick. STARSOVERPARADISE, bumped, then squeezed between
rivals at the start, tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside nearing the turn, altered course avoiding some traffic entering upper stretch but
lacked the needed final response. MY BACK PAGES exchanged several bumps just after the start while shifting inwards crossing the path of the eventual
winner, switched a bit off the inside racing off the second flight into the turn, lost some momentum when racing in close quarters nearing upper stretch and
came up empty in the drive. ANGIE'S REVRAC was urged to terms pressing a rival's pace three deep racing three deep through the backstretch into the
turn and gave way into upper stretch. PPIANO AT MIDNIGHT tracked off the first flight five wide through the backstretch and soon faded.

Footnotes
DEANO took up a tracking position racing off the first flight outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide nearing the lane and found
his best stride in the final sixteenth to just collar DRIVER DAN in time under firm left handed pressure. The latter broke awkwardly while getting away last,
angled to the rail racing into the first turn regaining some position tracking off the first flight, gained position inside foes racing through the far turn, tipped
outside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch to challenge for command, moved away to a clear advantage, drifted out leaving the furlong marker losing
some momentum, failed to contain the winner and was vanned off the course following the race. JOEY B settled off the second flight while angling inwards
racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch to split foes three deep and continued with an effort to gain position between foes to the end
while prevailing for a share. FAST ONE, urged to the lead inside foes racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled
for command inside a rival racing into upper stretch but gave way nearing the furlong marker. PLEASANT MOON, forwardly placed between rivals
prompting the pace racing to the far turn, gave way into upper stetch. SHOBIZ STAR, forwardly placed there wide tracking just off the pacesetter for five
furlongs, steadily faded into the lane. MAXIMUS IMAGE was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention.

MYSTERY MAN tracked off the first flight four deep racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the bend to steadily advance on the pacesetter
three deep on the turn, skirmished with that foe racing into upper stretch and edged forward in the closing stages under pressure. PITAMAN broke out
bumping a rival, was righted while pulling his way to join the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, dispatched that foe entering the bend to set the pace a
bit off the rail, resisted when challenged by the winner nearing upper stretch but proved no match late while lasting for the place honors. SPINSTER ROAD,
bumped at the start, was righted to track off the second flight outside foes, advanced four wide into the bend, shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch
and continued with interest to close the gap. TALIS PARK GRAD switched off the inside early to track off the second flight racing to the turn, was held up
avoiding traffic three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, then split foes in that path in the closing stages to improve position. JETTIN OUT tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. WILL KNOWS, urged while angling to the inside prompting a
rival's pace racing to the turn, gave way after a half. GONZO settled outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and displayed
some belated interest. RUFFOLO dropped out last in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. ONE PUTT RICHIE angled to the rail tracking the
leaders as part of the second flight. briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. NYOMAN tracked off the first flight
three wide between racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and gave out in late stages.

Footnotes
TWIRLING ROSES stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing through the backstretch, was prompted to bid inside that rival leaving the midway
point of the turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, was headed while being brushed by LT. JUNIOR GRADE racing through the stretch
but resolutely prevailed under stout pressure following a prolonged drive. THROWN FOR A LOUPE tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the
opening stages, pulling under restraint while racing in close quarters, shifted out three wide conceding some position on the turn, but continued willingly in
that path through the lane to close the gap and edge a rival for the place honors at the wire. LT. JUNIOR GRADE, forwardly placed three deep racing just off
the pacesetter in the opening quarter, continued with a steady bid shifting inwards racing into upper stretch to challenge for command, drifted midstretch
brushing the eventual winner contesting the issue to late stages but yielded to the top pair nearing the wire. TWO WORLDS was rated off the second flight
inside a rival racing to the turn, tipped out to the four path racing into upper stretch and continued with an even effort. DICK THE BRUISER settled outside
rivals in early stages and never gained contention. YOU'RE IN COREY, urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into the turn,
gave out after a half.

ONE WAY HOMEbroke readily, was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, met a
rival's challenge racing into the far turn, repulsed that foe racing into upper stretch while shifting to the three path midstretch but kicked away under firm
encouragement. TAPSOLUTE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, was
fanned five wide midstretch but continued with interest to the end to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. COWBOYS DREAM tracked the
pacesetter three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but lacked the needed final
kick. THE GRAY BLUR tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening quarter, angled inwards racing into the far turn continuing just off the
leaders, tipped out in upper stretch and continued evenly between foes late. DIAMOND DAVE exchanged bumps while swerving at the start, continued to
exchange contact with KREWE CHIEF racing into the first turn, was reserved off that rival nearing the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then
shifted out entering the lane to gain some position between foes while no real threat. PISTOL BOX, caught in close quarters at the break, settled last racing
to the far turn, was fanned six wide entering the lane but made no impact. KREWE CHIEF exchanged bumps at the start, then again racing into the first
turn, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the second bend, shifted off the rail and steadily faded leaving the far turn. SHWEET PERSUASION
came through close quarters at the start, angled to the rail to track just off the pacesetter, pulled his way inside that foe to press the issue racing into the far
turn and gave way racing into upper stretch.

between foes racing into the turn, shifted inwards to bid inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch and was just outkicked by the winner. HIGH HERO sped to

yielded to the top pair late. TIZ APPROVED tracked off the second flight outside a rival in early stages, angled inwards racing through the turn to bid
between foes just off the inside in upper stretch, lost some momentum when caught in tight quarters midstretch and finished evenly late. RENEGADE BOB
