Footnotes
MISS MESS broke to the outside wall then sprinted to the lead, cleared the field and drew off under a hand ride. HERE COMES LINDA pressed the pace
early from the inside while racing one paced proved to be second best. ENVOYS LEGACY was well placed in the three path made a bid on the turn to be
best of rest. PRICEY raced in the middle of the pack from the two path then angled out at the head of the stretch and closed well. MISS INVADER was
unhurried early and made a four wide rally. HOLY WAR stumbled at the start and raced wide but improved late. SMACKFIRE saved ground but was not a
threat. THURSDAY MORNING raced in the middle of the pack from the three path and failed to menace. GRAYFULLY was not a factor. JUST HADLEY
was close up early in the three path and gave way.

LAST TO KNOW was well placed in the two path just behind the leaders angled out ant the head of the stretch and drew off late. MACHO MARK was
unhurried early then made a late four wide bid on the turn and closed willingly. FLAMIN FIRE vied for the early lead then placed just off the pace and
dropped back then came again but was empty in the drive. ROCK ON COWBOY was rushed to the lead to set the pace and lacked a late response. THE
BIG IRISHMAN was allowed to settle on the inside, advanced up the rail and finished strong. UNCLE FRANK tracked the leaders from the three path made
a middle move on the backstretch but failed to sustain bid. AND YET ANOTHER stalked the pace from the two path and gave way. PREFERRED
PROSPECT was rushed to contention while racing four wide and retreated.
