Footnotes

inside in upper stretch dueling late ceding to outside pressure. HELLO MY HALO chased the pace saving ground to to draw even on the rail in upper stretch
dueling there ceding grudgingly late. SEEKING VIOLET raced evenly losing ground to upper stretch holding position there six wide. KARA LOT chased
through the turn extending at mid track down the lane hanging late. COLLUDE fractious in the gate delayed the start then broke very slowly. HELLCAT
WARRIOR played no factor. WILD OATSSE hustled along chased on the turn then faded in upper stretch. LITTLE LIES was always outrun. SHEZA MEAN
BROAD showed little.
