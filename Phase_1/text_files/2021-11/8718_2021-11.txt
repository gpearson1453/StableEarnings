Footnotes
PURELY SILVER was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace while clear, then was sent down leaving the turn and drew out in the stretch to prove
much the best under left handed crop urging. KAZ LUCKY NUMBERS was off slowly, then angled over to the rail and chased the pace, made a bid on the
inside on the turn but could not gain on the winner in the drive while clearly second best. PEACEARELLA tracked the winner three wide and made a mild bid
on the turn but was empty in the drive while besting the rest. HIGH DOLLAR DATE was reserved early, then raced three wide on the turn and swung out
five wide for the drive but offered no rally. FLY FLY BIRD was not a threat while four wide. STREETGARA stalked the pace four wide and stopped.

BEYOND THE BEND chased the early pace from between rivals, then was boxed by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the three sixteenths pole to make a
inside bid by the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear late to prove best under a drive. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS stalked the early pace in between
horses, made a four wide bid between horses leaving the turn to vie for command, then had a long drive four wide through the furlong grounds but was
outfinished by the winner while getting the bob for the place award. LITERALLY set a pressured pace while two wide, then battled gamely the final furlong
between rivals but was outkicked late while losing the bob for the place award. TRIPLE A. PLUS chased the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn
to vie for command but flattened out in the drive. BRILLIANT CHASE was off a step slow, then chased the pace six wide and needed more in the drive.
VENOMOUS STATE lunged at the start, then was bumped after the start, then was rushed up the inside, then steadied around the seven sixteenths pole,
then weakened on the inside. RIO ABAJO pressed the early pace and weakened.

Footnotes
THOMAS KNIGHT was reserved early while two wide, then advanced on the turn and eased out to come five wide into the stretch, closed well to get up in
time under a drive. THURMAN MERMAN sent to the lead and crossed over to set the pace on the inside while clear, then remained clear by the furlong
marker, but was on the left lead late and was caught. TRUE WISDOM was rated along early, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened
out in the drive. SMART TWO A T was brushed at the start, then was bumped soundly around the five eighths marker by the winner, then continued to race
on the inside, was in tight around the five sixteenths pole, then continued on the inside to be gaining late while rider losing his crop in deep stretch, missed
show award. MEROCKETMAN stalked the early pace and faded in the drive. BLUEGRASS POSSE chased the early pace and made a mild bid four wide
leaving the turn but could not sustain that bid.
