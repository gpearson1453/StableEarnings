HOTFOOT applied pace pressure to UNDENIABLE PROOF in early stages, launched a three wide bid into the lane, seized command in the final furlong
and held firm. PERFECT FANNY was away last and quickly moved up to race in close contention, was ridden along the inside around the turn, stayed on
two to three wide in the lane and captured place in final stride. NO PASA NADA raced off the top trio around the turn, sustained a three to four wide bid
through the lane and got nipped for place. UNDENIABLE PROOF sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace around the turn, save ground
into the lane, got collared by the winner in the final furlong and gave way. DUNE D'ORO raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped three to
four wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
HADDY UP was forwardly placed just off the early leader, came out wider entering the top stretch, shifted closer to the inside, vied two wide between foes in
deep stretch and dug in gamely to prevail. NAUGHTY SWAGGER sped to the lead at the start, held firm around the turn, came out wider under left handed
pressure entering top stretch then came in a couple paths, vied three deep for the late lead and lacked a final kick. STREET FLYER raced in contention
along the rail around the turn, saved ground into the lane, vied inside in the final sixteenth and yielded late. WRIGHT WINGED hustled along between foes
into the turn, stayed on two wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. INEEDAMANIANDAPEDI hustled along four wide around the turn, urged
five to six wide through the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. BEAUTY BLACK showed response in opening stages then weakened off
the early leaders, saved ground into the lane and had no late response. SHARP MOVE raced off the early pace, came two to three wide into the lane and
failed to move on.

Footnotes
MYSTIC REALITY raced off the top flight heading into the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer on the embattled pair and
kicked by late. GRAY ADMIRAL vied inside of C DUB for the early lead, battled on gamely holding a slight edge in the final furlong then got outkicked when
the winner swept by late. C DUB vied outside of GRAY ADMIRAL for the early lead, fought back outside of rival into the final furlong, yielded in late stages
and got outfinished. AZEE RULES raced off the early pace, roused three wide into the lane, angled inside, took closer order then finished evenly.
MIDNIGHT IN MAUI raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. ATTA BOY BILLY chased inside off the top
flight then faded out of the turn. GORDY'S RULES lacked speed, raced along the outside into the lane and had no response. COUGAR COUNTRY lacked
speed, came off the inside leaving the turn and never menaced.

Footnotes
WIND TARTARE (FR) settled inside around the first turn, edged up closer midway through the backstretch and stalked the pacesetter, launched a two wide
bid turning for home, took over the lead leaving the eighth pole and finished going away. GALILETA cleared on top and angled inside after the start, set the
pace through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, got collared by the winner past the eighth pole and held place. RED VENUS stalked the
pace through the backstretch, was ridden along two to three wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained on place. JEWEL AZUL raced off the
early pace, began to advance along the rail near the quarter pole, steadied late on the far turn, tipped out for the drive and had a mid improve. DADDY'S
GIRL secured inside position around the first turn, settled and saved ground through the backstretch, cut the corner entering the lane and failed to kick on.
MISCHIEF MAMA rated along the outside not too far back in early stages then weakened around the far turn. SUNDANCE STAR raced in range tracking
the early pace then faded around the far turn.
