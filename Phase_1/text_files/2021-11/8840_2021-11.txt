Footnotes
MOMMAS BOY OTIS ducked outwards at the start, was quickly righted while angling inwards to set the pace just off the inside on a narrow advantage
racing into the turn, was prompted to go clear racing into upper stretch and extended the margin in the closing stages under mild encouragement. COAL
TOWN ROAD came through close quarters at the break, angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch into the turn,
tipped out racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE swerved out at the start crossing the paths of KARAYEL and
MUNCH, was taken back last dropping well off the field on the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and made an effort to gain position inside rivals in the
closing stages. KARAYEL, crowded at the start, was collected to gain a position tracking just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, shifted out
three wide in upper stretch but was outfinished for a share. NOBEL switched outside the pacesetter in the opening stages while being prompted to a forward
placing tracking just outside that foe, continued in pursuit three deep into the bend and gave way racing into upper stretch. MUNCH, caught in tight quarters,
then shuffled back at the start, switched out four wide after the opening furlong while being urged to contention four wide to the bend but soon gave way.

Footnotes
AGAVE KID broke inwards bumping RAHFEE TOWN, was urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for command inside foes into the turn,
edged forward racing into upper stretch and kicked away late under some right handed pressure. BEE HAPPY ATTACK, brushed at the start, was prompted
to a contending position along the rail just after the break, was steadied off the eventual winner midway through the backstretch, tracked off the first flight
along the inside racing into the turn and came through inside foes in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors. SKIP THE SMALLTALK switched
outside rivals in the opening stages, was prompted to join the pace three deep after the opening furlong, pressed the issue in that path into the turn to upper
stretch, was bumped while being carried out slightly by MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH racing past midstretch but continued well enough to edge that rival for a
share. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH angled inwards in the opening stages while being prompted to force the pace outside the eventual winner, then between foes
racing into the turn, shifted out under left handed pressure nearing midstretch bumping SKIP THE SMALLTALK and gave out in the last furlong. RAHFEE
TOWN, bumped by the eventual winner at the start while forced into the path of HURRICANE JAKE, settled into stride racing off the rail to the turn but never
gained contention. HURRICANE JAKE, bumped, then squeezed back at the start, never menaced thereafter.

P H FACTOR broke readily to gain a clear advantage racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the far turn, was
roused to repel a challenge from CHRISTIAN C racing past midstretch and dispatched that foe to go clear under firm handling. The latter was prompted to
forward placing stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued under patient handling between foes on the far turn, was prompted to challenge
the winner racing into upper stretch but proved no match late. AND WON, reserved between foes tracking the leaders out of striking distance to the second
bend, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued willingly to the end to gain position while prevailing for a
share. NOT VERY GENTLE was settled outside foes in the last flight racing three, then four wide to the backstretch, was fanned six wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. NILES CHANNEL ducked inwards at the start, was reserved inside foes in the last flight racing into
the first turn, steadily gained position inside rivals racing into the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch but came up empty entering the
lane. SENSE OF SELF, reserved last between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while swinging out four wide racing into the lane but
had no closing bid. LAST PROMISE was rated just out of striking distance while pulling against restraint racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on
the far turn to lodge a brief bid but quickly emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GREEN BANANAS was settled in hand in the opening quarter dropping well off the leaders, was prompted to advance in the four path racing into the turn,
made steady progress in that path nearing upper stretch to challenge for command approaching the furlong marker, then took over and went clear under
some right handed pressure. JOURNEYIST was urged in pursuit of the leaders along the rail in the opening stages, tipped to the three path leaving the half
mile marker while steadily closing the gap on the leaders racing into the turn, moved to challenge for command three deep between foes racing into upper
stretch but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. RAP STAR was settled between foes while shifting out a bit in the opening stages,
gradually gained contention while shifting to the three path in upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share in the closing stages. JUST A
WONDER angled inwards while being urged prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, was headed in upper stretch, then gave way in
the closing stages while losing third late under some tepid handling. MILLIONAIRE WALTZ was settled last racing well off the field to the turn, swung out to
the four path in upper stretch and displayed some belated interest. GRACIE WILL SMILE settled out of striking distance near the inside racing to the turn
and failed to menace thereafter. I THINK I KNOW YOU sprinted to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn into
upper stretch and gave out abruptly leaving the furlong marker.

Footnotes
PERFECT DIVA took up a tracking position three deep racing through the backstretch into the turn, steadily drew into striking distance entering upper
stretch, then responded to firm right, then left handed encouragement to just collar LUSCIOUS in the finals stages to prevail. The latter came through close
quarters along the inside to gain the advantage, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shifted out to the two path racing
through upper stretch, grudgingly maintained the advantage past midstretch but yielded to the winner nearing the wire. AROSE FOR LYLA broke inwards
making contact with U CAN DO IT at the start, was settled in hand off the leaders racing three wide into the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and
continued willingly in the closing stages to close the gap on the top pair late. MY BOSS LADY tracked off the leaders while angling to the inside in the
opening quarter, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch gaining position inside foes but had no final kick in the final furlong. U CAN DO IT, bumped
at the start while being forced into READY AT MIDNIGHT, was righted, then urged pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn and gave
out entering upper stretch. SENORITA AURORA, off slowly, then cut off at the start, never gained contention. READY AT MIDNIGHT, bumped soundly at
the start, settled off the leaders near the inside early but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
W W COOKIE MONSTER shied inwards avoiding HUEY ATTACK at the start making contact with MON AMI FUZZIE, was righted, then urged between foes
disputing the pace, pressed the issue inside a rival while angling to the rail racing into the turn, asserted himself racing into upper stretch to gain a clear
advantage, then held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. HUEY ATTACK ducked inwards at the start, was quickly righted, then rated off
the first flight outside a rival racing through the backstretch, shifted to the four path racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just
edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. WHAT'S UP DUDE, forwardly placed four wide in attendance to the pace racing through the backstretch,
continued in pursuit of the leaders three wide into the turn, couldn't close the gap on the winner while gaining second midstretch and weakened nearing the
wire. DEVILEYE, bumped from both sides, then knocked back at the start, settled into stride along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued with an even effort inside foes to improve position. LOCAMOTOR broke readily to gain a narrow advantage three deep between foes,
forced the pace between rivals, then outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, couldn't match that foe nearing the lane and gave way in upper stretch.
ARCHIEMYBOY, prompted to contend inside foes in the opening furlong, was eased off the pace while switching well off the inside on the backstretch,
raced five wide into the stretch and made no real impression. MON AMI FUZZIE, bumped, then squeezed back between rivals at the start, never gained
contention. WILE E PEYOTE ducked out bumping DEVILEYE at the start, flashed brief pace inside rivals prompting the pace but was through early.

Footnotes
LASTFORTINOFAMILY, in touch with the first flight three deep between foes in the opening stages, continued under rating conceding some position to the
leaders in the second furlong, was prompted to advance on those rivals three deep racing into the turn, moved to challenge for command leaving the
midway point of the bend, wrested the advantage while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch and drew well clear through the closing stages under firm
encouragement. MINISTRY OF ART broke readily to race in touch with the leaders four deep between foes in the opening stages, was eased off the pace in
the second furlong, tracked the leaders from out of striking distance racing into the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and continued with interest
to gain the place honors in the closing stages. WHATA SHOW OFF was settled last racing through the opening stages, switched out racing into the turn
gaining position, angled to the five path in upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share in the closing stages. HATCHET CREEK
raced on terms with the leaders five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, briefly resisted the
winner's bid while shifting to the inside nearing upper stretch but gave way in the drive. TO THE BANK, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside in the
opening stages, conceded some ground tracking the leaders along the rail racing into the turn and steadily faded into the lane. POWERFUL MAN, urged
inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
NEW RULES sprinted clear of the field along the inside racing through the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch and maintained a safe
advantage to the end under brisk handling. BOBBIE TOO TOO tracked the pacesetter between rivals in second flight racing to the turn, was prompted to
gain some position a bit off the inside nearing the lane, drifted inwards in upper stretch, but was righted in the closing stages continuing in pursuit of the
winner to prove best of the others. CHARLO tracked the leaders just behind the second flight racing three wide into the turn, then continued evenly in that
path to late stages while earning a share. ENCHILADA was rated between rivals in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the turn, saved ground
to upper stretch and continued with an even effort to gain some position. SONG AND A KISS tracked well off the second flight racing four wide to the turn,
then continued in that path into the lane while finishing evenly late. IRISH HALO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn and failed to
seriously menace. CATNIP KITTEN was settled last near the inside racing through the backstretch and proved no threat. CAMPFIRE TALES made brief
pursuit of the eventual winner along the rail, bore out badly racing into the turn and completed the final three furlongs in hand.
