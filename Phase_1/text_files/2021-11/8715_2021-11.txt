Footnotes
MY SACRED PLACE rated a slim lead inside, came under moderate pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced with a clear advantage at the rail on the
far turn and was kept alert in the stretch. SUSPIROS rated close to the early pace toward the inside, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and dug in through the stretch to hold second. GOOFY BOY settled off the rail on the opening turn then eased
outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished well while gaining on the runner-up.
DYNAMIC DAY stalked two deep then challenged at the three eighths pole, remained close through the backstretch but dropped back leaving the quarter
pole and ran evenly in the lane. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly.
SCOTTISH MAN rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, but weakened in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
MINISTRY OF MAGIC settled off the pace inside on the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, angled three
wide entering the stretch, dug in to take over later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. HOT FUDGE SONDE settled off the pace in the two and three
paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, contested the edge off the rail through the far turn, drifted
a bit and gave up the nod into the stretch, but quickly recovered stride and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. CATFISH rated a slim lead inside
entering the first turn, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught toward the quarter and dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the
rail on the far turn, recovered the edge into the lane but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. C R'S MANDATE rounded the first turn in the three
path and settled off the pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn then flattened the final furlong. TYRY
TYRANNOSAURUS rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled well off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little further. BEAR'S ESTATE angled in to stalk two deep, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole then faded into the far turn. MODERN DAY ROMANCE saved ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch but showed little
response.

Footnotes
SHERIFF'S KID stalked the early pace off the rail, bid between horses approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep nearing the five
sixteenths, contested the edge on the far turn then dueled determinedly to draw clear of RAISED WRONG in later yards, while the latter rated the pace
inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was headed at the five sixteenths but remained close to late stretch before relenting.
COLETTE'S SPIRIT saved ground just off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, eased to the three path entering
the stretch and was gaining on the runner-up. LOOKIN BACK angled to the inside early and was roughed off the heels of Collette's Spirit into the first turn,
eased out at the nine sixteenths pole and bid from the seven sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn but showed little more. CLASSY BUT SASSY
rounded the first turn about the four path then angled in to stalk two deep leaving the nine sixteenths pole, picked up the chase toward the three eighths but
weakened in the three path of the far turn. TAPIZAR GIRL hopped from the gate, rounded the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

raced close off the rail on the far turn, and while able to gain slightly in the stretch, had to settle for second best. WHOSE THAT LADY settled off the pace
inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, flattened from the head of the lane and just held on for third. POSH
PRINCESS settled back about the three path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of
the far turn and was gaining on the tiring Whose That Lady. UNEXPECTEDLY settled back off the rail then eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving
the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn but showed little in the lane. SARAH BELLUM rated close inside, picked up the chase toward the

UNSHAKABLE U broke sharply on the lead and set a well reserved pace inside, came under a bit of pressure into the far turn, raced at the rail through the
turn and was steadily handled to late stretch. ANNA ROCKS stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
then dueled clear of WHO U GONNA CALL in late stretch, while the latter settled just off the pace toward the inside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn then relented second inside the sixteenth pole. LADY FOX settled back off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path and finished well while gaining on third. C V'S POWERPAK saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. THE BETTER ONE settled off the pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. EARNED THE SHOT settled off the pace about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. UNCAPTURED RUBY broke inward while bobbling and hit the stall gate, ran in the four path of
the first turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NEVER COMPROMISE exchanged contact with Hello Carlo leaving the gate then steadied in tight at the rail into the first turn and settled just off the pace,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms leaving the far turn, took the nod just inside the eighth pole, dueled clear and was steadily handled
to hold on. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground off the pace the opening turn, gave chase into the backstretch and steadily improved in the three path of the far
turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. JEFFERY SCOTT settled off the pace in the three and four
paths, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in to briefly occupy second place in late yards but ceded that position
nearing the wire. BUZZHOUND settled back off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, angled to the six
path into the stretch and finished evenly to pass rivals. HELLO CARLO exchanged contact with Never Compromise leaving the gate and settled off the pace
inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close entering the stretch then flattened later yards. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY took the lead
toward the five eighths pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, raced with the edge at the rail on the far turn but was
caught inside the eighth pole and flattened stride. LUFTY'S KISSES rounded the opening turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and
showed little response. NATIVE COURAGE had the lead through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
but faded on the far turn. HIGH PRINT dropped well back.
