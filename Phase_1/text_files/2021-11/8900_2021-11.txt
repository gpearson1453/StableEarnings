Footnotes
ENCROACHMENT lightly bumped with inside foe at the start, briefly led then forced the pace while outside foe, gained front passing quarter marker, edged
away and held under steady handling. CALI BAY (IRE) tracked leading pair into and on the turn, continued on two path into the stretch, tipped out three
wide in the lane, responded from right handed urging and was along late for second. SQUARE CAT was sent up inside to grab lead, set pressured pace into
and on the bend, relinquished command passing quarter pole, continued willingly inside but was out finished late for the place. FLINTMORE chased from off
the rail, remained three wide into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, remained well off the rail and went willingly to the wire. DANIEL'S MAGIC
bumped lightly with outside rival leaving the gate, saved ground chasing the pace, exited the turn three wide, moved out further in the upper stretch and was
no threat. TOP ROYAL angled over nearing the far turn, chased two wide around the bend, later secured the rail but lacked needed response. DANCE
COMPANY settled outside, was four then three wide leaving the backstretch, moved up slightly around the turn but failed to sustain effort. RACKATAPTAP
reserved while three wide, shifted inward, trailed from the inside into the stretch and did not threaten. WHACKO KID chased on two path, gained the rail on
the turn, continued inside into the stretch, came out some and weakened.

Footnotes
SECRET TOUCH forced pace outside leader into the backstretch, moved alongside that rival passing three-eighths marker, gained front, extended lead
under asking in upper stretch and proved best under steady hand encouragement late. MAD GRACE was three wide into the backstretch, continued on
same path then was three deep into far turn, dueled three wide and between rivals in the final sixteenth and gamely gained the place. T BONES TRICK
settled inside, saved ground chasing the leaders, hugged the rail departing the final bend, battled gamely inside through the drive and narrowly missed the
place. SAYIN GRACE caught six wide into initial turn, angled in some stalked three then four wide into the stretch, battled outside rivals through the lane
and was out finished. BUILDER was off a bit slow and bumped leaving the gate, settled inside, also saved ground to second turn, came two wide into the
stretch, between rivals on two path through the lane and narrowly missed better placing. SALAH three wide early, stalked from between foes to the second
turn, came in slightly, in bit tight departing final turn and weakened. INVICTATATUS stepped to the front, set pressured pace from along the rail, was
overtaken on the second turn, drifted out some entering the stretch and weakened. FAMILY BIZ caught five wide into first turn, angled in some, chased from
bit off the rail, dropped back past half-mile marker and also weakened.

Footnotes
ZERO TOLERANCE was off bit slow and got bumped at the start, rushed up from between foes, forced the pace outside leader into the turn, moved
alongside midway on the bend, gained front then shook free in upper stretch and safely held. NIGHTLIFE settled inside, got put in tight quarters along the
rail and dropped back at the three-eights pole, continued inside around the bend, angled out bit then rallied strongly to clearly best others. STORMING
LADY bobbled leaving the gate, stalked while outside rival, between foes into the turn, gained the rail, was inside runner-up in upper stretch and gamely
gained the show. SOUTHERN MAMA lost path at the start, settled off the rail, chased three wide into the bend, remained on same path to the stretch, had a
mild late rally and just missed third. TRICKLE IN broke inward slightly, sped to front, set pace from the inside, lost lead departing the turn and weakened
inside. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU bumped inner rival at the start, settled off the rail, between foes nearing quarter marker, continued on two path into the stretch
and weakened inside.

Footnotes
DREAM ROBBER broke out, flashed good early foot, contested pace outside rival into and around the turn, continued prolonged duel in the lane,
exchanged leads outside foe then responded from strong handling nearing the wire and inched away to prevail. HEAD FOR BUSINESS pushed the gate
open prior to the start, broke out slightly, tracked leading duo early from two path, tipped out three wide exiting the turn, closed steadily from outside then got
up in final jump for second while four deep on the wire. SOTTOCAPO was fractious in the gate prior, sent up inside to engage winner, dueled around the
turn and well into the stretch then gave ground grudgingly approaching the wire and lost the place on final jump. LEMON SUSHI off slow, tracked pace from
the inside, continued along the rail on the turn, closed in later stages, came out slightly and narrowly missed while three deep and between rivals at the
finish. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE chased from off the rail, remained three wide around the turn and into the stretch and lacked needed late response.
MIZZEN POWER was off slow, settled off pace, saved ground throughout but never reached contention in the stretch. JUNGLE ROAR chased three wide
into and on the turn, came out further entering the stretch and was never a threat.
