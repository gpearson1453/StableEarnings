OUR CARAVAN In hand four wide up the backstretch, tracked three from the rail on the last turn, collared the leader a furlong out and under the whip
narrowly bested ROYAL SUSPECT for the win. ROYAL SUSPECT Set the pace along the three path into the backstretch, showed the way with a lengthy
lead, was collared a furlong out, battled to the line and finished gamely inside. KINGFISH In hand along the three path, continued that way to the top of the
lane, lodged a bid, was no match for the top pair and then wrapped up late. HIGH COMMAND Ducked in at the start, four wide on the first turn, two path
after that, saved ground on the last turn and weakened inside. BELLAGIO Broke slow, checked after that, lagged back, four wide on the last turn and
finished wide. THIS CAT CAN FLY Saved ground and tired. BLOOD MOON Tracked four wide into the backstretch, three path after that, two path midway

MY MAGGIE Away on top, toyed with MIDNIGTH MINDSET to midway on the turn, took charge without asking into the lane, widened and then wrapped up
with a sixteenth to go to win easily. WINNIPEG WONDER Well placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it and finished well to earn the
place. MIDNIGHT MINDSET Vied for the lead along the two path, altered out to the three path into the lane, chased and weakened. AS YOU WERE Broke
two lengths slow, five wide early, four wide on the turn and weakened. COUNT ON FRIENDS Broke slow, two path on the turn trailing, was outrun.

Footnotes
QUEEN ARELLA Tracked along the three path, gained to take on the leader at the top of the lane, put that one away and under pressure outran
PENDOLINO to the wire. PENDOLINO Slow to load, close up along the three path, continued on that path into the lane, asked, gained and just missed.
FAIR LASSIE Unhurried along the two path, responded late and earned a share. MIND OF GOLD In hand along the rail early, gained some inside into the
lane, eased out and weakened. TRIVIA Unhurried along the two path into the turn, three path out of it and weakened. SWEET SHALLOTS Away best, set
the pace along the rail, was collared the top of the lane and gave way.
