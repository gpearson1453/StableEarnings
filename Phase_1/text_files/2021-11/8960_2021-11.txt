Footnotes
PRAYER BOOK broke a bit slow, moved up then chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into upper
stretch, gained to take the lead approaching the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up until near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong
urging. EMBER pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths then carried four wide into the
stretch, gained a short lead at the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for
the place. VIKING ZIM came away in good order and went to the front, set the pace under pressure from the outside, vied inside to the two path while
guided with extra left-rein pressure on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, lost the lead to the runner-up at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened but was far clear for the show. SUTTON VALLEY broke in then bumped hard with a foe and was off a bit slow, moved out
leaving the chute then was reserved on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, dropped back while moving closer to the two path around the
five-sixteenths and capitulated. ARROWHEART was ridden along off the pace, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch then drifted out outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. FLIGHT TO PARADISE broke a bit slow, moved out at the rear, was urged along
on the outside, went four wide on the turn and also failed to threaten. OCEAN DEEP was taken in hand early then came under coaxing, dropped back
outside the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. SONIC SPEED was bumped soundly at the start and off a bit slow, settled
towards the back, saved ground under urging on the turn and was no factor. VICTORY ANTHEM was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the
backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and retreated.

Footnotes
PROFUSION broke out at the start bumping WESTERN ADVANTAGE and squeezing that rival back in tandem with pressure outside from MUCHO
SUNRISE, raced four wide in aim of the front early on before engaging in a duel with BREAKING STONES to his inside from the five-eighths into and
through the turn when taking command five-sixteenths from home, swung four to wide into upper stretch shaking away, drew clear under a drive to prevail.
BREAKING STONES forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, took over command just inside six furlongs from home and dueled with the
aforementioned foe through the turn getting displaced from the front at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the
top one and weakened in the late stages while able to preserve the place honors. ACTUARY (GB) bobbled at the break conceding two lengths to the front
and crossed inside to chase from the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure
the show honors. MUCHO SUNSHINE got bumped at the start by WESTERN ADVANTAGE due to pressure inside from PROFUSION, chased five wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. OUCH OUCH OUCH stumbled at the start and came under
coaxing to range up and show the way early on, got headed just inside six furlongs remaining and chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BELLAMY DOLCE chased five wide under coaxing from the midway point on the turn,
went six to seven wide for home and offered no response. FOTIS got brushed at the start by MUCHO SUNRISE then got bumped by JACKS AMERICAN
PIE, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. JACKS
AMERICAN PIE broke out at the start making light contact with ACTUARY and came inwards to bump FOTIS, chased five to six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued four wide for home and tired. WESTERN
ADVANTAGE broke in at the start and was bumped by PROFUSION and got steadied when squeezed back against MUCHO SUNRISE conceding three
lengths to the front, crossed to chase along the inside coming under a ride with seven-sixteenths remaining, spun three wide for home and made no impact.
NOCTILUCENT chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the
finish.

Footnotes
FLANIGAN'S COVE broke in and bumped solidly with a foe, was taken under a tight hold early then rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the
rail on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved out in pursuit of the pacesetter near the furlong marker and got up in the final sixteenth under
strong urging to prevail. MEZCAL angled in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when set down into
upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the place. FEDERALIST PAPERS was reserved towards the rear
in the two path, waited while blocked from the five-sixteenths into upper stretch then was roused, angled out into the final furlong and finished with late
energy to garner the show. VOLADOR broke out and bumped solidly with an opponent, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back,
came under urging while three then four wide on the far turn, rallied outside passing the five-sixteenths, closed well into upper stretch, chased under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. EQUAL MEASURE went two to three wide around the opening bend, was rated in the second flight, came under
coaxing late on the backstretch, was roused three wide on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch and tired. ENTWINE (IRE) was reserved on the
inside at the rear, continued to save ground on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide, swung five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. MAOILIN established a forward position early, rounded the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was
given her cue in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.

FLOWER POINT just off the inside tracking the front under rating, remained patiently handled swinging three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path
nearing the eighth pole roused and offered up a good kick to collar the leader to her outside in the last jumps to the finish and prevail. GIACOSA two to three
wide in pursuit, advanced on the front into the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, rallied to take command a
furlong out, dug in under lone threat to the outside and was caught in the final strides to the finish. SAILINGINTOTHEWIND attended the leader to the
outside in the two path, advanced on that rival to apply pressure for the initial time three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while able to secure the show honors. MUCHA MEZQUINA established the front and
showed the way rated along the inside under attendance from the aforementioned foe but facing little pressure untoil that rival upped the ante with three
furlongs to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to command until
displaced a furlong out, then weakened in the late going. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SEVEN LILIES raced off the early pace, was carried out while moving up with a half-mile to run, tracked then chased four wide on the turn, gained to make
a bid into the stretch, took the advantage outside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE showed good speed and
disputed the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then came further out around the three-sixteenths, lost the lead to the
winner while still on his inside lead before the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place. OUR MAN MIKE broke out then was
corrected by the rider, raced at the rear under urging, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved out around the
three-sixteenths and improved position to get the show. BIG BROWN SHOES moved up then disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail
under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. COPPER CHALICE broke in then was taken
up with a snatch of the right rein, spotted the front a couple lengths, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail under the crop in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. BIG CASTLE broke a half-step slow then was hustled, settled outside under some urging, was put to stronger encouragement while four then five
wide on the turn and failed to respond. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE broke a bit slow, bumped with DOUBLEPOUR while moving up early, advanced to make a
bid while shifting out near the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. DOUBLEPOUR came out early
and bumped with ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE then was taken up some, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no
factor.

FONTANAFREDDA coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a
drive issuing a challenge a furlong out, knocked heads to the sixteenth marker when taking over command, then inched away to the finish kept to task.
TOUGH STREET brushed the near side stall at he start and came under hustling to show the way in hand along the inside under pressure from TRINITY
TITOLI to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch shaking off that rival confronted by the
aforementioned foe, tussled with that rival to the sixteenth pole when headed for the front, then fought on inside to preserve the place honors. TRUE
EMPRESS six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide
into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. CARBON four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TRINITY TITOLI coaxed from the gate,
prompted the pace from the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch getting shaken off and weakened in
the late stages. LADY OF THOROTON stumbled at the start conceding three lengths to the front, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. FROSTY INVASION hustled from the gate, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from midway, went three wide into upper stretch and tired.
COOLCATSNKITTENS just off the inside in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. DREAM
CENTRAL chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and never got involved. CARA'S DAYDREAMER
struck the near side stall at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along

RUDY ROD brushed with a rival at the start while off a bit slow, was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, rallied outside into the
stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under steady urging. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN was hustled from the
start, showed good speed while angling in and set the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, lost the advantage inside the
furlong marker and was outfinished but just held the place. HORN OF PLENTY brushed with a foe while off a half-step slow, angled in under urging, saved
ground while getting closer on the turn, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and weakened then just missed the place but was clear for the show.
QUICKFLASH was sent hard from the start, showed speed on the inside of a foe but was beaten to the lead, moved out behind that foe then chased, vied in
the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. BAR FOURTEEN bumped soundly with a foe
at the start, moved up under urging, chased four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path nearing the quarter-pole and capitulated. JERUSALEM GATES
was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and failed to threaten.

was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the stretch and was no factor. AIR SHOW bumped soundly with an opponent at the
start, was hard ridden off the pace, dropped back two then three wide on the turn and faltered then was not urged in the stretch.

Footnotes
NEVER SURPRISED established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until set down continuing in the inside
route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task establishing a course record. SAFE CONDUCT tracked the leader from the two path in closest
aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths as that rival began to slip away, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on to just preserve the place honors over a pair. GUSSY MAC (IRE) just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. OCALA DREAM two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. KYGO (GER) saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing
three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position passing tired rivals. MONITION two to three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ORIGINAL tracked the pace along the inside coming under
encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BEES AND HONEY broke a bit awkwardly then was taken in hand early, went around the first turn in the four path, was rated on the outside, came under
urging late on the backstretch, chased four wide on the far turn, brushed with a foe while making a bid into upper stretch, took the advantage at the
three-sixteenths, fought with the runner-up into the final furlong then drew clear under strong urging. PLAYED HARD went to the front, set the pace under a
snug hold in the two path, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to hold
the place. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL bumped soundly with a rival shortly after the start, was taken under a strong hold then tugged at the bit while keen under
restraint, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back, came under coaxing around the nine-sixteenths, was ridden along while two
then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. SHALIMAR GARDENS brushed the
outside of the gate at the start then bumped solidly with foes on both sides, saved ground around the opening bend, was rated just off the pace, came under
urging around the nine-sixteenths, chased inside to the two path on the final turn and came up empty. VEGAS WEEKEND prompted the pace on the outside
in the three path, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. HYBRID ECLIPSE bumped soundly with a foe
just after the start, settled at the rear on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VALMONT hustled from the gate, chased along the inside tipping out near the quarter pole to spin just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the
drive, dug in under a drive rallying between foes to take command a furlong from home, then gamely held sway to the finish kept to task. BORU chased just
off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the two path straightened away and offered up
late foot to threaten nearing the finish but missed at the end. SOUTH SEA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to bid a furlong from home, then tussled head to head with VALMONT until shaken off inside the final sixteenth and
kept on clear for the show honors. SMILE BRYAN chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, then
tipped out a path straightened away and kicked on belatedly to the finish. BOURBON MISSION three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. STANHOPE ranged up after the start to advance inside taking narrow
command half a mile from home, showed the way through the turn and was let out cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and
relented a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. R BOY BODE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five
wide for home and weakened. MONTAUK DADDY chased just off the inside, got shuffled mildly back when UNCLE ROAMIE faded in front with
five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide into upper stretch under a drive and tired. UNCLE ROAMIE hustled from the gate, showed the way early on
from the two path coaxed along until headed for the front along the inside by STANHOPE half a mile out, chased through the turn and faded, went four wide
into upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the finish. Please note UNCLE ROAMIE ran with no front shoes.
