Footnotes
ATONE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, hit the front nearing the three sixteenths, ducked in passing the chute,
then was corrected and drew clear to prove best under a mild drive. JOURNEYMAN was allowed to settle early towards the inside, continued on the inside
on the turn, moved three wide leaving the turn and then shifted in to the inside by the furlong marker and had a good finish on the inside to gain the place
award. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside, was rated along the front end, then was headed by the quarter pole,
angled out nearing the furlong marker and faded, held show award. EMARAATY (GB) was rated along three wide, tipped out four wide leaving the turn for
aim, but had no kick. SOULMATE hit the gate at the start, then settled three wide, came four wide into the drive and offered no rally. WINNING FACTOR
was settled in along the inside and lacked a rally. SUMMER TO REMEMBER was rated along the inside into the first turn, then was a bit tough to handle
entering the backstretch, continued on the inside to the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way early on before settling in closest aim of the duel four paths off the inside,
tucked three wide through the turn and steadily advanced to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch,
received a pair a taps to the right side and drifted in while going clear to prevail comfortably at the end. COURAGEOUS GIRL shied in from GOODNIGHT
OLIVE breaking inwards and bumped and pinched out CAFE SOCIETY in concert with FIRING CAROL, then got clipped behind by CAFE SOCIETY,
chased three wide until briefly tucked to the two path half a mile from home, tipped back three wide midway on the turn coming under coaxing, angled six
wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to just get up for the place honors. HAPPY SOPHIA four paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing just off the inside three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. MORE MOONSHINE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide for home and weakened. CAFE SOCIETY got bumped at the start between rivals and was pinched back, then clipped
the rear of COURAGEOUS GIRL and bobbled being taken hold of soon after conceding about five lengths to the front, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. PRIMACY five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. FIRING
CAROL broke out at the start bumping and pinching CAFE SOCIETY in tandem with COURAGEOUS GIRL, chased just off the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, went four wide for home and tired. MAKINGCENTS dueled from the two path with BRAVO REGINA to her inside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, yielded the front as a pair to the eventual winner five-sixteenths from home, faded and then tired in the stretch. BRAVO REGINA dueled
inside of the aforementioned foe under coaxing from the three-eighths, got overtaken in tandem with five-sixteenths remaining, faded and went three wide
into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MISS J MCKAY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside in hand just off the leader's hindquarters, cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away, came under a left handed crop attempting to tip out to the two path, successfully completed the move a sixteenth out leaning briefly on
ROYAL ADDRESS who in turn leaned on REAGAN'S EDGE, and surged late to get up in the final strides to the finish. GOTTA GO MO showed the way
lightly coaxed along the inside under pressure from ROYAL ADDRESS to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under late threat and was caught in the last jumps to the finish. TASS broke a beat slow, then grew briefly rank when steadied at the
start, chased four then three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
STOLEN HOLIDAY broke in at the start brushing GOGO SHOES, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five
wide for home and offered up a mild bid. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) prompted the leader from the outside in the two path, got set down continuing just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was briefly leaned on as MISS J MCKAY tipped out a sixteenth from home and in turn leaned on
REAGAN'S EDGE before being outfinished in the late going. GOGO SHOES brushed at the start by STOLEN HOLIDAY, who broke inwards, chased just off
the inside down the backstretch and then inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and was outkicked. PRINCESS FAWZIA coaxed from the
start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was outkicked. MY SWEET
WIFE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn getting ridden along with seven-sixteenths to run, spun two to three wide for home and
made no impact. REAGAN'S EDGE three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and was weakening when leaned on briefly by ROYAL ADDRESS due to pressure from MISS J MCKAY tipping out and paused when backing away to
the finish.
