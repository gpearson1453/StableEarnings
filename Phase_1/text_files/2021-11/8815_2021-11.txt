Footnotes
SOUPER SUCCESS pressed the pacesetter, raced two-wide on the turn where he made a bid and took a short lead, briefly lost the lead in midstretch but
dug in gamely and proved best. WESTERN TROUBLE stalked the pace while racing on the inside, angled off of the rail at the 1/4 pole while looming very
dangerously, took the lead briefly in the stretch but was outkicked. KITTEN'S SOLUTION stalked the pace while racing off of the rail, was asked for more
midway around the turn while racing two-wide and chased to the wire. CORDUROY ROAD took a slight stumble shortly after the break, raced widest while
in midpack on the backstretch, was three-wide on the turn and offered a mild rally in the stretch. O'KRATOS got out to set the pace while taking some
pressure, lost his lead midway around the turn and weakened in the stretch. LUCKY GIRASOL trailed the field in the early stages, angled to the outside
nearing the 1/4 pole and offered no rally. PIVEN raced between foes in midpack in the early stages and came up empty midway around the turn.

Footnotes
U S NAVY CROSS sat inside in midpack on the first turn, stayed close but seemed to be dropping back when two to three wide midway on the far turn but
rallied four wide at the quarter pole and tipped out to the six path turning for home, closing doggedly on the outside to the front at the seventy yard marker
and holding safe to the wire. UPSTART GENTLEMAN was two to three wide on the first turn in midpack, closed in two to four wide on the far turn and got by
the leader at the eighth pole, passed by the winner at the seventy yard marker but gave way grudgingly. GREEN FLEET off the pace and along the inside
on the first turn, came rail to three wide inside the eventual winner late on the far turn and while no match for that one was game to grab the show spot late.
NEWPORT AGENT chased along the rail around the first turn, dropped back on the far turn before rallying inside the winner and the third place finisher
down the stretch to grab a minor award. READY HERO off the pace early, commenced a rally while two to three wide on the far turn and tipped out into the
seven path turning for home, down the same path as the winner but only able to best the balance of tiring runners while still outside. POUND GREEN off the
pace and along the inside, closed nicely in upper stretch to get in behind the pack at the sixteenth pole but was not persevered with in the final stages when
a clear path wasn't available. DANCERS GHOST chased the leaders early in the two path, was behind the top group turning for home and squeezed up
inside the tiring pacesetter in the final furlong but the top finishers were long gone. VICTORY TOWN set a fast pace while stalked throughout, headed by his
stablemate at the eighth pole and called it a day. MUSKOKA GIANT was well off the pace before rallying two to four wide on the far turn and out in the
seven path turning for home, closed well in the final sixteenth after changing to his proper lead at that point. LOMAKI'S GEM stalked the early leader
throughout, took a run at that one on the far turn but was repelled, retreating in the stretch. HELL BENT trailed throughout and never entered contention.

Footnotes
SILENT RUNNER broke inward then showed speed, set a pressured pace, moved clear through the turn, widened under a drive in the stretch and finished
under a brisk hand ride. I'M A CHI TOO forced the pace, chased on the turn and finished gamely. SOUPER RUSH forced the pace, stalked on the turn and
chased through the stretch. FUN COOL settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail late turn and chased through the stretch. BID ONCE hit the gate
leaving, settled in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn and finished evenly. BOSSY HOLIDAY forced the pace, chased four and five-wide on the turn but
lacked a closing response. DROP A CARIBOU broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn but had no response in the stretch.
WILD RIVER WOLF got away slowly, raced from off the pace, was hustled on the turn but failed to menace. MUSICAL RELOAD raced in mid pack, dropped
to the rear on the turn and lacked a rally.
