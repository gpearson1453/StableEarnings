ROUGH GUY Broke slow, lagged back along the three path, gained some into the last turn, drifted in slamming KHALI'S DREAM leaving the five-sixteenths
pole, angled out in the lane, lodged a bid, clipped heels with NAVY KING when that one drifted in at the furlong marker, responded outside and outran the
latter to the wire. NAVY KING Vied for the lead three across to the top of the lane, drifted out nearing the furlong marker into the path of ROUGH GUY and
then appeared erratic from the sixteenths pole to the wire while just missing. DR. LIVINGSTON Lagged back along the three path, four wide into the lane
and rallied wide. HAYAI Well placed along the two path, four wide into the lane, reached the leaders four across and faded. DISENGAGE Vied for the lead
along the rail to the furlong marker and faded. PERSISTENT DANGER Vied for the lead from between to the top of the lane and tired. KHALI'S DREAM In
hand close up after a half mile, two path into the last turn, was slammed by the winner leaving the five-sixteenths pole, took up sharply losing all chance. A
stewards inquiry was posted concerning the race. Also claims of were lodged by the rider of HAYAI against the winner and NAVY KING for interference at
the furlong marker, resulted in the disqualification of the winner to last. Also NAVY KING was disqualified from second and placed behind ROUGH GUY in
seventh.

BETTY RUBBLE Away best, set the pace along the two path, opened up and under the whip turned back STARSHIP PRECIOUS for the win. STARSHIP
PRECIOUS Broke slow, rushed out, tracked along the rail, eased out and finished well. KEEN ON ME In hand four wide into the turn, continued wide into
the lane and finished well. QUAYSADILLA Broke slow, unhurried saving ground and made a mild bid. SAVING SOULS Broke slow, unhurried along the two
path, three path into the lane and then altered out late . STRATUSFACTION Tracked along the three path around the turn, chased and faded. MAJESTIC
TOES Saved ground and tired inside. POOKIELICIOUS Ducked out at the start, four wide on the turn and finished wide.
