Footnotes
THREE O ONE assumed command from the start, jumping well on the front end and wasn't really challenged until coming out of the home turn heading
towards the last, jumped the last with the advantage and held of a hard charging rival at the wire. MAKE A STAND was always close to the leaders, picked
up a spot going down the backside for the final fime to stalk the leader on the home turn, was in striking distance jumping the last and was gaining ground
through the stretch but just missed at the wire. HOMERHAYES was in no hurry during the early going, closed the gap after the third last jump, rallied on the
home bend then flattened out. THE KID ROCKS stalked the pace for the first mile and a half, then gave way to several rivals on the backside for the final
time and raced evenly from the home turn. TWENTYONEGUNS raced towards the back and never could gain any ground on the field. WHERE'S OLIVER
was in contention until the third last then stopped. BRAVE DEACON was in contention when he fell at the last jump and walked off.

GOSTISBEHERE was well placed mid pack, got in gear heading into the home turn to capture the lead at the second last fence then drew clear from there.
PEAT MOSS (IRE) drafted the leader through out rallied on the home turn but was no match for the winner. ARGENTIC (FR) settled mid pack, rallied on the
far turn to be in striking distance but failed to sustain bid. SHAKA dwelt briefly at the start and then got going some fifteen lenghs behind the others, casually
closed the gap to catch the field with a circuit to go, then started to pick up rivals on the backside for the final time to get into somekind of position on the
final turn to have a chance then flattened out. DON'T SHOUT (IRE) showed the way for the first two miles then faded on the home turn. MR. SARINANA
was in contention with a circuit to go then retreated on the backside for the final time. JUMP SHIP never really got into the race and was no threat here.
