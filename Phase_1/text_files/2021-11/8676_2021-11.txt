JETTIN PEGASUS settled outside, responded with a rapid move five wide into the far turn, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip under a hand
ride to win as much the best. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE with the second flight two wide, offered a mild bid on the far turn in the four path then was no match
for the winner while clearly second best. BEACH BABE advanced in the five path on the second turn then leveled off. DREAMINOFJUSTICE was fractious
in the gate prior to the start then passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CHECK OUT LINE with the second flight inside, weakened in the stretch. LAISSEZ
FAIRE pressed the pace two wide through the second turn and gave way late. SPIT'S IMAGE was outrun. CIRCLE WILL RUN made the lead soon after the
start, set the pace along the inside to the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
MOANA'S TALE with the second flight into the turn, rallied outside rivals three wide in the middle of the racetrack, made the lead late and drew off to win in
hand. WAR CAT made the lead soon after the start, set the pace near the inside, drifted to the six path entering the stretch then was no match for the
winner. MAGESTAL BASTIDA well back early, found her best stride late in the three path. ALLIE AND JAZZY chased the early pace,, loomed boldly two
wide midway on the turn, kept pressure to mid stretch, drifted out past mid track and lost ground. ALEXA G bore in at the start, was righted quickly then
through after half.

Footnotes
DOUBLE DEEP broke outward bumping FAT DADDY causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside, set all the pace while nicely rated and maintained
his advantage under brisk handling. LATIN SPICE pressed the pace two wide and finished clearly second best. SURF AND TURF was bumped at the start
and passed tiring rivals late in the six path. FAT DADDY was bumped at the start, stalked the leaders near the inside, shifted out and loomed boldly three
wide past the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. HEZA HANDFUL saved ground, improved position into the stretch then leveled off. FRANCO was
no factor. MAXIMIZER was bumped at the start, had speed from the start, inched closer three wide before a half, had speed into the stretch then came up
empty. ZALINSKY was outrun.

Footnotes
CLEVERLY WICKED sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and drew off under mild urging to win as much the best.
BEARPATH never far back, rallied through the stretch five wide and finished second best. DREAM PRIZES unhurried early, closed a gap late along the rail.
KID RUSSELL chased the winner three wide and was outfinished. MA MOO POWER failed to menace. SMASHED POTATOES chased the winner from the
inside and weakened in deep stretch. RONNI'S STORM close up through the turn two wide, faded. HEIDI'S SINATRA was outrun. MACADOOOO KID was
no factor. MOBIL MAGIC swung wide and was through early.
