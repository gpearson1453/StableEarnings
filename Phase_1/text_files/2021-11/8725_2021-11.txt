Footnotes
CODY'S WISH chased the pace early, ranged up three wide nearing the lane, took over command into the lane then drew away late in the stretch while
geared down to the wire. SCARLET FUSION chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the
winner and held place late. ANNEAU D'OR tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but drifted out a bit and did
not have enough for place in the late stages. MR. TIP raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. PERFECT
SILENT CAT raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch drive. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE was in
the five path into the lane and improved position. DIVINE LEADER bobbled at the start, set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and gave way
late in the stretch. BEARS WATCHING stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and empty late in the stretch. CAPT. MAESTRI was never
involved. OTTOTHELEGEND was never a threat. ISLAND BOY was through after a half.
