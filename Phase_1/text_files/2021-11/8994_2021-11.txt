Footnotes
PARATUS went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace on the outside, raced three wide on the final turn, was asked outside the
five-sixteenths, gained to make an outside bid into upper stretch, took the lead inside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up into the final sixteenth
and proved best under good handling. CITY AT NIGHT stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, went two to three wide on the first turn, prompted the
pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the final turn, took the lead into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken
while clear for the place. MY BROTHER CAM bumped hard with foes just after the start, angled in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened but held the show. GOOD MEDICINE broke in then bumped hard with an
opponent, was in tight off heels into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, was reserved near the back, went three wide while roused on the far
turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response. WICK LOVES A FIGHT leaned out at the start, moved in early then went
around the opening bend in the two path, was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths and came up
empty. RUTHENIAN bumped with foes on both sides at the start, traveled three wide around the first turn, was keen under restraint early on the backstretch,
went three wide while roused on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. IMMINENT STORM was taken up while rank into
the first turn, raced in the back half of the field under reserve in the two path, was asked on the far turn and also failed to respond. UNCLE WATER FLOW
pulled under restraint while inside through the first turn, was reserved on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and dropped out. PRINCIPALITY was last
to commence then taken up some while traveling awkwardly, went four to five wide on the turns and faltered.

Footnotes
TWO CENT TOOTSIE three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit from mid pack, advanced through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat to the inside and prevailed safely
on the wire. KISSING FROGS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied
digging in along the inside and fought on to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the line while along for the place honors. MORE GOOD TIMES saved
ground early on at the tail of the field, tipped to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, then got floated three wide as STELLA MARS tipped out from the inside,
went three then two wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to
secure the show honors. STELLA MARS saved ground near the rear of the field, tipped out to the two path with seven-sixteenths to run before tucking back
inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid kicking home
belatedly to the finish. TAPPANZEE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled until set down spinning three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. BLAME THE GODS just off the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, tucked inside at the three-eighths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no headway.
LADY FATIMA three then two wide through the first turn, settled just off the inside just off the pace, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go,
swung four wide for home and weakened. KITTEN'S ROMANCE forwardly placed four then three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in closest aim
of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.

BUSTIN BAY went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole
then came under a drive in upper stretch, shook off the runner-up into the final furlong and drew clear under steady urging. EFFIEMEISTER bumped with
rivals on both sides at the start, chased the early pace then moved up to press the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, drew even with the leader in upper
stretch but proved no match while just able to get the place. GENTLE ANNIE broke out and bumped with a rival, moved in near the half-mile pole, chased
inside to the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and just missed the place but was clear for the show. FLASHING RED bumped with
a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position without threatening.
GRINGOTTS was urged along off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. AMOS was ridden along
off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. NO DEAL chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch under the crop and tired. PEACHES AND SPICE was last away, lagged at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
WATER'S EDGE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the leader, tucked to the two path and advanced on that rival to assume command just
inside the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, shied out and was corrected, then edged clear under a
drive kept to task to the finish. SCOTTO coaxed from the gate, chased three wide isolated between the top trio and the lone rival well behind down the
backstretch, came under coaxing two to three wide at the three-eighths having joined the top three, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase
the winner home clear for the place honors. RUN FOR BOSTON grew detached at the tail of the field early on chasing along the inside, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths when making up ground through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors in the final jumps.
EMPEROR'S CAUSE coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in pursuit just off the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled
five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. EXIT RIGHT hustled from the start, established the front shortly after and showed the way in
hand just off the inside, came under pressure nearing the turn and tucked along the inside, got displaced from command just inside the seven-sixteenths
and came under coaxing in response, tipped three to four wide for home in retreat and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
UMBRIA went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, went two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied on the
outside, closed well to get the lead near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed. SANDRO THE GREAT was hustled from the start then taken under a tight hold
early, moved in before the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out while asked in upper stretch,
chased behind horses into the final furlong and finished with good courage for the place. BERNARDINO bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled,
prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead while three wide into the stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken
and just missed the place. MR. CONNECTICUT bobbled a bit leaving the chute, was keen under restraint early then reserved in the two path, came under a
drive in upper stretch, lacked room into the final furlong, was hesitantly ridden to the wire and earned the last spot in the superfecta. DREAMPOINT lost
footing behind leaving the chute, went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ACTION JACKSON was
off a bit slow, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved at the rear under a tight hold, went around the far turn in the two path, swung five wide into the
stretch then moved further out and improved position. PIVOTAL RUN was reserved on the inside, saved ground through the final turn, came under a drive in
upper stretch, lacked room from the eighth-pole to near the sixteenth-pole, steadied some in the process and missed the superfecta. BLESS BLESS
traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back, went three wide while let out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch,
angled out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. ZAP MAN broke out and bumped with a rival, set the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn,
lost the lead into the stretch and gave way. MIGHTY MEISTER saved ground around the opening bend, settled towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the
two path and was no factor. EIGHT WEEKS LONG tucked into the two path before the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced three wide on the far turn,
came six wide into the stretch, had his path taken while lacking the needed response at the sixteenth-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
EMPTY TOMB vied inside a pair early on along the inside, briefly got shaken off a bit six furlongs out before advancing once more to duel with CHRIS AND
DAVE down the backstretch and into the turn, got joined three wide by the runner up three furlongs from home and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch shaking off the middle rival engaged by FIRST CONSTITUTION straightened away, dug in under a
drive holding gamely to the finish to rebuff the challenge prevailing safely on the wire. FIRST CONSTITUTION (CHI) got bumped at the start by
AMATTEROFTIME due to pressure from TIERGAN, vied briefly with a pair to his inside before settling three wide off the duel, continued three wide through
the turn and advanced to latch on the top pair midway, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, dug in under a drive
threatening to the finish but was ultimately safely repelled to the end. TIERGAN broke in at the start bumping AMATTEROFTIME into FIRST
CONSTITUTION and pinching back AMATTEROFTIME, chased four wide from mid pack, got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths and angled out five
wide into upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick to miss for the place honors. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON broke in brushing the near side stall at the start
then bumped with LIL COMMISSIONER, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild bid. PRIORITIZE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch and rallied up the rail kicking on belatedly, but did not have enough to impact the top spots. LIL COMMISSIONER got bumped at the start by
BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and weakened in the final furlong.
DANNY CALIFORNIA coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six to seven wide at the head of the
stretch and weakened. CHRIS AND DAVE coaxed from the gate, vied briefly loosely between foes until shaking away to a brief sole command, had EMPTY
TOMB advance inside and knocked heads with that rival down the backstretch from the midway point through the turn getting joined to the outside by FIRST
CONSTITUTION and now vying once more between foes through the latter portion of the turn, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and was shaken
off straightened away, then tired in the stretch. GLORY ROAD three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper
stretch and tired. AMATTEROFTIME got bumped between foes at the start, raced sluggish early showing poor action and grew detached at the tail of the
field while five paths off the inside, continued five wide through the turn and then went six to seven wide for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHANGE OF CONTROL came away in good order, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked after turning
into the stretch, gained to take the lead into the final furlong, shook clear while drifting out a bit outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady handling.
TOO SEXY settled on the outside, was asked while two then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished with good courage for the
place. LOVE AND THUNDER (IRE) broke in and was off a step slow, was reserved off the pace under restraint, moved from the rail to the three path on the
turn, gained four wide to loom a threat into the stretch, chased in the drive and was out-kicked while able to get the show. MISS MAJORETTE dropped back
then settled towards the rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished with
late energy to get the last spot in the superfecta. PIEDI BIANCHI settled off the pace, started the turn in the two path, was carried three then four wide later
on that bend, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. ATHWAAQ showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, spun into
the two path entering the stretch then came under a drive, lost the lead into the final furlong and gave way. RAVEN'S CRY (IRE) tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the three path, chased into the final furlong and came up empty. SECURE
CONNECTION broke a step slow, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
VERGARA broke in at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, moved out late on the backstretch, was asked while two then three wide on
the far turn, gained four wide into the stretch then made an outside bid, fought on well in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. SHE'S A MIA
was reserved on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the far turn, gained to make a rail bid outside the furlong marker, battled
inside of two foes into the final sixteenth, fought with the winner to the wire and missed but narrowly earned the place. MISCHIEVOUS KISS was restless in
the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the paced, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch,
chased the vanguard in the drive and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to get the show. CAIRONI went four wide on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, came six wide into upper stretch and improved position. ANADOR (FR) settled on the inside,
turned into the stretch in the two path, was coaxed along behind horses in upper stretch, steadied while bumped by a foe near the furlong marker and
finished willingly to just miss the superfecta. SOLIB rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn,
took the lead while three wide into upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken. DETERMINED STAR went three wide on the first turn, settled
in the middle of the field on the outside, steadied a bit near the three-eighths, went around the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch,
moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. LOUELLA STREET was rank while three then two wide on the first turn then reserved
off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved in and bumped with a rival around the furlong marker and lacked the
needed kick. TASWEYA went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked under threat late on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then
lost the advantage and gave way. KINGDOM QUEEN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, lagged at the rear and was eased in the stretch but
walked off.

Footnotes
FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole and held sway to the finish. BALINESE showed the way in hand
just off the inside under pressure from the aforementioned foe, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got headed at that
station and took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. GAILHORSEWIND chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. BOSS CARA chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and kept on to the finish. R GIRL FAITH chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TIKTOKNAWAY chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. STARSHIP ROGUE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide for home and made no impact. ANCHOR LADY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for
home and tired. MISCHIEF REIGNS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, faded swinging four wide for home and tired.
GENETIC GEM broke out at the start bumping STARSHIP ROGUE and stumbled awkwardly losing the rider and suffering an injury freezing her hind end
and standing prone and was attended to by veterinarian and euthanized on track. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the start focusing on GENETIC GEM
prior to the result standing and the race being declared official.
