EPONA'S DREAM coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong out, then inched away to the finish kept to task. CARAMOCHA prompted the pace from the outside in the two path coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole on near even terms, swung five wide for home, took over the front straightened away, dug in under threat and was headed a
furlong out, ran on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. I'M FINE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled out
seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just miss for the place honors. AMITY ISLAND broke open the gate prior to the start, chased two
to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide for home and weakened in the late stages. I'M PERFECT TOO bobbled at the
start, showed the way in hand along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, yielded the front
straightened away and tired.

DOCTOR JEFF broke out at the start under coaxing, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive and held clear to the finish to a hand ride late. TRUST DADDY chased just
off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be along clear for the place honors.
LONGSHADOW three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors. PURE
PANIC stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went three wide at the head of
the stretch and offered no rally. BIZ BIZ BUZZ prompted the leader from the outside four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch and then from the two
path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and tired. HERE
COMES BILLY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive latching on the aforementioned foe a furlong out when put to a left
side crop, shied out at that station and once more nearing the sixteenth marker, fought on to the finish but was ultimately repelled at the end. NEST broke in
at the start bumping and squeezing back SURPRISINGLY in tandem with RED HOT MESS, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly for the show honors latching on the top pair as they hit the finish. SWEET AS PIE chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and kept on under a drive but was outkicked. GODDESS OF FIRE coaxed
from the gate, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, floated out four then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
five to six wide for home and tired. SURPRISINGLY got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back at the start, chased just off
the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. RED HOT MESS broke

Footnotes
GOTANDA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for
home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. D'VINICRIS four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ADDICTED TO YOU bumped at the start by TACO BEAN, got
forced to steady between foes conceding five lengths to the front, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just get up for the show honors. BOOM BOOM KABOOM three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages settling for the last major share getting nailed for the show honors in the
very last jumps to the line. JACK'S DREAM five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and was
outkicked. SANDOR CLEGANE forwardly placed just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, weakened in the
final furlong. ARMS AN ARMOR showed the way in hand just off the inside spurting away early on, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, got collared nearing the eighth pole and was eased home to the finish
weakening to the wire. HERONEANDONLY bumped at the start by ADDICTED TO YOU due to pressure from TACO BEAN, chased along the inside under
a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TACO BEAN broke out at the start bumping ADDICTED TO YOU and
forcing that rival to steady out, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact.
BABAGRAM chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK chased three then
two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.
