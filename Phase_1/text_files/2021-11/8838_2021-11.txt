RUNNING ON EMPTY settled off of the early pace, mounted a bid from the three path on the turn, was under steady right-handed encouragement inside of
the furlong marker to get by SPLIT ACES and drew clear in the end. SPLIT ACES was away well and set the pace through the turn, jumped a shadow
leaving the three-eighths marker, was under pressure from the winner leaving the turn but kept on to hold second. LOVER BOY TOM stalked the early pace
from a three to four wide position on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch while on the left lead, just missing for second. WIND IN HIS SAIL stalked the
early pace, lost ground on the turn and weakened in the late going. QUIRKY CHAOS veered in sharply at the start, mounted a bid on the turn to contest the
pace but tired in the drive.

RICKEY B was away in good order and set quick fractions through the turn while saving ground, extended the lead off of the turn and was clear in the end.
ARNO'S MANE MAN settled at the rear of the field, mounted a four wide rally leaving the turn, battled ROCKTILLYOUDROP through the lane for place
honors and just won the nod for second on the wire. ROCKTILLYOUDROP was away a step slowly and settled near the rear of the field, was three wide on
the turn, closed in the stretch while battling ARNO'S MANE MAN and just missed for the place. EMERALD MAGIC stalked the pace from a two wide
position on the turn and weakened in the drive. REGAL BORN chased the early pace from a four wide path and did not muster a late rally. CINDERELLAS
PRINCE tracked the pace while two wide between foes and tired in the stretch run.

GOOD OLD FAITHFUL was hustled to contest the early pace, was prompted by ZERO DOWN through the turn, put that foe away nearing the top of the
lane and held to win in a drive in a good debut. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS tracked the early pace from a three wide position, closed well in the stretch and
claimed the place in the final strides. UNCLE FRED settled near the rear in the early going, saved ground through the turn, gained leaving the turn but was
outkicked in the stretch and just missed for second. ELCONDOR was forwardly placed through the turn while two wide and was outfinished in the stretch
run. BARHOPSKY was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground on the turn and rallied in the stretch drive. ZERO DOWN pressed the pace through the
turn and tired in the stretch run. VANDENBERG stalked the pace through the turn while four wide and gave way in the late going.

GRINNINGEARTOEAR sat just off of the early pace while saving ground, swung out to the four path for the drive, gained ground inside of the furlong
marker and held to prevail over an oncoming runner-up. THE GREAT HAYNES settled in the early stages while three wide, angled in for the stretch run,
rallied along the rail and just missed for the win while holding for the place. IMA HAPPY CAT pressed the pace from a two wide position and was outkicked
in the stretch run. LOTSA PEPPER was away well and set the fractions while being pressured, led into the stretch but was outfinished in the closing stages.
HURLEY was away slowly, settled at the rear of the field and was not a factor. SWIFT NONNI chased the early pace from a ground saving position, swung
out for the drive and weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
MEGAMEISTER contested the early pace with SOUTHEAST ASIA through the second turn, wore down that foe leaving the second turn and drew clear in
the end. SOUTHEAST ASIA contested the pace with MEGAMEISTER through the second turn, could not stay on terms with that rival leaving the second
turn and was outfinished in the stretch, while holding for second. CURRY NATION was a bit slow into stride and lagged at the rear through the backstretch,
was two wide on the second turn and mounted a rally in the stretch to claim the show. STORMING WARRIOR settled in the second flight through the
second turn and lacked a final kick in the stretch. DI LAURIAN tracked the early pace, steadied on the first turn when glancing the inner rail, continued to
stalk the pace into the second turn while four wide and tired in the drive. SECOND BOLD was off slowly and was hustled to stalk the pace, was four wide on
the first turn, was five wide on the second turn and weakened in the late going. FOUR O'FIVE was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground throughout
and did not have a late rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
HALF HOPING sat off of the early pace, mounted a bid from the three path on the turn, improved position through the stretch, collared CLEVER
CHIEFTESS inside of the final sixteenth and kicked clear in the end. LIVIN' AT THE BU tracked the pace through the turn while two wide, gained ground
leaving the turn but was outfinished by the winner, while besting the rest. CLEVER CHIEFTESS was sent to set the early pace, was three wide on the turn,
had a clear lead into the lane but was caught in the final sixteenth. ZAFFERANA stalked the early pace from a three wide position and was outkicked in the
stretch run. MISTICAL SURPRISE settled near the rear of the field while two wide and made a mild late gain in the stretch run. ACCORDING TO JUDY
chased the early fractions, was green and erratic through the turn, lugging out to six wide on the bend, and lacked a late response. TENDERONI tracked the
pace from the inside and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
LAGATHA stalked the pace through the turn, mounted a bid nearing the top of the lane while three wide, put away the pacesetter inside of the furlong
marker, had a clear lead in the late stages but felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up and held to prevail. ON PURPOSE settled off of the pace while
three wide, gained ground off of the turn and was closing fast in the stretch, put late pressure on the winner but could not reel her in and bested the rest.
RED HOT LASS tracked the early pace from a four wide position, gained ground off of the turn but was outkicked in the late stages, while holding for the
show. PHANTOM INDIAN settled in the midflight while saving ground and closed willingly in the stretch run, just missing for third. BIG CHICK was away
slowly and had no early speed, was four wide on the turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch drive. BLACK DROP was away well and set the fractions
through the turn, was collared by the winner nearing the furlong marker and tired in the late going. SHOUT IT OUT chased the early pace, was two wide
between foes on the turn, lost ground leaving the turn and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
DESCARTES attended to the pace by RIVER ROSE through the second turn, made a two wide bid leaving the second turn to confront that foe and kicked
clear in the end to prevail. TRUTH SEEKER settled in the second flight through the second turn, was two wide between horses on that turn, closed well in
the stretch and claimed the place. OF GOOD REPORT was unhurried through the second turn, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch and finished willingly
to get the nod for the show. CLAIM OF PASSION stalked the pace from a ground saving position, gained ground off of the second turn but was outkicked in
the late stages. RIVER ROSE was away in good order and set the pace through the second turn while being prompted by the winner, felt pressure leaving
the second turn, was caught nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the drive. LYMEBYRD settled near the rear of the field, saved ground
through the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch run. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY stalked the pace from midpack, was four wide on the second
turn and did not mount a late rally. EXPLOSIVE was forwardly placed through the second turn and weakened in the stretch run.
