Footnotes
VA VA VOOM was sent up inside to briefly duel then gained slim advantage, set pressured pace from the inside into the stretch, edged away nearing
mid-stretch then padded that margin late. MENDHAM MILL stalked from outside rival, tipped three wide past quarter marker, continued well off the rail in the
lane, battled willingly and got up in final jumps from between foes to gain the place. VIGILANTIA chased from along the fence into and on the turn, came out
slightly exiting the bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, battled widest of all late in the drive and narrowly missed second from outside runner-up.
AVENTAPP broke very alertly then forced the pace from outside the winner, remained on two wide path to the stretch, could not match VA VA VOOM later
in the drive then lost placing in the final yards. MAP TO MY HEART briefly between foes then tracked pace from the inside, remained on the rail around the
bend and lacked needed late punch from the inside. SMITTEN BY KITTEN angled over in the early going, checked off heels leaving the backstretch, found
the rail then came back out some and did not threaten. LADY MACARENA traveled two then three wide into the stretch, came out further in upper stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
VELVET SLIPPERS pressed the pacesetter into the through the backstretch, bid between rivals on the final turn, hooked up in prolonged battle between
rivals in the lane and gamely prevailed. GINJA stepped to the front and set pace under pressure from along the rail, resisted when challenged on the second
bend, fought back through stiff drive and was denied. TROUVILLE prompted the early pace from the outside, remained three wide to far turn, engaged rivals
three deep midway on the second bend, continued on same path through the stretch and only gave ground grudgingly late. CALIFORNIA KOOK two wide
then between rivals into and through the backstretch, remained on same path to the stretch and lacked needed late punch. VAROMA caught four wide into
initial turn, traveled widest on the backstretch, was three deep past three-eighths marker and weakened in the final eighth. SWEET PEARL was pulling a bit
around the clubhouse turn, chased from along the fence, shifted out passing quarter marker and gave way steadily in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZLIGHTNING grabbed early command while crossing over, set pace from the inside, remained on two path into the lane, asked from more and stretched
margin then just lasted under urging. BRIGHT LEAF settled inside, dropped back early on the turn, remained along the fence, roused entering the lane,
rallied willingly from the inside, whittled gap on leader late and just ran out of ground. CLAMPETT bobbled slightly leaving the gate, in tight passing half-mile
marker from between foes, brushed with rival then shuffled back, re-rallied three then four wide into the lane and was getting to inside leader late and
narrowly missed while three deep on the wire. MR. T'S THIRSTY stalked from along the rail, hugged the fence around the turn, came out slightly in upper
stretch and weakened. PRINCE HUSSAR was bit squeezed in opening strides, chased from off the rail, drifted four then five wide into the lane and lacked
needed response. IM STILL THIRSTY close up while three or four wide early, brushed with inside rival past half-mile marker, under asking around the bend
and weakened. HAY JUAN was four deep and prominently placed early, continued outside and close up into the bend, stalked four wide to the stretch and
also weakened.

sixteenth marker and edged away. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) forced then stalked from outside pacesetter, moved up leaving the turn, reached front past
eighth marker, was quickly overtaken by winner but safely held the place. PSYCHO DAR showed good speed from along the rail, padded cushion on the
turn, continued just off the rail, was collared past mid-stretch but lasted for the show. FIRST PREZ gradually angled over early, secured the rail on the turn,
remained inside into the stretch, later came out some and closed some late on third place finisher. FLY THE SKY was antsy in the gate, tossed his head
and hopped at the break to be off well behind the field. saved ground into the stretch, came out some and finished willingly. BEDROCK settled off the pace
and well off the rail, traveled four then three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. POLAR briefly dueled three deep then was taken off the pace, was
three wide on the turn, came out further into the lane and weakened.

MOVE OVER (GB) tracked leaders from the inside, shifted out three then four wide leaving the last turn, rallied strongly from off the rail, surged to the front
past mid-stretch and edged away to prove best under well-timed trip. FRENCH GETAWAY tracked pace from the inside to the second turn, angled three
wide leaving that bend, rallied strongly from off the rail in the drive and out finished outside foes for second. STIRLING DRIVE settled well off the pace,
chased two or three wide, shifted five wide entering the stretch, rallied strongly from the far outside and was up late for third. SEEKING REFUGE unhurried
while steered toward the inside, chased outside foe to second bend, came out four wide leaving that turn and finished very willingly from between rivals.
BLAMELESS stalked while outside rival around both turns, tipped out three wide into the lane, loomed through the drive then was outfinished by outside
rivals in the final yards. FLY TO MARS got shuffled back soon after the start, tracked pace from along the rail, saved ground well into the second turn, also
came out some into the stretch then weakened. ABSOLUTE UNIT tossed head at the start, was steered to the rail early, chased inside, continued along rail
into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out but did not threaten. VIA EGNATIA set pressured pace while outside rival on both turns, inched
away leaving second turn, then was overtaken and weakened from the inside. DR. TROUTMAN forced or dueled from along the fence, continued contesting
the issue to the second turn, dropped back some leaving that turn and gave way steadily.

Footnotes
KRISTI'S TIGER content to lag back while bit off the rail, made steady progress three wide on the turn, angled five wide into the stretch, quickly reeled in
leader while having reins shaken, reached front past eighth marker and drew off under mild hand urging. SATURDAY HEIST was sent up along the rail,
forced the pace then gained slim lead, inched away later on the turn, had no resistance for winner past mid stretch but comfortably bested others. BIG
SUMMER stalked leaders from off the rail, moved up three then four wide into the stretch, loomed in upper stretch, failed to sustain effort but comfortably
held third. DELTA WIND brushed with inside foe at the start, stalked while off the rail then three wide, came in then dropped back around the turn and
weakened inside. LILA AT THE BEACH angled over nearing the turn, chased two wide around the bend, came back out some in upper stretch and did not
challenge. CASSIE BELLE hopped slightly leaving the gate, chased three or four wide, drifted out further in upper stretch and lacked any rally.
SEPTEMBER SECRET three deep early, chased from off the rail around the turn, was inside the winner entering the stretch and weakened. RAIN DIVA
brushed with outside rival at the start, showed good early foot, contested the pace outside rival, dropped back in upper stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
PRECIOUS INSIGHT saved ground stalking the pace, came out some on the second turn, bid between rivals, gained lead an eighth out then edged away
under urging. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE angled over early, tracked the leaders three wide, advanced on the final turn, challenged three deep in upper stretch,
could not match the winner in the drive but lasted for the place. LOVERS ODYSSEY off slow in the beginning, reserved from the inside, bumped with
WARREN'S QUEEN BEE late on the final turn, continued inside, rallied strongly, came out nearing wire and rushed up in final strides for third. BONNIE
BRAE off a bit slow, between rivals early then chased two or three wide to the second turn, angled out five wide leaving that bend and produced a mild late
rally. ROUBAIX flashed early foot while crossing over to assume command, dictated the pace into and around the second turn, relinquished the lead nearing
eighth marker then weakened some in the late stages. CANDY ON TOP found the rail early, stalked from the inside into the stretch, angle three wide in
upper stretch and was no late threat. INFINITE LOVE unhurried while steered to the inside, chased along the rail or two wide, came out bit on the second
turn, was blocked behind rivals in upper stretch, shifted out later but did not menace. HEAVEN'S GHOST checked off heels of LA DEUXIEME ETOILE
shortly after the break and checked again off heels of same rivals into the first turn, chased three wide, was trying to drifted out entering the stretch and
lacked any late response. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE between rivals early then chased two wide, steadied when blocked at the quarter pole, bumped with
rival late on the bend, then weakened inside. SHE'S A BIT SASSY was off slow and rank in the beginning, rushed up while four wide around the first turn,
prompted the pace while outside leader to the second turn then also weakened. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY unhurried early, trailed while saving ground,
dropped back further on the last turn then was not persevered with in the stretch and walked off.
