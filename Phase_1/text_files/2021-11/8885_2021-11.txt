Footnotes
MISHPACHAH stalked the pace from the inside then made her move coming out of the turn and wore down the leader to prevail. SERAPE pressed the
pace early from the three path then took the lead after a quarter but was worn down in the stretch drive to prove to be best of the rest. MYLIES STAR was
rushed to contention and advanced three wide on the backstretch but was empty in the drive. VIOLET SHADOWS showed brief speed early from the two
path then vied for the lead for a quarter and faded. WHIMSICAL LADY tracked the leaders from the three path and weakened. CRAFTY PRINCESS was
unhurried early going six wide into the first turn then made a bid on the final turn but didn't have enough late. MALIBU ROSE was forwardly placed going
four wide in the the first turn and retreated. MY SWEET SOPHIA hopped at the start then was allowed to settle on the backstretch and moved to slip through
on the rail in the final turn but faltered. TOOSIE was off a step slow and was never a factor.
