Footnotes
JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) stalked the pace while two wide on the backstretch, rallied three wide in upper stretch and powered to the front and was best in the
end. VENTURE FORTH was unhurried early then rallied four wide on the far turn, was gaining ground to be up for the place in the end. OLD SOT was
settled while inside on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn then was blocked behind rivals in mid stretch, angled out in late stretch but was too late.
HALF OURS TO KEEP dueled for the lead while two wide, was in a long drive but weakened in late stretch. CHAMPS SUCCESS dueled for the lead while
inside, was in a long drive then gave way in the stretch. LIFE ON THE ROAD was unhurried early and failed to menace. DEANOS CAPE stalked the pace
while three wide on the backstretch, made a bid on the far turn but faltered in the stretch drive. THAT'S WHAT I SAY raced three wide on the backstretch,
was used up then gave way. PA MA'S AMOS trailed throughout.
