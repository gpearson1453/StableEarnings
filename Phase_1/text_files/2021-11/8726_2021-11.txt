Footnotes
DICEY MO CHARA (GB) went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace outside a rival up the backstretch, tipped out and came four wide into
the lane, bid four deep in upper stretch, dueled with APPRECIATED in the furlong grounds and dug in late to prevail. APPRECIATED brushed with rival at
the start, ceded the lead early first time through the stretch, stalked two wide then took aim three wide into the lane, bid three deep between foes in upper
stretch and took a short lead, dueled with DICEY MO CHARA in the final furlong and got outkicked. ONE FAST BRO went two wide around the clubhouse
turn, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, angled five wide and put in a bid five deep in upper stretch but finished evenly late. OFFLEE NAUGHTY
unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, steered four wide around the far turn, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. RED HORNET
brushed with rival at the start, stalked the pace from inside, put in a mild bid along the rail in upper stretch but proved no match in the final furlong. KAZAN
(IRE) got shuffled back in the chute, trailed early then raced two wide near the back, exited the final turn three wide and failed to threaten. JACK SPROUT
traveled four then three wide around the first turn, dropped back off the pace, went three then two wide around the second bend and lacked further
response. SPIRIT MAKER tossed his head and came away slow, continued to be rank in the early stages, angled to the inside, saved ground then moved
out in the lane and was not a factor. VIA EGNATIA sped clear and moved to the inside, set all the pace to the lane but folded in upper stretch.

LONE ROCK angled outside leader to race four wide on the first turn, stalked the pacesetter from off the rail, bid four wide leaving the far turn and
challenged into the stretch, took over and kicked clear in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. TIZAMAGICIAN broke well and cleared around the
first turn while four then three wide, moved into the two path setting the pace, remained unchallenged to the quarter pole, challenged into the lane, lost
command in upper stretch and stayed on well to hold the place. CUPID'S CLAWS hit the gate at the start, went three wide around the first turn then moved
to the two path, angled to the rail on the final bend and was driven inside into the lane, could not threaten the top pair in the final furlong, moved out with a
sixteenth remaining and finished a clear third. HAPI HAPI reserved early and steered from the four path down to the two path around the first turn, moved
out a bit on the backstretch and went three wide into the final turn, angled in around the bend and traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, tired then eased
by the rider in the lane and walked off. LOCALLY OWNED tucked inside on the first turn, stalked just off the pacesetter near the rail, dropped back into the
third turn, had nothing left for the stretch run, was eased to the wire and walked off.

GOING GLOBAL (IRE) tracked in range in the two path, between foes into the far turn, remained two wide to the lane, moved out in upper stretch, collared
the runner-up with a sixteenth to go and surged clear. ZOFELLE (IRE) stalked along the rail, tipped two wide leaving the far turn, bid outside in upper
stretch, took a short lead past the eighth pole but proved no match for GOING GLOBAL in the final sixteenth. PRINCESS GRACE sped to the front from
inside, showed the way with company alongside, put away that rival around the far turn, met another challenge in upper stretch, clung to a narrow
advantage with at the eight pole, relinquished the lead soon after and churned on through the final sixteenth on the inside. ABSCOND broke well then
dropped back off the pace, steered to the inside, saved ground then moved out in the stretch and produced a mild rally. BODHICITTA (GB) bumped inside
rival leaving the gate, moved to the inside near the back, shifted to the two path into the lane and never made an impact. CONSTANTIA came away slow
from outside, trailed early in the two path, went outside a rival on the backstretch, exited the second bend three wide and failed to menace. IPPODAMIA'S
GIRL got bumped leaving the gate, stalked three wide then tipped four wide leaving the far turn and weakened. GLESGA GAL (IRE) raced up close flanking

CE CE tracked the leading duo four wide into the turn, eased out around the bend and loomed five wide into the stretch, bumped with BELLA SOFIA in
upper stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and drew away late. EDGEWAY stalked the top pair to the turn, bid inside around the bend and vied for the
lead two wide into the stretch, fought through upper stretch, could not kick on the winner in the furlong grounds but stayed on to best the rest. GAMINE set
the pace under pressure from BELLA SOFIA, vied between rivals and carried a short lead through the turn, lost command in upper stretch and got
outfinished for the place honors. BELLA SOFIA pressed the pace from outside early, vied three deep then four wide on the turn, got bumped between rivals
in upper stretch and weakened. PROUD EMMA came away slow and lagged behind early, saved ground to the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PAL sprinted clear to set a cracking pace, was shaken up leaving the turn, dug in and kicked on in resolute fashion. LIEUTENANT DAN
shadowed GOLDEN PAT to his outside, fought on in dogged pursuit but was unable to best the determined winner. CHARMAINE'S MIA settled between
rivals, commenced her bid leaving the turn, tipped out inside the three-sixteenths pole, quickened once uncovered and was making up ground. EMARAATY
ANA (GB) was forwardly placed along the inside, got through entering the stretch, toiled on but failed to make headway. A CASE OF YOU (IRE) was
allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, split rivals entering the stretch, altered course to the inside and was gaining. GEAR JOCKEY contended
between foes, came four wide to make a mild bid but lacked the needed late response. KIMARI was unhurried, shifted out leaving the turn and improved
position. GLASS SLIPPERS (GB) broke a step slow, moved up along the inside, but came up empty leaving the turn and faded. EXTRAVAGANT KID
settled off of the inside and failed to respond. CHAOS THEORY settled on the outside and was never a factor. FAST BOAT was unhurried into stride, came
five wide but lacked a response when called upon. CARAVEL was close up four wide through the turn and dropped out. RACE TIMES UPDATED AFTER
DATA REVIEW.

Footnotes
LIFE IS GOOD sped clear into the first turn, showed the way in the two path to the far turn, took some minor pressure past the five-sixteenths but turned
away the bid from GINOBILI and kicked clear into the stretch, drew off under right-handed urging and coasted in late. GINOBILI tracked three wide early
then moved further off the rail on the backstretch, put in a mild bid from outside past the five-sixteenths pole but could not sustain the momentum into the
stretch, chased the winner through the final furlong and held the place. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE tossed his head at the start and came away slow, went
four wide through the first turn, asked with three-eighths remaining, came four wide into the lane and was along for the show. EIGHT RINGS bumped
leaving the gate, stalked the pace off the rail, chased two wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. SILVER STATE stumbled in the beginning,
unhurried in the early going, moved to the two path in the middle stages, angled four wide on the far turn and never threatened. SNAPPER SINCLAIR
turned his head, bobbled and bumped rival at the start, angled to the two path, raced outside a rival then moved inside, steered three wide on the far turn
and made no impact. PINGXIANG hustled early then steadied off heels, pulled around the first turn, raced in ranged off the rail, dropped back on the far turn
and tired. JASPER PRINCE stalked the pace from inside, dropped back on the second bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
LOVES ONLY YOU (JPN) was prominently placed between rivals from the outset, tracked in hand thereafter, was patient in traffic into the lane, found a
seam inside the sixteenth pole, split horses and was up with a late surge. MY SISTER NAT (FR) was unhurried into stride, responded when roused with
three furlongs to run, made a sweeping move six wide, loomed large entering the stretch, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. WAR LIKE
GODDESS was unhurried, commenced her bid into the final turn, reeled in the leaders entering the stretch, poked her head in front inside the
three-sixteenths pole, fought on but grudgingly gave in. LOVE (IRE) was allowed to settle, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, came to level terms
entering the stretch, but weakened slightly during the drive. AUDARYA (FR) tucked in at once to save ground, moved into striking distance, was blocked
and steadied near the quarter pole, altered course to the outside and continued on fairly well. OCEAN ROAD (IRE) broke slow, was unhurried into stride,
settled saving ground, wheeled out into the stretch and improved position. ROUGIR (FR) checked between early, settled between foes, came five wide but
lacked a response when called upon. POCKET SQUARE (GB) vied between horses into the stretch the first time, settled off of the pace and shifted out
three wide, moved up to engage the leaders on the final turn, but came up empty in the drive and faded. ACANELLA (GB) contended along the inside,
shifted out leaving the final turn and faltered between runners. DOGTAG contested the pace outside to the stretch and succumbed. GOING TO VEGAS was
away alertly, set the pressured pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the stretch and dropped out. QUEEN SUPREME (IRE) checked early, was
allowed to settled, stopped into the final turn and was distanced through the lane.

Footnotes
SPACE BLUES (IRE) attended the pace along the inside, shifted out to commence his attack entering the stretch, wore down SMOOTH LAKE STRAIT and
was inching away. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT opened clear to dictate terms, fought on gamely through a prolonged drive but was unable to resist the winner.
IVAR (BRZ) settled off of the inside, advanced between horses through the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, quickened once clear and was
making up ground. RAGING BULL (FR) was jostled early, contended saving ground, got through and churned on fairly well. GOT STORMY tracked three
wide, came four wide to make his bid, but flattened in the final furlong. PEARLS GALORE (FR) was hustled along in mid pack, came four wide into the
stretch, bumped with CASA CREED in the drive and continued on willingly. IN LOVE (BRZ) was bumped early, tucked in to save ground, angled out but
found his best stride late. CASA CREED settled in hand three deep, split horses entering the stretch, bumped with PEARLS GALORE (FR) and BLOWOUT
(GB) inside the furlong maker but failed to make headway. REAL APPEAL (GER) was unhurried, settled towards the inside, angled out and made a belated
improvement. MOTHER EARTH (IRE) passed some tiring ones. BLOWOUT (GB) was close up three wide, weakened entering the stretch, was crowded
and bumped inside the furlong marker, steadied and retreated. VIN DE GARDE (JPN) was shuffled back at the start and never recovered. MO FORZA was
roughed between foes early and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
MARCHE LORRAINE (JPN) settled in the two path or outside rival, went three deep into the far turn, bid five wide between then cleared into the stretch, led
through the lane and just held over the runner-up. DUNBAR ROAD reserved in the early going, lacked room and got shuffled into the far turn, steered out
around the bend, bumped with rival in upper stretch then again at the eighth pole, closed gamely inside the winner and missed. MALATHAAT unhurried and
moved inside, took closer order up the backstretch, angled out and put to a drive on the far turn, bumped in upper stretch then again at the eighth pole,
finished willingly and held the show. CLAIRIERE lagged behind early, trailed to the far turn, ranged up wide on the second bend, got floated seven wide into
the stretch, rallied and missed the show. ROYAL FLAG raced near the back early on, moved out in the middle stages, made a swift move six wide on the
final turn, drifted into the stretch and got outkicked in the furlong grounds. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL off alertly and traveled three deep early, chased the
leader four wide around the clubhouse turn, bid four deep into the second bend, led briefly past the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished command around the
bend and weakened in the stretch run. BLUE STRIPE (ARG) got shuffled shortly after the start, angled to the inside, steered off the rail backstretch, moved
closer outside a rival, went three wide into the far turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AS TIME GOES BY chased in the two path then
moved inside, saved ground to the stretch and faded. HOROLOGIST angled in and tracked from inside, moved off the rail in the middle stages, got shuffled
and steadied at the three-eighths pole, exited the turn two wide and could not rally. LETRUSKA raced between early then chased three wide around the
turn, applied pressure on the backstretch, took a short lead past the three-eighths pole, lost command with five-sixteenth remaining and faded out of
contention. PRIVATE MISSION sped clear from inside, showed the way with company alongside on the backstretch, lost the lead past the three-eighths
pole, dropped back around the turn, angled four wide and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
YIBIR (GB) was caught in tight early, settled under a snug hold toward the tail of the field, was reserved off of the inside to the final turn, unleashed his bid
nearing the five-sixteenths marker, circled swiftly through the final turn, came seven wide and was full bore once straightened for the drive, caught
BROOME (IRE) inside the sixteenth pole and was going away. BROOME (IRE) settled four wide, ranged up to engage the leaders leaving the final turn,
shook clear into the stretch, kept on well but was unable to resist. TEONA (IRE) settled between horses, took closer order leaving the final turn, shifted out
entering the stretch and kept on well. JAPAN (GB) was in hand within striking distance, moved up in traffic, bobbled off heels leaving the final turn, was
quickly back into stride and finished willingly. CHANNEL MAKER was forwardly placed off of the inside, forged a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, but
weakened during the drive and gave way. BOLSHOI BALLET (IRE) stalked the pace, moved up four wide to make his bid, but faltered between rivals
entering the stretch and faded. SISFAHAN (FR) settled between runners, came four wide and finished with a mild improvement. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE)
settled saving ground, was put in tight into the final turn and lost position, shifted out and passed some tiring ones late. WALTON STREET (GB) was hustled
along in mid pack three wide to the final turn and tired. GUFO was allowed to settle, wheeled out into the lane but failed to make an impact. TARNAWA
(IRE) was unhurried between rivals, creeped closer some on the backstretch, circled into the stretch five wide, but lacked a response when called upon.
ASTRONAUT was close up along the inside, checked hard leaving the five-sixteenths pole and dropped out. TRIBHUVAN (FR) sent clear to set the pace,
was collared on the second turn and gave way readily once headed. ACCLIMATE chased three wide to the final turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
KNICKS GO brushed with rival at the start then sprinted clear, showed the way in the two path into the second bend, eased out to the four path leaving the
turn, drew away under hand urging and was ridden out to the wire. MEDINA SPIRIT rated early outside rivals, navigated the first turn three to four wide,
chased outside a pair of rivals on the far turn and driven four wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner in the final
furlong but finished willingly to best the rest. ESSENTIAL QUALITY was off a bit slow and brushed at the start, raced inside through the turns, steered out in
upper stretch and churned on to gain third. HOT ROD CHARLIE tracked the pace off the rail then moved inside, given his cue with a quarter mile to run,
urged right-handed in the lane but flattened late. STILLETO BOY chased between early then angled inside a rival near the finished line for the first time,
went three wide around the clubhouse turn, entered the far turn two wide, angled five wide leaving the bend and failed to rally. ART COLLECTOR was
forwardly placed through the early stages, remained closest in pursuit while between rivals into the far turn, driven two wide into the stretch and faded out of
contention. TRIPOLI unhurried in the early stages on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and never got involved. MAX PLAYER came away a bit slow
from outside, chased four wide through the clubhouse turn, traveled widest up the backstretch, navigated the second turn four wide and came up empty in
the stretch run.
