Footnotes
BETCHA dueled for the lead inside of SKYVALUE, then inside of MISS PINKERTON as well around the turn, disposed the first before meeting the latter's
bid entering the lane, but swiftly repelled that rival passing the quarter pole, and drew off under driving pressure. MISS PINKERTON pressed the pace three
wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but was repelled by the leader entering the lane, and was second best. MY DARK SECRET tracked two wide, tipped
four wide entering the lane, claimed show in upper stretch, but failed to progress thereafter and was best of the rest. WHISKEY SIS lied off of the pace three
wide early on after a bit of a flat-footed start, and never got involved. RADIANTRITHYM stalked along the inside, and faded turning for home. BOW MAKER
was outrun. SKYVALUE dueled for the lead two wide, vied between horses into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped.

Footnotes
ESKENFORIT set the pace, vied inside of PIT BOSS around the far turn, got headed by that foe entering the lane, shifted outwards to engage that rival,
regained a narrow advantage approaching midstretch, then shook clear passing the furlong grounds, and held under driving pressure. PIT BOSS prompted
the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, led entering the lane, but was re-headed by his inner game counterpart approaching midstretch, failed to match
strides passing the furlong pole, then held place. SOMETHING NATURAL vied early on, but was wrangled back off of the pace into the first turn, pulled in
the bit while shifting two to three wide in midpack around that bend, advanced to a pressing position into the backstretch, then chased the leading pair
around the far turn, kept on between horses through the lane to attempt a bid inside of PIT BOSS for place in the late stages, but did not have enough to
reach that rival. THE STIFF settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide under a drive around the far turn, grinded away outside of the leaders
entering the lane, but leveled off in midstretch and finished up evenly. TEZ broke in a tangle, then trailed around both turns, and failed to make an impact.
MISSISSIPPI stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase through upper stretch, and failed to produce a bid. NOBRAG JUSTFACT was slow into
stride after a slight bobble at the start, lied off of the pace while being floated from the three path to the four path around the first turn, then was done early.

Footnotes
MY MY MUNNY chased three wide, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid outside of LUCKY US in upper stretch, and drew clear
passing the furlong pole. LUCKY US dueled for the lead along the inside of BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB, shook free of that foe at the quarter pole as MY MY
MUMMY menaced, but proved no match for that foe at the furlong pole, gave way, but lasted for place. MIDWAY'S ANGEL broke outwardly costing her
chance of gaining early forward position, lied off of the pace four wide around the turn, and stayed on through the final furlong, but missed reaching place.
FINE PROSPECTURE hopped slightly and was off a beat slowly at the start, stalked along the inside, then chased through the lane without making a bid.
SPY A STAR trailed along the inside, and never got involved. BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB dueled for the lead outside of LUCKY US, but weakened entering
the lane.

Footnotes
RYE HUMOR was off a tad slow before shying from an outer foe and brushing an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace three wide, gained four wide
into the far turn, tucked three wide around that bend, rallied alongside of a clear RESTORING HOPE at the furlong pole, and forged an advantage under a
long drive in the final sixteenth. RESTORING HOPE set the pace, met a pair of bids around the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch, dug in as RYE
HUMOR persistently gave chase, but was bested by that foe in the final strides. SEE THE PYRAMIDS broke a bit inwards after outbreaking an inner rival,
took back around the first turn to stalk the pace setters from the two path, was driven to move between those foes to press the inner leader into the far turn,
but subtly failed to keep pace with that rival and an outer bidding foe in upper stretch, then chased them home well, then had to alter course after running up
on their heels in the final sixteenth. HAPPY CAMPER tracked two wide, put REVENIO into tight quarters while clearing to the rail approaching the
backstretch, saved ground before swinging four wide in upper stretch, but failed to make progress through the lane. IMTHEPRINCE lagged well behind the
field, swung six wide in upper stretch, and passed tiring inner foes. REVENIO tossed his head in the air at the start, tracked along the inside, but was put to
tight quarters by an outer HAPPY CAMPER approaching the six and a half furlong pole, then saved ground thereafter, but to no avail. UPHAM took minor
brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, lied far off of the pace, gained mildly three to four wide around the far turn, but flattened out through the lane.
GRAND DESIGN pressed the pace setter while decidedly staying a path or two away from that rival, then wilted into the far turn. THE RIDER OF REVENIO
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF HAPPY CAMPER FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FIRST TURN, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS

Footnotes
DATTTSAFANCYFOX stalked two wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch, drew off approaching the furlong pole, drifted outwards in the final sixteenth as
HOLDING COURT menaced, but safely kept his stable mate at bay. HOLDING COURT broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, trailed along the
inside, picked up stride turning for home before swinging four wide in upper stretch, rallied well to claim place a sixteenth out while taking aim on his clear
stable mate, but was denied reaching that rival. ARISTOCAT broke inwardly, stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair through upper stretch, tipped
outside of them while inside other rivals at the furlong pole, got outkicked for place a sixteenth from home, then kept on to secure show. PRACTICE SQUAD
tracked the pace three wide around the turn, but only managed to chase evenly through the lane. MAXIMUM IMPACT was void of early speed, took the turn
in the four path while well off of the pace, and never got involved. BAR ON THE BEACH cleared off early on, but was headed by the eventual winner at the
three sixteenths pole, and weakened. IKE AND JACK was bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied off of the pace in the three path, but came under a drive
at the three furlong pole, and failed to respond.

BARBER ROAD pressed the pace setter from the outside, assumed command entering the lane, readily drew off when roused approaching midstretch, and
won with more to give. JESUIT received a solid bump from an inner for at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped three wide in upper stretch, but took a
bump from an inner rival while bidding for place at the furlong grounds, dueled outside of his hindering counterpart for that position, and prevailed.
BARSTOW broke outwardly squarely bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed the field in the two path, split foes to bid for place at the furlong pole, but
bumped an outer rival in the process, dueled with that foe thereafter, but was outfinished. VIDAL set the pace, vied inside of the eventual winner around the
turn, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and weakened thereafter. COUSIN GREG stalked three wide, came under a drive into the turn, but
failed to respond and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DEFEATER hopped irrelevantly at the start, tracked the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home while ranging up to the leading trio, swept past
those foes at the three sixteenths pole, crossed over while clearing, and drew off readily. HUNT THE FRONT lagged well behind the field down the
backstretch, picked up stride turning for home while shifting four wide, then produced a late kick to surpass a trio of foes late to reach place a few strides
from the wire. SOARING BIRD was bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer
foe in upper stretch, kept on, but lost place to an outer rallying rival in the final stages. MYOPIC shied from an inner foe in to an outer rival at the start,
pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by outer foes in upper stretch, and faded through the final furlong.
MALIBU STAR broke outwardly, set the pace, met a trio of bids entering the lane, proved no match for them in upper stretch, and weakened. WING
COMMANDER tracked along the inside, but was done turning for home. THE TRAINER OF SOARING BIRD LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
DEFEATER FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SENSE YOU LEFT stalked along the inside, easily maneuvered inside of the pace setter around the far turn as that foe intently left the rail vacated, forged
an advantage approaching the quarter pole, then maintained that advantage from an outer game counterpart to the wire. FRONT STREET set the pace
while well in hand, stayed in the two path while not encountering pressure, allowed SENSE YOU LEFT to produce an inside bid for the lead turning for
home, got headed by that foe while still in hand and shifting to the three path entering the lane, then was set down in upper stretch to attempt a re-bid,
fought on well through the final furlong, but failed to regain even terms. HIGH FASHION settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path in
upper stretch, and was steadily gaining on the embattled dueling pair through the late stages. SHIP IT stalked two wide, but faded around the far turn.
FAMILY TIME tracked two to three wide, but failed to factor. FIST FULL OF DICE was pulled up around the first turn, was dismounted and untacked
approaching the backstretch, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
COUNTY FINAL vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses turning for home, inched clear of those rivals in upper stretch, and held firmly from a
pair of bidding foes on either side through the final furlong. MOMOS pressed the pace three wide and between horses, but allowed those foes to go on into
the turn, stalked while tucking to the two path turning for home, advanced between horses in upper stretch while aiming for a bid inside of the leader in the
final furlong, then chased that foe home well, and claimed place via a photo finish. BOB'S EDGE trailed, gained three wide and between horses around the
bend, tipped four wide entering the lane to bid outside of the leading trio, but subtly drifted further outwards in upper stretch, grinded away at a clear
COUNTY FINAL's advantage, but failed reaching that rival while missing place to an inner foe. FIRE SWORD prompted the pace four wide, tucked three
wide at the three furlong pole before vying outside of a pair of rivals turning for home, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe and an outer bidding rival in
upper stretch, and chased thereafter. JOE FRAZIER took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to
make an impact. MIGHTY MISCHIEF settled off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and failed to
factor. BOCA BOY set the pace, showed the way from a pair of vying foes around the turn, but was headed approaching the quarter pole, and gave way in
upper stretch. BRAD'S TIME chased from midpack while in the two path, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
WICKED GENIUS set the pace from a pressing HIPPODROME, but shook clear of that rival in upper stretch while under driving pressure, and was geared
down through the final sixteenth. HIPPODROME prompted WICKED GENIUS from the outside, vied around the far turn, but was repelled in upper stretch,
and proved second best. ONE MORE BABY stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with
those rivals around the far turn, and kept on late without menacing. VERSATILE saved ground far off of the pace, improved to bid for show in upper stretch,
but flattened out. MR. YASUDA tracked along the inside while under a firm hold around the first turn, but faded between horses in upper stretch. STAR
SHOPPING lied off of the pace three wide around the first turn, and never got involved. COASTAL CHAOS tracked two wide, but was done early.
CORRENTE DE OURO was off slowly, got outrun, and showed little.
