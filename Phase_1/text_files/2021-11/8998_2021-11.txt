Footnotes
MICAJAH broke through the gate pre-race, then bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked the clear leader two wide, chased through upper stretch while
drifting outwardly and fending off an outer bidding CUSTOM KAT, then rallied in the final furlong as the clear leader tired, bid inside the final sixteenth, and
prevailed. CREOLE CHARLIE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, cleared off early on despite that infraction, managed a clear margin through upper
stretch, but tired in the final furlong, and was worn down late,, but lasted for place. CUSTOM KAT was bothered by an outer foe at the start, tracked from
midpack tow wide, gained three wide turning for home while ranging up outside of MICAJAH, but got herded outwardly by that drifting foe in upper stretch
while chasing the clear leader, closed in through the late stages while chasing that foe, and ran out of ground to reach place. MIGHTY ABLE laid off of the
pace three to two wide, and failed to threaten while gaining a minor placing. GRIEF hopped inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, trailed the field by a
distance, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and passed tired rivals. WICKED ALEX tracked from midpack along the inside into the turn, but tired around
the bend. ADRENALINE stalked along the inside, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
LETS GO ALL THEWAY stalked two wide, inched forward to vie outside of BRINA with a half mile remaining, forged an advantage from that foe at the
quarter pole, then took over in upper stretch, and drew off. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES tracked the pace three wide, and stayed on through the final furlong to
reach the tiring early pace setter on the wire for place. BRINA cleared off early on, vied inside of the eventual winner at the half mile pole as that foe ranged
up, but was headed turning for home, proved no match in upper stretch, gave way, and was nailed on the wire for place. SWEET BAY stalked along the
inside, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair into the far turn, and tired thereafter. TAPPIN'TIME broke a step slowly, and got outrun.

Footnotes
WINNING QUALITY set a clear pace down the backstretch, met a pair of rivals' bids at the five sixteenths pole, was headed briefly, but gamely repelled
those rivals passing the quarter pole, shook clear again in upper stretch, but dug in inside the final furlong as LUCKY LINZ menaced, and held gamely.
LUCKY LINZ settled off of the pace two wide after breaking a beat slowly, tracked between foes around the turn before tipping four wide entering the lane,
chased on his left lead in upper stretch, but changed over at the furlong pole, loomed outside of WINNING QUALITY while grinding away at that foe's
advantage, bid in the final sixteenth, but hung. CAVE CREEK stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path at the quarter pole, but only managed to
chase the leaders, failed to keep pace with the top two in the final furlong, but kept on to claim show from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. BELMAR
BEAUTY stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane, but was turned away by her inner counterpart
in upper stretch, then tired through the final furlong. GET DIRECTIONS tracked three wide, ranged up around the turn to bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with her inner competitors passing the quarter pole, then faltered between horses in upper stretch while hanging on
her left lead. ALTERED DREAM laid at the rear along the inside, and never got involved. BLONDIE LOX BABE tracked from midpack four wide and outside
of foes, but was outkicked by an inner foe entering the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
HORNSWOGGLE settled far off of the embattled trio, gained four wide while inside of a pair of rivals into the far turn, bid for the lead between horses at the
three furlong pole, tucked two wide turning for home while besting their inner counterpart, then repelled outer foes passing the quarter pole, shook clear in
upper stretch, and drew off. CARTIER CAT stalked three wide around the first turn, vied into the backstretch as his group kicked away from the rest of the
field, led into the far turn while those trailing rivals closed in, got swarmed by that trio of foes passing the three furlong pole, lost position at the five
sixteenths, but sustained stride entering the lane, kept on through the final furlong, regained place at the sixteenth pole, and held. UNORTHODOX trailed
well behind the eventually-collapsing pace, tracked bidders three wide around the far turn, shifted outside of them entering the lane, but drifted to the eight
path in upper stretch, then stayed on well through the final furlong, but failed to reach an inner foe for place. PLEMMONSTON sat reserved two to three
wide early on, gained five wide and between horses into the far turn, bid for the lead passing the three furlong pole, forged an advantage shortly after while
tucking three wide, but was re-headed by an inner foe entering the lane, failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, and weakened through the late
stages. OGRE'S LION KING was unhurried far off of the pace, shifted outside of rivals before gaining six wide into the far turn, pressed inner foes while
shifting four wide around that bend, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, and tired. YOUKILLINMECAT set the pace early on, dueled inside of a pair of
foes after entering the backstretch, but weakened passing the three furlong pole while inside of a trio of bidding rivals. INDIAN SPRINGS stalked two wide,
bid entering the backstretch, dueled between horses thereafter, but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
K T'S JILTED GROOM chased along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, but drifted to the four path in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong
grounds, quickly drove clear at that marker, and drew off. GREY SLOAN gained five wide into the turn, inched closer while getting floated to the seven path
entering the lane, exchanged bumps with an inner chasing competitor passing the furlong grounds, and sustained his grinding charge late. R AND R STAR
broke a beat slowly and sat unhurried along the inside into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, rallied between horses in midstretch, and reached
place in the final sixteenth while not threatening the winner. CONQUISTADOR GOLD bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, was floated to the
six path entering the lane, exchanged bumps with an outer foe passing the furlong grounds while chasing, and kept on for a minor share. HOLDEN PASS
was bumped between horses at the start, pressed the pace three to two wide early on, stalked around the bend, but was floated to the five path in upper
stretch, chased to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but flattened out in the final furlong. ARGYBARGY BUCK broke outwardly, stalked two wide and
between horses, but was wrangled back when tentative between horses into the turn, then chased along the rail into midstretch before fading. TOOL BOX
was bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, cleared off early on, but noticeably tired entering the lane, was overhauled by the winner at the
furlong grounds, and weakened. YANKEE HAIL CAT broke a step slowly, and failed to factor. THISGUYCANFLY was pinched back between horses at the
start, and never got involved. PRIORITY POINTS was outrun.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL FINISH dueled for the lead inside of STREET N SOUR, shook clear passing the quarter pole, and safely held sway from a chasing RUMBLE
READY through the final furlong. RUMBLE READY stalked two to three wide and from between horses, ranged up to the dueling pair while in hand at the
five sixteenths pole, but hung on his left lead entering the lane, failed to keep pace with an inner rival passing the quarter pole, lugged inwardly in upper
stretch, committed to attempting a challenge inside of the clear leader leaving the furlong grounds, but failed to progress thereafter, and was second best.
LUNAR ROCKET stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase along the rail to claim place leaving the furlong pole. IBERVILLE was last away and
trailed the field around the turn, shifted four wide in midstretch, and moved up past tiring foes. EXCELLENCY tracked three to four wide, but failed to keep
pace with the leaders and an inner foe turning for home, then hung on his left lead while fading. BUCKY BIK COIN never got involved. STREET N SOUR
dueled for the lead two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but weakened passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
OVA CHARGED perched herself five wide while tracking outside of leaders, ranged up under her own power while shifting to the four path to bid for the lead
outside of HALF KOO KOO at the three furlong pole, vied before assuming command in upper stretch under mild urging, and widened while being ridden
out to the wire. HALF KOO KOO dueled for the lead inside of FANCY MALLORY while a path off of the rail, met OVA CHARGED's bid into the turn, vied
turning for home, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and held place through the final furlong. GALAXY THIRTYSIX broke outwardly, stalked
two wide before tucking to the rail into the turn, stalked before tipping two wide in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with the leader while chasing HALF
KOO KOO home. STEPH'SFULLASUGAR tracked the pace from the four path, but lacked a bid through the lane. NEW YEAR'S PARTY trailed three wide
around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. OURPERFECTPRINCESS was bumped by an inner foe at the start, chased while
off of the pace along the inside, saved ground around the turn, but faded through the lane. FANCY MALLORY dueled for the lead two wide from the three
path, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
PEARL EARRING was reluctant to load, perched herself three to four wide while tracking outside of foes around the first turn, stalked in the bit down the
backstretch, pressed into the far turn before bidding outside of rivals at the three furlong pole, dueled with CHOPIN DRIVE entering the lane, battled
tenaciously outside of that foe while ding-donging through the final furlong, and prevailed. CHOPIN DRIVE tracked two to three wide, pressed before bidding
for the lead three wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, sparred turning for home inside of a looming PEARL EARRING, battled tenaciously
with that foe through the final furlong, but lost the photo on the wire. PARIS KENTUCKY broke inwardly, tracked from off of the pace along the inside, tipped
five wide entering the lane to set up shop outside of the battling leaders, but drifted outwardly at the three sixteenths pole, regained stride at the furlong
grounds, closed in on the dueling pair while hanging on his left lead, but missed. GREAT ADVENTURE splayed her left front outwardly when the gates
opened and took a staggered step at the start, saved ground at the rear, shifted four wide in midstretch, and stayed on. DELIGHTFUL MOMENT stalked two
wide, pressed the pace down the backstretch, bid for the lead between horses into the far turn, vied among those rivals around that bend, but gave way to
outer foes at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. ABUELA'S HUMOR set a clear pace around the first turn, felt pressure from a trio of foes down the
backstretch, met their bids into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. AMERICAN DEPUTY bobbled at the start, chased along the inside, but was
done early and steadily faded. CHATON ROUGE was outrun.

Footnotes
JOEY'S SASSY SHANA broke outwardly and slowly, gained from far off of the pace four wide turning for home, then sustained his rally via a long drive
while hanging on his left lead, and surpassed the tiring leaders approaching the wire. SATISFY U broke in and bumped a foe at the start, stalked three wide,
chased through midstretch, grinded away to bid at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival, and prevailed for place. CUSTOM GUITAR
stalked two wide around the turn, chased the clear leader while inside of SATISFY YOU through upper stretch, closed in to bid passing the sixteenth pole,
but was outkicked, and outfinished for place. AUTUMN'S LIL DOLL dueled for the lead three to two wide, cleared passing the three furlong pole, maintained
a clear advantage into the final furlong, but met a pair of bids at the sixteenth pole, and faltered. PAT HAND GIRL broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace
two to three wide, but was outmoved turning for hoe, shifted five wide at the furlong pole, and stayed on while hanging on her left lead. LAKE RUNNER
broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then failed to factor. AMERICAN FIRST was sandwiched between horses at the start, then never got
involved. GAMBLE ON GABBY bobbled at the start, dueled for the lead inside of AUTUMN'S LIL DOLL, but failed to keep pace at the three furlong pole,
and weakened. MISS CARUSO vied inside of a pair of foes through the opening furlong, but weakened at the half mile pole, and folded up.
