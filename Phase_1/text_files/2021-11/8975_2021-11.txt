RISE UP MOSCOW raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, forged to the front with a furlong to run and drew
off with something left. EXTREMELY WICKED lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished
well to secure the place. SANDMAN'S LEGACY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SQUARE ROOT
sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened through the final furlong. LUCKY CHANCE settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled inward in mid-stretch and gradually weakened. STEPHEN JAMES chased the leaders while racing
four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
BLACKBERRY LISA broke sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the quarter, vied and held gamely to the wire.
WITHIN THE LAW disputed the pace from the inside, responded when challenged nearing the quarter, vied and gave way grudgingly to the winner.
SHESAHEATWAVE pressed the pace while racing five-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied but could not get
by the top pair late. EVERYBODY DOES IT lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished fastest of all.
SUPAH SISTA settled off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LINDA'S BALLET raced off the pacesetters early,
moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace.
GRAZEN VALOR was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

CROOKED FINGER RAY was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and was up in the
closing yards. ORCADIAN STORM sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not
resist the winner late. MEET JOE was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. L D' RADO
GOLDRUSH settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was off a step slow, raced unhurried
early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL was void of early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and was not
a factor.

the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and rallied late to gain the pace. KING LEBRON pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to gain
command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead with a quarter to run but could not hold the closers safe late. MARQUE IT UP was away in

clear. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late

TIGER DAD sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by RAAGHEB nearing the three-eighths marker, was headed by that rival into the lane,
re-bid soon after and drew clear through the final yards. RAAGHEB chased the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-eighths pole, gained a brief lead but could not match strides with the winner late. DYNAMIC RULER was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide
through the second turn and gave way in the drive. TOP OF THE GAME showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second and finished with a
steady rally. ARIZONA MOON threw his head at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed
rally. WICKED TRICK raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
PAPER BOY lacked early speed, advanced six-wide through the turn, responded when roused for the drive and was up late to be going away. PARLEY
STREET settled off the leaders early, lugged out through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run but could not hold off the winner late. DEVIL'S
TEETH pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained a brief lead and gave way. MORE HONOR was
forwardly placed from the inside, angled out into the stretch, lacked racing room and was steadied in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. GEORGIAN
ROAD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. FREIBURG was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. SOUTH FRESNO showed no early speed, saved ground through the
turn and failed to rally. CHROMIUM showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened.
