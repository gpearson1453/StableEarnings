Footnotes
HARDSCRATCH took the lead soon after the start and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and was steadily
handled through the lane. GLORY MARCH saved ground racing well off the early pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far
turn about the three path and dug in to take second the final yards. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL stalked from the two and three paths then challenged past the
half mile pole, gave close chase from that point but dropped back at the rail on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. IGNITION KEY saved early
ground, picked up the chase from the nine sixteenths pole, ran in the three and four paths of the far turn then flattened the final furlong. MOLLY BOLTS
saved ground, made only a mild bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened out at the rail on the far turn. RUN ON ENERGY settled off the early pace
just off the rail then stalked three wide into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn then weakened.
VIOLANE settled in the three path and showed little response.

the lane but was caught at the wire. SHINY PENNY chased through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dropped back
leaving the eighth pole then flattened late yards. LA LIMA gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BODIE'S STORM

rail on the turn, drew clear into the lane then drew off with steady encouragement. CASTLE LIGHTS had her heels clipped soon out of the gate and gave
chase into the backstretch, raced close two deep on the turn but dropped back into the lane and had to settle for second best. PRINCESS HALO came out
to make contact with Castle Lights and clipped her heels on the chute then picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, steadily improved off the rail on
the turn and dug in through the stretch to take third the final strides. MAY MAYS CASTLE chased through the backstretch and raced at the rail on the turn,
dug in under steady stretch handling but was nipped from third the final strides. WITNESS THE ENERGY gave chase, rounded the turn three wide then
flattened the final sixteenth. A BLONDE THING chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn four wide, drifted a bit into the lane and showed little
more. JADE SKYE was reluctant to load and dropped well back. IHEARTRAINACOMN gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. MICHEAUX

Footnotes
LIL TOUGHMAN settled back two deep and between horses on the opening turn, started a bid nearing the quarter pole and improved in the six path of the
far turn, dug in through the final furlong to take over late yards and raced clear approaching the wire. JUST GETS BETTER took a quick lead and rated the
pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady stretch handling, but was caught in
late yards. BLUE COLLAR BOY rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled close into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, ran through the far turn about the three path, drifted outward in the upper stretch then held on for third. DEPUTY JAMES settled off the pace
and off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path,
was shuffled back mid-stretch, though, came back to finish evenly. MINDYOURPSANDQS saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid approaching the
three eighths pole, angled outward toward the head of the lane and left the turn about the five path, but was forced out and steadied mid-stretch.
NORMANDY'S EMPIRE stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far
turn. CRYPTOBLUE stalked off the rail then picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and appeared a solid threat
in the upper stretch, but weakened toward the sixteenth pole. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN rounded the first turn about the five path, entered the backstretch
outside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. MINI BOLT saved ground well off the pace and showed little response.
