Footnotes
FOSTER BOI sat just off of the early pace, mounted a bid from four deep on the turn to confront the tiring pacesetter and drove clear in the late going. HE
BE MOJO RISIN settled near the rear of the field, was five then four wide on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch but was no match for the winner.
HYPERSONIC stalked the pace while saving ground and was outfinished in the stretch drive, just missing for second. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET tracked the
early pace, improved position on the turn while four wide but gave way in the stretch run. LEADVILLE settled near the rear of the field and did not have a
late rally. DARKSABER set quick fractions from a three wide position, was collared by the winner nearing the head of the lane and tired in the late going.
STONE GROOVE tracked the early pace from an inside position, checked sharply along the turn while in tight quarters and weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CANDY RUNNER was hustled to set moderate fractions from a ground saving position, was pressured in the late going by the runner-up but held to prevail
in the final strides. ELLE VICTOIRE settled toward the rear of the field while saving ground, improved position leaving the turn, drifted out nearing the
furlong marker and bumped LOVELY HUSSAR and EARLY RISER in the process and rallied in the late going to pressure the winner but could not reel her
in. GIRL CAN FLY stalked the early pace from a three wide position between horses and was outkicked the stretch drive. BANGO ISHERNAYMO settled in
the second flight, mounted a bid from the four path on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch. LOVELY HUSSAR tracked the early pace from a five wide
position, was bumped nearing the furlong marker when ELLE VICTOIRE drifted and made a mild late bid in deep stretch. CONSENTIA was away slowly
and chased from the rear, was three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. EARLY RISER (IRE) stalked the pace from the midflight,
mounted a bid while six wide on the turn, was bumped nearing the quarter-pole when ELLE VICTOIRE drifted out and finished evenly in the late stages.
LOOKING AT BO checked leaving the half-mile marker while pressing the pace in tight quarters, saved ground on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.
EVENING AMBITION tracked the early pace from a ground saving position and did not have a late rally. RUN D. L. C. was forwardly placed through the turn
while four wide and faded in the stretch run. TANGO KITTEN was reluctant to load and was away slowly, had no early speed, was eased along the turn and

Footnotes
AWESOME CURLIN settled near the rear of the field, saved ground through the second turn, gained ground near the inside leaving the second turn, vied for
the lead while splitting horses with a sixteenth to go and dug in and held to prevail in the final strides. EVEN STEVEN tracked the early pace from the inside,
chased NATIONWIDE PRIDE into the stretch and was outfinished by the winner, while holding for second. NATIONWIDE PRIDE set moderate fractions
from the inside, extended the lead leaving the second turn but was outkicked by the top pair, while holding for third. LUVTHEONEURWITH stalked the pace
through the second turn while four wide and flattened out in the stretch run. LOVE THAT KID settled in the second flight, was five wide on the second turn
and finished evenly in the stretch drive. HANDSOME HUSSAR was off slow and was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the second turn and
showed late interest in the stretch, but was not challenging the leaders. NORWESTER settled near the rear of the field and did not mount a late rally.
LAKER BARRY was forwardly placed through the run on the backstretch and weakened in the stretch run. MALIBU GHOST stalked the early pace, was
three wide between foes on the second turn and tired in the stretch drive. SMOKEY DESERT prompted the pace through the second turn while saving
ground and faded in the late going.

LAGATHA was away quickly and set a fast pace from the inside, extended the lead off of the turn and was ridden out in the stretch run. LIAM'S SECRET
chased the early pace from the inside and was no match for the winner while besting the rest. TRAFFIC STOPPER tracked the quick pace while three wide
and was outkicked in the stretch run. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was away a step slowly, chased from the rear while saving ground and passed tiring foes
in the stretch run. SMILING SPIRIT chased from the second flight and weakened in the stretch run. BLUEGRASS SKY had no speed early, was four to five
wide on the turn and was not a factor. BRASTIKA chased the pace through the turn while saving ground, was outrun leaving the turn, was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
SKY DINSKI settled just off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, steadily closed the gap on MUCHO MACHISMO off of the turn and into
the stretch and was up in time in the final strides to tag that rival on the wire to prevail. MUCHO MACHISMO was away well and set moderate fractions
while opening a long lead on the rest of the field, saved ground through the second turn, was feeling pressure in the final sixteenth and was tagged on the
wire for the win, while holding for second. EL JOY improved position along the backstretch to track the pacesetter, was four wide on the second turn, closed
well in the stretch and just missed for the win and place. EL TENAMPA settled near the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn, swung out widest
for the drive and rallied in the stretch but could not reel in the top three. SHE SHOT ME DOWN stalked the pace from a ground saving position and did not
mount a late rally. SECRET WEAPON tracked MUCHO MACHISMO through the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. ALARMING MOMENT had
no speed in the early stages, was three wide on the second turn and was not a factor. HABANERO KID stumbled at the start, was eased a few strides after
the break and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TOM'S SURPRISE sat off of the quick pace while in the second flight, was three wide on the turn, rallied leaving the turn and dug in in the final sixteenth to
prevail. HANDSOME GARY was forwardly placed through the turn while three wide, closed ground leaving the turn to vie for the lead inside of the final
sixteenth but was caught by the winner and just held for the place. TED attended to the early pace, was two wide between horses on the turn, vied for the
lead inside of the final furlong but was outkicked by the top pair and just missed for second. COUNTING CARDS stalked the pace from a ground saving
position and was outfinished in the stretch run. FLICFLAC settled near the rear of the field, was asked for run while three wide on the turn and offered a mild
late kick in the stretch run. THEYREMINISCEOVERU showed good early speed while setting quick fractions, saved ground on the turn, led into the stretch
but weakened in the late going. ROCKTILLYOUDROP settled in the midflight while four wide on the turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. OUR
BOLD PRINCE had no early speed, attempted a bid from the five path on the turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch drive. ECOLOGIST was slow
into stride leaving the gate and was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.
