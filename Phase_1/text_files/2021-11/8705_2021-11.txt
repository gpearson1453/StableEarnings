the pace, came two-wide through the turn, dueled past the leaders but was out nodded. VICTORY JET set a pressured pace, dueled two-wide on the turn,
was passed mid stretch and chased to the end. OLYMPIC FENCER forced the issue, dueled from the rail on the turn, was also passed mid stretch and
chased in vain. SOUP SPOON was off slowly, pressed the pacesetter into the turn, chased three-wide, lost ground at the top of the stretch and finished
evenly. SILVER SIGNATURE raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. LIBERTYINBLUE lost her path when slow leaving
the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MUSIC HOUR, away slowly, settled off the pace, chased
along the rail through the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
BLU SKY SUNRISE won the break but was allowed to settle along the inside chasing the leaders, angled out approaching the quarter pole and drove by the
pacesetter in upper stretch, holding a safe margin to the wire. MELROSE STAR had one rival beat while along the inside down the backside, came off the
rail on the far turn into the three path while still at the rear, dipped inside turning for home when everybody else was fanning out into outside paths and
hugged the fence down the lane to be a clear second best. CRUMLIN BIRD went to the front into the first turn and was rank in the early going, settled in
front down the backside but didn't put up much resistance when challenged by the winner in upper stretch, holding onto the show spot the best she could
do. ROYAL CITY REIGN was knocked into a rival at the start when that one broke in, settled three to two wide in midpack on the first turn, came two to five
wide on the far turn and out in the six path turning for home, mildly closing for a minor award down the lane. HOLLYWOOD RING sat along the rail in
midpack, followed the winner around the far turn and angled out turning for home but was outkicked in the stretch. MADAME BOVERY sat off the pace and
in the two path throughout, closed mildly down the lane without threatening. EL VALOR was off the pace and three wide on the first turn, began to rally while
still three wide on the far turn but fanned out in the eighth path turning for home and levelled off in the final furlong. HONEY GIRL broke out at the start and
trailed until the stretch when she passed a few stragglers in the late stages. FANCYSOUL was bumped in a chain reaction at the start, recovered to chase
inside the early pacesetter, stalked that one down the backside and bid on the far turn but retreated from the quarter pole down to the wire. DELIGHTFUL
DREAMER was four wide and off the pace on the first turn, still four wide on the far turn and fanned into the nine or ten path turning for home, done by the
eighth pole. SMART N QUICK sat in midpack and four to three wide on the first turn, dropped back midway on the far turn while three to four wide and didn't
recover. LEAVEYOUBREATHLESS bore in at the start and bumped a rival, up to stalk and press the leader three wide on the first turn, stayed out there into
the far turn but retreated down the stretch.

Footnotes
MRS. DEL bumped at the start, showed brief speed then settled in striking range, chased on the turn, took the lead in deep stretch and held under a drive.
SPEEDY LYNN had speed and moved clear, set the pace, was collared in the final 16th and gave way grudgingly. IMA BEAST had speed, was hustled from
the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch, was closing well but didn't want to go between rivals in the late stages and had no time to alter course.
STERLING SPEED settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then gained mildly, but late. MARAIS was involved in bumping
at the start, settled in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. HIT AND RUN broke inward and bumped ASHA IRONBORN,
settled in range, came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, and finished all out. ASHA IRONBORN, involving in bumping at the
outset, settled off the pace, angled from rail to three-wide on the turn then evened out late. STARLIGHT RIDGE, also partook of bumping leaving the gate,
raced in mid pack, came four and five-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
BARILKO hit the gate at the start but recovered quickly and rushed up the fence to get the lead after a sixteenth, held a clear advantage throughout and
was kept to his task in the later stages. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL settled along the inside and off the pace early, skimmed the rail into range on the turn and
kept hugging the fence through the lane, gaining second at the eighth pole and inching up on the winner late. AGNELLI had a short-lived lead early, allowed
the winner to take over to his inside and stalked that one until bidding late on the turn but was out of gas for the stretch run. MAJESTIC MELODY off the
pace early, circled rivals four wide to loom large at the quarter pole but evened out in the stretch, still game between foes for a minor award late. R U
WATCHINGBUD off the pace early, circled the field four to six wide on the turn and widest into and down the stretch, hanging late when a better placing
looked possible. KUDURO dueled for the early lead, fell back to chase the top pair, bid three wide at the quarter but stalled, losing positions in the final
seventy yards. KEEN SAMURAI leapt up at the start and was off the pace, put in a nice rally to be behind the pace chasers in upper stretch but was out of
run at the eighth pole. BEN LOMOND went to his knees at the start and the jockey remained on somehow, came from off the pace rallying outside the
eventual place finisher on the turn, but stalled in the final furlong in behind rivals. SUITEDCONNECTED stumbled at the start and had nobody beat while
three to five wide on the turn, only able to pass a tiring foe in the final sixteenth. TINKER RING chased outside early, into range three to five wide at the
quarter pole but retreated down the stretch.
