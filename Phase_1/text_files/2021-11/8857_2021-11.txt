Footnotes
DIVA'S FINALE showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, was passed by Papa Tony nearing the far turn, came on again in the
stretch while racing near the rail and just got up under all out pressure. PAPA TONY pressed the early leader while racing just off the inside, took command
into the far turn, raced between rivals in the lane and finished gamely to the wire. ALL TACKED UP stalked the early pace, moved up three wide in the lane
and had not enough in the final stages. FIND YOUR BOAZ was unhurried in the early stages, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and gained ground
in the latter stages. THE TRAIN settled off the early going, raced two to three wide and had no response. BAD SUENO raced far back and never
threatened.

COMMANDING GENERAL showed good early speed to cross over to the rail soon after the start, built a clear lead into the lane and held gamely under
steady handling. TRENDING UP was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up in the two path while racing between rivals but was no match for
the winner late. RUN FAST stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up near the rail in the drive and showed good late interest. PAY THE KID
stalked the early pace, moved up four to three wide in the stretch run and weakened in the final stages. LONG TOM was allowed to settle off the early
going, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no rally. ERIC THE SALESMAN dropped back early, raced three to four wide in the lane and
had no response. GONE ASTRAY KISS settled off the early pace, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

TRAVEL GIRL showed good early speed to set the early pace, was roused inside the eighth pole under left handed urging and raced well clear late under
steady handling. SISTER SADIE was off a step slow, chased the early leader down the backstretch and was no match in the drive. EMILIA STRONG was
squeezed back at the break, settled towards the back early on, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and showed late interest. MADAME
CHANNEL stalked the early pace along the inside and weakened. LET'S GO DANZING was slow early, raced three wide and had no response. IAMPROUD
dropped back early, was five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
NABRUZZI was unhurried early on, moved up along the inside approaching the quarter pole, raced three deep through the lane and finished well under
strong handling. TIME SENSITIVE broke to the outside, showed good early speed to set the early pace but couldn't match strides with the winner in the
drive to finish second best. SLEEPY N JOYFUL was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced three wide in the lane and had not enough in the
stretch drive. MEEMOO stalked the early pace, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. EMPRESS NEFERTITI settled
off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MISS JASSER dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was
a factor. CHANTAJE failed to respond.
