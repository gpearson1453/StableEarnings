Footnotes
GLOBAL FREEDOM (GB) was close to the pace and then took over the lead the lead on the backside for the final time, still had a slight advantage coming
out of the top turn and dueled with GLENCORRIB SKY (IRE) through the long stretch and drew clear in the late going. GLENCORRIB SKY (IRE) settled
mid-pack rallied up the hill after the last jump and on the final bend to collar the leader, dueled with that rival through the lane and gave way late.
BASSMATCHI (FR) was in contention until the head of the lane the weakened through the stretch. SEMPRE MEDICI (FR) was in strking distance until the
final turn then tired. DREWCOURT (IRE) trailed the field and passed a tired rival in the stretch. JUMP SHIP raced towards the back but still was in
contention until the backside for the final time when he started to lose ground and was no threat from there.
