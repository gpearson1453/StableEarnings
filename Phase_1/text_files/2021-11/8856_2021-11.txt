Footnotes
ONE WILD WOMAN tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid to take over leaving the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch, after one
right handed pop with the riding crop, then was ridden out to prove much the best. DAREDEVIL BULL was rated along the inside early, eased out on the
turn, made a four wide bid past the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. GREEDY ALGORITHM was allowed to
settle while three wide and had no rally while being along for the show award. IRIE EMPRESS broke outwardly at the start, then vied for the lead three wide
and weakened the final quarter of a mile. COUSIN MARIE was not a factor. SHE'S GOT GAME vied for the early lead on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
MAINE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then was headed leaving the turn, drifted out through the stretch carrying BURN AND TURN out,
then held on gamely under a drive. BURN AND TURN had a slight bobble at the start, then chased the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the
quarter pole, went on even terms leaving the turn, then was carried out in the stretch, hung late. RACK GIN was settled back early, then advanced five wide
on the turn, then continued that momentum and had a late rally for the show award. PERFECT REVENGE was reserved early, swung out four wide for the
drive and had a belated rally. TWIXY CAT chased the pace on the inside, angled out in the drive but had no kick. VISUAL ARTIST chased the pace from
between horses and weakened. MR. WALSH was allowed to settle while four wide and weakened. ONE SLICK START dropped back. JARLIAN was
allowed to settle while four wide and tired. The jockey on BURN AND TURN claimed foul against MAINE for interference in the stretch, after the stewards
reviewed the replays the disqualified MAINE and was placed second.

early pace, then was on the inside on the turn, was headed leaving the turn, stayed on gamely to the wire while no match for the winner but clearly second
best. LIL TATER was allowed to settle early while three wide, then advanced and came four wide into the drive, then finished evenly late, bested rest.

allowed to settle early on the inside, then switched out on the turn, was three wide by the quarter pole, swung out wider for the drive and had no rally.

Footnotes
MAGIC MICHAEL was reserved early, then was sent down on the turn and advanced four wide, then continued the bid and wore down the pace setter late
to prove best under a drive. ROCK ON LUKE set a pressured pace early while racing off the rail, then shook clear by the quarter pole, then was still clear by
the furlong marker, but could not hold off the winner late while clearly second best. SENIOR INVESTMENT was allowed to settle early, made a inside move
on the turn but flattened out. ZOOMER pressed the early pace three to four wide and weakened.
