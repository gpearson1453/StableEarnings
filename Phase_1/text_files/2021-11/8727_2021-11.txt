pace, raced outside around the first turn and weakened. TOOTIE lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ZIP unhurried in the early going, moved up from the outside around the turn, took command, drifted in down the lane but drew clear and proved
best. AW SHUCKS raced in the middle of the pack early, showed a late rally down the lane to narrowly prevail for the place. ICE PEAK raced in the middle
of the field, make a late bid down the lane but just missed the place. NATE'S WAY broke well and took the early lead, was challenged around the turn and
could not match strides with the top ones late. THERUNAWAYROCKET raced within contention down the backside, challenged for lead around the turn but
weakened late. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY in the back early, gained ground down the lane but was too little too late. FUELINJECTEDPRAYER was never a
serious threat. KING COOKIE raced within contention in the early going but dropped back around the turn and was done. WAYFARING STRANGER was no
factor. CROCODILE JACQUES showed little.
