KONTAR saved ground, got through along the rail under right handed urging was up in the final strides. QUIET AMIGO dueled for the early lead two wide,
shook clear before a half, set the balance of the pace in the two path and just missed hanging on. KOLE MAN CAN allowed to settle, finished with good
courage in the five path. LITTLE BITA SMOKE hopped hitting the side of the gate at the start and passed tiring rivals in the six path through the stretch.
BLUE MONARCH was no threat. DERBY INCLUDED battled for the early lead along the inside, chased the pace into the stretch then was used up. DIAL
MR PROSPECTOR was outrun. SCORZA stalked the pace for six furlongs then faltered.

Footnotes
FRIAR LAURENCE close up along the inside, shot through along the rail to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened at will in hand to win as
much the best. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD dueled for the early lead four then three wide through the turn then was no match for the winner. BALI BEACH
stalked the pace and went evenly in the six path. FLYING GUILLOTINE passed tiring rivals inside. SUPER NECESSARY was no threat. BUNDLEDLIKE
BERNIE broke slowly, rushed to lead along the rail nearing the turn, got out approaching the quarter pole then lost ground. GAISGEACH was outrun.
ABOUT TO RAGE set the pace into the turn then was used up. VIOLENT SURPRISE was no threat. MASTER was through early.
